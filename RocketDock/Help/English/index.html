<div class="indent">
<h2 id="what-is-rocketdock">1. What is RocketDock?</h2>

<div class="indent">
<p>Have you ever glanced over the shoulder of a Mac user and seen the nifty little bar of icons at the bottom of their screen? This is known as a "dock." For those of you that haven't seen this, a dock is simply a bar that can be set to the edge of your screen with a background and a row of shortcut icons. The function of a dock is to bring quick access to these shortcuts in an organized fashion relieving your desktop of clutter.  It acts much like the Quick Launch, pointing each icon to the original folder or file.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> RocketDock does not remove, replace, store, duplicate, or backup any of the items you drag into the dock.  You should never delete the original items.  Dock shortcuts are not stored as files and cannot be dragged back onto the desktop or anywhere else.</p>

<h1 id="managing-items">Managing Items</h1>

<div class="indent">
<h2 id="adding-new-items">1. Adding New Items</h2>

<div class="indent">
<p>The first thing most people want to do after installing
RocketDock is add new items. There are a few different ways of doing
this:</p>

<p>You can simply drag -n- drop a new item into RocketDock from
almost any location; your desktop, an Explorer window, the Quick Launch
Bar, and the Start Menu.</p>

<p>Another way to add items is by right clicking on RocketDock
and viewing the "Add Item" menu.</p>

<img src="images/Snap2.jpg" alt="" title="">
<p>From here you have a few options to choose from and each will
add a different type of item to RocketDock. Let's break each one down.</p>

<ul>

	<li><strong>File:</strong> You can choose any type
of file to add to RocketDock. When clicked it will open that file in
its default application.</li>

	<li><strong>Path:</strong> You can add any folder
to RocketDock. When clicked the folder will open in Explorer.</li>

	<li><strong>Blank Icon:</strong> This option
creates an item with no icon settings. When clicked it will bring up
the RocketDock "Icon Settings" window so you can manually configure its
properties. This is useful when you want to add special items that are
not files or folders. An example would be a link to a webpage.</li>

	<li><strong>Separator:</strong> Adding a separator
between icons helps you organize them into different categories, or
just add a visual break.</li>

	<li><strong>Recycle Bin:</strong> This adds a shortcut to the Recycle Bin that has both an empty and full state.</li>

	<li><strong>Dock Settings:</strong> This is a
special item. In case you removed the Dock Settings item on RocketDock,
this will add it back in.</li>

	<li><strong>Quit:</strong> This adds an icon when pressed will quit RocketDock.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="docklets">2. Docklets</h2>

<div class="indent">
<p>Docklets are like mini applications that do one task and run
inside RocketDock. They vary from system meters for RAM usage to a
Recycle Bin item that changes the icon depending on whether the system
Recycle Bin is full or empty. You can add docklets to RocketDock by
dropping them in the RocketDock Docklets folder located at:</p>

<p><em>C:\Program Files\RocketDock\Docklets</em>
(default location)</p>

<p>Afterwards right click on RocketDock and in the "Add Item"
menu there will now be additional options to add each docklet you have
in the folder.</p>

<img src="images/Snap3.jpg" alt="" title="">
<p>Note: RocketDock has support for ObjectDock docklets only.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="customizing-items">3. Customizing Items</h2>

<div class="indent">
<p>Items on the dock can be rearranged by simply dragging them around.  You can change the way each item looks on RocketDock by simply
right clicking on an item you want to change and selecting "Icon Settings."</p>

<img src="images/Snap4.jpg" alt="" title="">
<p>From here you will now see the Icon Settings window where you
can change the properties of your item.</p>

<img src="images/Snap5.jpg" alt="" title="">
<h3>Folders</h3>

<div class="indent">
<p>Here you will see a list of all the folders you currently have
in your RocketDock Icons directory located at:</p>

<p><em>C:\Program Files\RocketDock\Icons</em>
(default location)</p>

<p>You can add any icons to this folder and have them available.
The - and + buttons allow you to add and remove folder directories that do not appear in your RocketDock Icons folder.</p>

</div>

<h3>Icons</h3>

<div class="indent">
<p>This pane will show you a preview of all the icons available
in the folder you have selected in the Folders section. The drop down menu below the Icons list (usually showing "Normal Icon" grayed out) is used for different icon states.  This is most commonly used for the Recycle Bin full and empty icons.</p>

</div>

<h3>Preview</h3>

<div class="indent">
<p>You can see which icon you have selected to use for your item.</p>

</div>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<div class="indent">
<p>Here is where you change how your item title displays, where
the item links to, and other special actions are available.</p>

<ul>

	<li><strong>Name:</strong> Set the label that
appears when your mouse goes over it in RocketDock.</li>

	<li><strong>Target:</strong> Here is the location
of the item on your computer.</li>

	<li><strong>Start In:</strong> This sets the
working directory for the target application.</li>

	<li><strong>Arguments:</strong> Sets optional
parameters for the target application.</li>

	<li><strong>Run:</strong> This sets the minimize
state of the window when the item is launched from RocketDock.</li>

	<li><strong>Open Running:</strong> This drop down menu allows you to override the "Open Running Application Instance" on a per icon basis.  You get the choice of: "Use Global Setting," "Always," and "Never."

	<li><strong>Popup Menu:</strong> This will choose
between displaying special actions in the RocketDock context menu for
an item. A good example is when having an Internet Connection shortcut
present in RocketDock with the "Display Special Actions" option checked.</li>

</ul>

<img src="images/Snap6.jpg" alt="" title="">
</div>

</div>

<h2 id="removing-items">4. Removing Items</h2>

<div class="indent">
<p>You can remove items from RocketDock two different ways. The
first is simply dragging the item off RocketDock and dropping it on
your desktop. It will then simply vanish. The second is right clicking
on the item and using the "Delete Item" option.</p>

<img src="images/Snap7.jpg" alt="" title="">
<p>You can remove separators in the same fashion. Docklets can
only be removed by dragging them out of RocketDock.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> RocketDock does not store its shortcuts as files.  If you drag an item off the dock there is no way to undo.

</div>

<h2 id="drag-n-drop">5. Drag 'n Drop</h2>

<div class="indent">
<p>You can drag files and folders into the items on your dock.</p>

<p>If you drag a file/folder into an application item it will
launch and load
the file/folder if that application supports it. For example if you
drag a PNG onto a Photoshop shortcut it will launch and load that
image.</p>

<p>If you drag a file/folder into a folder item then it will be
copied into that folder. Each item will react the same way as an item
would on your desktop.</p>

<p>If you drag files/folders into an item that
points to the Recycle Bin they will be deleted.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="minimized-windows">6. Minimized Windows</h2>

<div class="indent">

<p>If you have enabled "Minimize Windows to the Dock" in General Settings, your minimized windows will show up as icons on your dock.	These window icons can be dragged around for rearranging, but cannot be deleted or closed by dragging off the dock.	In Windows Vista, they will be rendered as a real-time preview if you have Desktop Composition enabled in your Windows performance settings and the ability to use Aero Glass.</p>

<p>You can open or close a window by right-clicking on the window icon and selecting "Open Window" or "Close Window."	By default the window will be opened if you simply click on it.</p>

<img src="images/Snap14.jpg" alt="" title="">

<p>You can prevent a specific window from ever minimizing to the dock by holding <strong>Control+Alt+Shift</strong> when you minimize it for the the first time.	This will ensure that your favorite media player or chat client will minimize to the taskbar or system tray as you would expect.  This can be undone by repeating the process.  If you want to temporarily prevent a window minimizing to the dock just hold <strong>Control</strong> as you minimize the window.</p>
