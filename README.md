# imkira3Keys
Welcome to imkira3Keys, a collection of tools designed to make everyday tasks easier, including workflow, gaming and media. Learn the hotkeys associated with a button by pressing it while holding shift, a brief description will show in the corner. Skip Forward/Backward or Pause/Play or Next/Previous File in your media player without clicking on it or while it’s minimized, Daum Potplayer comes pre-configured for this and with extra codecs for ease of use. Copy/Paste/Cut/Delete/Select All/Find/Undo/Redo/Rename all get their own dedicated buttons. Control mouse sensitivity (DPI) via hotkeys, effectively changing how fast your gun reticle moves in first and third person shooters. Mark a window as On Top, or adjust Priority via the windows context menu. Access an advanced task manager with a hotkey if explorer ever crashes. Show/Hide an easily configurable mac-style dock. Toggle a hidden Desktop with your BossKey, and tranfer windows to/from your hidden desktop. For a full list of changes, see the "Changes" post that's accompanied by each update.

There are a few things worth explaining. First off, in v2 I used to use an external program called BlindBossKey to hide/show an advanced task manager program called Process Explorer. Process Explorer is owned and maintained by Microsoft. BlindBossKey is no longer necessary, as long as Process Explorer is placed in the proper directory with the proper name everything should be taken care of automatically, and you will still be able to hide/show/launch Process Explorer with the Alt+NumLock hotkey. This hotkey avoids that awkward moment when explorer.exe itself freezes, preventing you from clicking the Process Explorer icon in the taskbar which forces you to click Ctrl+Alt+Del and open task manager. Just make sure to turn on Options > Allow Only One Instance, Options > Hide When Minimized and Options > Always on Top in Process Explorer.

So I know your probably wondering how you can possibly remember all these awesome features I added, and the hotkeys that go with them right? Well, by pressing shift and the button your curious about you can open a text popup in the bottom-left corner that will show you exactly what that key can do. It shows what modifier keys can change the function too, and don't worry about the default Shift+Numpad behavior interfering either. I was able to bypass that annoying feature.

So next I'll explain the media keys. These come pre-configured with Daum Potplayer, and they are global hotkeys. Global means you won't have to click on your video player to control it, you can even minimize it. This is obviously great for audiobooks and music. You can always access the previous/next file and pause/play keys, but the rest of the media keys are only available while NumLock is on.

Changing DPI (mouse sensitivity) on the fly is a great option for gamers, especially first person shooters, but if were being honest the default slider Windows uses to change DPI is quite sloppy, and who wants to open that window and drag the slider mid-game anyway? By pressing the appropriate hotkey you can easily set your DPI to the exact value you want, and the hotkeys are easy to remember too. Programs that do this are rare, and usually involve using the scrollbar which can be inaccurate if you want a specific DPI. There is also a hotkey to restore the default DPI, which also happens automatically if you exit the program.

This version features a manipulation of a open-source project called mDesktop. This is a nifty little app that lets you shift between multiple desktops easily and send windows to other desktops. It’s quite useful for older versions of Windows that don’t have that feature, and it still works on newer versions too. My edits to the script make mDesktop the perfect bosskey, simply press Left Ctrl+NumpadEnter to switch to your hidden Desktop.

You might notice some buttons have been configured to launch hotkeys involving Ctrl+Numpad buttons 1-9. These hotkeys can be set to any program you like by registering a shortcut to it in the start menu, opening the properties window for that shortcut, and then configuring the hotkey for the shortcut in the properties window, and you can still use these hotkeys with imkira3Keys turned off using Ctrl+NumPad buttons 1-9. You will probably have better luck configuring Start Menu hotkeys when imkira3Keys is disabled.

The F13-F24 buttons are really handy. Some programs have issues with AutoHotkey, even if you run your script in administrator mode using AutoHotkey32 and AutoHotkey64 for maximum compatibility, but only while registering hotkeys. This is one reason I suggest you disable AHK when registering hotkeys, usually anyway. Single button hotkeys register much better. But wait, won't this conflict with any other shortcuts assigned to F13-F24? The answer is nope, fact is those keys aren't on most keyboards, but they can still be accessed by pressing Shift+F1 for F13, Shift+F2 for F14, etc. But, Shift+F1 would in reality result in Shift+F13, not F13, so most hotkeys will refer to Shift+F13 instead of F13, you follow? Even if you have the keys on your keyboard, for this reason they will always produce Shift with the F key. That means you can use F13 and above for whatever you want.

MenuTools is a great piece of freeware, I have had a long love for the program ever since 64-bit became more popular and I was forced to find a suitable replacement for PowerMenu. That's why I decided to make use of it within my program, imkira3Keys will automatically launch MenuTools. MenuTools is a program that will add 4 options to the context menu in the title bar of most apps, allowing you to set a window as "On Top", adjust transparency, minimize to tray or adjust the process priority.

RocketDock is a really old piece of software, and yet it continues to work perfectly on all versions of Windows, providing users with an easy to customize mac-style dock while utilizing a completely inconsequential amount of memory. It can get in the way though, which is why imkira3Keys will automatically hide the dock, you can show/hide the dock by pressing Left Ctrl+NumpadEnter. Please do not disable the “Portable INI” setting in Dock Settings, as this will delete the Settings.ini file. Moving forwards, v6 and later will look for the Settings.ini file in the RocketDock directory. If it’s not found it will assume this is a fresh install and copy the INI, effectively overwriting your Dock Settings. If you update via zip you will have to be careful not to overwrite the file manually.

PotPlayerPortable is the default video player for imkira3Keys, though the only thing tying imkira3Keys and PotPlayerPortable together is the global media hotkeys. If you would prefer to use another video player with imkira3Keys you can, simply by configuring the global hotkeys manually. I suggest you at least try PotPlayerPortable though, as the nature of the program can change greatly depending on the settings used. Considering the sheer amound of settings and support for external codecs, this is hardly surprising. The way it’s configured now, it’s optimized for television, movies, music and audiobooks. All windows and bars hide during video playback, automatically ignoring aspect ratio and stretching the video to the four corners of the sceen/window. I often use this player at a 480x320 window size tucked in the corner so I can watch anime while I work, and I love how the player will remember a list of recent files in the favourites list. Not only that, it will remember playback positions, but only in the favourites menu. If you like that feature, don’t update PotPlayer, this is the latest version that supports remembering your playback position in the favourites list while ignoring playback position everywhere else. The very next version they made it so if you want to remember playback position in your recent file history you also have to remember playback position in the playlist, and when you run the file manually too. So for example, if you watched every episode of Steins;Gate a few months ago, and your watching it again now, every episode would start in the credits, which is just ridiculous, so I suggest you don’t update PotPlayer. You don’t really need to update the base app though, as it’s a simple matter to update and install both native and external codecs without updating the base app, and I will take care of all that for you in later versions of imkira3Keys. I could talk all day about how amazing this app is and all the things it can do, so just have a look at the sheer number of options in the context and settings menus.

You might notice I didn't use shift in anything except the button descriptions, not on the input side anyway. No, I used Ctrl or Win or Alt or nothing to combo with the buttons, in case you wanted to make stickers for your buttons like I did. I made a simple system: Ctrl goes on the left side of the button, buttons that change with NumLock have their alternate function on the left side too. Win goes up above the top row buttons, Alt goes on the right, and on the bottom side of the buttons is it's default function, like so:

There I think that mostly explains how my script works. The only thing left to talk about is the installer. I made a simple SFX file that will install the program and add shortcuts, but not startup entries. This program has problems starting on startup unless configured specially to run as Administrator. You can also install via ZIP if you prefer, however this program will only operate properly if it can find the proper files in the proper directory with the proper name, so be sure and extract everything to: "C:\ProgramData\imkira3Keys". Also, there are 2 versions of the code this time, and they are both slightly different. They are meant to work together, and the tray icons are hidden since they are meant to be controlled by the master tray icon, so be sure to use the imkira3Keys.exe file to launch everything, it will launch the tray icon, both scripts and all associated software. Configuring PotPlayerPortable has an extra step too, in order to avoid overwriting any of your settings during each update, I have not included all the settings files, skins and other customizeable aspects of PotPlayerPortable in the installation directly. Instead I included 3 tools to help complete the setup. At the very least you have to run Configure Potplayer.exe at least once to install the missing settings files. Run it again at any time to easily restore default settings. Configure Associations.exe and Configure Shortcuts.exe are optional, however if you do decide to configure which programs open with PotPlayerPortable you must do so either by running Configure Associations.exe, or by associating each of the over 100 supported formats with PotPlayerPortable.exe directly. All other methods, such as configuring associations in the video player itself will point directly to PotPlayerMini64.exe or PotPlayerMini.exe, which is not the proper way to run a portable program, the result being portability is broken and your settings moved to the AppData folder. Set it up properly and you can move your settings to other computers simply by copying the PotPlayerPortable folder. Now here are the download links, have fun:
