# imkira3Keys
I have been working hard on making the best possible use of my numpad. It seemed an ideal place to make buttons for some of your most used hotkeys and programs. It hasn't been long since my last update, yet once again big progress has been made! I added descriptive text popups that describe what the buttons do, and I can control mouse sensitivity (DPI) via hotkeys, a much loved feature among gamers. Once you try it, you can never go back, the ability to change mouse sensitivity on the fly, in CoD for example, is priceless. For a full list of changes, see the "Changes" post that's accompanied by each update. Here is a list of functions:

There are a few things worth explaining. First off, in v2 I used to use an external program called BlindBossKey to hide/show an advanced task manager program called Process Explorer. Process Explorer is owned and maintained by Microsoft. BlindBossKey is no longer necessary, as long as Process Explorer is placed in the proper directory with the proper name everything should be taken care of automatically, and you will still be able to hide/show/launch Process Explorer with the Alt+NumLock hotkey. This hotkey avoids that awkward moment when explorer.exe itself freezes, preventing you from clicking the Process Explorer icon in the taskbar which forces you to click Ctrl+Alt+Del and open task manager. Just make sure to turn on Options > Allow Only One Instance, Options > Hide When Minimized and Options > Always on Top in Process Explorer.  

So I know your probably wondering how you can possibly remember all these awesome features I added, and the hotkeys that go with them right? Well, by pressing shift and the button your curious about you can open a text popup in the bottom-left corner that will show you exactly what that key can do. It shows what modifier keys can change the function too, and don't worry about the default Shift+Numpad behavior interfering either. I was able to bypass that annoying feature. I also configured the extra hotkeys too, which means you can assign any combo of numpad button+function keys as hotkeys for whatever you want. There was a bug that prevented this in v2.  

So next I'll explain the media keys. These will have to be programmed into your media player, and I recommend setting them to global hotkeys. Advanced video players like Daum Potplayer and VLC support this. Global means you won't have to click on your video player to control it, you can even minimize it. This is obviously great for audiobooks and music. You can always access the previous/next file and pause/play keys, but the rest of the media keys are only available while NumLock is on.  

Changing DPI (mouse sensitivity) on the fly is a great option for gamers, especially first person shooters, but if were being honest the default slider Windows uses to change DPI is quite sloppy, and who wants to open that window and drag the slider mid-game anyway? By pressing the appropriate hotkey you can easily set your DPI to the exact value you want, and the hotkeys are easy to remember too. Programs that do this are rare, and usually involve using the scrollbar which can be inaccurate if you want a specific DPI. There is also a hotkey to restore the default DPI, which also happens automatically if you exit the program.  

You might notice some buttons have been configured to launch hotkeys involving Ctrl+Numpad buttons 1-9 and Alt+Numpad5. These hotkeys can be set to any program you like by registering a shortcut to it in the start menu, opening the properties window for that shortcut, and then configuring the hotkey for the shortcut in the properties window, and you can still use these hotkeys with AHK turned off using Ctrl+NumPad buttons 1-9. I suggest setting Ctrl+Numpad 0 to Calculator, also you will probably have better luck configuring Start Menu hotkeys when AHK is disabled.  

The F13-F24 buttons are really handy. Some programs have issues with AutoHotkey, even if you run your script in administrator mode using AutoHotkey32 and AutoHotkey64 for maximum compatibility, but only while registering hotkeys. This is one reason I suggest you disable AHK when registering hotkeys, usually anyway. Single button hotkeys register much better, like how I used the NumpadClear button with BlindBossKey Lite. But wait, won't this conflict with any other shortcuts assigned to F13-F24? The answer is nope, fact is those keys aren't on most keyboards, but they can still be accessed by pressing Shift+F1 for F13, Shift+F2 for F14, etc. But, Shift+F1 would in reality result in Shift+F13, not F13, so most hotkeys will refer to Shift+F13 instead of F13, you follow? Even if you have the keys on your keyboard, for this reason they will always produce Shift with the F key. That means you can use F13 and above for whatever you want.  

MenuTools is a great piece of freeware, I have had a long love for the program ever since 64-bit became more popular and I was forced to find a suitable replacement for PowerMenu. That's why I decided to make use of it within my program, imkira3Keys will automatically launch MenuTools. MenuTools is a program that will add 4 options to the context menu in the title bar of most apps, allowing you to set a window as "On Top", adjust transparency, minimize to tray or adjust the process priority.  

You might notice I didn't use shift in anything except the button descriptions, not on the input side anyway. No, I used Ctrl or Win or Alt or nothing to combo with the buttons, in case you wanted to make stickers for your buttons like I did. I made a simple system: Ctrl goes on the left side of the button, buttons that change with NumLock have their alternate function on the left side too. Win goes up above the top row buttons, Alt goes on the right, and on the bottom side of the buttons is it's default function, like so:

There I think that mostly explains how my script works. The only thing left to talk about is the installer. I made a simple SFX file that will install the program and add shortcuts and startup entries, but you can use the ZIP if you prefer. However, this program will only operate properly if it can find the proper files in the proper directory with the proper name, so be sure and extract everything to: "C:\ProgramData\imkira3Keys". Also, there are 2 versions of the code this time, and they are both slightly different. They are meant to work together, so be sure to use the imkira3Keys.exe file to launch everything, it will launch both scripts and all associated software. Now here are the download links, have fun:
