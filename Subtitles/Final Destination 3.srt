that one guy who got voted

I didn't see his face, but, um,

did take his sickle

before the ride started if
that's helpful in any way.

that death is, like, a person?

00:59:55,203 --> 00:59:57,848
No. It's like...
Like a force.

Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

It's nothing else.

of how we were sitting
on the roller coaster,

but not how it works with
people who sat together.

1206

Ok, we don't know if Ashley
or Ashlyn died first.

Hmm. Death is
fucking complicated.

No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

It's simple.

That's just part of life.

You know? I mean,

1214
01:01:24,843 --> 01:01:26,888
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

It's as simple as that.

How can you explain what
happened to us as simple?

1219
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:41,536
I mean, if Wendy never
had that premonition

1220
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,653
and none of us
had gotten off that ride,

1221
01:01:42,677 --> 01:01:43,988
we'd all be dead right now.

1222
01:01:44,012 --> 01:01:45,056
Does that not make sense to you?

1223
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,357
[IAN] Oh, yeah.

1224
01:01:46,381 --> 01:01:50,295

dies of a plain heart attack

oh, wow, he was

01:01:55,156 --> 01:01:56,967
when princess Diana
died in Paris,

1228
01:01:56,991 --> 01:02:00,171
and then he saw her funeral
on TV, and now he's dead?

they'd sound crazy,

[IAN] Ok.

1246
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:56,770
Let's go with what
you guys are saying.

1247
01:03:56,794 --> 01:03:58,105
Let's just say, you know,

1248
01:03:58,129 --> 01:04:00,575
that death does have
a conscious plan

1249
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,943
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

1250
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:05,145
So, Newton's third
law of motion,

1251
01:04:05,169 --> 01:04:06,380
and, well, look,

1252
01:04:06,404 --> 01:04:07,948
I'm just guessing that
it goes for death, too,

1253
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:09,883
when he's working in our world.

1254
01:04:09,907 --> 01:04:12,152
Newton says that every action

1255
01:04:12,176 --> 01:04:13,854
has an equal and
opposite reaction.

1256
01:04:13,878 --> 01:04:16,941
So, that means that

1257
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:20,878
if death has taken
action so can we.

1258
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:23,114
And that that action
we take might have

1259
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:25,716
an opposite reaction that
thwarts death's intent.

1260
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,485
You're being a fucker,
but go on.

gonna ruin any plan
