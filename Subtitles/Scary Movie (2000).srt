1
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:22,246
<i>- Hello.
- Wanna have a little fun?</i>

2
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,296
<i>- Who is this?
- Tell me your name
and I'll tell you mine.</i>

3
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:27,463
I don't think so.

4
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:30,262
<i>- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.</i>

5
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,721
<i>- I-I didn't think
you would hear me.
- No, that popping noise.</i>

6
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:37,681
Oh. I'm making popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.

7
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:41,263
<i>- Ooh. What is it?
- It's just a scary movie.</i>

8
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:43,438
<i>- Do you like scary movies?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

9
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:46,853
<i>- What's your favorite?
- Mm, I don't know.</i>

10
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:48,731
<i>Think.</i>

11
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:52,399
<i>Oh, I know. Um, Kazaam. You know,
the one where Shaq plays a genie.</i>

12
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:56,070
<i>- That's not a horror movie.
- Yeah, well, you haven't seen Shaq act.</i>

13
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,077
<i>- Hey, you have a nice voice.
- Thanks.</i>

14
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,287
<i>You never did tell me your name.</i>

15
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,628
Why do you wanna know my name?

16
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:08,427
<i>'Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.</i>

17
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,260
What...
What did you say?

18
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,595
Nice breasts.

19
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,599
Look, what do you want?

20
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:19,396
<i>I wanna see
what your insides look like.</i>

21
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:21,847
Well... Well, then,
turn to page 54.

22
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,892
Oh.

23
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,604
Hey, nice.

24
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:31,575
Listen, asshole, you've had your fun,
now you better stop or else.

25
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,737
<i>- Or else what?
- Or else my boyfriend's
gonna be here any minute...</i>

26
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:36,863
and he's black
and he'll kick your ass.

27
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,326
<i>- Oh, really?
- Yeah.</i>

28
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,127
<i>You mean the one who wears make-up
and dresses like a woman?</i>

29
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:44,206
<i>- How did you know?
- Turn the porch lights on.</i>

30
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:53,465
Help! Help!

31
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,508
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.

32
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:57,968
I mean, I've fucked him a couple
of times, but that's it.

33
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:01,311
Look, I'm calling the cops.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,646
<i>Go ahead. Call the cops.</i>

35
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:06,777
<i>But you might wanna
check the back door first.</i>

36
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:08,861
<i>You forgot to lock it.</i>

37
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:33,845
Take that, you psycho!

38
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,393
I can't feel my legs.

39
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,728
I think my arm is broken.

40
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:45,392
- Sorry.
- I want my mommy.

41
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:50,360
Hello, Drew.

42
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,374
Oh, God.

43
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:09,758
Oh, God!

44
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,889
No!

45
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,945
Daddy! Daddy!

46
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:18,076
Daddy! Daddy!

47
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,408
Daddy, no! No!

48
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:27,209
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

49
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:58,539
Bobby, what are you doing?
My dad's in the other room.

50
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,335
It just occurred to me I never
climbed through your window before.

51
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,537
Yeah, well, now that you got it
out of your system, Bobby...

52
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,341
- What?
- you have to leave.
- Why?

53
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,672
Shh. Come on.

54
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,671
What's going on in there?

55
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:14,089
Ow! Daddy's head is stuck.
Unstick Daddy's head.

56
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:17,765
- Dad, can you knock?
- Knock?

57
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:21,678
- I thought I heard screaming in here.
- No. No, you didn't, Dad.

58
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:24,436
Well, i-it could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

59
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:26,359
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, that's what it was.

60
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:29,108
Listen, I gotta leave town for a couple
of days. Okay? No big deal.

61
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,362
Just, you know that new business
I started with those Colombian guys?

62
00:05:31,492 --> 00:05:34,279
- Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

63
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:36,488
Well, there's a problem.
Some money went missing.

64
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:38,864
And apparently,
some legs are gonna get broken.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,957
- It's just better if I lay low
for a couple of days.
- Okay.

66
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:43,872
- Now, if the cops raid the place...
- I never heard of you.

67
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,294
- And don't forget...
- To flush your stash.

68
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:49,211
Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

69
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,383
that I left you a little something
in the coffee can.

70
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:55,047
- Dad...
- But you have to remember to step
on it before you sell it.

71
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:58,054
- Now, what are you gonna cut it with?
- Um, baking...

72
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:00,060
- Baking soda. Not baking powder.
- Soda.

73
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:02,940
Because baking powder guys will have
muffins growing out of their nose.

74
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:05,557
- Dad.
- You love that joke, don't you, honey?

75
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:08,861
You've loved that joke
since you were two years old. Eh?

76
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,816
- Okay, well...
- Okay, I love you.

77
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:13,108
- I love you.
- Have a good trip.

78
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:15,651
- Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:18,413
Is the coast clear?

80
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,246
Oh, Cindy, that nightgown.

81
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:24,544
That was close. God!

82
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,592
<i>I was, uh, home watching The Exorcist,
and it got me thinking about you.</i>

83
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:36,802
If this is about the time I puked green
slime and masturbated with a crucifix...

84
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:39,093
It was my first keg party, Bobby.

85
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:43,690
No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cut out.

86
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:46,688
So you thought you would just climb
through my window...

87
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,813
and we would play bump-bump?

88
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:50,987
Oh, I was kind of hoping
to get my balls licked, but...

89
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:53,786
I wouldn't wanna break your little
underwear rule, now, would I?

90
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:57,161
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes-type stuff?

91
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:03,377
Okay. But just for a minute.

92
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:20,097
What the...

93
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,023
Wrong set.

94
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:29,316
Bobby! Oh, Bobby!

95
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,487
<i>I don't wanna wait</i>

96
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,942
<i>For our lives to be over</i>

97
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:35,655
- No, Bobby, don't.
- Ow!

98
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,667
Jeez. I see, yeah.

99
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,747
Yeah, my dad.

100
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,541
Okay, stud,
you have to go now.

101
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,010
Oh, um,
about the sex stuff?

102
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,512
I was only half serious. I mean,
I don't wanna rush you or anything.

103
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,846
Hey, would you settle
for PG-13?

104
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,553
What's that?

105
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,976
Oh, jeez!

106
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,902
Good night, Bobby.

107
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,449
Shorty, you are so loud.

108
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,201
And make sure you take
your behind to class today.

109
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,334
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

110
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,999
It is when you got the munchies.

111
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,998
- See, that's why you such a dumb-ass.
- Your mother.

112
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:33,049
You my brother.
That's your mother too, jackass.

113
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:36,431
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, your father's stupid.

114
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,097
So? I don't know him.

115
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,064
Yeah, me neither.

116
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,891
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

117
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:51,105
- Come on. We're gonna be late.
- Ooh, wait. There's Buffy.

118
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:53,732
I don't know why
you hang out with her.

119
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:56,621
- She is such a ho.
- Why do you say that?

120
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:58,823
'Cause I've seen her.

121
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:01,745
- My friend Sean
had a pool party this summer.
- Sean?

122
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:03,585
You know, Puff Daddy?

123
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:06,417
Anyway, everybody was drinking
Cristal champagne.

124
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:09,585
And then it started to get wild,
and people was getting freaky
in the pool and stuff.

125
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:14,262
I look over and there was your girl
getting buck wild in the Jacuzzi.

126
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,505
So?

127
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:18,761
With a backup dancer.

128
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:22,727
I mean, that's nasty. That's-That's
lower than the security guard.

129
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:26,938
At least security can get you backstage.
She don't love herself.

130
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,071
- Bye, Daddy.
- I don't know.
I think Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

131
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:33,781
Oh, she is as fake
as Press-on nails.

132
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,199
- Hey, baby girl!
- Hi!

133
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:39,789
- Hi.
- What is up, my sister?

134
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:42,787
- Bye, Mr. Gilmore.
- Bye!

135
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,379
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

136
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:49,217
<i>Do you like what you see</i>

137
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:52,095
<i>It's all about the money</i>

138
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:54,795
<i>- Hey, Cindy!
- It's the only way to be</i>

139
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,432
- I love this color.
- Let me see that.

140
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:05,981
- Oh, you guys should not use this brand.
- Why not?

141
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:09,028
- Because they test
their products on animals.
- So?

142
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:13,699
Look, have you seen what they do
to those poor animals?

143
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,321
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

144
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,661
I'd like to feed all the hungry
little children of the world.

145
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:25,167
- I'd much rather help my fellow man
than some animal.
- Spare a dollar?

146
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:27,622
- Oh! Get away from me, you bum!
- Buffy.

147
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:30,130
Can't you see he's just hungry?

148
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:34,128
Here you go, sir.
A nice sandwich for ya.

149
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:38,132
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch!

150
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,143
Ow!

151
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:43,355
God.
Look at this place.

152
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,855
It's a circus.

153
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:50,647
<i>Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author
of the book You're Dead, I'm Rich.</i>

154
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:52,858
A small college town
is in shock...

155
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:55,281
after the unthinkable
has happened:

156
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:58,117
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead...

157
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:00,786
That's it. Two teens dead...

158
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,206
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

159
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:06,872
- It's times like these...
- Police are combing the area for clues.

160
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,214
It seems there are no witnesses
available at this time.

161
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:12,759
There are no suspects in custody. Police
are asking anyone to come forward.

162
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:16,055
<i>Reporting live for Black TV.
White folks are dead and we're
getting the fuck out of here!</i>

163
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:19,517
- Let's roll, Jack.
- Right.
- Come on! Grab your shit
and let's go, motherfucker!

164
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,353
Go! Go!

165
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:26,316
Hey, do you think the press is gonna
wanna talk to us?

166
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:31,272
Ugh! Girl, no.
The press only wants to interview
the most ignorant person they can find.

167
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:35,073
<i>I'm on TV! Oh, shit!
First Cops, now this!</i>

168
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:37,077
Oh, man, I'm gonna be
a star, son!

169
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:41,583
- What can you tell us about Drew?
- Well, she had the phat ass, son.

170
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,794
- I mean, it was like bang!
- How close were you to the victim?

171
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:47,626
Real close.
Until the roofies wore off.

172
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:49,751
Then she woke up talking about
pressing charges.

173
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:51,961
So I just pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

174
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:54,254
What would have been
your last words to Drew?

175
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,426
Run, bitch! Run!

176
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:04,020
Hey, yo, dog.
Does this shirt make me look gay?

177
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,941
No, man.

178
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:10,193
What about now?

179
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:12,779
- Nah.
- Cool?
- Yeah.

180
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,902
Here. Take one, guys.
Don't forget: election's Tuesday.

181
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,823
"Don't forget:
election's Tuesday."

182
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:22,168
Goddam it!
Son of a bitch!

183
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:25,330
What's the matter, honey?

184
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,421
My report card.

185
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:32,423
Well, at least
you got one "A."

186
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:35,509
- Yeah. I did, huh?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:38,808
You're so smart.

188
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:41,510
- Hey, has anybody seen Bobby?
- Nah.

189
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:43,723
You know what?
That kid is always late.

190
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:46,147
I don't get it.
He lives so close.

191
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:48,937
<i>Why are you</i>

192
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,278
<i>Any better than anyone else</i>

193
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:56,200
<i>Why are you so good</i>

194
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:58,701
- See you later, Hairy Mama...
- Bye, hon.
- Bubba, Jim...

195
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:01,833
- Big Jim, Little Jim,
Slim Jim, everybody.
- Bye.

196
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,665
I'll see you later. Ciao, Ding.
All right.

197
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:13,591
Damn, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.

198
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:16,509
- I'd sure like to get in them pants.
- Really?

199
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:19,050
Yeah. What size are these?

200
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:22,555
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bobby.

201
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,398
Hey, baby.

202
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,850
- How you doing?
- Good.

203
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,979
- You guys see all
the reporters out there?
- Yeah.

204
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:32,067
- Yeah. Saying that girl Drew Decker
got killed last night.
- I know.

205
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,442
- You know what? I think I knew her.
- Really?

206
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:37,578
- Yeah. She had a brother named Steve?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:40,279
Long hair, pretty little mouth,
perfect ass?

208
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:43,287
- That was her.
- Nah, I was talking about Steve.

209
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,377
Whatever happened to him?

210
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:48,376
Hey, do you guys think it's strange
that she got killed...

211
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:51,545
exactly one year after we...

212
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,885
you know, killed that guy?

213
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:56,588
Hey!
Cindy, that was an accident.

214
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:58,599
Was it, Greg?

215
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:05,649
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

216
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:18,035
Would you look
at what they're doing?

217
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:20,916
When are we gonna do
stuff like that, huh?

218
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,916
One day.

219
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:25,582
- You like that, baby?
- Yeah, that's different.

220
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:27,956
- You like that?
- Oh, I love that.

221
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,417
Oh, I love
when you play with my ass.

222
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:32,426
I'm not playing
with your ass.

223
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:37,844
- Ray!
- Oh, my bad.

224
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:42,804
Come on, man!
Hey, Bobby, put on some music.

225
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,058
Hold on.
Here, put this on.

226
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,273
<i>- Yeah, that's the shit right here!
- It's rainin' men</i>

227
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:56,114
<i>- Hallelujah
- It's raining men</i>

228
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,737
<i>- Baby.
- Amen</i>

229
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:01,543
<i>- I wanna go out
- What?
- I'm gonna let myself get</i>

230
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:06,793
<i>- What? It's a classic.
- Absolutely soakin' wet
- Turn on the radio, man.</i>

231
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:12,006
Yeah! Whoo!

232
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,316
- What? It was laundry day.
- What the fuck is...

233
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:30,485
Yeah!

234
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:34,564
Whoo! Yeah!

235
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:40,664
- Hey. Come over here.
- What?

236
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:43,876
- Just get a little closer to me.
- Something you're gonna tell me?

237
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:50,165
- Bobby, what are you doing?
- I just want you to touch it.
Just touch it. Come on.

238
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:52,425
- Uh...
- Just a little bit. Come on.

239
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:56,172
<i>- Whoo!
- Everybody wants you</i>

240
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:59,141
- Ow!
- Oh!

241
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,595
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.

242
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:12,533
- Bobby!
- Oh, my God! Shit!

243
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:18,405
God, Cindy...
Oh, shit!

244
00:16:29,884 --> 00:16:32,008
Oh, my God.
What was that?

245
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:34,462
I think we hit something.

246
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,562
Oh, man!

247
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:45,556
Bobby, look at my car, man!
My dad's gonna freak!

248
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:48,397
I didn't see it.
It-It-It c-came out of nowhere.

249
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,067
- Oh, my God, we hit a boot.
- Where's the foot?

250
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,571
I don't know.

251
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:55,610
Where the...

252
00:16:57,914 --> 00:17:00,286
- It's a body!
- Oh, shit. Is he alive?

253
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,373
- I don't know.
- Well, check it out!

254
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:04,625
- I can't.
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!

255
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:07,459
- We have to call the police.
- No way. I ain't goin' to jail.

256
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,500
- We have to!
- Hey, Cindy.

257
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,923
Do you know what they do
to young boys in prison?

258
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,837
You know, all those sex-starved convicts
just waiting for a fresh piece of meat.

259
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:18,181
Hey, you're right, Cindy.
Maybe we should call the police.

260
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,604
Oh, yeah. That's a great idea, Ray.
But what about Brenda, huh?
You think she wants to go to jail?

261
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:24,640
This is manslaughter, okay?
We're all gonna fry for this.

262
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:28,476
- We're looking at 10 to 15 years.
- Shut up, Bobby!

263
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,530
- Alcohol all over...
- It's okay. I'm fine.
- We're in so much trouble, you guys.

264
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:34,611
- I'm fine.
- Don't blame that shit on me, Ray.

265
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:38,694
- Look, we... We'll get rid of the body.
- Unnecessary.

266
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,501
- Now you're thinking.
- We'll dump him in the ocean.
- Not the ocean, the pier.

267
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,702
- Guess I'll be leaving now.
- That's a great idea.

268
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,829
- What about the alcohol?
- We'll get rid of it.

269
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,956
Come on. It'll be all right.

270
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:50,297
- Come on. Hurry up. Let's go.
- Put him in the trunk.

271
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,965
- I won't have anything to do with this!
- Shut up!

272
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:56,465
Cindy, come on.
We'll just pretend it never happened.

273
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,803
You know, like the time we got drunk
and we went down on each other.

274
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:03,436
- I'll get his arm.
- I'll grab his other arm.
- I'll grab his ass.

275
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:06,056
We'll take him down to Williamson Cove
and we'll dump him in there.

276
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:08,351
The sharks'll take care
of the evidence.

277
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:11,403
Oh, my God, someone's coming.

278
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:14,533
- Oh, shit. It's Shorty.
- Brenda, take care of him.

279
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,995
Shorty, I know you ain't driving
without no papers.

280
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:27,213
I got papers, blunts, bongs...

281
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,831
all the ingredients
to make a high nigga pie.

282
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:35,171
- Hey, yo, can I help you?
- Yo, what's up, Ray?

283
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:37,845
- Yo, son, you all need jumper cables?
- Nah, we're cool.

284
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:42,021
Oh, good, 'cause I left
my roach clip at home.

285
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:45,730
- Go home, Shorty.
- Yeah, I-I'll see you later.

286
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,018
- Peace, Ray.
- Get the trunk closed.

287
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:50,644
- It won't close.
- I'll do it.

288
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,764
Hold on. Hold on. Put him down.
He's heavy. Oh, God.

289
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:25,807
Jesus. Okay, look. On three
we dump him over the ledge, all right?

290
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:28,350
Wait, wait, wait.
Shouldn't we at least check his wallet?

291
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:32,070
- For what?
- Shit, he might have some money.

292
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:35,117
We already committed murder.
We might as well rob his ass.

293
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:37,949
- I'll take the credit cards.
- I want his jewelry.
- I'm gonna take his drawers.

294
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:43,080
Get off! Hey, yo, get off!
His drawers are mine! Hey, yo!

295
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:46,835
- I got me a gold ring.
- Credit cards.

296
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:50,464
- All right, let's get him in the water.
- I don't think I can, Greg.

297
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:53,001
- It's not too late.
- Shut up, okay?

298
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:56,922
- Christ, already. I'll do it.
- Come on.
- Just get him in the water.

299
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:00,262
Okay. One, two...

300
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:02,269
three.

301
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:10,732
Right now we make a pact.
We take this to our grave. Agreed?

302
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,656
- Agreed.
- Agreed?

303
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:16,863
- Agreed.
- Say it, Cindy. Say it!

304
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:20,080
We take this to our grave. Say it!

305
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,330
We take this to our grave. Say it.

306
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,168
Greg, chill. Come on.
You're hurting her. Greg.

307
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:27,711
- Come on.
- We take this to our grave. Ow.

308
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,459
And we never
mention this again.

309
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:34,761
- Mention what?
- The guy we just killed.

310
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:37,131
Well, you just mentioned it, Greg.

311
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,674
Starting now!

312
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:43,180
- Stupid bitch, man.
- God, I hate him.

313
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:46,648
It's gonna be okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

314
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:49,861
Just touch it again.
Come on. Please?

315
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:56,359
- You have to move on, Cindy.
That's all behind us now.
- Exactly.

316
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:58,653
- It's a coincidence.
- Greg's right, Cindy.

317
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,707
I mean, what do you think
we're in, a horror movie?

318
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:05,504
Yeah, you guys are right.
I mean, if we were...

319
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:10,339
they'd probably cast some dingbat
like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me.

320
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:14,217
Yeah, yeah, or they'd...
or they'd cast people in their late
twenties, early thirties to play us.

321
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:19,977
Kenny, get the camera ready.
Here. Hold my gum.

322
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:25,564
- Hi. Sheriff, Sheriff,
can I get a statement?
- No comment.

323
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:30,935
Damn. Who do I have to screw around here
to get a stupid story?

324
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,398
Hey! Hey, no running.

325
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:37,410
Loser.

326
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:40,788
- Slow it down!
- Blow me!

327
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,288
All right!

328
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:45,957
<i>Hi. Gail Hailstorm.
Field Reporter, Hard Story.</i>

329
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,211
Special Officer Doofy.

330
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:52,290
Oh, hi, Doofy. Doofy, listen.
Is there a problem on campus?

331
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:54,587
- No comment.
- Okay.
- No comment.
- Okay.

332
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:58,387
You know, you look awfully young
to be a police officer.

333
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,676
- Yeah, I'm 25 and a half years old.
- Ooh!

334
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:03,054
- Yeah, that's this many.
- Ah, so big.

335
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,063
Yeah. That's big.

336
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:08,027
Well, you don't look
a day over 12.

337
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:12,067
Except for the big head
and glazed-over look in your eyes.

338
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:15,734
- Ooh, was that drool?
- Yeah. I forgot to swallow.

339
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:19,238
Don't worry,
'cause I never forget.

340
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,794
- Would you remind me
not to do that again?
- Sorry.

341
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,754
<i>Hello. Due to the recent tragedy,
the sheriff and me, your principal...</i>

342
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:29,419
<i>will be questioning all students
throughout the day.</i>

343
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,421
Wow. Sounds like we've got the makings
of a serial killer on our hands.

344
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:35,258
Yeah, I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

345
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:39,886
Hey, Doofy, what do you say you and I
go inside my van over there...

346
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:42,142
and, uh, get to know
each other a little better?

347
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:46,020
- Would you like that?
- That van?
- Yeah, that van right there.

348
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:52,195
- Yeah. Yeah, okay, let's go. Come on.
- Oh!

349
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:56,072
A terrible tragedy
and an unbearable loss.

350
00:22:56,203 --> 00:23:00,450
It's days like today
that we need prayer in school.

351
00:23:00,582 --> 00:23:05,577
It starts to unravel the very
moral fabric of our society.

352
00:23:05,713 --> 00:23:07,670
Here you go, baby.

353
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:09,874
You go to your daddy.

354
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,095
- I'll see you after class.
- Sweet!
- All right!

355
00:23:17,225 --> 00:23:21,554
Okay, class, who would like to give
their oral presentation first?

356
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:26,316
- Anybody?
- Yes!

357
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:29,360
Anybody else?

358
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:32,654
- Okay, Heather.
- Oh, yes! Okay.

359
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:37,657
- Okay. Can I start?
- Yeah.

360
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:40,658
Okay, my presentation
is on the First Amendment.

361
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:45,334
And it began on May 25, 1787
in Philly with George Washington.

362
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:47,289
And it states, and I quote...

363
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:50,839
"When our Founding Fathers argued the
passage of our glorious Constitution..."

364
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:44,060
And so, the First Amendment gives
us the right to say what we want...

365
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,108
Oh, shut the fuck up!

366
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,485
So, who's next?

367
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:53,614
Uh, Cindy Campbell.

368
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,992
Isn't she the daughter
of, uh, well, you know...

369
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,620
- Oh, yeah, you know, old Mrs., uh...
- Old Mrs...

370
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,584
And, uh, yeah.
Yeah, the one and only...

371
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,079
The one and only.

372
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,832
- Uh... Why, uh, hello, Cindy.
- Hi, Principal Squiggman.

373
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:15,926
- Thanks, Doofy.
- It's Special Officer Doofy today,
Cind.

374
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,639
Now, Cindy, Sheriff has some questions
that he would like to ask you today.

375
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,268
- What is that, that god-awful smell?
- I don't know.

376
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,678
I got a poopie.

377
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,771
Did you just say that you, uh,
you went poopie?

378
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,940
- Yeah. It was good.
- Mm.

379
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:35,158
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

380
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,990
- Thank you, Doofy.
- Okay.

381
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,280
You should now go back
to Special Ed.

382
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:44,627
- Okay. Salute.
- Maybe a change of underwear, son.

383
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,291
- Bye, Doofy.
- Bye, Cind.

384
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,172
- How are you, Cindy?
- Fine.

385
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,171
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Bloated, constipated.

386
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:56,838
Got a boil on my ass the size
of a walnut. You know, the usual.

387
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:59,845
Cindy, I want to ask you
some questions about Drew Decker.

388
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:04,396
- I didn't really know her.
- Oh, come on. Sure you do.

389
00:26:04,524 --> 00:26:06,849
- No. I mean...
- Come on.
- I didn't really know her.

390
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,736
I've been in this game a long time.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter, all right?

391
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:14,240
Tell me about Drew.
What was she like in bed, Cindy?

392
00:26:15,452 --> 00:26:18,571
Tried to get you.
It's an old police trick.

393
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:22,204
It's an old police trick. You didn't
fall for it. Good for you, kid.

394
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:24,208
Hike!

395
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:27,703
Pass! Pass!

396
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:33,251
- All right, shower up!
- Yes!

397
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,179
Yo, Dugan, man,
nice play, yo. Word up.

398
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:41,014
- Johnson, what a block, baby. Word up.
- Thanks a lot, kid.

399
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:44,348
- Woodward.
- Hey-hey.
- Nice ass.

400
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:46,558
Damn.

401
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:50,026
Hey, yo, Greg, man, what's up?
You gonna hit the showers or what?

402
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:54,283
No, man. I-I think I'm gonna work out,
you know, beat the bag a little.

403
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:58,537
Suit yourself, kid. All right.
Last one in the shower's a rotten egg!

404
00:26:58,663 --> 00:27:02,531
Come on, y'all!
I'm gonna get y'all!

405
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,585
Don't let Uncle Ray catch you!

406
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:33,114
Who did this? Huh?
Where are you?

407
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:35,530
This isn't funny, all right?

408
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,578
A small dick's like a disability, man!

409
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:42,916
Huh? Would you make fun of a guy
in a wheelchair? Huh? Would you?

410
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:45,415
Come on out here,
you sick fuck!

411
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:49,590
I'll kick the shit
out of you right now! All right?

412
00:27:49,716 --> 00:27:53,584
It's not the size of the hammer,
it's the nail you're throwing it at!

413
00:27:56,598 --> 00:28:00,133
It's a shame how she died, you know?
She was such a nice girl.

414
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:03,223
Yeah, she used to baby-sit
my brother Doofy.

415
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:06,974
- He had the biggest crush on her.
- Ray, you're a dead man.

416
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:09,102
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

417
00:28:09,236 --> 00:28:11,609
- No, no, no, what you tryin' to say?
You wanna get butt-naked and wrestle?
- Chill out. Chill out. Chill out.

418
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:14,989
- Bring it on, Ray!
- Hold my earrings.
- Chill out.
- Where's my Vaseline?

419
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:18,736
- Take it easy.
- What's the problem?
- I'll show you the problem.

420
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:20,948
Oh... That's you?

421
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:24,617
They... They turned the hot water off
in the showers, all right?

422
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,791
Oh, shit!

423
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:32,127
Oh, yeah. Laugh it up, you guys.
Big laugh.

424
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,218
You know what?
You can all go to hell!

425
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,634
Greg, you're not the only one
who got one.

426
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,059
Oh, you-you mean
Bobby's got a baby dick too?

427
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,265
No. I was talking
about the note.

428
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:50,644
I got one too.

429
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,531
- Somebody knows.
- That's bullshit, Cindy.

430
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:55,650
Look, someone's just trying
to fuck with us, you guys.

431
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:58,406
We have to call the police, Greg.

432
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:01,207
You call the police,
and I'll kill you myself.

433
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:12,839
- You're hurting her, man.
- And you know what?
That goes for all of you guys!

434
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:15,543
That psycho wants
a piece of me, bring it on.

435
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:18,800
But I'm not going to jail.
You got that?

436
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:29,018
What's everybody talkin' about?

437
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,609
Just forget it, Shorty.
You already know too much.

438
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:38,401
Aren't they beautiful?

439
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:41,539
- Buffy!
- Contestant number one!

440
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:48,121
Very good.
And contestant number two.

441
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:54,757
Very good.
And contestant number three.

442
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:58,553
- Buffy!
- That's my girl!

443
00:29:58,684 --> 00:30:01,934
- That's my girlfriend!
- Yeah, that's my girlfriend too!

444
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:05,312
- Hey, kiss my ass!
- Yeah, I'm hitting that too!

445
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:07,932
- All right, Buffy!
- Hey, shut the hell up, man!

446
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:11,687
- Oh, yeah, man. Best pussy I ever had!
- What, you want a piece of me?

447
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:14,148
Now the talent portion
of the competition.

448
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:16,988
- Oh, you guys, I'm gonna go
downstairs for a closer seat.
- Let's begin...

449
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,782
with contestant number three...
- See you after the show.
- Buffy Gilmore.

450
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,158
Hey, you know what? I'm gonna
go, uh, hit the head. You want me
to bring you back anything?

451
00:30:24,294 --> 00:30:27,129
No, no, no. I'm good, man.
But hurry back. She's gonna perform.

452
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:29,828
- Don't worry. I'll be back.
- So, good evening, Buffy.

453
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:32,089
And what will be
your talent for this evening?

454
00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:35,967
Acting. I'll be doing
a dramatic reading.

455
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:40,426
Buffy Gilmore
doing a dramatic reading.

456
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:45,812
<i>Hey, do that thing from Baywatch!
She's running down the beach!</i>

457
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,779
Look out, Greg!
Look behind you!

458
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,115
- It's him! It's the killer!
- Huh?

459
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:02,164
Oh, my God!
Somebody do something!

460
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:05,791
Somebody do something!

461
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,494
He's killing him!

462
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:11,549
- He's killing him!
- Must be an original piece.

463
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:12,957
He's killing him!

464
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:16,631
She's good. She's good.

465
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:19,635
- What's wrong with you people?
- That's fantastic.

466
00:31:19,768 --> 00:31:23,635
You fucking bastards!
Why won't anyone help?

467
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:25,848
- Amazing.
- She's the next Pamela Lee.
- God!

468
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:29,067
Oh, God! Oh, God! Don't!

469
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,692
Greg, hold on!

470
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,691
Give it up for Buffy Gilmore!
Wonderful!

471
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,903
Absolutely fantastic.

472
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:46,169
I think we have a winner, ladies
and gentlemen. Miss Buffy Gilmore!

473
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:48,834
Buffy, wait.
You have to go back onstage.

474
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,254
- No. I have to get to Greg.
- But you won!

475
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:53,009
- They're calling your name.
- There's a killer...

476
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:56,887
- I won?
- They're calling your name. Go.

477
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,850
- Buffy, what happened? What about Greg?
- Oh, fuck Greg. I won.

478
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:02,052
- Congratulations!
- Oh, out of my way, loser!

479
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,638
Miss Buffy Gilmore!

480
00:32:05,774 --> 00:32:10,068
<i>Here she comes
Miss Teen She's So Fine</i>

481
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:13,196
<i>- Such lovely tits
- Give me my crown, bitch.</i>

482
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:16,443
<i>And a great behind</i>

483
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:21,535
<i>There she is
Doggy style anytime</i>

484
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:25,877
<i>And I'll do her behind
behind and behind</i>

485
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:28,874
<i>Oh, there she is</i>

486
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:32,376
<i>She loves 69</i>

487
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,879
- There's no sign of him anywhere.
- He could've taken the body.

488
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:38,968
That's impossible, Cindy. There's no
blood. There's nothing. Look around.

489
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,971
I bet it's just Greg playing
another one of his dumb jokes.

490
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:44,511
He's gonna turn up. I'm sure of it.
He's probably at my house...

491
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:47,186
waiting for us right now, you guys.

492
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:50,686
All right, fine, fine.
But you know what?
I'm gonna look around some more, so...

493
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:53,229
- You mind catching
a ride home with Buffy?
- Yeah, no problem.

494
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:55,737
- All right, fine.
- Call me later.

495
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:20,224
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Cindy.</i>

496
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:23,103
<i>- Who is this?
- It's me, Bobby.</i>

497
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,685
<i>You know, your boyfriend.</i>

498
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:29,813
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm a little jumpy lately.

499
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:32,899
<i>- Hey, any sign of Greg?
- No.</i>

500
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:36,235
<i>- Do you want me to come by?
- No.</i>

501
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:39,987
I'm just gonna take a bath,
and then I'm gonna go to bed.

502
00:33:40,122 --> 00:33:43,954
<i>Okay. I'd really like
to see you, but... I love you.</i>

503
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:47,454
Aw. I love you too, baby.

504
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:11,819
Bobby, I told you...

505
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:14,189
<i>I still know
what you did last Halloween.</i>

506
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:15,984
Who is this?

507
00:34:28,756 --> 00:34:31,543
Ow! Ow!

508
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:38,220
<i>- Hello.
- I'm gonna kill you.</i>

509
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:40,591
<i>- I'm gonna slice you up.
- Who is this?</i>

510
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,182
<i>- I'm gonna chop you like liver.
- What do you want?</i>

511
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:45,685
I'm in the house.

512
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:48,188
<i>Do you know where I am?</i>

513
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:54,735
I could be anywhere.
I'm like the wind, baby.

514
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:58,033
<i>Yeah. Where am I?</i>

515
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:03,119
Um, you're-you're
behind the couch.

516
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:08,871
- What? How do you know that?
- I-I can, um, see your feet.

517
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,216
Ah! Okay, turn around.

518
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,552
Close your eyes.
No peeking.

519
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:25,223
Yeah. No. No. No.

520
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:28,227
Hey, hey, hey. No peeking.
No peeking. Turn around.

521
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,937
Good.

522
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,109
Okay, now you can look.

523
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,939
Now do you know where I am?
You don't.

524
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:39,196
No, Mr. Killer.
I don't know where you are.

525
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:42,200
I'll give you a big clue.

526
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:47,499
Oh! I gotta stop drinking.

527
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:57,844
- Grandma!
- Ow, baby! Ow! Ow! Oh, my hip!

528
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:23,123
Come on.

529
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:31,795
<i>White woman in trouble off the 744...</i>

530
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:41,803
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God.
- I heard screaming.
What's going on?

531
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:44,225
- Bobby, he was here.
- Shh.

532
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:47,724
- The killer was here, Bobby.
- It's okay.

533
00:36:54,866 --> 00:36:58,485
- I can explain that.
- Oh, my God.

534
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,491
A friend gave 'em to me.
Cindy. Cindy.

535
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:04,918
Cindy. Cindy! Cindy!

536
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:06,917
Cindy! Cindy!

537
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:13,840
It's me, Cind.

538
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,543
Cindy, you know me. Cindy.

539
00:37:23,104 --> 00:37:25,595
I know you've had a rough night, Cindy,
so I won't keep you.

540
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:28,519
I just want you to look at some photos.
Tell me what you think.

541
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:36,615
Mm-mmm.

542
00:37:38,745 --> 00:37:41,699
- No?
- No.

543
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:45,830
- I'm sorry, Sheriff.
- You sure?

544
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:48,879
Okay, you're free to go.
Do you have somebody picking you up?

545
00:37:49,006 --> 00:37:51,082
- Yeah.
- Oh. Just...

546
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:54,592
Just check that one out again.

547
00:37:56,013 --> 00:38:01,008
- Mm, no.
- No? No? All right. Well, worth a shot.
All right, thanks.

548
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:03,717
- Guess what I just did
with those hookers we busted.
- No way.

549
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:06,939
All the way, man! Yes, yes.
Watch this. Watch this. Doofy!

550
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,308
- Yeah?
- Come on. Come on.

551
00:38:09,444 --> 00:38:10,903
Okay.

552
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:13,897
Special Officer Doofy reporting.

553
00:38:14,032 --> 00:38:16,488
Hey, Doofy, smell my fingers.

554
00:38:17,744 --> 00:38:21,327
- What's that?
- That's when you know
you've become a man, Doofy!

555
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,408
Hey, Terry, smell my finger.

556
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:27,164
- Ugh! What the hell is that?
- My ass.

557
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:29,335
- Get the hell out of here, Doofy.
- Doofy.

558
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:34,257
- Mom said get home now.
- Tell Mom I'm on official
police business.

559
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:38,087
- Cindy, are you okay?
- Hey, hey, hey.
No talking to the witness.

560
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:41,011
- Go get in the car, Doofy.
She's coming with us.
- Does Mom know?

561
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:44,098
- Yeah, Doofus.
- Mom says when I wear this badge...

562
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,057
you're supposed to treat me
like a man of the law.

563
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,690
Yeah, well, Mom also said for you
to stop sticking your dick
in the vacuum cleaner.

564
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,191
Okay, three, two...

565
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,531
- Oh, no. Gosh darn.
- What now?

566
00:38:57,661 --> 00:38:59,819
- No, it's just that there's all
these numbers with deci...
- What, can't you count?

567
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:03,240
- No, I can count,
but there's really...
- Here, let me make it easy for you.
Chump-zilla, listen up, okay?

568
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,625
This little piggy went
to the market. All right?
This little piggy stayed home.

569
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:08,663
Now, if this little piggy doesn't roll
the goddam camera...

570
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:11,169
- I'm gonna put my foot
up his fuckin' ass...
- We're live, Gail.

571
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,506
Gail Hailstorm standing out front
of the police station...

572
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:16,257
where I'm going to try and get a glimpse
of Cindy Campbell...

573
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,844
the young girl who was attacked
earlier this evening.

574
00:39:18,974 --> 00:39:21,512
- You're on my foot, fat shit!
- Sorry, G...
- What did I say?

575
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:23,352
- Huh? What did I say?
- "Don't... Don't ever step
on Gail's shoes."

576
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:25,353
- Why not?
- Because Gail wears Prada shoes.

577
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:27,474
- You idiot.
- I'm a... I'm a bad man.

578
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:28,723
- Cindy! Cindy!
- How about one minute?

579
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,692
- Cindy, can we get a statement?
- Buffy Gilmore, Miss Teen.
She's not talking.

580
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:34,779
Is it true the police
have someone in custody?

581
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:38,277
- Um... Come on, Cindy.
- Cindy, Cindy, your ass looks fat!

582
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,495
Bitch!

583
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:44,747
- Good shot.
- Come on.

584
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:47,877
- All right, who copped a feel?
- Gail, it was me.

585
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:51,089
- Oh, my God.
- It was an accident, Gail.

586
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:54,087
I only touched it,
the top of the breast.

587
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:56,093
- It was so tender and juicy.
- Shut up!

588
00:40:05,314 --> 00:40:08,683
- Yo.
- Hello, Shorty. What are you doing?

589
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:14,061
Nothin'. Sittin' here watchin' the game.
Smokin' some bud.

590
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:17,532
Are you all alone?

591
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,361
- Wassup?
- Wassup?

592
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:23,870
What the...
Who's that?

593
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,788
Yo, pick up the phone.

594
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,921
- Wassup?
- Wassup?

595
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:34,589
Yo, Dookie,
pick up the phone!

596
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:38,046
- Yo.
- Wassup?

597
00:40:46,899 --> 00:40:52,570
- So what you doin', son?
- Nothin'. Just chillin', killin'.

598
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:55,235
True. True.

599
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,277
So you think Bobby did it?

600
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:03,991
I don't know.
But he was there, Buffy.

601
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:08,123
I knew there had to be something.
He's just too perfect.

602
00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:12,466
Handsome, smart,
good in bed.

603
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:15,926
- What did you say?
- Uh...

604
00:41:16,054 --> 00:41:19,139
Hey, Cind.
Got your ice pack for your hand.

605
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:21,971
- Ow!
- Sorry.

606
00:41:22,102 --> 00:41:24,640
- Uh...
- I'll get you one for your head.

607
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:27,097
No, no, that's okay, Doofy.

608
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:31,694
Hey, we're gonna get that guy
you dumped in the water. Yeah.

609
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,814
I'll be next door
if you need me.

610
00:41:33,948 --> 00:41:37,282
Night, Cind.

611
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,821
Buffy, you told him?

612
00:41:38,953 --> 00:41:41,990
The moron overheard a conversation
Greg and I were having.

613
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:46,251
- Yeah, but what if he says something?
- Who's gonna believe a retarded
retard like him anyway?

614
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,121
Don't worry.

615
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,832
Cindy, telephone.

616
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,966
Thank you.

617
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,677
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Cindy.</i>

618
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,846
<i>- Guess what.
- No!</i>

619
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,015
<i>- You got the wrong guy.
- No!</i>

620
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,018
<i>- Yep. It's not Bobby.
- Doofy?</i>

621
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,684
- Who is this?
- Doofy! Doofy!

622
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,057
- Doofy!
- Oh, my God.

623
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,695
Hello?

624
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,237
Hello?

625
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,204
I said don't disturb me
when I'm cleaning my room!

626
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,624
I heard Bobby got out
this morning.

627
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,010
I haven't seen him around.
Is he pissed?

628
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:40,887
You mean since you branded him
the Candyman? No. His heart is broken.

629
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:44,102
Yo, son. It's like
I seen this all before.

630
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,187
They had a killer at
your old high school, Shorty?

631
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:49,482
<i>No, it was in this movie Scream.
Same dialogue and everything.</i>

632
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,852
- This is ill.
- How did it end?

633
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:56,199
I don't know.
Some niggas started shooting up in
the movie theatre, so we just broke out.

634
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:59,991
- No doubt.
- Okay, I say we all
just stick together.

635
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:02,873
Tonight everyone meet at my house.
And bring some friends.

636
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:05,620
But don't tell everyone, okay?
Try to keep it quiet.

637
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:09,666
Okay.
Yo! Party at Cindy's house!

638
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,467
Drunk white women for everybody!

639
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:19,010
Ray, if you see Bobby,
tell him I love him.

640
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:23,091
Okay. If I see Bobby,
I'll tell him I love him.

641
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,643
- Jesus!
- It's okay. It's all right.
It's just me, baby.

642
00:43:33,823 --> 00:43:35,780
- What, you don't still
think it's me, do you?
- No.

643
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:37,984
- It's just that somebody
did try to kill me.
- Yeah.

644
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,413
- And the police said
I scared him away.
- I know. He called me last night.

645
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,909
Yeah, so you see, it couldn't have been
me. I was in jail last night. Remember?

646
00:43:48,213 --> 00:43:50,122
You're the best.

647
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:52,664
I'm sorry.
Please understand.

648
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:55,588
Understand what?
That my girlfriend would rather
call me a killer than touch me?

649
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,009
- That's not true, Bobby.
- Then what is it?
- What is it?

650
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,924
- She's gone and she's not coming back.
- It's been over a year, Cindy.

651
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,634
But Ginger was such an important
part of the Spice Girls.

652
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:07,726
- Oh, you gotta move on, baby.
- Oh!

653
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:10,812
I am sorry if my complicated life...

654
00:44:10,945 --> 00:44:14,989
is an inconvenience
to your perfect existence.

655
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:17,951
Cindy. Cind.

656
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:20,117
Okay, everybody, listen up.

657
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:22,488
Let me just say, uh...

658
00:44:22,623 --> 00:44:27,286
the killing of these... these teenagers
has been tragic, but, uh...

659
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:32,462
- Hey, you know, shit happens.
- Sheriff!
- Sheriff!

660
00:44:32,592 --> 00:44:35,795
- Yes, Miss Thunderstorm.
- Have they found
Cindy Campbell's father?

661
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:37,969
- No.
- Isn't he a suspect?

662
00:44:38,098 --> 00:44:40,174
That is classified information.
Where are you getting that?

663
00:44:40,308 --> 00:44:44,009
I'm sorry, but, uh, my sources
are strictly confidential, Sheriff.

664
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:46,637
Hey, Gail.

665
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:50,024
Gail swallows.

666
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:57,406
Watch this.

667
00:44:58,703 --> 00:45:01,657
Hello? Who is this?

668
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:06,581
What?
You wanna kill me?

669
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:08,834
Oh, God. Hold on.

670
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:13,008
Cindy, it's for you.

671
00:45:15,178 --> 00:45:17,467
All right, knock it off, Buffy.

672
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:20,432
Now, as you all have heard,
there is a killer in our town...

673
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,844
and the police have asked us to give you
the following safety tips.

674
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:26,185
Stay in well-lit areas.

675
00:45:26,315 --> 00:45:30,692
Do not travel alone whenever possible.
Always wipe front to back.

676
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:33,856
And remember, never, ever
believe someone...

677
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:36,694
when they tell you
that shaving your pubic hair...

678
00:45:36,826 --> 00:45:39,696
will rid you
of crab infestation.

679
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:43,743
Now, I understand this is
a difficult time for you young ladies.

680
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,876
So if anyone needs
to come to my office to talk...

681
00:45:47,003 --> 00:45:48,995
I am here for you.

682
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:56,379
- What a crock of shit.
- It's not, Buffy!

683
00:45:56,513 --> 00:45:59,383
He's real!

684
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:12,311
Miss Mann?

685
00:46:12,446 --> 00:46:15,732
Come in, dear. Have a seat.
Take off your bra if you'd like.

686
00:46:17,785 --> 00:46:20,240
No, thanks.

687
00:46:20,371 --> 00:46:22,447
What can I do for you,
Cindy?

688
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:26,282
I need to talk.
See, I have this problem...

689
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:29,918
and I don't know who to tell.

690
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:33,251
- Not feeling so fresh?
- Huh?

691
00:46:33,384 --> 00:46:35,757
Feminine odor and itching
got you down?

692
00:46:35,887 --> 00:46:38,923
Uh, no. No, not that.

693
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:42,971
Then what is it?

694
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:45,594
I have a terrible secret.

695
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,648
Well, Cindy, we all have
our little secrets.

696
00:46:51,695 --> 00:46:54,103
Sometimes we do things
we're not so proud of.

697
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,110
Some for money...

698
00:46:57,242 --> 00:47:00,409
others to gain the athletic edge
on the competition.

699
00:47:00,538 --> 00:47:04,452
Sometimes those secrets
come back to haunt us.

700
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:08,416
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes, I do, uh, Miss Mann.

701
00:47:08,546 --> 00:47:11,417
Thanks for ball...
I mean, all your help.

702
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:14,799
I have to go to class.

703
00:47:14,928 --> 00:47:17,004
Anytime, dear.

704
00:47:19,474 --> 00:47:22,760
- Buffy, are you coming?
- I'll catch up with you guys in a sec.

705
00:47:28,734 --> 00:47:31,604
Redrum.

706
00:47:31,737 --> 00:47:33,610
Hello?

707
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:43,872
Somebody there?

708
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:45,873
Hello!

709
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:55,211
Very funny.
Who put you up to this? Cindy?

710
00:47:55,345 --> 00:47:57,918
Lose the cape.
It's way too '90s horror.

711
00:48:00,308 --> 00:48:04,436
<i>Oh, so what movie is this from,
Die, Cheerleader, Die?</i>

712
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:11,440
Wanna play psycho killer?
Can I be the helpless cheerleader?

713
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,860
Oh, so this is where
I'm supposed to beg for my life?

714
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:19,946
Please, Mr. Killer, don't kill me.

715
00:48:23,832 --> 00:48:26,703
So is this where
I'm supposed to bleed?

716
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:30,584
Oh, look, I'm bleeding!
Eek. Eek.

717
00:48:32,216 --> 00:48:35,087
Oh, yeah,
I'm supposed to run, right?

718
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:39,881
Okay. I'm running!
I'm running! Help!

719
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:44,927
Help! Oh! Now I'm gonna fall
and break my leg, leaving me helpless.

720
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:52,315
There you go, Mr. Scary Killer.
I'm panicking now.

721
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:56,657
Oh, God!
Somebody please help me!

722
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:58,942
Oh, God, no!

723
00:48:59,077 --> 00:49:01,403
No!

724
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,946
Oh, now what?

725
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:09,670
I guess this is the big climax.
Hope you don't mind if I fake it.

726
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:15,048
Oh, look at me.
I'm all dead.

727
00:49:15,178 --> 00:49:18,677
I'm a gross, scary severed head.
Come on. Please.

728
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:22,756
Do you know who I am? I'm Miss Teen.
You're really giving me a headache.

729
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:26,761
And you got blood
all over my Gucci sweater.
I hope you're gonna pay for that.

730
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:29,520
Ah! I will not be ignored
by the likes...

731
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:34,443
- I'm gonna jump!
- Phil, get back in there.

732
00:49:34,573 --> 00:49:36,482
- No!
- What are you doing up there?

733
00:49:36,616 --> 00:49:40,033
- Be reasonable.
- I can't take this fucking job...

734
00:49:40,162 --> 00:49:43,412
or those greasy
shithead teenagers any more!

735
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:48,452
- I'm gonna end it all!
- Wait! Hold on!
We're getting help for you!

736
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:52,585
- Now we know Bobby's not the killer.
So who is?
- I don't know.

737
00:49:52,717 --> 00:49:55,920
Well, if the killer
was in your house last night,
why didn't he just kill you then?

738
00:49:56,053 --> 00:49:57,761
Because he's just
messing with us.

739
00:49:57,889 --> 00:50:00,427
Don't you see?
He's got us right where he wants us.

740
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:05,766
We can't go to the police.
He's just out there
watching us and waiting for us.

741
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:09,017
What are you
waiting for, huh?

742
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,021
What are you waiting for?

743
00:50:12,153 --> 00:50:14,858
What are you waiting for?

744
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,650
- What am I waiting for?
- What are you waiting for?

745
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:19,987
- What am I waiting for?
- What are you waiting for?

746
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,157
Fuck you!

747
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,284
Oh, my God.

748
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:29,289
Ray, I still don't think
this party is a good idea.

749
00:50:29,421 --> 00:50:32,837
- You know I'm not gonna
let nothin' happen to you.
- I just don't feel right.

750
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:37,380
- Why can't we just
do something else?
- Okay. How about we go to the movies?

751
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:40,550
- Huh? You like that?
See a little movie, huh?
- Yes. Yeah.

752
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:47,559
- Hey! That is my song!
- Hey!

753
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,730
- You know they gave me
a shout-out on the album, right?
- What?

754
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:55,483
<i>Yes.
Everywhere I go I see the same ho's</i>

755
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,407
Ooh, Brenda.

756
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:59,657
Did I tell you how sexy you look
in my jersey?

757
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:02,704
- I do, Ray?
- Yes.

758
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:05,618
I like it. Hey, get up.
Go-Go over there. Let me see it.

759
00:51:10,214 --> 00:51:14,081
Ooh! Yes, I like that.

760
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:16,626
- You like that?
You like that? You like that?
- Yeah. Hey!

761
00:51:16,762 --> 00:51:19,882
Hey, put this on with it.

762
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:24,096
- Ray, you are so freaky.
- That's right. You know
I'm freaky, girl.

763
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:26,186
Go on. Pull it.
Pull it up.

764
00:51:29,526 --> 00:51:33,570
Yeah. Here, here.
Put this on with it.

765
00:51:33,697 --> 00:51:36,188
Go on.

766
00:51:36,324 --> 00:51:40,536
- Are you sure?
- Go on, girl. Go on. Pull it on.

767
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:43,948
- Okay.
- Go on.

768
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:48,793
- I like that look.
- Ooh! I'm bad.

769
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:53,084
Ah, yes.
Here. Put this on with it.

770
00:51:53,217 --> 00:51:55,589
Go on, girl. Put it on.

771
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:58,590
Yeah. Put that shit on there.
Come on. Just shove it on.

772
00:51:58,723 --> 00:52:02,590
Do it. Yeah.
Ooh, so fucking sexy.

773
00:52:02,727 --> 00:52:05,265
Come here, girl. Bring your little
sexy ass over here. Come on!

774
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:07,021
Full speed. Charge!

775
00:52:10,944 --> 00:52:13,102
Yes! Yes!
Come on! Turn around!

776
00:52:13,238 --> 00:52:15,693
Turn around! Come on!
Yes, Brendan!

777
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:18,362
- Take it, Brendan! Take it, Brendan!
- Who?

778
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:21,031
Uh... Uh, Brenda. Come on,
come on. Put the helmet on.

779
00:52:21,163 --> 00:52:23,286
No, let's role-play.
Come on. You get me.

780
00:52:23,415 --> 00:52:25,657
- Get me! Come on! Come on!
- Huh?

781
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:27,702
I'm here at Lover's Lookout.

782
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:30,161
It's dark,
it's in the middle of nowhere...

783
00:52:30,297 --> 00:52:33,334
and it's where hormone-driven teens
love to come and fool around.

784
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:36,587
So very likely we're about
to see someone get killed.

785
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,386
Okay, sure enough,
there's a girl in that car,
blouse unbuttoned, all alone.

786
00:52:40,516 --> 00:52:43,303
Let's see if she'll have
a word with us.

787
00:52:43,436 --> 00:52:47,019
<i>Hi. Gail Hailstorm,
author of the new book You're Next.</i>

788
00:52:47,148 --> 00:52:50,398
- Oh, yeah.
- Can you tell us your name?

789
00:52:50,526 --> 00:52:54,690
- Well, my name's Heather.
- Heather, can you tell us what
you're doing out here all alone?

790
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:58,405
Well, yeah, sure. My boyfriend
and I were just, like, making out...

791
00:52:58,535 --> 00:53:02,034
and then we heard a noise out there,
so he went to go check it, but...

792
00:53:02,163 --> 00:53:04,655
- Well, that was,
like, ten minutes ago or so.
- Yeah, yeah.

793
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:08,041
Heather, has it crossed your
little mind that your boyfriend
was probably murdered...

794
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:11,539
and you're about
to be slaughtered next?

795
00:53:11,673 --> 00:53:14,247
Really? No way!

796
00:53:14,385 --> 00:53:17,172
- Way. Heather, good luck.
- Okay, thanks, Gail. You're the best.

797
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:21,717
I know. Just as I thought.
The murder is happening as we speak.

798
00:53:21,851 --> 00:53:24,520
I'm going to try and break into
the bloodshed. Are you getting this?

799
00:53:24,645 --> 00:53:28,061
Excuse me. Heather, Heather, can
you tell us what you're feeling, honey?

800
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:32,023
Lots of pain. Gail, please help me.
Gail, please!

801
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:36,151
I'd like to help you out, kid,
but it's sweeps. Sir, sir,
can I get a word with you? Sir!

802
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:39,200
You got a lot of nerve coming here.
I'm just trying to do my job.

803
00:53:39,327 --> 00:53:41,865
- Get the camera off me now!
You're dead, bitch.
- No, Kenny, keep rolling! Keep rolling!

804
00:53:41,997 --> 00:53:44,155
- I'm gonna slice your head off
and shove it up his ass.
- Sweet Jesus! Shit!

805
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:46,449
Get, get that camera off me!

806
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:50,962
Oh, my God, Kenny!
Kenny, move your fat ass!

807
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:53,841
Kenny! Oh, my God,
he's right behind you!

808
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:56,458
This man is chasin' me, Gail!

809
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,933
I am so scared right now.

810
00:54:06,731 --> 00:54:09,400
I just want to say...

811
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:12,645
to the family
of my cameraman, Kenny...

812
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:15,104
I am so sorry.

813
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:18,691
This was my interview...

814
00:54:18,827 --> 00:54:21,282
my story.

815
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:23,619
It's all my fault.

816
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:33,458
- You want some popcorn?
- Uh-uh. I brought me
a little snack of my own.

817
00:54:36,303 --> 00:54:38,628
- You want some chicken?
- Nah.

818
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:47,221
Mm-hmm.
For all y'all talkers up in here,
it's time to keep it down right now.

819
00:54:47,356 --> 00:54:49,064

Shh, back at you. Shh!

821

Why they actin' already?
It ain't nothin' but the previews.

real quick.
- Don't leave now!
The movie's about to come on!

828
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:33,644
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Here. Take your hot sauce.

829
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:37,113
Hurry up, man.
Don't be long.

Back up!
Let him through!

You don't own the theatre.

885
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:41,472
Oh, my God!

886
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:11,706
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

887
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,924
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

888
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:21,342
Yeah! Yeah!

889
01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:25,424
Oh, Bobby. Bobby.
I was worried about you.

890
01:01:25,562 --> 01:01:29,180
I thought the killer got to you
before I could.

891
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:31,024
Could what?

892
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:33,903
I wanna go upstairs.
There's something I wanna show you.

893
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:38,607
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

894
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:41,613
- Hey, party on!
- Yeah!

895
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:50,085
- So...
- So.

896
01:01:50,212 --> 01:01:52,882
Here we are again.

897
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:55,000
Yeah.

898
01:01:56,511 --> 01:01:58,918
And, you know,
if you're not ready...

899
01:02:00,598 --> 01:02:03,303
I'll understand.

900
01:02:03,434 --> 01:02:04,977
Bobby.

901
01:02:05,103 --> 01:02:07,096
I am ready.

902
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:10,391
- You are?
- Yeah.

903
01:02:12,277 --> 01:02:16,986
I can't keep fighting
these urges.

904
01:02:17,115 --> 01:02:19,951
I have to just
give in to them...

905
01:02:20,077 --> 01:02:22,116
and let them flow.

906
01:02:22,246 --> 01:02:24,285
Right.

907
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:25,909
Bobby?

908
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:29,042
I have been so selfish.

909
01:02:31,422 --> 01:02:33,498
This is like a scene
from a movie or something.

910
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:36,206
Only it isn't a movie, Bobby.

911
01:02:36,344 --> 01:02:38,218
This is real life.

912
01:02:39,514 --> 01:02:41,839
It's all a movie, baby.

913
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:46,103
There's the sound guy. There's the
script supervisor. How ya doin', baby?

914
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:48,554
- Bobby?
- What?

915
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:53,850
What I mean
is that in real life...

916
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:56,395
you have to enjoy
each moment.

917
01:03:24,602 --> 01:03:27,769
Bobby! Bobby!

918
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:33,689
Can I tell you a secret?

919
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,821
Sure, man.

920
01:03:36,948 --> 01:03:40,483
I see dead people.

921
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:43,536
Man, this shit is awesome!

922
01:03:43,664 --> 01:03:46,333
Yo, son, you gotta roll
some more of that shit!

923
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:50,788
- Ah, shit!
- We don't have any more papers, man.

924
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:53,163
We don't have
any more papers.

925
01:03:53,299 --> 01:03:56,668
Aw, man!
What can we use to make a bong?

926
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:03,512
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!

927
01:04:03,643 --> 01:04:05,801
- Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
- Yeah!

928
01:04:11,735 --> 01:04:15,946
Oh, shit, son!

929
01:04:16,072 --> 01:04:20,402
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!

930
01:04:21,703 --> 01:04:23,660
This some good shit!

931
01:04:48,106 --> 01:04:50,857
- Bobby! I've never done this before.
- Come on.

932
01:04:52,485 --> 01:04:55,689
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just like...

933
01:04:55,822 --> 01:04:57,779
It's like sucking on
a Tootsie Roll Pop.

934
01:04:57,908 --> 01:05:01,359
- A Tootsie Pop?
- Yeah, a cherry-flavor one.

935
01:05:01,495 --> 01:05:05,539
- Oh.
- With the fudge in the middle?

936
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:08,536
<i>- Okay.
- Show me now</i>

937
01:05:08,669 --> 01:05:10,293
<i>Show me how</i>

938
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:13,706
<i>- How it feels when we're together
- Just like that.</i>

939
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:17,210
<i>- I'm afraid if we wait
- Just like that, baby.</i>

940
01:05:17,344 --> 01:05:20,345
<i>We'll be waiting till forever</i>

941
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:22,880
Oh! Jesus!

942
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:27,805
I never could wait
to get to the chewy middle.

943
01:05:27,939 --> 01:05:30,774
- You know what? Let... Let me.
- Oh. Okay.

944
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,478
Goddam!

945
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:37,023
<i>I'm on a rocket ship
to a mother ship</i>

946
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:41,237
<i>I'm flying solo but don't know
if I can stop</i>

947
01:05:41,369 --> 01:05:45,913
<i>Don't ask me why
Don't make me lie</i>

948
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:47,950
<i>Just kick back
Just sit back</i>

949
01:05:48,085 --> 01:05:50,374
<i>Enjoy the ride</i>

950
01:05:53,507 --> 01:05:55,464
<i>'Cause I'm a spaceman</i>

951
01:05:58,846 --> 01:06:01,218
Guess it's been a while.

952
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:04,967
<i>Asking me out
Stay with me</i>

953
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,105
It's very, uh, '70s of you.

954
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:15,568
<i>Stay with me
Tomorrow's just</i>

955
01:06:27,668 --> 01:06:31,535
Oh, yeah. Oh, Bobby!

956
01:06:34,633 --> 01:06:37,504
Come here, Bobby!
I want it now!

957
01:06:37,636 --> 01:06:41,052
Oh, man,
am I fuckin' stoned!

958
01:06:41,182 --> 01:06:43,388
- Yeah, me too, son.
- Hey.

959
01:06:43,517 --> 01:06:45,475
Hey, you guys hear that?

960
01:07:01,995 --> 01:07:03,240
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

961
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:06,622
<i>- Hello?
- What's your favorite scary movie?</i>

962
01:07:14,842 --> 01:07:17,167
I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

963
01:07:24,226 --> 01:07:27,062
Oh, yeah! Oh!

964
01:07:27,188 --> 01:07:29,595
Yeah! What's my name, Bobby?

965
01:07:29,732 --> 01:07:31,274
What?

966
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,935
- What's my name, bitch?
- Ow! God! It's Cindy!

967
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:38,072
Whose is it, Bobby?
Whose is it, Bobby?

968
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:40,192
It's yours.

969
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,821
Oh, my God!

970
01:07:50,504 --> 01:07:55,664
Oh, shit!

971
01:07:58,637 --> 01:08:00,844
<i>Don't even contest
'Cause I'll make you undress</i>

972
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:03,594

974
01:08:06,812 --> 01:08:09,303
<i>Hey, yo, check it, yo.
Fuck a cheap bong</i>

975
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,065
<i>I wanna smoke Cheech and Chong</i>

976
01:08:11,192 --> 01:08:13,813
<i>And if I wanna fuck long
I let my ding-a-long hit the bong</i>

977
01:08:13,945 --> 01:08:16,518
<i>And then the song
Always pass the dutchie to the left</i>

978
01:08:16,656 --> 01:08:18,613
<i>Because the right way is wrong</i>

979
01:08:20,827 --> 01:08:23,365
I got one. I got one. I got one.
Here it goes. Ready?

980
01:08:23,496 --> 01:08:26,248
<i>I'm gonna slash and gash

<i>Peel your foreskin off

985
01:08:38,846 --> 01:08:41,515
Yo!

986
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,427
That was the illest rhyme
I ever seen, son!

987
01:08:47,688 --> 01:08:52,149
Bobby, where were you tonight?

988
01:08:52,276 --> 01:08:55,977
- What?
- I was just curious.

989
01:08:56,113 --> 01:08:59,732
- What took you so long to get here?
- Why are you so curious?

990
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:03,034
I don't know.

991
01:09:03,162 --> 01:09:06,164
I thought it would fit
the '90s horror cliché if...

992
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:08,663
you turned out
to be the killer.

993
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:11,201
Oh, so, what? You think
I killed Buffy and Greg?

994
01:09:12,964 --> 01:09:16,380
Buffy and Greg are dead?

995
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,218
- I thought you knew that.
- Oh, my God!

996
01:09:18,345 --> 01:09:21,512
Bobby, turn around!
It's the killer!

997
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,528
Cindy!

998
01:09:37,657 --> 01:09:41,986
- Oh, my God! Bobby! Bobby!
- Cindy. Help me.

999
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,533
- Bobby, it's okay.
- Gimme the gun. Gimme...

1000
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:49,453
It's gonna be okay, Bobby.

1001
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:53,457
Yo, wait for me!
There's a killer in the house!

1002
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,713
There's ass, blood
and guts everywhere!

1003
01:09:55,842 --> 01:09:59,342
Someone done gone crazy, son!

1004
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:03,599
- We all go a little crazy sometimes.
- Bobby, no!

1005
01:10:03,725 --> 01:10:07,675
Oh, shit, son!

1006
01:10:07,813 --> 01:10:10,814
Oh, my God!

1007
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:13,942
Cindy, he shot me in the lungs.

1008
01:10:15,821 --> 01:10:17,944
You wanna hit this shit?

1009
01:10:22,036 --> 01:10:23,863
Ketchup.

1010
01:10:23,997 --> 01:10:26,535
Just like my mom puts on
her spaghetti, baby.

1011
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:31,621
Oh, my God! Ray, you've gotta help me!
Bobby's gone crazy!

1012
01:10:32,964 --> 01:10:35,087
<i>Surprise!</i>

1013
01:10:35,217 --> 01:10:38,134
<i>Surprise, Cindy!</i>

1014
01:10:50,149 --> 01:10:52,188
Why are you doing this, Bobby?

1015
01:10:52,318 --> 01:10:55,983
Why? Why? You hear that, Ray?

1016
01:10:56,113 --> 01:10:58,604
I think she wants a motive.

1017
01:10:58,741 --> 01:11:01,576
<i>- Did Scream have a plot?
- No.</i>

1018
01:11:01,702 --> 01:11:04,158
<i>Did I Know What You Did Last Summer
make any sense?</i>

1019
01:11:04,288 --> 01:11:08,536
Don't think so! And what about the
sequel? Huh? What the hell was with
that fat, white Jamaican kid?

1020
01:11:08,668 --> 01:11:13,081
- Oh, I wanna kill that motherfucker.
- I know. Me too, man.
- It was bad casting, Bobby.

1021
01:11:13,214 --> 01:11:15,705
How about this for a motive?
Lack of sex!

1022
01:11:15,842 --> 01:11:18,962
It can cause serious
deviant behavior.

1023
01:11:19,095 --> 01:11:22,630
- I thought you loved me.
- Oh, I did, baby.

1024
01:11:22,766 --> 01:11:26,680
I did. But abstinence can make you
discover new things about yourself.

1025
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:29,729
That's right, Cindy. I'm gay.

1026
01:11:29,857 --> 01:11:32,145
And in case you haven't noticed,
so is Ray.

1027
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:36,061
What? I ain't gay.

1028
01:11:36,197 --> 01:11:40,491
- What are you talking about?
You took me to that club.
- So? They play good music.

1029
01:11:40,618 --> 01:11:43,821
- What about our trip
to San Francisco, then?
- I wanted to go shopping.

1030
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:49,164
- But you-you made love to me.
- No. First of all, you sucked my...

1031
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:52,248
Whatever, Ray! I don't want to talk
about this now. The point is, Cindy...

1032
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:56,295
that I'm a new man,
and I'm ready to leave
all this behind and start a new life.

1033
01:11:56,426 --> 01:11:59,961
- So you killed all your friends?
- Oh, no.

1034
01:12:00,096 --> 01:12:02,255
Just you. And maybe Shorty...

1035
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,348
but that wasn't planned
or anything.

1036
01:12:04,476 --> 01:12:06,801
But here's the genius part.

1037
01:12:06,937 --> 01:12:10,271
We're copycatting a serial killer
that already exists.

1038
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:14,183
- It's the perfect crime, Cindy.
- But wait! There's more!

1039
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,562
Hang on to your seat, baby,
'cause this one's a screamer!

1040
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,950
- I'll be back.
- Uh-oh.

1041
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:25,451
Move your big ass.
Come on.

1042
01:12:25,581 --> 01:12:27,870
Dad!

1043
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,622
What are you gonna do, frame him?

1044
01:12:30,753 --> 01:12:34,965
Nah. We're just havin' a little bit
of fun with old daddio.

1045
01:12:35,091 --> 01:12:37,713
The police are gonna find
you and daddy both dead...

1046
01:12:37,844 --> 01:12:41,260
and me and Ray are the only survivors
of a maniac's revenge.

1047
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:43,596
- You ready? I'm ready.
- You ready? I'm ready to do this.

1048
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:45,100
- All right. Let's do this, Ray.
- Let's do this.
I'm ready to do this shit.

1049
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,634
- Come on. Come on. All right.
- All right. All right.

1050
01:12:47,771 --> 01:12:50,096
- Come on! Come on!
- Give it to me. Give it to me. No!

1051
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:53,233
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- All right.

1052
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,519
- Ready? You ready?
All right. Let's do this.
- Wait, wait. Ready.

1053
01:12:55,654 --> 01:12:57,113
- Come on. Come on.
- Ready.

1054
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,781
Come on! Give it to me!
Give it to me!

1055
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:01,659
No! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Just...
You remember what we talked about?

1056
01:13:01,786 --> 01:13:03,743
- I know, man. How many times
we gonna go over this?
- To the side, right?

1057
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:06,113
- I know, okay? Stop. Just... All right.
- Okay. All right. I'm ready.

1058
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:09,499
Trust me, okay? I got this shit.
Ready? Come on.

1059
01:13:09,627 --> 01:13:12,083
- Wait, wait, wait! I just don't know...
- What the fuck!
I'm about to cut your throat, boy!

1060
01:13:12,213 --> 01:13:14,751
- Okay.
- Stop acting like a little girl.
Come on. Come on!

1061
01:13:14,882 --> 01:13:17,587
- You're right, you're right, you're
right, you're right. I'm ready.
- Come on. You ready?

1062
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:23,598
You guys are psychos!
You've seen one too many TV shows!

1063
01:13:23,725 --> 01:13:28,387
No! Watching television shows
doesn't create psycho killers!

1064
01:13:28,522 --> 01:13:30,431
Cancelin' TV shows does!

1065
01:13:30,565 --> 01:13:32,807
<i>The Wayans Brothers
was a good show, man!</i>

1066
01:13:32,943 --> 01:13:37,486
It was a good-ass show,
and we didn't even get a final episode!

1067
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:41,149
Take it easy!
I'm feelin' a little woozy here!

1068
01:13:41,285 --> 01:13:43,657
It's my turn.
Give me the knife.

1069
01:13:43,788 --> 01:13:46,705
Fuck outta here.
Ain't nobody stabbin' me.

1070
01:13:55,383 --> 01:13:57,921
Surprise, Cindy!

1071
01:14:50,857 --> 01:14:53,858
All right, all right.
Hold on a second.

1072
01:14:53,986 --> 01:14:56,524
Just give me a moment.
Ah. One...

1073
01:15:02,202 --> 01:15:04,409
Oh, yeah. That's it.

1074
01:15:04,538 --> 01:15:07,492
Ah. Okay.

1075
01:15:42,453 --> 01:15:45,619
Dad! Are you okay?

1076
01:15:45,748 --> 01:15:48,618
I thought I told you
not to have a party unless I was here.

1077
01:15:48,751 --> 01:15:51,206
But, Dad, you were here.
You were in the closet.

1078
01:15:51,337 --> 01:15:54,788
Oh, yeah, that's right. Did you get some
girlfriends' numbers for me?

1079
01:15:54,924 --> 01:15:57,960
- Dad, they're dead.
- Ah, you know, I can't get a break.

1080
01:15:58,094 --> 01:16:00,466
What's that? Is that the cops?

1081
01:16:00,596 --> 01:16:03,134
Okay, okay, listen, honey.
Help me up now.

1082
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:06,350
Uh... Uh... Uh... If the cops come,
tell 'em I'm a plumber, okay?

1083
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:10,226
You had a leaky faucet, and you
called, and they sent me over.
We don't even know each other.

1084
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,522
No! No!

1085
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,651
Dad, Dad, put your arms down.

1086
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,410
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- Sheriff, it's a bloodbath in there.

1087
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,865
- He was right here! I swear it!
- Who was?

1088
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:32,785
The killer!
The guy that murdered all my friends!

1089
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:36,421
And the sick bastard planted drugs
all in the house there.

1090
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,505
- All over the place.
- Dad. Stop it.

1091
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:42,424
All right, Cindy. I'm gonna
have to take you down to the station.

1092
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,384
I'm cool, though, right?

1093
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,474
- I'm okay?
- Let's... Let's go, Cindy.

1094
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:50,814
Cindy. Call me. Call me.

1095
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,399
Daddy'll get you out, honey.

1096
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:58,858
Okay. Let's go over this again.

1097
01:17:11,337 --> 01:17:13,329
- You say it was an accident.
- Yes.

1098
01:17:13,464 --> 01:17:16,584
- He was on the road.
- And you think he came back
to get revenge?

1099
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:19,552
It has to be him, Sheriff.

1100
01:17:25,268 --> 01:17:27,225
Here, Sheriff.
They wanted me to give this to you.

1101
01:17:27,353 --> 01:17:30,105
- That'll be all, Doofy.
- Okay.

1102
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:32,901
- I'm gonna go, then.
- All right.
- All right.

1103
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:35,979
Bye, Cind.

1104
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,571
I'm sorry, Cindy.
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

1105
01:17:41,702 --> 01:17:45,071
His name was David Keegan.
Some fishermen found his body
a few weeks later.

1106
01:17:45,205 --> 01:17:48,657
- He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
- That's impossible.

1107
01:17:50,627 --> 01:17:53,415
- Then I don't know who it could be.
- He's gotta be someone...

1108
01:17:53,547 --> 01:17:56,217
who was connected with all the victims,
someone who knew about the accident.

1109
01:17:56,342 --> 01:17:59,627
Someone who could move around
without being noticed.

1110
01:18:01,973 --> 01:18:05,093
Oh, my God.

1111
01:18:05,226 --> 01:18:10,102
She used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.
He had the biggest crush on her.

1112
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:12,271
It's me, Cind.

1113
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,681
'Night, Cind.

1114
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:19,690
- Doofy!
- Shithead?

1115
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:24,026
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No.

1116
01:18:24,162 --> 01:18:25,657
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

1117
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:27,829
- Has anybody seen Doofy?
- No.

1118
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:30,959
- Yeah. Just went out the back, Sheriff.
- Doofy!

1119
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:48,553
<i>He walks alone
under the big city lights</i>

1120
01:18:48,688 --> 01:18:52,022
<i>He always knows
just when the time is right</i>

1121
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:55,898
<i>He never shows what he's thinking
He keeps it inside</i>

1122
01:18:56,029 --> 01:18:59,694
<i>Because he's too cool for school</i>

1123
01:18:59,824 --> 01:19:02,909
<i>He comes alive
when the sun goes down</i>

1124
01:19:03,036 --> 01:19:06,904
<i>He gets it right
You know he's always down</i>

1125
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,492
<i>He's got one eye open
and his ear to the ground</i>

1126
01:19:10,627 --> 01:19:13,545
<i>And he's too cool for school</i>

1127
01:19:15,341 --> 01:19:18,792
<i>He's an operator
He's a real player</i>

1128
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:22,427
<i>And if you mess with him
you know you'll never win</i>

1129
01:19:22,556 --> 01:19:27,432
No!

1130
01:19:42,827 --> 01:19:45,153
Shit, son. Yo, what the deal?

1131
01:19:45,288 --> 01:19:47,993
Yo, if y'all watchin'
this tape right now...

1132
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,082
that means I didn't make it.

1133
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:54,125
Either I'm a prisoner,
or worse, dead.

1134
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:58,468
But either way it goes,
I'm gonna tell you all the rules
to survive this situation.

1135
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:01,714
Rule number one:
You gotta be quick.

1136
01:20:01,847 --> 01:20:05,051
Rule number two:
Don't fall down.

1137
01:20:05,184 --> 01:20:10,392
And rule number three:
Whatever you do, never look back.

1138
01:20:10,523 --> 01:20:12,397
Y'all wish me luck.

1139
