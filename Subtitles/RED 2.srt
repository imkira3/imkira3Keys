2
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,201
- Baby, check this out.
- A power washer?

3
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,967
We need one of these.

4
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,161
Yeah.

5
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,442
- On the patio in the backyard.
- Yeah.

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
Should we go look
at those window treatments?

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,641
No.

8
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,524
Do you want one of these hotdogs?

9
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,007
They're very good.

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,966
Baby, you are a heck of a homemaker.

11
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,331
You know that?
But we could just go to dinner.

12
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,086
Well, you know,

13
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,681
if you don't make it...

14
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,723
You don't eat it.

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,565
You know what? That's a great idea.
What if I make you dinner?

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,724
I'm gonna go and get that, uh, grill.
The big shiny one.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,128
Will you get us some shrimp?
The big jumbo kind.

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,441
Four down. Three over.

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,406
Come back and find me down here. In tools.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,843
What the hell are you doing here?

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,764
You ignored my messages.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,206
I am happy.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,481
You're desperate.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,570
- I can make this work.
- Frank, you're playing house.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,562
Look, I'm retired, okay.
I'm happy. We are happy.

26
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,445
Frank... Frank...

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,121
You haven't killed anybody in months.

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,607
That is not a bad thing, okay?

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,882
That's a positive thing
for a lot of people.

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,811
Kemosabe, I need you.
They're coming. I can feel it.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,365
You are driving me nuts, Marvin.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,881
Listen, if it makes you feel better,
bring the girl.

33
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,119
I'm not gonna bring the girl anywhere,
all right?

34
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,799
Don't bring the girl where?

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,848
Oh, we're just catching up.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,799
Marvin's here. I just bumped into Marvin.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,926
Where are we going?

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,371
No, come on. They're gonna close.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,040
Good to see you, Marvin.

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,008
- Good to see you.
- Frank.

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,801
You know you want to.

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,445
- No.
- Come on.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,086
Last chance, Frank.

44
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,170
I'm taking Sarah home.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,566
Stay safe.

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,686
- Well, I really wanted to be...
- Of course, it is, honey.

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,645
You are never gonna be
in danger ever again.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,769
We don't even know what happened.

49
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,685
We don't know who's in there.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,445
How am I gonna protect you?

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,125
Hey. He was your best friend.

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,526
Okay?

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,606
Come on.

54
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,721
Wow.

55
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,930
He still looks so lifelike.

56
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,919
He's not dead.

57
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,003
Honey, don't do that.
Just let your feelings out. Don't...

58
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,645
No. Really.

59
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,531
He does this a lot.

60
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,686
Really?

61
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,365
No, come on. Give me the pin.
Give me the pin.

62
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,519
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go sit down. Come on.

63
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,799
- Come on.
- I should kiss him.

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,802
Yeah, go ahead. Do you want to?

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,809
Let's go sit down. Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

66
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,808
At this time, we'll open
the floor to anyone

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,130
who wishes to say a few words
about the deceased.

68
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,839
Babe...

69
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,001
Share a memory, perhaps?

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,289
Perhaps, a poem. A song lyric.

71
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,886
Anyone?

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,281
You can do it.

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,201
Sir?

74
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,802
Marvin was

75
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,201
different.

76
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,881
He was

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,571
a very good shot.

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,485
Some would say that

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,847
he was paranoid.

80
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,719
But you have to expect a little of that
when the CIA's dosing you with LSD

81
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,087
for a little more than a decade.

82
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,129
He could wire a bomb

83
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,802
faster than anybody I ever met.

84
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,764
The good people of Moldova will always

85
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,011
be in Marvin's debt.

86
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,089
He was a really good friend.

87
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,971
Really good.

88
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,445
I'm gonna miss him.

89
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,766
Gonna miss him.

90
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,450
- We have to move.
- Canada?

91
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,849
High ground. Good kill zones.
It's a little farm.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,049
- A farm? Like, to farm on?
- Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,651
Like, with crops?

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,331
Yeah. It could be fun.

95
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,090
Listen, babe...

96
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,841
You know they say it's really
important not to make big...

97
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,204
life-altering decisions right after a loss.

98
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,086
If they can get to Marvin,
they can get to you and they can get to me.

99
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,731
Who are they?

100
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,039
Go to the safe house.

101
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,849
Look at me. Go to the safe house.

102
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,883
I'll come find you, okay?

103
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,645
- I'm not leaving you.
- Listen...

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,161
It'll be all right.

105
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,439
What is it?

106
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,487
Mr. Moses...

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,287
They want to debrief you
at a Yankee White facility.

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,720
Is that your sniper?

109
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,201
You're flagged Retired Extremely Dangerous.

110
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,079
Hi, there.

111
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,447
Um, my client Frank Moses is here.

112
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,679
He's an American citizen being detained
illegally without due process.

113
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,599
- You know what? That is a lovely blazer.
- Oh, thank you.

114
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,719
You're welcome.

115
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,119
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

116
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,519
But let me get Mr. Snyder for you.

117
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,646
Thank you.

118
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,599
How can I help you?

119
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,119
- Oh, hi, there. I'm sorry. What is your name?
- John Snyder.

120
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,599
John. You know what? I
didn't get your name.

121
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,399
- Oh, it's Kelly.
- Hi, Kelly.

122
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,441
John...

123
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,530
John... John!

124
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,119
Unless you want to end up like Kelly,

125
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,726
I suggest you tell me where
Frank Moses is right now.

126
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,847
Now!

127
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,799
In interrogation.

128
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,086
Ah!

129
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,647
I got a document right here that says that
you have a special interest in the Cold War.

130
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,684
We know that back in the day,
you spent an awful lotta time in Russia.

131
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,164
I just need to know what you
know about Project Nightshade.

132
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,239
I really don't know anything about it.

133
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,011
What the hell is that?

134
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,800
Small arms gunfire, 200 yards.

135
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,401
Watch him.

136
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,446
100 yards.

137
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,131
They're coming to kill us.

138
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,091
Get me outta these cuffs.

139
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,611
I can't do that, sir.

140
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,320
You have the key, right?

141
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,600
Hands up!

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,047
50 feet.

143
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,080
They're gonna kill us both,
if you don't get me outta these cuffs.

144
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,321
Come on.

145
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,363
Frank Moses.

146
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,563
You know, coming up through
the ranks, you were my hero.

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,959
Given enough time, I guess everyone cracks.

148
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,961
Huh, Frank?

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,359
- Who are you?
- Me?

150
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,361
Mmm-hmm.

151
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,087
I'm the guy the government
hires to get information.

152
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,447
And I'm allowed to use any
form of torture I deem fit.

153
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,010
And I will torture Sarah until you speak.

154
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,441
Speaking of Sarah, I love watching her

155
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,530
shave her legs in the tub.

156
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,801
Kinda reminds me of these Belgian mercs
I met in the Congo.

157
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,324
They would skin people alive
to get them to talk.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,410
And do you know where they started?

159
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,201
Guess.

160
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,449
At the ankles. Just like your Sarah.

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,047
So...

162
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,811
You either give me the information
that I need to know...

163
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,605
Or I'm gonna fillet your girl
from head to toe with no mercy.

164
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,520
Awesome.

165
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,121
Wow.

166
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,767
Pretty good for a retired guy.
But are you...

167
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,039
1-2-3-4-5-6...

168
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,122
7-on-1 cuffed with no weapon good?

169
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,321
Son of a...

170
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,522
Go. Go, go, go!

171
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,565
Shoot him, but don't kill him.

172
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,203
All right, kill him. Spray it up.

173
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,204
Frank, this is your last chance.

174
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,640
Fire.

175
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,006
Get in there! Go!

176
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,845
Shit.

177
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,081
Marvin!

178
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,206
- You're driving me crazy!
- I brought the key.

179
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,205
You faked your death.

180
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,283
- Gotta go.
- Let's go.

181
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,761
Gotta go.

182
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,642
You have no idea
what you put me through!

183
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,919
Oh! Thank God, you're okay.

184
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,921
No!

185
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,761
- What are you doing here?
- Marvin brought me. From the house.

186
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,079
Has everybody lost their mind?

187
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,687
- Marv, you don't bring a girl like that here.
- I had to see if you were okay, didn't I?

188
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,359
Honey!

189
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,169
I thought...
What?

190
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,842
Remember when we had that conversation
about how you were gonna lay low?

191
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,883
You don't get to tell me when to lay.

192
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,050
I mean, I'm not saying that.

193
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,164
Stop. Just don't. Just don't... No.

194
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,125
- You're mad at me now?
- You treat me like a China doll.

195
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,679
Frank, can I give you
a little advice about women?

196
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,841
No! Absolutely not!

197
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,039
Listen, you gotta ask yourself,

198
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,079
what is a girl like that
doing with a guy like you?

199
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,844
It ain't for your looks.

200
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,884
You know, I will shoot you.
I will shoot you in the liver.

201
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,119
Adventure, romance, danger,
activities you can share as a couple.

202
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,043
It's about you lying to me.

203
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,447
Frank...

204
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,364
I was very touched that you cried
at my funeral.

205
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,766
That's not true.

206
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,924
I didn't cry at your funeral.

207
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,050
I'm no crier.

208
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,927
Ninety-six hours ago,
somebody posted a document on the Internet

209
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,489
that said you and I took part in an
operation called Nightshade back in '79.

210
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,559
That's why you fake died?

211
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,086
Yeah. The chatter went through the roof.

212
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,359
So everybody's after you
for something they think you know

213
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,362
that you don't even know at all?

214
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,759
Oh, my God! Spiders!

215
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,366
Honey, you need to go to ground
and it's best I don't know where.

216
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,199
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

217
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,524
- Cash only. No calls. No contacts.
- Thanks. Look...

218
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,879
I'm not hanging out in some bunker
while you slink around and save the planet

219
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,439
with dusky international femme fatales.

220
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,599
- Dusky?
- Dark, smoldering.

221
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,250
I know what it means, Marvin.

222
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,639
It's hard to be the kinda person
I have to be right now

223
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,281
and do the kinda things that I'm going
to have to do while you're here.

224
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,130
This is gonna be good for us.

225
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,879
What are we doing?

226
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,999
Let's face it, Columbo,
things were getting a little stale.

227
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,119
Wow. Mommy just slapped Daddy
at the dinner table.

228
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,839
Is there a human being
in the trunk?

229
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,887
Yeah.

230
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,645
Who is it, Marvin?

231
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,802
He's a Senior Director of
Military Intelligence.

232
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,208
I've been caramelizing his onions
for a couple of days.

233
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
Caramelizing how?

234
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,323
With three tabs of acid and a lot of rats.

235
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,411
Dang!

236
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,366
Eleven people dead. Five FBI.
And the SecDef wants a briefing?

237
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,649
You were brought in to contain this.

238
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,801
Calm down.

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,162
I can't believe this is coming back on me
after so many years.

240
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,639
General, Moses and Boggs
have been completely isolated.

241
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,679
The FBI is seeking them for the murders.

242
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,889
Homeland has been informed that they
are officially domestic terrorists.

243
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,359
Is that gonna work?

244
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,407
Yes.

245
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,639
The problem is with that document
surfacing on the Internet,

246
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,086
all the players will be
coming after Nightshade.

247
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,404
It'll open the book on this.

248
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,208
I'm calling SecDef. We need to go public.

249
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
General...

250
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,850
Nobody's going public.

251
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,640
We need a new plan for Moses.

252
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,723
I need you to approve a specialist.

253
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,159
What? CIA?

254
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,891
It's been tried, sir.
Didn't work so well for those guys.

255
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,719
Han Cho Bai. He's the best.

256
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,767
Do it.

257
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,246
Suit, too.

258
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,011
Okay, he's clean.

259
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,841
Seriously?

260
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,883
Sit down, Mr. Han.

261
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,442
Your security is impressive.

262
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,803
A business associate.

263
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,771
Julio Alvarez Fernandes.

264
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,531
Very difficult to get close to.

265
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,171
Of course, it must appear like an accident.

266
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,159
Not a problem. Except for one thing.

267
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,286
Mmm?

268
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,567
Mr. Fernandes pays better.

269
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,927
Yeah?

270
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,361
<i>Who's the target?</i>

271
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,086
Oh, it's an old pal of yours. Frank Moses.

272
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,608
Karma's a bitch, Frank.

273
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,360
What is this?

274
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,519
There's a watchword flag
on a WikiLeaks document.

275
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,682
It's coded Priority One Alpha Seven.

276
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,041
- Something called Nightshade.
- Shut up!

277
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,921
Get out.

278
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,247
Find me Victoria Winslow.

279
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,764
Director Philips?

280
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,525
Um...

281
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,969
I'm with someone right now.

282
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,250
Keeping busy, I see.

283
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,242
Idle hands do the Devil's work.

284
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,361
Yes.

285
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,599
I understand you can get close
to Frank Moses.

286
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,601
Yes.

287
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,042
MI6 has a job for you.

288
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,926
If you want to stay alive,
you're going to accept it.

289
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,604
It's time to choose sides, Victoria.

290
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,041
Where do they
teach you guys this stuff?

291
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,599
Manuals, mostly.

292
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,011
Mmm.

293
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,121
Some of this stuff you just can't teach.

294
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,721
Wow.

295
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,370
Isn't this cool?

296
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,969
We're on a mission together.

297
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,119
Do you have any idea how many people
are trying to kill us right now?

298
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,639
You and I both know
that this is where you belong.

299
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,519
Right here. In the thick of it.

300
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,522
Pussy Cat's right, Frank.

301
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,206
Here we go.

302
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,486
Watch your step.

303
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,086
What?

304
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,527
Oh.

305
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,451
Come on!

306
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,127
- Where did you get this?
- Um... Marvin.

307
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,879
- You gave her a gun?
- It is America, Frank.

308
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,804
Everyone else has a gun.

309
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,849
She has no idea what to do with this.

310
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,319
I know exactly what to do with it.

311
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,765
Ow!

312
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,006
You don't give fire to a kitten.

313
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,167
Why don't you just give her
some dynamite, Marvin?

314
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,328
No external safety on the Sig?

315
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,610
Tell him what you told me.

316
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,239
At the height of the Cold War,

317
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,879
Nightshade was cooked up
by a rogue US general

318
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,519
as a first strike capability
against the Soviets.

319
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,249
- That's it. Can I go?
- That's it?

320
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,679
- You want a little pepper with that?
- No, okay! At the height of the Cold War,

321
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,839
a megaton-yield device
was smuggled into Moscow

322
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,039
in diplomatic pouches, piece by piece,
and then the weapon was lost. That's it.

323
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,804
You lost a nuke in Moscow?

324
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,651
The scientist was Edward Bailey. That's it.

325
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,121
What?

326
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,525
I made a mistake.

327
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,159
Edward Bailey was a genius physicist
who built some of the greatest stuff

328
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,519
during the Cold War.

329
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,606
Neutron bombs, particle beam weapons,
nerve gas. Excellent nerve gas.

330
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,319
He was a rock star of
conceptual mass killing.

331
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,402
They called him "The Da Vinci of Death."

332
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,239
We were the security detail assigned to
getting him in and out of Moscow safely.

333
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,366
What happened?

334
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,641
We thought he was secure.
The Soviets got him with a car bomb.

335
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,011
It was my fault.

336
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,601
He's dead.

337
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,805
Run or fight?

338
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,279
All we've got is this
WikiLeaks page off the Internet.

339
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,001
Out of a Paris IP.

340
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,130
Hmm. Paris could be anybody.

341
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,610
Wait. Wait. Scroll back down for a second.

342
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,163
- What is that?
- Oh.

343
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,727
Uh...

344
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,840
Coffee stain?

345
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,606
Mmm. Wine.

346
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,921
Frog.

347
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,039
What?

348
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,921
We're okay.

349
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,721
Your number.

350
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,439
Yeah.

351
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,239
MI6 has just given me a
contract to kill you.

352
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,279
Apparently, you're guilty
of nuclear terrorism, murder,

353
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,965
and you're number one
on Interpol's Most Wanted.

354
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,479
What did you say?

355
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,679
<i>Oh, I said "Yes. "</i>

356
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,199
You know, the money's good.

357
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,120
And anyway, if I don't do it,
somebody else will.

358
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,279
<i>Oh, and you should know the Americans
are sending someone also.</i>

359
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,281
Who?

360
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,761
Han.

361
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,719
It's bad, isn't it?

362
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,959
- Is that Marvin?
- Yes. And Sarah.

363
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,319
<i>Aw! Send them my love, will you?</i>

364
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,840
They're driving me crazy.

365
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,839
Marvin gave her a gun.

366
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,559
- Was it loaded?
- Yes! Yes!

367
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,119
Are you being controlling?

368
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,531
No!

369
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,808
<i>You have to take chances in a relationship.</i>

370
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,605
You have to be supportive.

371
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,559
I don't need her to fit in.
I just need her to be safe.

372
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,722
<i>Just rent</i> Dirty Dancing,
<i>tell her you love her.</i>

373
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,126
You know, it's important to enjoy life
while you still can.

374
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,605
Victoria just accepted a contract from MI6
to kill all three of us.

375
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,639
You don't think she'd do that, do you?
Frank, you don't think she'd do that?

376
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,039
She's a friend.

377
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,919
Frank, what, are you stupid? You never
took a contract out to kill a friend?

378
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,241
She called to give us fair warning.

379
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,206
Come on. There's one more thing.

380
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,399
Han just went number one.

381
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,999
Why don't they just
dip our balls in honey

382
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,526
and stake us to an ant farm?

383
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,807
Come on.

384
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,931
Whoa! Crazy old bastard.

385
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,279
Frank, do you feel old?

386
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,319
- Not really.
- Me neither.

387
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,639
I mean, crazy sometimes, I guess.

388
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,880
Who's Han?

389
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,806
Who's Han?

390
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,601
Korean. Counter-intel.

391
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,599
Frank put him in jail for a few years.

392
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,399
We should be super-scared of him, huh?

393
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,609
Yes. He is the best contract
killer in the world.

394
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,007
I've got a hit off an old alias,
silent for almost 20 years.

395
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,799
He's dodging watch lists.

396
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,601
Bingo. Private flight to Paris
scheduled for 0900 out of Teterboro.

397
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,165
Find their hotel. Get blueprints and
workups on the day and night managers.

398
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,087
Have Vance meet us on the ground.

399
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,527
They're one floor down. Two adjoining rooms.
Surveillance is almost up and running.

400
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,926
This is going to be
easier than I thought.

401
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,961
Hello. Speaking.

402
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,087
Yes.

403
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,959
- Where are they?
- They were here.

404
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,450
They ordered room service at 1:00.

405
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,720
What do you mean,
"The plane is prepped"?

406
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,444
I think someone stole your plane.

407
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,926
I'm really going to enjoy killing him.

408
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,723
Get me a gun that really hurts.

409
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,330
So how good is this guy?

410
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,729
Han is the best contract
killer in the world.

411
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,323
Let's just say that Frank
is in some very, very deep dog doo.

412
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,879
- He's not gonna kill me.
- Yeah.

413
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,879
- Nobody kills Frank Moses.
- Right!

414
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,679
The people he really doesn't like,
he tortures for a long time first.

415
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,999
Can we just focus
on trying to catch The Frog?

416
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,159
Okay. What's the action plan
for target acquisition and rendition?

417
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,241
Marvin?

418
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,169
Quit teaching her stuff!

419
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,401
Nice.

420
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,799
What do you think the most expensive
bottle of wine in the world costs?

421
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,159
Chateau d'Yquem 1847.

422
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,959
Maybe five, six, maybe, bottles left
in the world. It's pretty pricey.

423
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,009
Maybe we should get a bottle of that wine
and try to catch The Frog with it.

424
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,725
My God, this is so romantic!

425
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,365
Come here. Keep your head down.

426
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,283
But we have to go to the
Ile Saint-Louis for gelato.

427
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,527
I don't think so.

428
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,649
Really? What about the...

429
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,959
- Frank, is that...
- Mmm-hmm.

430
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,405
Hello, Frank.

431
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,479
- Have you seen her since?
- Nope.

432
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,244
God, I've missed you.

433
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,881
Who is she?

434
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,441
Trouble.

435
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,002
How are things?

436
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,882
Yeah, Frank, how are things?

437
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,839
Sarah...

438
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,645
This is Katja.

439
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,365
Yeah. Hi.

440
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,882
I need to speak with you. Immediately.

441
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,890
What the hell was that?

442
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,999
Katja Petrokovich.
Russian Counter-Intelligence.

443
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,399
I think we should hear what she has to say.

444
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,526
Frank...

445
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,039
You don't know the half of it.
She and Frank were young.

446
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,681
And he didn't have the slightest idea
she was working for the Russians.

447
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,362
She's Frank Moses' kryptonite.

448
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,966
I like you with no hair, Frank.

449
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,529
Bald men are so sexy. Virile.

450
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,007
Wow.

451
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,839
She's cute.

452
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,002
Where did you find her? Nebraska?

453
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,602
- Kansas.
- Kansas.

454
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,886
So what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

455
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,359
I would like to believe
that the US didn't plant

456
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,682
a weapon of mass-destruction in Moscow.
But I don't.

457
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,359
Why are you in Paris?

458
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,362
We come every fall for Strike Season

459
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,284
- and for the weather.
- Oh?

460
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,650
Well, the US seems to think
you're nuclear terrorists.

461
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,766
Russia wants complete access.

462
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,644
You agree now or I'll hand you over
to the US government.

463
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,888
Can't we just kill her?

464
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,641
Excuse me for one second.
Can I talk to you?

465
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,247
- What? Oh. Uh-huh. Sure thing.
- Come here for a minute.

466
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,399
- You know, I was shocked.
- I got it.

467
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,920
Yeah, I know. She was kinda counting
your teeth with her tongue.

468
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,919
A little, yeah.

469
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,251
Can she go now?

470
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,484
We don't really have a choice.
We need her to help us.

471
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,121
I promise there is nothing between us.

472
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,719
No, sir. This guy's not giving us anything.

473
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,290
Website's been scrubbed.

474
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,959
NSA intercepted a dispatch
to the Kremlin from Paris.

475
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,759
Moses is going after someone
called "The Frog."

476
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,686
The Frog.

477
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,091
So they call him "The Frog"
because he's French?

478
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,690
No.

479
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,330
No, he poisoned the water supply
at KGB headquarters

480
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,167
with the Amazon tree frog poison.

481
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,770
He must have been wiping
those little tree humpers for years.

482
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,203
Incapacitated 1,600 people and left
with every secret we had.

483
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,207
You know, the guy makes a fortune
selling information.

484
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,846
He knows so much
even the US won't touch him.

485
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,487
The hard part is gonna be taking him alive.

486
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,399
- Superb.
- Wine is wine.

487
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,641
I want to buy American
air defense protocols.

488
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,999
Why is it terrorists
never appreciate Burgundy?

489
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,479
Look, I don't think you know

490
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,639
who you're dealing with.

491
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,687
Shh! <i>Excusez-moi.</i>

492
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,521
Hmm.

493
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,369
Confirmed. It's him. It's The Frog.

494
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,884
<i>Just don't look at him, right?</i>

495
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,401
Well, just act natural.

496
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,399
And whatever you do,
don't look him right in the eyes.

497
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,811
Check.

498
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,206
Remember,
don't look right at him.

499
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,281
Idiot!

500
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,649
- Marvin, you all right?
- Yeah.

501
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,966
All right. Get her outta here.

502
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,406
- When?
- Now!

503
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,401
Get a car!

504
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,601
Is that...

505
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,161
Cut them off!

506
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,205
This is not a good idea!

507
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,720
She's not gonna get there first!

508
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,887
Sidewalk!

509
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,641
- Yes!
- No!

510
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,921
Yes!

511
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,522
Happy trans, bozo!

512
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,162
Don't you think we should let...

513
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,203
Shut your pie hole, Marvin!

514
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,641
Don't you think we should let...

515
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,841
Hush!

516
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,561
Incoming!

517
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,043
Bastard! Sidewalk!

518
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,041
What the...

519
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,725
She's fine.

520
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,721
Got him.

521
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,360
What are you doing?

522
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,366
Got him.

523
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,123
Look! What is she doing?

524
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,241
I'm begging...

525
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,486
Yeah, yeah. I got this.

526
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,440
I so got this.

527
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,122
I hate her so much.

528
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,408
You're wasting your time!

529
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,367
You're going to regret this
more than you can possibly imagine.

530
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,851
Hey.

531
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,481
You know who we are?

532
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,770
Yes, of course.

533
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,405
Tell us about Nightshade.

534
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:05,479
You think I'm going to roll over for you
hegemonic Mickey Mouse-loving Americans?

535
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,164
Leave Mickey out of it.

536
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,279
1947 Petrus?

537
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,089
Yes. That one's rather...

538
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,841
God's sake!

539
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,999
1945.

540
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,764
Wait, wait, wait! That bottle...

541
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,159
How do we find it?

542
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,563
Never! Nightshade was the plot of lunatics.

543
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,639
I used to be like you.
Driven by ideology and fear

544
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,688
with no love of what's
beautiful in the world.

545
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,851
I can't trust animals like you!

546
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,685
Do what you will.

547
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,681
Death is easy.

548
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,530
It's not about the destination.
It's about the journey.

549
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,603
Death is an art form in Russia.

550
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,643
There are so many ways
to take a man to bits.

551
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,724
Shall we start with a Chechen facelift?
Hold him down!

552
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,359
Stop! Stop it!

553
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,919
This is how we do it.

554
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,323
Please. You're so brave.

555
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,879
But you have to understand

556
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,602
we're doing this for the right reasons.
And this...

557
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,569
This isn't worth your life.

558
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,248
You must have something to live for.

559
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,360
Art.

560
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,680
Wine.

561
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,839
Women?

562
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,921
Hey.

563
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,126
Help us.

564
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,764
We need this information.

565
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,488
You'll be helping us save the world.
Please.

566
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,763
Mmm.

567
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,966
You, I'll help.

568
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,131
Excuse me.

569
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,681
Thank you.

570
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,885
And you can suck it.

571
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,679
Baby? Honey?

572
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,127
Seriously? You hooked up with that?

573
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,120
What a woman.

574
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,969
Is that the same dress?

575
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,810
They look the same to you?

576
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,843
No one ever called me
Frank Moses' kryptonite.

577
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,199
Frank's crazy about you.

578
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,885
I've never seen him afraid
of anything except losing you.

579
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,643
What if I'm ruining his life?

580
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,489
Frank is a very simple creature
with very simple needs.

581
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,690
Okay? It's killing,

582
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,011
eating,

583
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,166
sexting,

584
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,846
eating...

585
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,927
Killing, I guess.

586
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,687
What's your point?

587
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,410
I can't believe you kissed The Frog.

588
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,326
Well, I've kissed a lotta frogs.

589
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,679
- I got something for ya.
- What is it?

590
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,524
The key to The Frog's security deposit box.

591
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,367
- From?
- Credit Lyonnais.

592
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,767
Baby, I have a request.

593
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,765
Uh-huh.

594
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,525
How would you feel about
going out to dinner with me tonight?

595
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,329
- Hmm.
- It is Paris, after all.

596
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

597
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,608
Stay here. I'll be right back.

598
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,571
I need you, Frank.

599
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,090
It's not a good time.

600
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,530
One of our old assets
has some real information.

601
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,764
He needs to meet with us right now.

602
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,801
Nah.

603
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,924
Frank, what are you doing? She's kryptonite.
What are you doing?

604
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,282
- I'll handle it.
- Are you sure?

605
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,607
Yeah.

606
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,279
It's not okay. It's just some work.

607
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,126
- No, it's not fun.
- Go. You and Svetlana, you work it out.

608
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,769
I promise you that I will be back
in time for dinner.

609
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,121
I'll be back.

610
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,761
Keep her safe.

611
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,609
What happened to us, Frank?

612
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,371
- Well...
- Hmm.

613
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,130
You betrayed me.

614
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,244
You set me up. Tried to kill me.

615
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,765
I tried to kill you.

616
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,201
They were good times, weren't they?

617
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,799
You know, if you'd asked me
to betray my country,

618
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,801
you know I would have.

619
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,200
Yes, madam.

620
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,281
My God.

621
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,849
You know, I looked you up once.

622
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,480
You were in a bungalow in Los Angeles.

623
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,362
There were roses out in front.

624
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,524
But I lost my nerve.

625
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,843
So what do you want?

626
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,687
It was all about work
with you, Frank. Rules.

627
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,531
Not rules.

628
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,526
Right and wrong.

629
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,406
You know, it's harder for me
not to follow orders.

630
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,767
Despite my personal feelings.

631
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,924
But feelings don't matter
any more than right or wrong.

632
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,047
Orders matter.

633
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,891
Orders?

634
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,882
Russia will handle things from here.

635
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,569
I'm taking the key, Frank.

636
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,204
I can't let that happen.

637
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,846
No?

638
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,045
I can't feel my arms.

639
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,605
Enjoy Kansas.

640
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,086
Hmm.

641
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,966
He's out.

642
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,050
He might be awake.

643
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,770
Oh, good. So he can feel it.

644
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:35,770
Did you ever, ever in your entire career
let yourself get drugged?

645
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,764
You still like her!

646
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,559
And now she has the key!

647
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,609
She doesn't have the key. She has a key.

648
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,121
What?

649
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,126
I knew she would play him
like a banjo at an Ozark hoedown.

650
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,283
So I have the key.

651
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,966
Water.

652
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,165
How long was I out for?

653
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,165
Some of it's his.

654
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,045
<i>Et tu</i>, Marvin?

655
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,487
Style is the only constant in life, Frank.

656
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,483
We didn't come to Paris on vacation.

657
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,050
Oh. Shopping's what I thought
you did in Paris

658
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,964
with your boyfriend's money

659
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,850
while you're waiting for him

660
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,959
to wake up from being taken down

661
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,679
by his skanky, slutty,
Russian biatch ex-girlfriend.

662
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,159
So thanks. Thanks.
Thanks for the compliment for the fur.

663
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,999
For telling me that I look nice in my dress.
It makes me feel really good.

664
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,685
And it makes me feel
very loving towards you also.

665
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,639
Why is she doing this to me?

666
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,244
We can get a taxi over here.

667
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,079
Frank, listen, I gotta tell you something.

668
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,722
You have to start to learn to share
your feelings to evolve your relationship.

669
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,519
Even if it seems uncomfortable at first.

670
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,359
Say you're pinned down in a firefight.

671
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,967
If you stay where you are,
you're gonna die. Okay?

672
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,039
So, you tell me, what do you do?

673
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,359
Make the run.

674
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:29,163
Yes. You have got to make the run
to emotional safety.

675
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,841
Huh.

676
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,559
You dead yet, Moses?

677
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,641
Not yet.

678
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,639
Where's my plane?

679
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,846
In my ass!

680
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,126
- It's in an airport outside of Paris.
- What are you... Shut up!

681
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,291
Let's get outta here.

682
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,525
- Marvin?
- Yeah?

683
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,688
Is that a stick of dynamite in your pocket?

684
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,242
Yeah, but I'm saving it for an emergency.

685
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,442
Well, this is kind of
an emergency, isn't it?

686
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,839
The key I gave her is connected to
a particularly nasty terrorist cell

687
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,842
and their safe deposit box.

688
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,164
The French take this
kinda thing pretty seriously.

689
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,806
That's enough.

690
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,879
Put me down! Put me down now!

691
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,801
All right.

692
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,526
We gotta move quickly,
Moscow will have her out within the hour.

693
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,047
For the love of Mike.

694
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,646
All right.

695
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,050
I'm still not talking to you.

696
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,802
All right. This is an MI6
report on Project Nightshade.

697
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,210
It's about the operative
that placed the device.

698
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,722
They took him into custody
and put him on ICE.

699
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,399
What's ICE?

700
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,009
Incarcerate, Cannot Execute.
Who would they keep on ICE for 32 years?

701
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,362
- Come on. Gotta go.
- Come on where? Oh!

702
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,521
How could she have possibly found us?

703
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,603
'Cause I called her
and told her we were coming.

704
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,764
I couldn't take the
pressure of not knowing.

705
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,607
Why isn't she shooting at us?

706
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,648
That should buy us 24 hours.

707
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,809
Hello, sweetie.

708
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,801
You know, the next time
you two make a plan like this,

709
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,360
you could at least let me in on it.

710
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,679
Frank, you're compromising me.

711
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,366
Who knows what some girl
is gonna squeeze out of you?

712
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,729
Where'd you get the bodies?

713
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,651
My freezer.

714
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,370
Come on. Wake up.

715
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,839
Yeah?

716
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,999
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

717
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,319
- Sir?
<i>- Get anything from The Frog?</i>

718
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,847
No, he took some sorta poison
before we really talked.

719
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,045
I don't think he's gonna say anything now.

720
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,839
<i>You've got to find Moses and Boggs.</i>

721
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,490
Mmm. Mmm.

722
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,367
Don't worry. I'm on the trail.

723
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,200
<i>On your right,
you see the famous Tower of London.</i>

724
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,725
<i>And shortly, we'll be passing
under the Tower Bridge.</i>

725
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,930
It's a fortress.

726
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,879
It's an asylum for the criminally insane.
He's in the ICE unit.

727
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,408
That's an MI6 Alpha Level secure facility
buried deep within that building.

728
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,963
It's like a prison within a prison.

729
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,404
How are we gonna get in there?

730
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,759
She wants my head!
She wants my head! It's a Papist plot.

731
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,559
It's her. It's that bitch Mary, Queen of Scots.
She wants my head.

732
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,519
What are you doing? No! No!

733
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,046
Get me Cecil. Get me Cecil.
I'm the Queen of England!

734
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,199
Don't take me to the Tower!
I'll have your head for this, you bitch!

735
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,487
No! No!

736
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,522
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

737
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,605
They're plotting against me.
All of them.

738
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,999
There's a good queen.

739
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,086
Stuff it, you old bat.

740
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,881
Thank you.

741
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,841
Not so much the "old," if you don't mind.

742
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,799
<i>I think it was
really, really good.</i>

743
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,167
I thought I was kind of channeling
Bette Davis.

744
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,284
Good morning. Dr. Jones to see
prisoner number 17, please.

745
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,799
Dr. Jones? Are you with MI6?

746
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,290
Sadly, not anymore.

747
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,160
Because I don't seem to
have you on my list.

748
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,329
Bloody thing's not working. Why's that?

749
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,121
You're supposed to use...

750
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,726
Lay down on the ground.

751
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,323
Attaboy. On the floor.

752
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,130
Number 121. Oh, there it is.

753
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,606
Frank!

754
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,439
Who are you? You're visitors?
Who are you looking for?

755
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,120
We love having visitors, don't we, fellas?

756
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,611
Dr. Bailey?

757
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,606
Dr. Bailey?

758
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,441
Yes. Who did you expect to find here? Hmm?

759
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,003
- Sir...
- What?

760
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,526
I saw you die.

761
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,730
Saw me die? Who is he?

762
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,121
Frank?

763
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,119
Frank Moses, my dear fellow!

764
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,039
How are you, old sport?
So glad to see you. So glad you came by.

765
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,879
We've been expecting you.
Haven't we, fellas?

766
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,879
My God, Frank, why are you so old?
Good lord!

767
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,644
- Sir...
- What?

768
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,805
You've been locked up here for 32 years.

769
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,959
Come on, Frankie,
you've gotta be kidding me.

770
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,719
Come on, put 'em up.

771
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,087
Thirty-two years. How extraordinary.
Who are you?

772
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,407
Victoria.

773
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,409
Victoria! You should read this.

774
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,684
Lenin. <i>State and Revolution.</i> Jolly good time.
Stalin got it wrong, of course.

775
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,959
So where are we going, Frank?
Are you taking us

776
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,879
to the opera again tonight?
Is that where we're going, Frank?

777
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,359
The opera?
We love the opera, don't we, fellas?

778
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,919
Yes, the opera and the champagne
and the strawberries all 'round.

779
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,399
Sorry, my dear, what is your name again?

780
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,519
Victoria.

781
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,359
I'm sorry, it's the drugs

782
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,759
they've been feeding me,
it's my short-term memory.

783
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,919
The drugs they've been feeding...

784
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,839
Something that's meant to
keep us peaceful, I suppose,

785
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,080
or harmless!

786
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,321
Anyway, I know
it's around here somewhere,

787
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,807
but I don't know where it is.

788
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,599
Dr. Bailey, we need your help.

789
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,251
- Mmm?
- Do you remember Nightshade?

790
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,002
I'm sorry, I'm looking for my pipe
and my St. Christopher medallion.

791
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,929
Boys gave it to someone.

792
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,371
They were little boys, you see.

793
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,200
Now where it's gone... It's gone somehow.

794
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,885
Um...

795
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,039
Oh, shit!

796
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,560
Hey, Frankie, I'm over here.

797
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,279
I found it. it was in my
pocket the whole time.

798
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,799
I couldn't find my damn pipe, though.
But here it is.

799
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,280
Sorry, my dear,
what was the question you asked me?

800
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,644
Do you remember Nightshade?

801
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,959
Vaguely. It was some kind of
a bomb, I believe.

802
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,479
Dr. Bailey, people are looking
for that weapon.

803
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,119
People who want to use it.

804
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,044
Oh, dear. Yes, I do understand, of course.
Believe you me.

805
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,319
But you know, I made many things
for the Americans and

806
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,319
Nightshade turned out to be
a bit of a nightmare.

807
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,479
It was quite different.
Turned out to be too dangerous.

808
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,319
So naturally, they had to lock me up
in this place.

809
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,279
And after what they did to me,
I think it's perfectly natural

810
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,441
I tell them all to go F off!

811
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,839
MI6 tried to fake Bailey's death?
Why? What are they hiding?

812
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,161
You're gonna have to go.
You're gonna have to go find out.

813
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,720
You know
they're gonna try and kill me.

814
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,920
- I'll call you from Russia.
<i>- Do svidanya.</i>

815
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,163
<i>Maintenance to Bridge 7.</i>

816
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,450
We got a breach in Maximum Security.

817
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,521
Secure!

818
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,519
All right, what's so important?

819
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,286
I just heard from my source at MI6
that Edward Bailey's alive and on the run.

820
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,839
- That's not possible.
- This is bigger than a rogue general

821
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,968
and his unexploded ordnance.
What don't I know?

822
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,850
The game has changed.

823
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,327
The things Bailey knows are too dangerous.

824
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,890
We can't let Bailey or Nightshade fall into
terrorist hands, or millions will die.

825
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,286
Holy shit, it's real.

826
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,644
Unless we secure it, that weapon's
going off in the middle of Moscow.

827
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,407
Right now, that's our best case scenario.

828
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,601
Guys?

829
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,439
Ah!

830
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,920
Welcome, my friends.

831
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,288
So, it is true. You're alive.

832
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,810
Tell me, then, where is this device?

833
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,646
Who?

834
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,489
Work in progress.

835
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,201
<i>I never thought I'd be smuggling</i>

836
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,041
Frank Moses into the
heart of Mother Russia.

837
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,561
Me, neither.

838
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,242
Oh, before I forget. Frank.
Frank, a little something.

839
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,565
If you are caught or Han catches you

840
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,807
suicide pill is a much better option
than what you face.

841
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,169
You die with Russian smile on.

842
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,166
Good luck. <i>Do svidanya.</i>

843
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,323
- Mr. Bailey.
- Yes, Frank?

844
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,163
Is there any way you could tell us
where you hid the nuclear weapon?

845
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,366
Look at all those cows, Frank.
They're beautiful.

846
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,527
Yeah.

847
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,007
Cows?

848
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,847
Hi! Yoo hoo!

849
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,010
That's not good.

850
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,804
We have eyes on, Frank.

851
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,246
Where's my plane?

852
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,164
They paid me to kill you.

853
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,211
They didn't say I had to do it all at once.

854
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,720
This is not over, Moses.

855
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,921
We're not over! It's not!

856
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,044
What's wrong with him?

857
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,161
Wow.

858
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,609
What is this place?

859
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,604
My first safe house.

860
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,484
Untouched, since 1984. Aw!

861
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,966
Fugu poison?

862
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,761
Fugu poison is deadly stuff.
Terrible death.

863
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,846
This your little gizmo? XKG gas.
I invented it.

864
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,604
We tried to take out
old Fidel Castro in '61 in Cuba.

865
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,046
That didn't work though.

866
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,721
Any tea, Frank?

867
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,087
Why does Han hate you so much?

868
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,444
Not enough hugs as a child.

869
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,888
Frank framed him for
stealing state secrets.

870
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:11,887
So he went from being
a highly decorated counter-intel officer

871
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,010
to... to being a pariah.

872
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,399
What's ironic though, is that Frank
actually created the circumstances

873
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,890
for his own death.

874
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,207
It's poetic.

875
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,240
I ain't dead yet.

876
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,209
Should you eat that?

877
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,369
Is that safe?

878
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,563
It's before they had that,
you know, "sell by" date stuff.

879
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,761
Oh.

880
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,170
So did you get to meet Castro?

881
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,201
Who?

882
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,885
Did you get to meet Castro?

883
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,919
Yes, I did, actually. About two weeks
after Kennedy was assassinated.

884
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,285
Talking of which, Frank,

885
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,679
I'm starting to remember
more and more who I am

886
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,284
and who I was and the weapons I made.

887
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,682
My God, it really is amazing.

888
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,963
How efficiently those boys from MI6,
may God bless 'em...

889
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,439
But you know something, Frank?

890
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,519
They really do throw us away.
Don't they, old sport?

891
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,239
When we're no longer convenient, I suppose.

892
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,600
As though we'd never given them
the best years of our lives.

893
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,211
Bit of a joke, really.

894
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,089
Yes, very strange.

895
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,768
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

896
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,281
I'm sorry, my dear?

897
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,643
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

898
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,801
Oh, yes.

899
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,051
Now, this feels right.

900
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,403
It's around here somewhere.
I'm sure this time.

901
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,723
Everything looks different completely.

902
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,811
Maybe it's over here.

903
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,327
- It's been hours. Hours.
- Yeah, this is it.

904
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,081
Here we are.

905
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,802
How are those Jimmy Choos
working out for you?

906
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,400
The entrance is up there.

907
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,331
Who's Papa John?

908
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,639
It's new.

909
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,801
Entrance to what?

910
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,762
Secret tunnels
through the old catacombs.

911
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,689
Brezhnev used it to sneak his mistress in.

912
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,400
- In where?
- In there.

913
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,446
The Kremlin?

914
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,010
The weapon is in the Kremlin?

915
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,970
It's the one place they wouldn't look.

916
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,202
Jesus. Do you mind keeping it warm?

917
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,850
You have no idea
the damage you've done.

918
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,559
You kept one of our own
locked up for 32 years.

919
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,919
I have kept the world safe.

920
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,526
- If that weapon falls into the wrong hands...
- The weapon?

921
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:06,729
You haven't the slightest idea.

922
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,479
You must let me call Moses.

923
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,403
He doesn't know what he's walking into.

924
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,883
You've had your chance. It's over.

925
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,369
I'm sorry, Victoria.

926
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,923
Sorry, my ass.

927
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,449
They say you're a legend around here.

928
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,047
I've...

929
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,765
I've never heard of you.

930
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,764
Must have been a bit before my time.

931
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,604
Well, you've heard of me now.

932
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,890
How is it possible they never picked up
the radiation signature from that bomb?

933
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,447
That's the million dollar question.

934
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,962
Hey, gang. This is new.

935
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,929
What do you think is behind that wall?

936
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,241
Um...

937
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,046
I think Russians.

938
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,006
If anybody sees that hole, we're dead.

939
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,924
I'm gonna need you to help me
to disarm the weapon.

940
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,319
Frank, somebody's gotta guard the door.

941
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,970
- No.
- But...

942
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,446
You'll need this.

943
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,126
One more time.

944
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,199
Great. Great. What does that mean?

945
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,639
"Gas leak. Maintenance is coming."

946
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,240
- Good. And then they'll move on.
- And what if they don't?

947
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,679
- Want a gun?
- Yes.

948
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,966
No. No gun.

949
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,002
Just don't move. You're a security guard.

950
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,679
Don't smile. You can't smile.

951
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,201
You just never leave your post. Okay?

952
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,646
Nice.

953
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,970
Two shots, here and here.

954
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,521
Drag the body in there
and repeat as necessary.

955
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,087
- No safety.
- No safety.

956
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,243
Frank, I don't like
the Kremlin so much.

957
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,368
And I like being underneath it even less.

958
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,760
Here we are.

959
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,924
That's great. It's just like yesterday.

960
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,366
There's my wrench or crow bar.
Look at this.

961
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,601
There.

962
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,885
Hey, look, chaps.

963
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,519
That's my old pipe.
I knew I'd left it somewhere.

964
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,602
My dear wife bought this the fifth, 1969.

965
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,451
It was our wedding anniversary.
Oh, yes! This is, um...

966
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,451
This is Nightshade, by the way.

967
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,406
There.

968
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,803
- Is that...
- That's Red Mercury.

969
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,485
Red Mercury?

970
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,768
We were always told it was a Cold War myth.

971
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,879
Yes, they said it couldn't be done,
but I did it. See?

972
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,963
Frank, if that's Red Mercury,
you can zip it up in a backpack

973
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,407
and take it on the White House tour.
It's undetectable.

974
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,159
No signature. No fallout.

975
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,479
This is a weapon
that will entirely change

976
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,962
the balance of international power overnight.
Just like that.

977
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,410
We're all gonna die.

978
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,161
On your knees.

979
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,647
Katja.

980
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,842
No government should have this weapon.

981
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,846
Not yours. And not mine.

982
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,165
I have orders.

983
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,085
This isn't about orders.
This is about right and wrong.

984
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,086
Don't.

985
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,441
Did you really come to
see me in the States?

986
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,166
Yes.

987
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,806
What color were the flowers
outside my house?

988
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,045
Yellow.

989
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,331
What in the name of... Hey!

990
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,559
What are you doing kissing this guy?

991
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,879
I didn't wanna kill him.

992
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,399
What kinda stupid logic is that?

993
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,970
What in the Sam Hill is she doing here?

994
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,159
She's working with us again.

995
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,439
Like heck she is.

996
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,599
Why were you kissing that guy?

997
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,491
Kids, what happens
in the Kremlin stays in the Kremlin.

998
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,844
You are gonna
have to explain this to me.

999
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,041
Hey, Comrades!

1000
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,686
Here's to more success.

1001
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,159
Success.

1002
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,321
And saving the world!

1003
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,801
Saving the world!

1004
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,639
<i>Na zdorovie!</i>

1005
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,641
<i>Na zdorovie!</i>

1006
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,040
I got this. Right back.

1007
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,481
Hey.

1008
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,919
Where are you?

1009
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,921
Moscow.

1010
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,249
He's a nutter, Francis.

1011
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,919
MI6 didn't lock him up
because he created the weapon

1012
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,729
but because he wants to see it go off.

1013
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,606
Hello, Frank.

1014
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,642
That was Victoria, wasn't it?

1015
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,839
Telling you that I was
some sort of a monster

1016
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,401
who once wanted to destroy
the Soviet empire.

1017
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,089
Yeah. Very slowly.

1018
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,924
That's it. Good boy.

1019
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,842
Good. In you go.

1020
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,247
Marvin...

1021
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,531
Guns down.

1022
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,161
Weapons down. Very slowly.

1023
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,847
You planted the thing on WikiLeaks.

1024
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,203
Oh, yes, it was a cell phone
taken from a guard.

1025
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,963
I was just itching to get
my revenge on MI6, you see.

1026
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,124
Frank, you were absolutely marvelous
the way you found The Frog.

1027
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,811
No one else could have found him.

1028
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,121
Jack?

1029
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,163
Sorry, Frank, I made a deal already
with Mr. Horton for Red Mercury.

1030
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,330
- Well done, Bailey.
- Thanks.

1031
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,482
Nice to see you again, Frank.
Pick up the guns.

1032
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,366
Your country appreciates
your sacrifice, Frank.

1033
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,565
But your time's up.

1034
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,047
Let's go.

1035
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,046
It's time, Bailey.

1036
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,481
Yes, it is time.

1037
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,159
Very Interesting.

1038
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:09,122
Rogue American agents turned nuclear
terrorists kill top Russian officer.

1039
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,887
Not good.

1040
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,529
So long, Frank. So long, Marvin.

1041
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,571
Come on, boys, let's go.

1042
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,442
Easy. Easy.

1043
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,480
Oh, please, let me take that from you.

1044
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,201
I thought we were doing
the debriefing in London.

1045
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,479
Oh, we were. But since
you're such a sick, twisted bastard,

1046
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,481
you're going to Colorado.

1047
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,119
There's a secret facility there,
it's about a mile underground,

1048
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,039
where you will spend your remaining years
having every bit of knowledge

1049
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,119
plucked from that giant head of yours.

1050
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,121
Really?
Hmm.

1051
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,119
And since we're speaking frankly,

1052
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,282
I should say that it will
make your last 32 years

1053
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,528
seem like a vacation in the Caribbean.

1054
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,761
Cuff him.

1055
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,441
Mmm.

1056
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,641
Oh, I say.

1057
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,967
Well, well.

1058
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,240
Bet you didn't see that coming.
Did you, old man?

1059
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,011
I must say, I didn't. Jolly good.

1060
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,201
After you.

1061
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,528
Thank you.
Good morning, gentlemen.

1062
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,326
What did he say?

1063
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,601
Ready.

1064
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,771
Do something. Do something.

1065
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:10,961
I love you.

1066
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,123
At least Han didn't get us first.

1067
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,368
Really? You're gonna
bring that up right now?

1068
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,530
Ah, there is nothing more sexy
in the whole world

1069
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,769
than a beautiful woman
with an incredible gun.

1070
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,450
You're such a romantic.

1071
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,606
Watch your eyes.

1072
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,080
Close your eyes.

1073
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:01,083
I love the way your toes curl
right before you fire.

1074
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,119
Hopeless.

1075
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,639
Mmm.

1076
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,641
Ah!

1077
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,324
- Freeze.
- Shh!

1078
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,683
You know something? I don't think you
ought to point that idiotic thing at me.

1079
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,441
You should really start thinking about
your security protocol, don't you think?

1080
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,401
What the hell is that?

1081
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,170
That, my dear boy, is an antidote

1082
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:08,843
to the most powerful nerve
agent ever created. Look.

1083
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,566
Hello, boys.

1084
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,685
Hello, Mr. Davis.

1085
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,679
And you didn't see that coming.

1086
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,125
Did you, old sport?

1087
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,200
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to miss what's coming next.

1088
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,451
It's a little antidote. Jolly good.

1089
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,206
That's right.

1090
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,839
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1091
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,047
Good. Thank you.

1092
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,807
Jolly good.

1093
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,599
Honestly, two days,
Frank, two days,

1094
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,199
and you're in front of a firing squad?

1095
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,279
Yeah. But look...

1096
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,806
No. No excuses.
You're better than this. It's pathetic.

1097
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,925
Frank, an American military transport
made an emergency landing in London.

1098
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,767
Everyone aboard was found dead.

1099
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,489
Bailey has taken refuge
in the Iranian embassy.

1100
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,684
The Iranian embassy?

1101
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,086
We've gotta go there.

1102
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,048
All right. Get 'em ready.

1103
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,847
I'm gonna make sure we're
cleared for takeoff.

1104
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,648
If the world is here in a week,

1105
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,919
I will meet you in the Turks and Caicos.

1106
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,079
Mmm-hmm.

1107
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,839
And we will spend all night

1108
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,763
- beneath the stars.
- Beneath the stars.

1109
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,281
Mmm...

1110
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,405
I don't speak Korean!

1111
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,920
You having fun yet?

1112
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,248
I'll let you know when I start having fun.

1113
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,280
You betrayed me.

1114
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,761
I had no choice.

1115
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,290
You'd have done the same thing,
if you were me.

1116
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,364
How much is the US paying you?

1117
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,679
20 million.

1118
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,841
Are you kiddin' me?

1119
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,527
I asked for more.

1120
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,006
What happened to you?

1121
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,771
You used to be a good agent.

1122
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,766
Stop! Wait a minute.
Listen, I need your help.

1123
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,724
I know there's a part of you
that wants to do the right thing.

1124
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,721
There is a weapon
that's gonna be detonated...

1125
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,080
Bullshit.

1126
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,525
It's not bullshit.

1127
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,442
There's a bomb headed for London right now.

1128
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,642
Eleven million people are gonna
lose their lives if you don't help me.

1129
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,561
All right.

1130
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,171
Let's go.

1131
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,769
This doesn't mean I'm not
going to kill you later.

1132
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,527
I know.

1133
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,080
I think the way
to make a relationship work

1134
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,000
is that neither of you give up who you are.
Don't you agree, Marvin?

1135
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,086
Exactly. Exactly what Marvin says.

1136
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:06,286
Falling in love is like jumping off a cliff.
You just have to believe and let go.

1137
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,250
My God!

1138
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,285
Are you okay?

1139
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,447
No, he's all right.

1140
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,847
He's with us.

1141
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,125
We talked it out.

1142
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,919
Kill Bailey. Secure the weapon.

1143
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,921
How hard can it be?

1144
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,439
Of course, the external security
is very, very heavy

1145
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,479
but inside there are hardcore
Revolutionary Guards.

1146
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,369
They are serious fanatics.

1147
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,210
The whole thing depends on her.

1148
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:03,361
You do realize, if they catch you,
they will kill you.

1149
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,680
<i>I know this won't be
easy for you, but don't worry.</i>

1150
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,801
Okay?

1151
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,883
You know, I've been thinking about

1152
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,049
you and me.

1153
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,962
And I just...

1154
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,491
I got you something.

1155
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,366
Wow.

1156
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,726
You like it?

1157
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,002
- I love it.
- Seven rounds.

1158
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,119
- Okay.
- Not yet. I'm not ready.

1159
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,439
Stop, no.
Not right now. Wait.

1160
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,879
If you don't do it,
you're gonna blow it, all right?

1161
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,959
Look at me.

1162
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,279
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Mmm. Listen...

1163
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,439
I'm gonna count to three, okay?

1164
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,001
- We can go back to the...
- In English.

1165
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,527
- One...
- Not now. No. Wait.

1166
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,210
Two...

1167
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,730
God damn it.

1168
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,047
Hi.

1169
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,530
She's gonna get killed.

1170
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,886
It's tough when they leave the nest.

1171
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:46,322
Frank, come on. A little trust.

1172
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,727
She has talents you and I will never have.

1173
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,640
What talents?

1174
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,525
People like her.

1175
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,844
If she lives,
this'll be good for your relationship.

1176
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,321
You're right.

1177
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:03,327
And if there's one thing I know,
it's women and covert ops.

1178
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,485
That's two things.

1179
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,048
No, grasshopper.

1180
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,651
It is not.

1181
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,001
I wanna tell you a secret, Mr. Minister.

1182
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,525
Is she gonna make out with this guy, too?

1183
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,961
Ohh!

1184
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,721
What the hell was that?

1185
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,326
Blowfish poison.

1186
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,242
Paralysis and shooting pains
will grip your entire body.

1187
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,002
And you will slowly asphyxiate
until you choke to death

1188
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,567
while remaining fully-conscious,
unless you do exactly what I say.

1189
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,371
I will die before I compromise my country.

1190
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:00,399
Okay. We will drive you to your office where
you will write a letter on official stationery

1191
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,919
denouncing the treatment of women in Iran.

1192
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,410
Then you will get your antidote.

1193
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,566
That's it?

1194
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,127
How may I help you?

1195
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,641
Ah. Dr. Bailey, my apologies for the delay.

1196
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:44,279
Professor Dombrovski has
declared the weapon authentic.

1197
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,884
And we're prepared to proceed.

1198
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,244
As soon as my money's transferred,
Mr. Ambassador.

1199
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,927
Move! She's with me.

1200
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,921
Arman?

1201
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,399
He needs to go.

1202
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,719
Okay, okay.

1203
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,604
What are you talking about? Who is she?

1204
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,723
Sir, I'm sorry, you need to leave.

1205
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,604
You need to shut up!

1206
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,239
No.

1207
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,119
What? What is happening here?

1208
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,167
Sorry. What are you doing?

1209
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,399
Tell me what is happening here! Who is she?

1210
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,199
Get out! When I say "get
out," get out of here!

1211
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,486
You need to go!

1212
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,091
You shut the fuck up!

1213
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,011
Where's the safe?

1214
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,287
What?

1215
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,810
Where's the safe?

1216
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,926
Poo poo's coming.

1217
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,925
24 Hour Plumbing.

1218
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,726
<i>Hurry. Emergency.
Water everywhere. Come quick.</i>

1219
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,762
Stop! Plumbers, wait!

1220
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,883
It's okay! This way.

1221
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,526
Money received.

1222
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,166
Good show.

1223
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,604
Let's see our friend here.

1224
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,924
Would you lend me your knife, please?

1225
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,801
Thank you.

1226
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,564
Sorry about the mess on the carpet.

1227
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,207
Oh, Well.

1228
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,559
At this point, Jack... You don't
mind me calling you "Jack," I hope.

1229
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,609
You must be beginning to comprehend

1230
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,485
the stunning totality of your failure.

1231
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,966
You can't give it to them.

1232
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,679
Oh, I've no more interest
in giving Red Mercury

1233
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,524
to these boys than I have
in giving it to you.

1234
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,241
Jesus.

1235
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,639
Yes, it's a sad old world, you know.

1236
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,290
Anyway, that's only my opinion.

1237
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:52,165
But the central point is this, Jack,

1238
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:56,639
you see, when men like you
and those dickheads from MI6

1239
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,007
or CIA or whatever sewers you came from.

1240
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,851
When you take away not only my life

1241
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,999
but the innocent lives of
my dear beloved wife Natasha

1242
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,919
and my little boy,
who was only six, you see. Yes.

1243
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,206
I mean, what can I say?

1244
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,280
When you mess with me, buddy,

1245
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,881
this is what you get.

1246
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,606
Go to hell, old man.

1247
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,923
Fare thee well, patriot.

1248
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:32,881
Boom.

1249
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,880
Now what's next?

1250
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,727
Ah, Washington.

1251
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,879
Baby, hey.

1252
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,006
Are you okay?

1253
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,326
Hah!

1254
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,721
Awesome!

1255
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,922
Oh, shit.

1256
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,646
- Is that it?
- It's counting down, Frank.

1257
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,841
Shut it Off. Right?

1258
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,559
Shut... Yeah.
With what? Acupressure?

1259
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,882
- I don't know.
- Well, why is it my responsibility?

1260
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,041
Just do something.

1261
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,880
With my Mr. Chemistry set?

1262
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:38,209
I don't know what I'm doing.
You want me to push a button?

1263
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,530
Bailey's loose and the bomb's ticking.

1264
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,890
Wait. Excuse me, ma'am.

1265
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,570
Hello, I have an appointment.

1266
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,769
Gun!

1267
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,200
Get that bomb outta here.

1268
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,241
- Drop it now, darling. That's right.
- My gun!

1269
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,520
Press the button. Ground floor.

1270
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,289
Marvin, let's go!

1271
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,086
Jolly good show.

1272
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,081
Bollocks.

1273
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,801
You really drive this ridiculous thing?

1274
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,526
Can you shoot?

1275
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,490
We need eyes, Francis.

1276
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,809
Come on, Frank. Forty minutes.

1277
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,440
Marvin, how ya doin' back there?

1278
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,449
I can't talk to you right now.

1279
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,806
How is it?

1280
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,121
It's fine.

1281
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,727
Shit!

1282
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,161
Show me something.

1283
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,361
<i>Victoria,</i>

1284
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:25,359
I got eyes on. Bailey's heading for the M4.

1285
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,407
Got it.

1286
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,401
Got it!

1287
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,519
This one should stop it
and this one should detonate it.

1288
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,010
It's fifty-fifty, Frank.

1289
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:39,959
Wait!

1290
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,086
That's weird.

1291
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,441
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

1292
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,079
Wait, wait! Wait!

1293
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,519
Stop cutting wires!

1294
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,443
I knew we were gonna die!

1295
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,929
- Ready to kill this son of a bitch?
- Abso-bloody-lutely.

1296
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,607
Damn it!

1297
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,641
Trouble.

1298
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,921
<i>Marvin!</i>

1299
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:13,044
Frank, it's two pedals and two sticks.

1300
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,321
Okay.

1301
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,959
Damn it! We missed him.
He's going into the airport.

1302
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,007
<i>Go get him!</i>

1303
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,129
- Well, where are you?
- In trouble.

1304
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,959
<i>Turn back!
You are in restricted airspace.</i>

1305
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,599
Frank, they're gonna blow us outta the sky.

1306
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,721
I wouldn't worry about that.

1307
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,320
The engine's shutting down.

1308
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,490
Mayday! mayday!

1309
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,761
Frank!

1310
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,644
I knew we were gonna die!

1311
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,839
<i>This is your last warning!</i>

1312
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,889
Oh, please, tell me you're not crashing
with a weapon of mass destruction.

1313
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,009
No, Frank, no.

1314
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:26,841
Oh, God.

1315
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,125
You okay back there, Marvin?

1316
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,679
It wasn't exactly a
three-point landing, Frank.

1317
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,727
How's the bomb doing?

1318
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,730
I can't stop it.

1319
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,925
We gotta get it outta here.

1320
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,364
Hey! Hey!

1321
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,607
Get outta the car.

1322
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,727
Hello, Frank.

1323
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,406
Welcome aboard.

1324
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,522
Always the good soldier, aren't you?

1325
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,526
Stalemate.

1326
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:38,090
How will you take him out
and not shoot her first?

1327
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,882
Frank, it's okay.

1328
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:45,081
You can shoot. It's okay.

1329
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,890
Put the gun down.

1330
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,007
Put the gun down!

1331
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,731
Drop the gun!

1332
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:01,087
Put the gun down, Frankie.

1333
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,561
Thank you.

1334
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,245
Pretty smart.

1335
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,444
So love does conquer all.

1336
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,289
Go to your golden warrior.

1337
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,127
That's a good girl.

1338
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,441
Aw!

1339
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:24,287
Come here.

1340
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,245
Ah! It's so sweet.

1341
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,691
Now leave the plane.
Take Nightshade with you.

1342
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,807
Bye, Frank.

1343
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:39,605
Sweet dreams.

1344
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,483
Why didn't you just shoot me?

1345
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,806
- What happened?
- I couldn't disarm it.

1346
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,530
Oh, crap.

1347
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,521
Marvin,

1348
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,370
it's going to detonate?

1349
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:34,846
Yeah.

1350
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,206
Put your arms around me.

1351
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,641
Oh...

1352
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:03,969
I didn't see that one coming.

1353
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,447
There's something you don't see every day.

1354
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,564
You put the bomb on the plane.

1355
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:39,602
And, um, you didn't think to mention that?

1356
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,484
You blew up my plane.

1357
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,761
Sorry.

1358
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,963
I was wrong? So we're not even gonna die?

1359
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,481
Not yet.

1360
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:53,399
I was actually starting to like you.
I was even thinking about not killing you.

1361
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,607
This is what happens when
you try to save the world.

1362
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,039
Han. Han, you can't

1363
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,610
- put a price on these things.
- Uh-uh.

1364
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:03,129
You owe me 30 mil for the plane.
And 20 for not killing you.

1365
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,443
You're a dead man, Moses.

1366
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,931
Thanks for your help.

1367
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:11,801
Really.

1368
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,321
You think he means it?

1369
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:16,925
Nah, he's a nice guy.

1370
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,406
I mean it, Frank!

1371
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,801
All right.

1372
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:24,561
Aw!

1373
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,603
They're going to be right as rain.

1374
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:32,128
He made the run to emotional safety.

1375
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:37,646
So...

1376
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,642
I did hear about this job in Caracas.

1377
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:43,801
And?

1378
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,491
Don't look at me. She's your girlfriend.

1379
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,326
Oh.

1380
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,321
Come on.

1381
01:47:08,305 --> 01:48:08,649
