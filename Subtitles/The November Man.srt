00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,522
I'm going back to work.

3
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,045
Don't worry, I checked her out.

4
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,046
Scenario: Agent
falls in love with girl.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,043
Agent runs 'em up.

6
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,123
Girl gets kidnapped.

7
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,248
The other guys wanna know
the agent's source.

8
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,368
What does he do?

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,723
What do they do to the girl?

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,210
- Is there a point to this?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,205
Over your right shoulder.

12
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,404
- Us or them?
- How the fuck should I know?

13
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:51,926
Does it really matter?

14
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,681
You feel the need for
a relationship? Get a dog.

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,205
Channel four.

16
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,202
Shit! Mason, give us a hand
with this mike, will you?

17
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
Want me to put your Corsage
on too, Miss Prom Queen?

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sit on this and twist.

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,455
You're funny.

20
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,566
Hanley.

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,566
Right.

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,639
We have confirmation.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,960
There's definitely a credible
threat. We've got 20 minutes.

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,446
You ready?

25
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,559
Mason, you ready?

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,131
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

27
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,850
- Comm check, one, two.
<i>- Good hunting.</i>

28
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:58,887
Copy.

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,399
Hi, there.

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,879
Ambassador, I'm gonna
need your clothes.

31
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,245
We believe there may be
an attempt

32
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,049
on your life this morning.

33
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,320
<i>Target is male,
Caucasian, 35 to 40.</i>

34
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,364
<i>- Wanna bet your life on that?
- No. I'm betting on you.</i>

35
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,405
This is it, Peter.

36
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,601
<i>I'm in the yellow building,</i>

37
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:03,682
<i>green shutters,
left of the clock tower.</i>

38
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,210
How many potentials?

39
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,881
Too many.
I don't like it.

40
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,251
<i>Call off the Op,
we don't have the coverage.</i>

41
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:20,368
We're not calling this Op.

42
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,850
Body armor is not
gonna stop a head shot.

43
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,049
I've been having
these headaches, anyway.

44
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,729
Blue suit, two o'clock.

45
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,443
Got him.
He's moving.

46
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:45,522
Hold your shot.
Hold your shot.

47
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,479
Check your line of fire.
Don't shoot!

48
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
<i>- No, he's moving on you.</i>
- Do not shoot!

49
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,205
Devereaux?

50
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,291
Jesus.

51
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,248
<i>He tagged you, I had to hit him!</i>

52
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,283
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

53
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,730
Learn to take orders.

54
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,444
No! No, no, no...

55
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,931
Peter? There is a man
outside by the water.

56
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:53,410
He says he knows you.

57
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,649
That's it?

58
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,241
No "Hello, Hanley,
good to see you"?

59
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,449
- "Been a long time"?
- You still out of Berlin?

60
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,802
Berlin? Christ, no.

61
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,849
The action's moved, my friend.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,809
The frontline
is now in Belgrade.

63
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,369
You look good.

64
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,450
Better than him, at least.

65
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,250
- Kargan.
- Retirement got him fat.

66
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,526
- Not her, though.
- God.

67
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,442
Craig.

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,239
They knew the risks.
We all did.

69
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,049
We ID'd the killer.

70
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,479
Alexa Demoystria.

71
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,205
Contract killer out of Moscow.

72
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:52,647
She's cutting a swath through people
who have no business dying.

73
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,004
Agency thinks
it's Arkady Federov

74
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:58,402
killing anyone or anything
that reminds him of his past.

75
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,490
The guy's gonna be
the next Russian president.

76
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,210
What's this got to do with me?

77
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,410
Natalia.

78
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,963
You'd be proud of her, Peter.

79
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:25,079
After you left, she got
very close to Federov.

80
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,447
But she wants to come in.

81
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,449
She has something on him.

82
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,970
Something that's scaring
even her.

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,679
- What?
- A name.

84
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,366
Claims it changes everything.
And if she's right,

85
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,246
how long before you think
she's gonna join these?

86
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,599
You go in, you get her out.

87
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,639
Moscow to Petersburg.

88
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,167
Cross the border to Helsinki,
I'll meet you there.

89
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,568
She asked for you.

90
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,243
Only you.

91
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,880
She won't give you the name
until you bring her out, right?

92
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,922
She always was a ballbuster.

93
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,168
Drone's airborne.

94
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,645
Exfil on standby.
Monitoring.

95
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,165
Bravo! Bravo!

96
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,125
Do you have a link to the drone?

97
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:27,531
Yes, we do.

98
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,929
Rendezvous with
the extraction team in...

99
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,324
...four minutes.

100
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,889
We have eyes on the prize.

101
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,002
Traveling northbound
on Tverskaya.

102
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,643
Message received from prize.

103
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:56,529
We are five minutes from exfil.

104
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,890
Langley's online.

105
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,285
What time is it there, Perry?

106
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,123
You don't need to be
in on this one.

107
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,931
<i>If our girl's actually got
something on Federov,</i>

108
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:12,048
<i>a lot of people are interested.</i>

109
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,366
Subject's nearing
extraction location.

110
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,450
Sir, we have an issue.

111
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,999
<i>- Who?</i>
- It looks like FSB.

112
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,764
The Russians have made her.

113
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,169
Get in the car!

114
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,322
Peter! Why are you here?

115
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,682
Whose car is that she got into?

116
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,889
Whoever it is, it's not us.

117
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,039
How is Lucy?

118
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,405
She misses you.

119
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,288
I miss her too.
Both of you.

120
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,567
We're tracking
from parallel streets.

121
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,919

<i>Mason's got the ball.</i>

Forty-two. Confirm.

127

Forty-two, confirm.

128
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,199
You have a name.
I need it.

129
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,362
Right now, I need the name!

130
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,725
Mira Filipova.

131
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,851
- Yes.
- Mira Filipova.

132
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,169
Mira Filipova.

133
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,090
Peter, you're blown.

134
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,649
Forty-two complete.

135
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,764
Peter...

136
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,241
She was one of ours, Weinstein.

137
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,319
<i>It was over when
the Russians made her.</i>

138
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,685
<i>We did her a favor.</i>

139
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,003
Go, go!
Get down!

140
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,599
I've tapped into a CCTV feed.

141
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,045
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

142

Op One, this is Control.
Respond.

<i>What happened?</i>

144
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,170
Op Two, respond.

145
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,206
It was Devereaux.

146
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,251
It was goddamn Devereaux!
What was he doing here?

147
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,840
Who's Devereaux?

148
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,767
<i>Peter Devereaux, one of ours.</i>

<i>Active '77 to '08.</i>

Go, go, go!

155
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,610
- Smokey!
- I think this belongs to you.

156
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:46,919
Come here, you dumb cat.
I'm so sorry.

157
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,490
She spends so much time
in my apartment,

158
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,561
she should pay some rent.

159
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:51,369
She likes you better than me.

160
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,051
Would you like to come in
for a cup of coffee?

161
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:57,930
I just made some.
Tastes like home.

162
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,964
Sorry, work.

163
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,005
Hello?

164
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,087
Hi, I'm looking for
Alice Fournier.

165
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,245
Alice!

166
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,888
- Can I help you?
- Yes, hello.

167
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,799
My name's Edgar Simpson.

168
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,320
I'm an investigative journalist.
I work with The New York Times.

169
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,524
I want to talk to you
about this man.

170
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,639
Arkady Federov.
He's a Russian politician.

171
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,722
I'm researching a story on him.

172
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,839
- Hello.
- Hello.

173
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,410
I have reservation.

174
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,410
Why didn't you shoot?
Here.

175
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,959
Why didn't you shoot?

176
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,406
Yes, Mr. Mason,
why didn't you shoot?

177
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,565
There was no threat, sir.

178
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:48,844
The man who just assassinated
your entire team

179
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,684
is pointing a gun at you,
and you say there was no threat.

180
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,649
Devereaux was disoriented.

181
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,324
He didn't expect to see me there.

182
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:58,448
He was doing exactly
what I would have done.

183
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,410
We tried to kill him.

184
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,206
He killed us.

185
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,482
You gleaned all this
in less than two seconds?

186
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,843
Yes, sir.

187
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,842
The question remains:

188
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,924
Why didn't you shoot?

189
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,610
Why didn't he shoot?

190
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,530
- You think you know Devereaux?
- Just let me find him.

191
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,726
If I can talk to him, maybe I can
stop this from getting crazy.

192
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:42,961
You don't know him.

193
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,084
I know how he trained you.

194
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,690
No connections.

195
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,323
But there were things
in this world

196
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:04,004
that mattered
to Peter Devereaux.

197
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,443
People he let inside,
people he loved, perhaps.

198
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,968
And we just killed
a very important one.

199
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,327
And now he'll come after us
with everything he's got.

200
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:19,845
That's how he's wired.

201
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,848
He killed three of our people.

202
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,482
The call is to
terminate Devereaux.

203
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,851
Do you have a problem
with the call?

204
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,962
I do what I'm told to do, sir.

205
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,644
Hard drive's OK.

206
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,645
I think I've got something here.

207
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:00,799
What do you got?

208
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,245
It's what we're looking for.

209
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,087
The last search that Hanley ran.

210
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,722
See what else you can find.

211
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,681
Everything's a real mess.

212
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,242
What a clusterfuck.

213
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,087
Hi. How you doing?
I got some stuff for you.

214
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,679
Look, this girl, Mira,
arrives Belgrade late '90s.

215
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,599
UN refugee.
She's processed by these two.

216
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,762
They hand it off
to a social worker,

217
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,081
this woman, Alice Fournier.

218
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,601
Two or three other girls
were friends.

219
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,080
You know, prostitutes, junkies.

220
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,166
Last trace of your Mira
was a decade ago.

221
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:32,482
If she was anything like her
friends, she's probably dead.

222
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,971
Give me her.

223
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,679
Here you go.
She has lunch plans.

224
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,967
Dva Jelena Restaurant.

225
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,362
You're very welcome.

226
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,802
Biometric mets from
Belgrade Airport arrivals coming up.

227
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,729
It says four hours ago.
There.

228
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,650
He looked right at the camera.

229
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,439
Yeah?

230
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,721
<i>I have the crew from
Hanley's. They have something.</i>

231
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,601
Cleaners at Hanley's
have a possible hit.

232
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,010
Authorization
and access codes positive.

233
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,679
Go ahead.

234
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,489
Yes, this is Jurgen.

235
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,199
I need location information
on a subject... Fournier.

236
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,850
Alice.

237
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,605
Cell number 75365423.

238
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,447
Search the location
of this cell phone:

239
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:04,727
Fournier, Alice.

240
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,489
Cell 75365423.

241
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,562
Current location: Skadarska 32.

242
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,919
I believe that's a restaurant.

243
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,081
<i>Thank you.</i>

244
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,883
How many on station at Hanley's?

245
00:29:27,884 --> 00:29:29,006
Two.

246
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,561
Call the other one.

247
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,524
There's no answer.

248
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,445
It's Devereaux.

249
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,761
Thank you for deciding
to meet with me.

250
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,564
Please, sit down.

251
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,690
I won't stay long.
Thank you.

252
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,529
- Would you like something?
- Water's fine. Thanks.

253
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,126
So, let's talk
about Arkady Federov.

254
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,965
In the work I do,
it's a name I hear a lot.

255
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:57,646
But he's old news.
Atrocities are like reality TV.

256
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,766
There's always a new show
for people to forget.

257
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,039
Agreed.
However, now Federov

258
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,485
is about to become
president of Russia.

259
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:06,604
That makes him a person
of interest to the world

260
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:08,045
and to my publication.

261
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,482
When Federov was just a general,

262
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:12,084
I'd say he was
pretty much untouchable.

263
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,401
But it's different now.
He's vulnerable.

264
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:16,243
What?

265
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,003
You don't think
that makes him dangerous?

266
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,641
These guys always
talk a big game,

267
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:23,599
but at the end of the day
they're mostly men

268
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,329
who just like the sound
of their own voices.

269
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,810
You want your story
and your Pulitzer Prize?

270
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,247
You haven't seen what they're
like when they come to us.

271
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,359
Many are just girls.

272
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,169
Frightened girls.

273
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,842
Have you thought about what
your story might do to them?

274
00:31:39,843 --> 00:31:42,491
There are crimes
Federov is guilty of.

275
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,684
He needs to be exposed.

276
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,003
If the girls from your center
are willing to talk to me,

277
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:50,523
- to tell me their stories...
- I help the victims.

278
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:52,363
I don't use them for politics.

279
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,482
These girls have
been through enough.

280
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:57,006
I'm sorry. Maybe your heart's
in the right place,

281
00:31:57,007 --> 00:31:59,446
but nobody can stop Federov.

282
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,005
You've agreed to meet with me.

283
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,048
There must be some way
you can help me.

284
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,405
Excuse me.

285
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,162
- Are you Alice Fournier?
- Yes.

286
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,647
There is a call for you
in the office.

287
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,048
They say your cell phone
is not working.

288
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,087
- This way. Please.
- Excuse me.

289
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,399
Yes? Hello?

290
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,084
<i>Stop. Stay right
where you are.</i>

291
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,285
Listen to me very carefully.

292
00:32:31,286 --> 00:32:33,362
<i>The woman you're with
is a killer.</i>

293
00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:35,999
<i>If she panics,
you're a dead woman.</i>

294
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,439
<i>Turn around. Turn around.</i>

295
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,125
<i>I'm right behind you.
Turn around.</i>

296
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,919
Run! Now! Run!

297
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,206
Alice?

298
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,727
Out the back!
I want eyes on them!

299
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,643
Come on! Come on!

300
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,839
In here!

301
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,245
Move!

302
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,449
Who are you?
What's happening?!

303
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,805
Side door.

304
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,321
He's gotta be in the market!
I want eyes on him right now!

305
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,721
Mason.

306
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,085
I can't believe you still got
the same phone number.

307
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:51,081
How's it going?

308
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,999
Actually, I'm a little busy
right now.

309
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,365
Can I call you back
in a few minutes?

310
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,964
Get the cell scanner.

311
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,122
<i>No, let's just talk, shall we?</i>

312
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,882
You can keep doing
what you're doing.

313
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:04,201
- I don't mind.
- Scenario: hard target

314
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:06,679
with a female accomplice
took a 30-second lead on me

315
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,079
into a crowded venue.

316
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,759
- Tell me about your target.
- Male, old.

317
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,001
- Used to have skills.
- Used to?

318
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,685
<i>Probably thinks he still does.</i>

319
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,484
Yeah, he's arrogant,
confident he'll evade.

320
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,449
<i>He's already made
his first mistake.</i>

321
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,087
You really think six agents
are gonna do it?

322
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,279
Tell me.

323
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,169
Devereaux. De...

324
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,360
Who were those men,
were they police?

325
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,403
No. Sort of.

326
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,562
Then who the hell are you?
Who are you?! What do you want?!

327
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,165
Let go of me!

328
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,804
What's happening?
I didn't do anything.

329
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,883
I believe you, but they won't.

330
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,965
Now if you wanna walk out of here,
you're gonna have to trust me. OK?

331
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,403
Alice?

332
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,251
Wait!

333
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,884
- You OK?
- Yeah.

334
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,526
- I knew you'd call back.
- You're losing your perimeter.

335
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,843
Too many bodies moving.
You're losing control.

336
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,615
Don't you wanna know why
I was in Moscow?

337
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,483
What my orders were?
Who sent me?

338
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,563
- Keep him talking.
- Why don't you come in,

339
00:36:18,564 --> 00:36:19,959
we'll talk about it.

340
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,407
No. This is my scenario,
I make the rules.

341
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,445
Come on, kid. Just give me enough
to keep it interesting.

342
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,884
Maybe I'll make a mistake.
You owe me that much.

343
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:32,565
- I don't owe you shit.
- Give me your phone.

344
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:35,291
<i>Where am I?
Come on, Mason, where am I?</i>

345
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,928
The call is being broadcast
through this phone.

346
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,447
The scanner thinks Jake's phone
is Devereaux's phone.

347
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,125
That's why he seems so close.

348
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,408
How many people
have you killed, Mason?

349
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,291
What, now?
Or in the next five minutes?

350
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,124
You think about it sometimes?

351
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,170
Maybe having a coffee,
or a screw.

352
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,766
You see a beautiful woman
or a child,

353
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,015
then you remember all the lives
you've taken.

354
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,565
That way.

355
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,722
<i>It stops you cold, doesn't it?</i>

356
00:37:00,723 --> 00:37:02,643
<i>No, asshole.
I sleep like a baby.</i>

357
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,519
<i>I don't get you, Devereaux.</i>

358
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,295
<i>I'm the one you want.
Why not take your shot?</i>

359
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,199
Tempting.

360
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,168
Give away my position, though.

361
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,967
Always willing to die
for the cause, Mason?

362
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,965
Fear is the enemy,
you taught me that.

363
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:18,884
<i>Yeah. Well, I haven't finished
teaching you yet, son.</i>

364
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,521
Yet here I am about
to take you down all the same.

365
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,489
You're not gonna take me down, kid.

366
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,959
You're a blunt instrument at best.

367
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,325
<i>No perspective, no knowledge.</i>

368
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,889
- Keep talking, old man.
<i>- This is humiliating.</i>

369
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,564
<i>Embarrassing.</i>

370
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,883
Just like in Moscow.

371
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,131
<i>Isn't it?
What is it, Mason?</i>

372
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,166
No one there to hold your hand?

373
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,121
No one there to tell you
to pull the trigger?

374
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,239
He's stealing a car.
Where's the nearest parking lot?

375
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,680
There's one straight ahead,
this way.

376
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,650
- So no regrets?
- Not one.

377
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,085
And you know what?
I don't give a fuck

378
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:04,605
about the people I've killed.

379
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,884
If by some stroke of pure luck
you manage to kill me,

380
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,088
then I won't give a fuck
about that either.

381
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,402
He's here.
He's around here somewhere.

382
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,409
<i>That was quite a speech.</i>

383
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,807
You bring out the best in me.

384
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,799
Gas, get back!

385
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,928
Get back!
Get back!

386
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,921
Fuck!

387
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,803
Mira Filipova.
Where is she?

388
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,805
How do you know that name?

389
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,247
When was the last time
you saw her?

390
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,001
I don't know. Maybe three years ago.
I was her case worker.

391
00:39:19,002 --> 00:39:21,731
A good friend of mine died
trying to find her.

392
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,044
I'm sorry.
I have no idea where she is.

393
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,409
The woman who approached you
at the restaurant,

394
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,811
she was a professional killer.

395
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:32,168
Russian. The men on
the motorbikes were CIA.

396
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,322
- CIA?
- Now, whatever that girl knows,

397
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:36,604
a lot of people want it.
And if they can't find her,

398
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:38,364
you're the next closest thing.

399
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,761
Do you have files
on the women you help?

400
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,881
Yes.

401
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,242
We gotta catch this tram.

402
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,890
Why do you hate him so much?
The man who wants to kill us.

403
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,086
Why do you hate him?

404
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,205
I don't hate him.

405
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,843
No. He's probably
the best friend I've ever had.

406
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,086
So all your friends
try to kill you?

407
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,486
Eventually.

408
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,764
- Where can I find her?
- I told you, I don't know.

409
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,965
You must know something.
Friends, places she frequented.

410
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,363
- People don't just disappear.
- I don't know, OK?

411
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,922
In my line of work, yes.
Yes, they do, they disappear.

412
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,800
One day you think they're there,
the next they're just gone.

413
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,965
She stopped coming to meetings.

414
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,566
People said she was using,
doing tricks.

415
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,124
Do you know who this man is?

416
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,279
A pimp.

417
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,602
He brings girls in from
the Caucasus, sells them for sex.

418
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,445
- His name is Lebedynko.
- No.

419
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,490
His real name is Simi Denisov.

420
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,691
He was Federov's right-hand man
during the last Chechen conflict.

421
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,730
You know where he is right now?

422
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,925
Yes.

423
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,522
He's here in Belgrade.

424
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,122
How do you know Denisov?

425
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,724
Just people you meet.

426
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,762
- I'm here to see Lebedynko.
- No.

427
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,921
Just tell him
Peter Devereaux's here.

428
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,890
Wait.

429
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,123
- Yeah, let him.
- Come on.

430
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,839
- You look like shit.
- Yeah?

431
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,365
Well, you don't
look too good yourself.

432
00:42:42,366 --> 00:42:43,805
Welcome.

433
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,881
I can't believe it, Peter.

434
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,963
- So, why are you here, Peter?
- I want information.

435
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,965
Someone is here in Belgrade
to kill you and it's not me.

436
00:42:57,966 --> 00:43:01,851
I can tell you who it is,
but I want something in return.

437
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:04,923
OK. You tell me.

438
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,321
I go into your debt.
For old time's sake.

439
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,882
Arkady Federov.

440
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,122
He's killing just about everyone
who was close to him

441
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,290
from your good old days.
Now my information is

442
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,169
that he's gonna try and kill you.

443
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,879
- Me?
- Yeah. So what's his deal?

444
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,928
Why does he want to have
a clean slate now?

445
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:28,331
What's his game?

446
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,611
Turn around.

447
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,003
You should turn around just now.

448
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,929
Chechnya.

449
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,599
This ugly, dirty, little
godforsaken country.

450
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,321
Oil, however, lots of it.
Filthy Chechen terrorists

451
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,124
didn't want to give it to us.

452
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,443
So... one day,

453
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,523
a building...

454
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,691
...blew up.
Good Russian soldiers

455
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,922
with mommies and daddies
back at home

456
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,765
get sent back in pieces.

457
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,845
And just like that,
Federov got his dirty little war

458
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,567
and Mother Russia got its oil.

459
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,123
- You dropped the building?
- No.

460
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,009
Federov was smart enough to know

461
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,403
that he couldn't handle
an operation like that,

462
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,204
keep it a secret.

463
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,842
- We ran it for you?
- It's to ask how.

464
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,006
All we did was sit back
and watch everybody die.

465
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,084
Would you like some water?

466
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,329
Sorry about the treatment.

467
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,482
If it makes a difference,
I argued against it.

468
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,042
You ran Peter Devereaux from 1998

469
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,571
until his retirement in 2008.

470
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,731
On April 17th of this year,
you went to Lausanne

471
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,930
under the name Sanders
and reactivated him.

472
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,775
- Show me your tits.
- Excuse me?

473
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,087
I assume that's why Weinstein
sent you, isn't it?

474
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,641
It certainly isn't
for your acumen.

475
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,559
- Fuck you.
- You like being on top?

476
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,530
Working your way up the ladder?
I like the other guys better.

477
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,285
Where the fuck are the other guys?

478
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:49,011
- This room is soundproof.
- You don't think I know that?

479
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,445
I approved the use and design
of this facility.

480
00:45:52,446 --> 00:45:54,283
I wrote the manual
you're going by.

481
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,882
I know how long until you
switch operational procedure.

482
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,929
You stupid twat.

483
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,963
You may know the procedure,

484
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,410
but then you also know
that I have the right

485
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,722
to vary the procedure
if I deem it necessary.

486
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,281
Based on the tenor
of this conversation,

487
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,569
I am inclined to vary the procedure.

488
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,365
<i>You know what?
I don't give a fuck</i>

489
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,170
<i>about the people I've killed.</i>

490
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,371
<i>If by some stroke of pure luck
you manage to kill me,</i>

491
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,000
<i>then I won't give a fuck
about that either.</i>

492
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,487
<i>That was quite a speech.</i>

493
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,722
<i>You bring out the best in me.</i>

494
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,885
Not exactly accurate,
that last statement you made.

495
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,088
Keeping him engaged
was an advantage, sir.

496
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,049
Yes, to him.

497
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,410
I don't know
if he's too in your head,

498
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,324
and maybe you're mad because
you never had a daddy,

499
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,005
I don't know,
and frankly I don't care.

500
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,844
He played you for a fool.

501
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,570
- I'll get him.
- Will you?

502
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,764
It doesn't feel that way
from here, son,

503
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,571
from here it feels like you're
busy trying to please him.

504
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,484
What, you still admire the man?

505
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,290
I did.

506
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,402
Well... here's what
he thought of you.

507
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,603
Hey, you. Hey!

508
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,521
How'd you get in here?

509
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,961
All she wants
is to be at your place.

510
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,724
My God, you're
an ungrateful bitch!

511
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,486
Mommy's gonna turn you
into a handbag.

512
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,850
- OK, then.
- "OK, then?"

513
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,686
What is that?
We've been passing each other

514
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:04,125
on the stairs for eight weeks.

515
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,489
Who are you anyway?

516
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,639
I mean, sure, you're mildly
attractive and mysterious,

517
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,928
but it gets kind of tired
after a while, you know?

518
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,289
I mean, I don't even
know your name.

519
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,365
David.

520
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,604
Well, I'm Sarah.

521
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,081
Did you ever think that maybe
Mira is better wherever she is?

522
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,525
Your girl witnessed Federov and
a CIA agent conspire to start a war

523
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:54,091
that killed hundreds
of thousands of people.

524
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,447
So whoever gets to her first
owns Federov.

525
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,087
And believe me...

526
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,083
...someone will find her.

527
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,130
Come on.

528
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,843
What it must be like to be you.

529
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,721
Take what you want,
do as you please.

530
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,842
What happens if they come back?

531
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,203
We leave.

532
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,007
There you go.
That'll do.

533
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,610
Bottoms up.

534
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,529
What happened in Moscow?

535
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,291
Something...

536
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,402
...unfortunate.

537
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,728
What was her name?

538
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,930
Natalia.

539
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,681
Will killing him
really make it better?

540
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,131
It's a start.

541
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,329
Why did you save me?

542
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,041
Don't put your faith
in me, Alice.

543
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,242
I promise...

544
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,364
...I'll disappoint you.

545
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,523
Satie.

546
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,169
What did you say?

547
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,762
It means "my favorite"
in Russian.

548
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,122
- You speak Russian.
- Yes.

549
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,359
My parents were
university professors.

550
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,169
They taught me.

551
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,324
I found some clothes
that should fit you.

552
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,522
What if they find Mira
before you do?

553
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,929
Then no one will need you.
Your problems will be over.

554
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,328
- They'll kill her, won't they?
- Yes.

555
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,087
What if no one ever finds her?

556
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,961
No one can hide forever.

557
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,651
I can't bring you with me
where I have to go now.

558
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,442
So I can't protect you anymore.

559
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,567
Go somewhere where no one
can find you. Not even me.

560
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:49,042
Use only cash,
and wait for this to ring.

561
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,604
Sarah?

562
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,163
Sarah.

563
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,129
Sarah?

564
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,725
- David?
- I'm here.

565
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,130
It's all right.

566
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,046
Everything's gonna be all right.

567
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:40,724
He won't hurt you.
Understand?

568
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,447
- Let her go.
- "Let her go."

569
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,764
And you? What?

570
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,884
Bullets start bouncing around?

571
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,489
Tell him he needs to listen.
Tell him.

572
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,806
You need to listen.

573
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,442
You know what he's doing,
don't you?

574
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,163
He's trying to decide
what you're worth.

575
00:59:11,164 --> 00:59:12,924
He will not hurt you.

576
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,288
He still hasn't decided.

577
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,040
Ask him.

578
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,000
Ask him if you're worth saving.

579
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,645
Am I worth saving?

580
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,367
He's not answering
your question, is he?!

581
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,525
You need to make him
answer your question!

582
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,401
- Am I worth saving?!
- Yes!

583
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,363
You are!

584
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,359
You are.

585
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,759
- You like her?
- Yeah.

586
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,799
Time to finish your training.

587
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,689
What the fuck can you teach me?

588
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,161
- You gave up on me, remember?
- What did you want?

589
01:00:08,162 --> 01:00:09,402
I wanted to be better than you!

590
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,409
What does that mean?

591
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,201
To be better than me?
Be better at something?

592
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,370
- To be a better man?
- Why did you drop me?

593
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,279
Here it comes.

594
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,851
I took the shot. What was I
supposed to do? I had no choice!

595
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,561
- There's always a choice!
- Answer the fucking question!

596
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,607
You made the wrong choice.

597
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,286
I came here tonight, Mason,
to kill you.

598
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,841
I did not know
what she was to you.

599
01:00:42,842 --> 01:00:45,319
You thought
this was about Natalia?

600
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,243
No, this is about you.

601
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,248
You can be a human...

602
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,969
or a killer of humans,
but not both.

603
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,000
Eventually, one of those people
will extinguish the other one.

604
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,770
All you have to do now
is just to show me...

605
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,759
...that it's not too late for you.

606
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,160
- Come on!
- No!

607
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,131
Second chance, Mason.
Scenario...

608
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,567
- No!
- Your target has just severed

609
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,131
the femoral artery of a woman.

610
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,446
- No!
- David!

611
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,681
Has just severed the femoral artery

612
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:27,215
of a woman
you have been intimate with!

613
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,561
- What do you do?
- Let her go!

614
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,084
Fuck!

615
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,644
Celia, do you want to know
what I did?

616
01:01:53,645 --> 01:01:56,325
I know what you did, Mr. Hanley.
We're discussing why.

617
01:01:56,326 --> 01:01:59,439
No, you don't know
what I did or what I do.

618
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,047
Ergo, how the fuck could you
possibly comprehend why?

619
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,007
- Let's start at the top.
- Look, what do you think

620
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,202
it is we do here at the agency?

621
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,044
- We collect information.
- No. Information is useless.

622
01:02:13,045 --> 01:02:15,327
That changes overnight.
Knowledge isn't power.

623
01:02:15,328 --> 01:02:18,449
People are power!
We collect people!

624
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,361
And if anyone's listening at Langley,

625
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:24,202
with half a brain in their head,
they know what I'm talking about!

626
01:02:24,203 --> 01:02:27,568
I'm talking about
the ownership of Arkady Federov!

627
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,288
Are you listening?!
Arkady Federov!

628
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,200
Sir, welcome
to the Hotel Imperial.

629
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,041
- Edgar.
- Alice.

630
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,883
What are you doing here?
Are you all right?

631
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:17,609
What happened to you
at the restaurant?

632
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,766
I decided to tell you everything
I know about Arkady Federov.

633
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,884
Come in.

634
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,241
You know he's in town right now
for a European energy conference.

635
01:03:29,242 --> 01:03:32,881
- Staying at the Imperial Hotel.
- No, I didn't.

636
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,003
I'm surprised to see you.

637
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,367
Can I get you a drink?
A cup of coffee or something?

638
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,568
No, thank you.

639
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,451
That's my wall of shame.

640
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,251
There were hundreds of girls
that came out of the conflict.

641
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,931
- We're a small organization.
- Let me get my Dictaphone.

642
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,522
There was one girl, Mira.

643
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,127
Pretended she was a mute.

644
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,888
Federov... liked her.

645
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,329
Kept her close to him.

646
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,641
Like a pet.

647
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,731
Mason, David. Access code: three-niner-zero-four-two.

648
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,003
- Get in the corner.
- Leave the poor girl alone.

649
01:06:50,004 --> 01:06:51,126
What the fuck...

650
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,287
Natalia didn't expect
to see me in Moscow.

651
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,529
She didn't even know
I was coming!

652
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,683
- What did you do?
- She was...

653
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,159
...these past few months,
she was acting erratically.

654
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,655
Analysts thought she was becoming...

655
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,319
- Bullshit!
- It happens!

656
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,368
So they decided to pull her.

657
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,130
I couldn't get to her
without them knowing.

658
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,008
If she came to our side,
she was going to die.

659
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,322
Sending you was her only chance.

660
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,801
Why?

661
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,559
- Why?
- Agency suspected for years

662
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,530
that Federov started the war
by dropping the building

663
01:07:31,531 --> 01:07:33,095
on his own men,

664
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,600
then blaming it on
the Chechen nationalists.

665
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,204
Then Natalia reaches out to me.
Says she's got an eyewitness,

666
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,125
who will swear that Federov
was involved.

667
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:44,849
We did it!

668
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,329
We did it!

669
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,205
Who the fuck you been talking to?

670
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,926
People you should have been
talking to!

671
01:07:52,927 --> 01:07:55,844
Who was it on our side?
Now don't fucking lie to me!

672
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:06,327
The same man who picked up
Natalia's mayday demand.

673
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,687
The same man who ordered
her extraction.

674
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:13,050
And the same man who
quarterbacked the hit on her.

675
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,365
Come in.

676
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,963
Devereaux has a daughter.

677
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,884
Her name's Lucy.

678
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,242
These pictures are from
five years ago.

679
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,129
She'd be 12 by now.

680
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,721
Natalia Ulanova was her mother.

681
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,528
And Devereaux raises her.

682
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,759
When Devereaux was in Berlin,
he recruited Natalia,

683
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,569
convinced her to spy for us.

684
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,565
He had a whole goddamn family
hidden from all of us.

685
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,682
Mira can destroy Weinstein.

686
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,162
That's why he had Mason
kill Natalia.

687
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,003
That's why he's going after Mira.

688
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,450
The girl wasn't a peasant
or a mute.

689
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,611
Both her parents
were university professors.

690
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,639
She could speak English
and Russian.

691
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,484
Everything that Federov said
she understood.

692
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,402
- I'm here to see Lebedynko.
- Your bag.

693
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,444
Hands up, please.

694
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,559
Why are you here?

695
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,801
Peter Devereaux needs a big favor.

696
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,641
- What do you got?
- This woman.

697
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,409
Alice Fournier, deceased.

698
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,361
April 2005. Cancer.

699
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,721
Then who is she? She was in
the restaurant with Devereaux.

700
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,448
I'll run a biometric match.

701
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,801
Welcome to Hotel Imperial.

702
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,686
- Peter?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

703
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,122
- I'm going to visit Arkady Federov.
<i>- Are you insane?</i>

704
01:10:43,123 --> 01:10:44,845
I've made the decision
to confront him.

705
01:10:44,846 --> 01:10:47,002
<i>This is suicide.
He will kill you.</i>

706
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,931
<i>Don't be foolish!
Mira? Mira!</i>

707
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,726
Who are you?

708
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,291
I'm the gift from Simi Denisov.

709
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,209
What's this for?

710
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,765
OK. Upstairs.

711
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,039
Come in.

712
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,201
Turn around.

713
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,770
Denisov is very generous.

714
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,204
- Get in the bed.
- I'd like to wash first.

715
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,199
I have an audio file match.

716
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,725
Label's been changed.

717
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,083
Border intake interview.

718
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,805
<i>My name is Mira Filipova.</i>

719
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,122
<i>My parents were murdered
by the Russian general,</i>

720
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,608
<i>Arkady Federov.</i>

721
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,565
<i>I survived.</i>

722
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,121
Arkady Federov
is in Belgrade right now

723
01:13:45,122 --> 01:13:46,610
for an energy conference.

724
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,970
Find out where he's staying.

725
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,010
- You are not going to kill me.
- You're wrong.

726
01:15:54,011 --> 01:15:55,759
No.

727
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,321
If you were,
I'd already be dead.

728
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,246
You don't know what
you're doing, do you?

729
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,130
This is for my family.

730
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,203
My God.

731
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,731
Mira.

732
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,359
So many people who want me dead.

733
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,203
And yet here you are.

734
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,527
The angry little girl

735
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,521
who didn't know how to fuck.

736
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,209
- And now we talk.
- Shut up!

737
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,399
OK, OK.
Maybe you will kill me.

738
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,243
We will see.

739
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,999
But making you into a woman...

740
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,559
It is one of the sweetest
memories I carry with me.

741
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,805
Shut up!

742
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,486
Did you forget who I am?

743
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,721
Mira! Mira, don't!
Don't do it.

744
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,042
- I want him to die.
- He will.

745
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,801
But once he tells
the world what he did.

746
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,885
Where's your phone?
Get it.

747
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,762
Go get it now!
Start filming.

748
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,809
Nineteen ninety-nine.

749
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,604
You supported an American operation

750
01:18:16,605 --> 01:18:18,602
to impersonate Chechen terrorists.

751
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,162
Who was the American agent
who ran it?

752
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,962
You are sit on my shirt.

753
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,206
Mira, take this.

754
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,646
Shoot him if you have to.

755
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,643
You are not going to kill me.

756
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,849
That's for you to decide.

757
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,602
We're gonna play a little game

758
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:56,602
that I believe was invented
in your country.

759
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,286
I'll ask you once more.

760
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,524
Who was the American agent?

761
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,889
I'll ask you again.

762
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,010
Was it Weinstein?

763
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,930
Come on!

764
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,601
The stairs.

765
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,559
You piece of shit!

766
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,007
Your odds are running out.

767
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,047
Who was the American agent?

768
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,648
Was it Weinstein?

769
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,330
Hanley.

770
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:02,608
John Hanley.

771
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,607
- Hanley?
- Yeah.

772
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,799
Was it this guy?
The guy in the middle?

773
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,847
No.

774
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,565
Peter.

775
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,719
That's him.

776
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,449
The bald guy.

777
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,203
Go. Here you go, take this.

778
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,282
- Use the service elevator.
- What about you?

779
01:21:07,283 --> 01:21:08,882
Check into the Hyatt Hotel.

780
01:21:08,883 --> 01:21:10,802
If I don't turn up,
go to the Dutch embassy.

781
01:21:10,803 --> 01:21:13,004
Identify yourself
and tell them everything.

782
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:14,843
- Ask for asylum. Go.
- OK.

783
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,043
- He's heading to the basement.
- Repeat that.

784
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,041
<i>He's gotta be heading
to the basement.</i>

785
01:22:06,042 --> 01:22:08,611
<i>- Cover the back stairs.</i>
- Traveling.

786
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,086
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

787
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,085
You go that way.

788
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,895
Check this out.

789
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,491
- Jesus.
- You need to see something.

790
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,448
<i>Who was the American agent?</i>

791
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,210
<i>Was it Weinstein?</i>

792
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,050
<i>Hanley.</i>

793
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,086
<i>- John...</i>
- This is messed up.

794
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,439
<i>...Hanley.</i>

795
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,522
We're taking this
to Weinstein right now.

796
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:52,688
You, stay.
Tits, back to your desk.

797
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,405
Sit.

798
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,325
You know who sits here?

799
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,802
Your boss sits here.
I'm sitting here.

800
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,884
So sit down.

801
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,324
Peter?

802
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,090
Thank God you're alive.

803
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,644
What happened?

804
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,730
You can disappear.
I'll help you.

805
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,850
Name a city, I'll get you there.
I have contacts.

806
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,249
People who can help you start again.

807
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,200
People who can make sure
you'll never be found.

808
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,288
I'm not running ever again.

809
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,925
Running is better than dead.

810
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,161
Thank you, Peter,
for saving my life.

811
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,728
Letting you die
was never an option.

812
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,004
Come on.
We've gotta get moving.

813
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,009
A lot has changed
in a very short time.

814
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,851
What were you doing a week ago?

815
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,242
Living my life.

816
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,486
What's in Peter Devereaux's life?

817
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,889
Simple things.

818
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,850
A home in Lausanne.

819
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,444
A small business.

820
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,808
It's a cafe by a lake.

821
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,811
And a daughter...

822
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,004
...who never got to know
her mother,

823
01:27:17,005 --> 01:27:18,764
and who barely knows her father.

824
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,687
- What's her name?
- Lucy.

825
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,205
She's 12.

826
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,364
Where is she now?

827
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,202
Waiting for her father to pick
her up from boarding school.

828
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,482
<i>- Lucy?</i>
- Never had you pegged

829
01:27:45,483 --> 01:27:48,848
for the father type, Peter.
That such a lovely little girl

830
01:27:48,849 --> 01:27:51,650
<i>could come from your DNA
defies logic.</i>

831
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,561
Really, you should say something.

832
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,764
I'll kill you.

833
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:04,559
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

834
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,685
Funny thing, Peter.
Turns out the keys to Federov

835
01:28:07,686 --> 01:28:10,001
are worth more to Langley
than any qualms

836
01:28:10,002 --> 01:28:11,922
Weinstein had with my methods.

837
01:28:11,923 --> 01:28:13,888
<i>I'm running the show here now, Peter.</i>

838
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:16,008
<i>Weinstein's back in the States.</i>

839
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,690
He seemed surprised
when they sent him home.

840
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:25,084
But not as surprised
as you probably are right now.

841
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,882
You know,
if it's any consolation,

842
01:28:27,883 --> 01:28:30,360
it was your boy, Mason,
who brought Lucy in for me.

843
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,281
<i>I just thought, well,
you should be proud.</i>

844
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,159
<i>He did good, didn't he?</i>

845
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,401
Found that soft underbelly.

846
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,844
Wasn't sure you had one.

847
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,279
Yeah. The boy did good.

848
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,805
<i>OK, the fortress.</i>

849
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:50,408
Eight a.m.
Where they play chess?

850
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,970
You bring me Mira,
I'll give you your daughter.

851
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,719
You're a weapon, Mason.
A damn good one.

852
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,722
I value that.

853
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,728
We gotta get out of here right now.

854
01:29:10,729 --> 01:29:12,365
Go to the train station.

855
01:29:12,366 --> 01:29:14,282
Book three tickets on
the noon train to Junik.

856
01:29:14,283 --> 01:29:15,519
The border there is weak.

857
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,005
He doesn't want you,
he wants me.

858
01:29:17,006 --> 01:29:18,206
We'll meet you there.

859
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,804
- We'll be there!
- And if you're not?

860
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,088
Then I guess I didn't make it.

861
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,291
They're gonna kill us all.

862
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,646
How would it happen?

863
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,370
You don't feel anything.

864
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,610
How can you be so sure?

865
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,488
A bullet travels at over
4,000 feet per second.

866
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,085
Four times faster
than the speed of sound.

867
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,519
The effect of that velocity

868
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,684
is... absolute.

869
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,051
You just...

870
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,730
...cease to exist.

871
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,889
Just be there, please.

872
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,603
<i>Attention, please.
The train from Chardok</i>

873
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,080
<i>is late by one hour.</i>

874
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,924
You tell yourself
no one's gonna get hurt.

875
01:30:54,925 --> 01:30:56,843
At least no one you care about.

876
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,846
- You played it well, though.
- Did I?

877
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,042
You know what Federov's
going to do

878
01:31:07,043 --> 01:31:08,929
when he secures the presidency?

879
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,369
Change the world.

880
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,727
Russia's gonna join fucking NATO.

881
01:31:13,728 --> 01:31:15,165
Why?

882
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,966
Because I got my hand so far up
his ass, I'm moving his lips.

883
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,650
I own him.

884
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,371
This is what we worked for
all those years.

885
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,730
You know it is.

886
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,926
Yeah, I think I got something
for you here.

887
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,319
Yes, she's at train station.

888
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,046
Just bought three tickets to
Junik with a credit card.

889
01:32:22,047 --> 01:32:24,327
- She should be there.
- Thank you.

890
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,529
You think, maybe...

891
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,365
...just maybe you might
have crossed the line with this?

892
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,167
Along time ago, my friend.

893
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:38,411
You'll need proof of life,
of course.

894
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,279
- Hello.
- Your father.

895
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,647
Papa? Is that you?

896
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,730
<i>How you doing, kiddo?</i>

897
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,284
<i>I know you're scared.</i>

898
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,447
But everything's gonna be
all right, I promise you.

899
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,647
<i>I just wanted to hear your voice.</i>

900
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:12,523
<i>And tell you Have you more
than anything in this world.</i>

901
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,368
I love you too, Papa.

902
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,411
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

903
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,371
OK. Where's Mira Filipova?

904
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:37,647
Bus station.
Bus to Novi Sad, nine a.m.

905
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:44,847
Bus station. Bus to Novi Sad,
nine a.m. Bring her in.

906
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,924
Jones, you go with him.

907
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,639
You misjudged the kid.

908
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,723
He's a survivor.
Not like you.

909
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,844
No.

910
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,447
We bring Mira in,
you have my word,

911
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,884
you'll have your daughter back.

912
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,201
You know what we
used to call you, Peter?

913
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,088
The November Man.

914
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,603
'Cause after you passed through,

915
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,051
nothing lived.

916
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:41,203
You are one bleak
motherfucker, my friend.

917
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,247
- Bus station is that way.
- Shortcut.

918
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,841
Slow down.

919
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,088
- Slow the fucking car down!
- Seatbelt.

920
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,684
Stop the vehicle, right now!

921
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,645
Wall.

922
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,204
- Mason, you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

923
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:54,159
Not one American life was lost
in that Chechen mess. Not one.

924
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:57,767
- You're right.
- East versus West. Fuck that.

925
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,446
From now on,
it's the civilized world

926
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,601
against the goddamn Middle East.

927
01:38:02,602 --> 01:38:04,682
Now, that's a fight
I can understand.

928
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,723
That's a fight we can win.

929
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,691
Don't you get it?

930
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,002
- Hanley.
- What?

931
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,209
- Why are you sweating?
- 'Cause it's fucking hot.

932
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,606
Excuse me.
I'm still using this station.

933
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,845
Thank you.

934
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,366
Where's Lucy? You were supposed
to bring her here

935
01:39:48,367 --> 01:39:51,569
- when it was done.
- It is.

936
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:18,006
You just doomed us to another
decade of conflict. Of shit!

937
01:40:18,007 --> 01:40:19,525
I hope you know that!

938
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:24,169
The thing is,
I like it this way.

939
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:28,329
Thank you.

940
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,651
Papa!

941
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,044
Where is she?

942
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,724
Where is she?

943
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,887
- Peter!
- There she is.

944
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,321
Let's catch a train.
Come on.

945
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,167
<i>My name is Mira Filipova.</i>

946
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,605
When I was 15 years old,

947
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,766
Arkady Federov murdered my family,

948
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,487
and held me captive for two years.

949
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,965
I was repeatedly abused by him.

950
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,479
During that time,

951
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:09,485
I witnessed Federov conspire
with CIA agent John Hanley

952
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:12,129
to bomb a civilian building.

953
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,207
That bombing was the start
of the second Chechen war.

<i>The revelations of Chechnyan refugee</i>
