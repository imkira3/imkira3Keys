<i>Where's my suitcase?</i>

3
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,550
Miss. Young lady!

4
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:35,617
Excuse me. Girls!

5
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:38,653
Hey, little fella. Hey!

6
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:41,223
Excuse me, girls. Girls!

7
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:42,992
Hey, big fella!

8
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:45,459
Help me make the beds
in the living room.

9
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:46,824
Come on down here!

10
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:48,966
Hey, son!

11
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,235
Big fella.
Hey, little guy! Little guy!

12
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:57,369
Pete's brother
and his family are here.

13
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,168
<i>Trish is going to Montreal.</i>

14
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:02,006
Montreal? Oh, her family's there.

15
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:03,681
<i>- Then we're off.
- When?</i>

16
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,975
<i>- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready, are you?</i>

17
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,277
Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie...

18
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:10,819
...but the big kids can.

19
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,285
Why can't I?

20
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:13,684
I'm on the phone.

21
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,788
When do you come back?
Not till then?

22
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:19,759
It's not even rated R.
He's just being a jerk.

23
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:23,491
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...

24
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,363
...then it must be really bad.

25
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:28,699
No, we put the dog in the kennel...
Hey, get off!

26
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,135
Kevin, out of the room.

27
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:32,640
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't you?

28
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:33,942
This kid.

29
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:36,580
Did you pick up
a voltage adaptor thing?

30
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,306
No, I didn't have time.

31
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:41,315
- Then how do I shave in France?
- Grow a goatee.

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,647
Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

33
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:48,156
I've got something, pick up those
MicroMachines that are all over.

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,351
Aunt Leslie almost broke her neck.

35
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:52,860
He was playing
with the glue gun again.

36
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:54,358
We talked about that.

37
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:57,634
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

38
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,736
I made ornaments out of fish hooks.

39
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:03,837
- My new fish hooks?
- I can't make them out of old ones...

40
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,476
...with dry worm guts stuck on them.

41
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:10,404
- Peter.
- Come on, Kevin. Out.

42
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,842
Do you guys have a voltage adaptor?

43
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:14,518
Here's a voltage adapter!

44
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,349
God, you're getting heavy!
Go pack your suitcase.

45
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:22,592
Pack my suitcase?

46
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:25,325
- Where's the shampoo?
- I don't live here.

47
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:27,761
This many people here and no shampoo.

48
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,991
- Are your folks home?
- They don't live here.

49
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:32,830
- Tracy, did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.

50
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:35,029
Excuse me. Are your parents here?

51
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,832
My parents live in Paris.

52
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,066
- Hi!
- Hi!

53
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:39,710
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:41,846
- Do they live here?
- No.

55
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,509
Why should they?
All kids, no parents.

56
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,116
Probably a fancy orphanage.

57
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:51,249
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done it once.

58
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,583
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

59
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,054
What did I say?

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,284
You told him "Tough."

61
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:59,931
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What was I supposed to say?

62
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,861
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

63
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,500
- I'm not an idiot!
- Really?

64
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,728
You're helpless! We have to do
everything for you.

65
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:10,204
- She's right, Kev.
- Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm small.

66
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,967
I don't know how to pack.

67
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:15,613
- I hope you didn't just pack crap.
- Shut up, Linnie.

68
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:17,247
You know what I should pack?

69
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,748
Buzz told you, cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

70
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,782
What are you so worried about?

71
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:26,753
You know Mom's gonna
pack your stuff, anyway.

72
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,985
<i>You're what the French call
les incompetents.</i>

73
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:31,219
What?

74
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,089
Bombs away!

75
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:42,034
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

76
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,971
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.

77
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:48,976
This house is so full of people
it makes me sick!

78
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,911
When I grow up and get married,
I'm living alone!

79
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,141
Did you hear me?

80
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:54,910
I'm living alone!

81
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:57,748
I'm living alone!

82
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,493
Who's gonna feed your spider?

83
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:06,961
He just ate a load of mice guts.
He'll be good for a couple weeks.

84
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,634
Is it true French babes
don't shave their pits?

85
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:13,336
Some don't.

86
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:16,431
But they got nude beaches.

87
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,766
Not in the winter.

88
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:27,978
Don't you know how to knock,
phlegm-wad?

89
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:31,618
Can I sleep here?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

90
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,654
If he drinks, he'll wet the bed.

91
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:38,390
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

92
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,860
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

93
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:48,862
Who's he?

94
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:53,438
You ever heard of the South Bend
Shovel Slayer?

95
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:55,204
That's him.

96
00:05:55,414 --> 00:06:00,215
In '58 he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...

97
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,344
...with a snow shovel.

98
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,881
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

99
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:10,721
If he's the shovel slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?

100
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:12,692
Not enough evidence to convict.

101
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:15,457
They never found the bodies.

102
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,692
Everyone around here knows he did it.

103
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,237
It'll just be a matter of time...

104
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,430
...before he does it again.

105
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,606
What's he doing?

106
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:27,468
He walks up and down the streets
every night...

107
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,977
...salting the sidewalks.

108
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,116
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

109
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,514
No way.

110
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,622
See that garbage can full of salt?

111
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:42,121
That's where he keeps his victims.

112
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:47,094
The salt turns the bodies
into mummies.

113
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,091
Mummies!

114
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:56,766
Look out!

115
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,936
How you kids doing?

116
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:32,269
Good?

117
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,905
Lot of action around here today, huh?

118
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:36,774
Going on vacation?

119
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:38,505
Where you going?

120
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,241
You hear me, or what?

121
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,249
Going on a trip?

122
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:44,415
Where you going, kid?

123
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:56,700
Okay, that's $122.50.

124
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,229
Not from me, kid. I don't live here.

125
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,405
You just around for the holidays?

126
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,868
You could say that.

127
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,666
- Pizza's here!
- There you go.

128
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:06,844
That's $122.50.

129
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,104
It's my brother's house.
He'll get it.

130
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,376
Hey, listen...

131
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,651
- Are you Mr. McCallister?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:18,755
The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

133
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,448
Good, because somebody owes me $122.50.

134
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,649
I'd like a word with you.

135
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:25,125
Am I under arrest or something?

136
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:29,200
There's always a lot of burglaries
around the holidays.

137
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:33,497
We're checking the neighborhood to see
if the proper precautions are taken.

138
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:37,742
We have automatic timers for our
lights, locks for our doors.

139
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:39,968
That's about as well
as anybody can do.

140
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:42,237
- Did you get some eggnog?
- Come on.

141
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:43,914
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

142
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:45,047
- Eggnog?
- Pizza!

143
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,583
- Are you gonna be leaving...?
- Pizza!

144
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,588
Grab a napkin
and pour your own drinks.

145
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,420
- Does Santa go through customs?
- What time do we have to go to bed?

146
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:59,529
Early. We're leaving at 8 a.m.
On the button.

147
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:03,497
I hope you're all drinking milk.
I want to get rid of it.

148
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:08,264
- Pizza boy needs $122.50, plus tip.
- For pizza?

149
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,201
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

150
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,876
- You've got money.
- Traveler's checks.

151
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:15,171
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

152
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,577
You probably got the checks
that don't work in France.

153
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:21,680
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

154
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:23,887
Yeah. But if you want any...

155
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:27,547
...somebody's gonna have to barf it up
because it's gone.

156
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:31,585
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

157
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,432
Kev! Kev, get a plate.

158
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,214
- Passports!
- Watch it!

159
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:59,089
No, no. Get these passports
out of here.

160
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:05,495
Are you okay, honey? Come here.

161
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:06,595
Are you all right?

162
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,459
What is the matter with you?

163
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,461
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

164
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,704
He knows I hate sausage and olives...

165
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,396
Look what you did, you little jerk!

166
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:31,283
Get upstairs now.

167
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:32,512
Why?

168
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:34,351
You're such a disease.

169
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:36,958
- Shut up!
- Kevin, upstairs!

170
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:39,323
- Say good night, Kevin.
- "Good night, Kevin."

171
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,200
Why do I get treated like scum?

172
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,962
I'm sorry. This house is just crazy.

173
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:50,266
We've got all these extra kids
running around.

174
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:52,705
My brother's in from Ohio.
It's nuts.

175
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:55,436
How come you didn't bring
more cheese pizzas?

176
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:57,540
Nice tip. Thanks.

177
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:00,315
Having a reunion?

178
00:11:00,518 --> 00:11:04,614
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris. His kids are still here.

179
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:07,519
He missed the family,
so he invited us to Paris...

180
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:08,818
...so we'll be together.

181
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,493
You're taking a trip to Paris?

182
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,686
Yes, we leave tomorrow morning.

183
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,063
Excellent. Excellent.

184
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,326
If you'll excuse me, this one's
a little out of sorts.

185
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:21,232
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband.

186
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,236
And don't worry about your home.
It's in good hands.

187
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:32,339
There are 15 people, and only you
have to make trouble.

188
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,915
I'm getting dumped on.

189
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,917
You're the only one acting up.
Now get upstairs.

190
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:39,454
I am upstairs, dummy!

191
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,852
The third floor?

192
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,221
- Go.
- It's scary up there.

193
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,260
Fuller'll be up in a little while.

194
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:49,558
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
He wets the bed.

195
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:51,998
He'll pee all over me. I know it.

196
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:54,000
We'll put him somewhere else.

197
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:56,603
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:59,239
It's too late. Get upstairs.

199
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,338
Everyone in this family hates me!

200
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,676
Then ask Santa for a new family.

201
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:10,412
I don't want a new family. I don't
want any family. Families suck!

202
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:13,716
Stay up there. I don't want
to see you again tonight.

203
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:16,450
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

204
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:19,129
I don't want to see
anybody else either.

205
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,423
I hope you don't mean that.

206
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:25,399
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up
and didn't have a family.

207
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:27,604
No, I wouldn't.

208
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:30,434
Then say it again.
Maybe it'll happen.

209
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:33,770
I hope I never see any
of you jerks again!

210
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,694
<i>I wish they would all just disappear.</i>

211
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,860
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8 sharp.

212
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:07,670
Peter!

213
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:11,571
We slept in!

214
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,428
Hi, I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

215
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,460
You guys going out of town?

216
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,030
We're going to Florida.

217
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:38,828
Well, first we're going to Missouri
to pick up my grandma.

218
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:41,562
You know the McCallisters
are going to France?

219
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:43,172
Do you know if it's cold?

220
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:47,970
- Do these vans get good mileage?
- Kid, I don't know. Hit the road!

221
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,881
Do a head count.
Get everyone in the vans.

222
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:55,313
Where are the passports?

223
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,420
I put them in the microwave to dry.

224
00:14:57,622 --> 00:15:01,388
How fast does this go?
Does it have automatic transmission?

225
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:03,390
Does it have 4-wheel drive?

226
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:07,463
Look, I told you before, kid.
Don't bother me. Now, beat it!

227
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:21,138
Line up in front of the van.

228
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:25,040
- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!

229
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,581
Shut up!

230
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:27,978
I need a head count.

231
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:29,880
One, two, three...

232
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:32,215
Eleven, 92, 12...

233
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:34,724
Buzz, don't be a moron.

234
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:37,860
Six, seven, eight...

235
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,656
...nine, 10, 11.

236
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:44,696
Okay, half in this van,
half in this one. Let's go.

237
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,806
Have a good trip.
Bring me back something French.

238
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,209
There's no way we'll make this plane.
It leaves in 45 minutes.

239
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,778
Think positive!

240
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:58,778
You be positive.
I'll be realistic.

241
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:02,482
Excuse me, your power is fixed...

242
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:06,248
...but the phones are a mess.
It'll take a couple of days to fix...

243
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:08,982
...especially around the holidays.
- Thanks.

244
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:10,592
Did you count heads?

245
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,524
Eleven, including me.

246
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,756
Five boys, six girls,
two drivers...

247
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,366
...and a partridge in a pear tree.

248
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,536
Hold the plane!

249
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,668
- Did we miss it?
- You just made it.

250
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:02,536
Single seats only in coach.
Take whatever's free.

251
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:04,374
I get a window seat!

252
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:11,082
- Kids are in coach, we're first class.
- Seats Four A and B.

253
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,757
Four A and B. I'll take your coats.

254
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,389
- Fasten your seat belts.
- Champagne, please.

255
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:19,756
- It's free, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.

256
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:21,765
We made it.

257
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,263
Do you believe it?

258
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:25,758
Hope we didn't forget anything.

259
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:47,742
Mom?

260
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,692
- That's real. It's real crystal.
- Yeah, so?

261
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:01,763
- Put them in your purse.
- Frank, I can't do that.

262
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,696
Just... Put them in your purse!

263
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:07,503
Yeah. Fill it up.
Fill it up.

264
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,002
Fill it up, please.

265
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:11,165
Thank you.

266
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,811
Don't you feel like a heel, flying
first class with the kids in coach?

267
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:16,445
No. The kids are fine.

268
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:20,947
The only time I ever flew as a kid was
in the station wagon, not to France.

269
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:24,052
We had to go to Aunt Laura
and Uncle Arthur's.

270
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,523
Kids are okay. They're having
the time of their lives.

271
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:30,185
Hello?

272
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,093
Mom?

273
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,933
Dad?

274
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:47,710
Where are you guys?

275
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,011
Buzz?

276
00:20:03,194 --> 00:20:04,422
Megan?

277
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:06,261
Hello?

278
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,497
Rod?

279
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:12,100
Uncle Frank?

280
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:14,863
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

281
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,704
Megan? Linnie?

282
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,071
Is this a joke?

283
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,639
It's only my imagination.

284
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,705
Only my imagination.

285
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,291
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport!

286
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:33,684
I made my family disappear.

287
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,953
<i>You're completely helpless.</i>

288
00:21:37,154 --> 00:21:38,143
<i>You know, Kevin...</i>

289
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:41,951
<i>... you're what the French call
les incompetents.</i>

290
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,161
<i>Kevin, I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.</i>

291
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:48,230
<i>Kevin, you are such a disease.</i>

292
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:53,369
<i>There are 15 people, and you're
the only one who has to make trouble.</i>

293
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:57,130
<i>Look what you did, you little jerk!</i>

294
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:04,272
I made my family disappear.

295
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,091
I'm free!

296
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:33,369
Wow!

297
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,444
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!

298
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,522
Cool! Firecrackers!

299
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:48,191
I'll save these for later.

300
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,355
Buzz, I'm going through
all your private stuff.

301
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:54,156
You better come out and pound me!

302
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,161
Buzz, your girlfriend! Woof!

303
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:51,519
<i>Who is it?</i>

304
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:56,559
<i>It's me. Snakes.</i>

305
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,058
<i>I got the stuff.</i>

306
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:01,129
<i>Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.</i>

307
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:04,529
<i>All right, Johnny,
but what about my money?</i>

308
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:05,724
<i>What money?</i>

309
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:08,166
<i>A.C. Said you had some dough for me.</i>

310
00:24:08,372 --> 00:24:11,273
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

311
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:13,443
<i>A.C. Said ten percent.</i>

312
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,012
<i>Too bad A.C. Ain't in charge no more.</i>

313
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:20,182
Guys, I'm eating junk
and watching rubbish!

314
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:22,750
You better come out and stop me!

315
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,279
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

316
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,453
<i>I'll tell you what I'm gonna
give you.</i>

317
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,360
<i>I'm gonna give you to
the count of ten...</i>

318
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:37,397
<i>... to get your ugly, yellow...</i>

319
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,796
<i>... no-good keister off my property...</i>

320
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,972
<i>... before I pump your guts
full of lead.</i>

321
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:43,606
<i>All right, I'm sorry.</i>

322
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:44,838
<i>I'm going.</i>

323
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:47,306
<i>One, two... ten.</i>

324
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,992
<i>Keep the change,
you filthy animal.</i>

325
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,059
Mom!

326
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:20,775
What's the matter?

327
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:23,338
Honey?

328
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:27,183
I have a terrible feeling.

329
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:28,316
About what?

330
00:25:29,854 --> 00:25:31,515
That we didn't do something.

331
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:34,924
You feel that way because
we left in a hurry.

332
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,854
We took care of everything.

333
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:38,358
Did I turn off the coffee?

334
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:39,922
No.

335
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:41,229
I did.

336
00:25:41,432 --> 00:25:42,899
Did you lock up?

337
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:45,427
Yeah.

338
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,202
Did you close the garage?

339
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:51,299
That's it.

340
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,909
I forgot to close the garage.
That's it.

341
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,480
No, that's not it.

342
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,352
What else could we be forgetting?

343
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:10,225
Kevin!

344
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:57,101
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are out of order.

345
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:59,833
We'll call when we land.
I'm sure it's okay.

346
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:03,603
Horrible. Horrible.

347
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,343
Just horrible.

348
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,309
How could we do this?
We forgot him.

349
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,919
We didn't forget him,
we just miscounted.

350
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:14,346
What kind of mother am I?

351
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,119
If it makes you feel any better,
I forgot my reading glasses.

352
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,633
<i>Five families gone
on one block alone.</i>

353
00:27:25,836 --> 00:27:28,771
<i>They all told me from their
own mouths.</i>

354
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:30,497
<i>It's almost too easy.</i>

355
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,133
Check it out:

356
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:34,402
All the houses with nobody home...

357
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:37,445
...have automatic timers
on their lights.

358
00:27:37,815 --> 00:27:41,046
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

359
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:47,256
Number 664 will be going on
right about...

360
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,820
...now.

361
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:52,795
Wait, wait, wait.

362
00:27:53,897 --> 00:27:56,923
Number 682...

363
00:27:57,701 --> 00:28:00,226
...right now.

364
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:03,733
Wait a minute.

365
00:28:03,941 --> 00:28:06,774
681...

366
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:08,074
...now.

367
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:14,106
And that's the one, Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

368
00:28:14,585 --> 00:28:15,813
It's very G.

369
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:18,887
Very G, huh? It's loaded.

370
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:21,353
It's got lots of top-flight goods.

371
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:24,891
- Stereos, VCRs...
- Toys?

372
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,689
Probably looking at some
very fine jewelry.

373
00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:29,497
Possible cash horde.

374
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,760
Odd marketable securities.

375
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:35,669
Who knows? It's a gem.

376
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:38,441
Grab your crowbar.

377
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,105
Crowbars up.

378
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,917
<i>You're a rotter,
Mr. Grinch</i>

379
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:51,982
<i>You're the king
Of sinful sots</i>

380
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,684
<i>Your heart's a dead tomato</i>

381
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:59,454
<i>Blotched with moldy purple spots,
Mr. Grinch</i>

382
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:41,426
Which way?

383
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,438
We'll go around back,
down the basement.

384
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:08,059
- You said they were gone.
- They were gonna leave today.

385
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,926
Let's get out of here.

386
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:48,701
We have to use the phone, please.

387
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:52,270
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

388
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,944
Please! Our brother's home alone.

389
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:57,479
Give us the phone!

390
00:30:57,781 --> 00:30:58,975
I'm sorry. Thank you.

391
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:01,845
I'm calling the police.
Book us a flight home.

392
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:04,953
Get change out of here.
Call everybody you know.

393
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:09,285
Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everyone on our street.

394
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,324
Maybe somebody can help us.

395
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:14,861
Hello? Hello?
Oh, she'll have to call you back.

396
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,636
This is ridiculous.

397
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,172
Only a wimp would be
hiding under a bed.

398
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:29,334
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

399
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:40,020
Hey, I'm not afraid anymore!

400
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,619
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!

401
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:48,962
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore.

402
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,892
Village police department.

403
00:32:21,098 --> 00:32:24,534
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

404
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:29,672
<i>I'd like somebody to go there. Tell
him that we're coming home to get him.</i>

405
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:33,434
Okay, let me connect you
with Family Crisis Intervention.

406
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:35,111
Hold on.

407
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,381
Larry, can you pick up?
There's some hyper lady on hold.

408
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,052
- What line, Rose?
- Two.

409
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,086
Family Crisis Intervention,
Sergeant Balzac.

410
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,191
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

411
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:54,057
Has the child been involved in
violence with a drunk family member?

412
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,253
No!

413
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,124
Has he been involved
in a household accident?

414
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:00,462
I don't know. I hope not.

415
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:05,866
Has the child ingested any poison
or is an object lodged in his throat?

416
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:09,568
No, he's home alone! I'd like
somebody to go over to the house...

417
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,475
...and see if he's all right.

418
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:16,244
You want us to go to your house,
just to check on him.

419
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,579
Yes!

420
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:19,787
Let me connect you to the police.

421
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,389
They just transferred me.

422
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:22,558
- Rose!
- Yeah.

423
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,783
- Hyper.
- Hang on.

424
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:27,589
- Hold on, please.
- No, please don't hang up. Please!

425
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:29,696
Any luck?

426
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:34,097
- I couldn't get anybody.
- Leslie?

427
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,602
Nothing but a bunch
of answering machines.

428
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:41,744
Somebody pick up. Pick up!

429
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:43,936
Oh, hi, ma'am. It's you again.

430
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:48,106
Look, I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone, and I...

431
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:52,049
We'll send a policeman over
to your house to check on your son.

432
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:24,980
There's nobody home.
The house looks secure.

433
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,281
Tell them to count their kids again.

434
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:30,893
You can't bump somebody or ask or...?

435
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:32,925
There's no way I can do that.

436
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,257
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

437
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:36,932
If you said it's an emergency...

438
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:38,499
I cannot ask them.

439
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,897
She's sending a policeman
over to the house.

440
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:44,005
Well, that's a relief.
Everything here is booked.

441
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,333
Nothing to Chicago?

442
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,739
There's nothing to Chicago,
New York, Nashville.

443
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:53,241
- What about a private plane?
- Sorry. We don't do that.

444
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,385
The only thing is a booking
for us on Friday morning.

445
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:59,077
Friday morn... That's two days away.

446
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:01,257
The kids are exhausted and so are you.

447
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,392
There's nothing we can do here.

448
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:08,223
I say we go over to Rob's, and that
way we can call the police again.

449
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:11,663
I'm not leaving here unless
it's on an airplane.

450
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,961
Madame, we are doing
everything we can.

451
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:18,164
If you want to stay at the airport,
maybe we can get you on standby.

452
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:21,310
It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.

453
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:24,912
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.

454
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:32,819
I'll miss you, honey.

455
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:38,556
Don't you get lost.

456
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:41,289
Goodbye.

457
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,377
I took a shower, washing every
body part with actual soap.

458
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:02,347
Including all my major crevices...

459
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:04,986
...between my toes
and in my belly button...

460
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:07,554
...which I never did before
but enjoyed.

461
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:13,062
I washed my hair with adult formula
shampoo and used creme rinse.

462
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:17,496
I can't find my toothbrush,
so I'll pick one up today.

463
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,794
Other than that, I'm in good shape.

464
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,617
All right! Buzz's life savings.

465
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,112
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.

466
00:37:59,536 --> 00:38:02,505
You're one of the great
cat burglars of the world.

467
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:05,368
You think you can keep it
down a little in there?

468
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:09,775
<i>You've reached the Murphy's.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

469
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,582
<i>This is Peter McCallister again.
We're in Paris at my brother's.</i>

470
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,242
<i>Let me give you the number here.
The country code is 33.</i>

471
00:38:18,455 --> 00:38:23,392
<i>The area code is 1-4 and the number
is 694-876...</i>

472
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:25,693
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah?

473
00:38:25,895 --> 00:38:29,296
That house we ran last night,
was that the McCallister's?

474
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,033
<i>- Call me in Paris.
- You're right. They're gone.</i>

475
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:41,002
- I knew they were.
- Silver tuna tonight.

476
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,176
Wow!

477
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,484
How may I help you?

478
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:55,455
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

479
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:57,784
Well, I don't know.

480
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:00,557
It doesn't say, hon.

481
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,229
Can you please find out?

482
00:39:05,368 --> 00:39:07,097
- Herb.
- Yeah?

483
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:10,569
I got a question here
about a toothbrush.

484
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:21,812
Do you know, is this brush approved
by the American Dental Association?

485
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:22,985
I don't know.

486
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,908
Oh, hon, you pay for that here.

487
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,878
Wait, you have to pay for that.

488
00:39:52,649 --> 00:39:54,947
Son! Son!

489
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,620
Jimmy, stop that boy!

490
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,220
Hey!

491
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:10,032
Shoplifter!

492
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,132
Hey! Hey, kid!

493
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:23,510
Come back here!

494
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:26,677
Stop it, will you?

495
00:40:27,183 --> 00:40:28,343
Come here.

496
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,320
I'm a criminal.

497
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:36,583
What's so funny?

498
00:41:38,221 --> 00:41:39,483
What's so funny?

499
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:41,081
Why are you laughing?

500
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:45,655
You did it again.

501
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,463
You left the water running.

502
00:41:49,432 --> 00:41:51,866
Why do you do that?
I told you not to do it.

503
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:54,434
- It's our calling card.
- Calling card.

504
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,798
All the great ones leave their mark.

505
00:41:57,006 --> 00:41:58,598
We're the wet bandits.

506
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:01,568
You're sick, you know?
You're really sick.

507
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:04,175
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.

508
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,608
It's a sick thing to do.

509
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:14,286
- We don't need that.
- Don't tell me...

510
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,356
I can do it if I want to.

511
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,759
It's not sick. Hey, watch out!

512
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,438
Hey! Hey!

513
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,540
You've gotta watch for traffic.

514
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:34,843
- Sorry.
- Damn.

515
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:37,444
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes, buddy.

516
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:39,710
Okay, okay.

517
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,676
Merry Christmas.

518
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:54,194
What's the matter?

519
00:42:54,564 --> 00:42:56,896
I don't like the way
that kid looked at me.

520
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,536
- Ever seen him before?
- I saw a hundred kids this week.

521
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,335
Let's see what house he goes into.

522
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,236
Why's he going faster?

523
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,533
I told you something's wrong.

524
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,733
He looked at me weird.
Why would he run?

525
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,643
Maybe he went in the church.

526
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:22,646
- I'm not going in there.
- Me neither.

527
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,078
Let's get out of here.

528
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:46,238
When those guys come back,
I'll be ready.

529
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:12,425
Did they come back?

530
00:45:12,935 --> 00:45:14,732
From Paris?

531
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,705
We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone.

532
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:56,034
We better go before somebody sees us.

533
00:46:27,677 --> 00:46:29,645
Look what I found in the kitchen.

534
00:46:29,846 --> 00:46:31,939
Frank, those are for later.

535
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:39,119
Do you want a little shrimp, huh?

536
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,984
Do you speak English?

537
00:46:45,528 --> 00:46:46,859
Well, is there...

538
00:46:52,668 --> 00:46:55,865
- Did you get anybody?
- I am looking for my son!

539
00:46:56,072 --> 00:46:57,767
No, I can't find anybody.

540
00:46:57,974 --> 00:47:01,068
They're all shopping.
Nobody's home for the holidays.

541
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:02,869
Never mind, forget it.

542
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,508
- This is so pointless.
- What?

543
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:09,143
We're here rotting in this apartment.

544
00:47:09,352 --> 00:47:11,547
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.

545
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:14,517
- So?
- You're not worried about Kevin?

546
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:19,593
Why should I be? He acted like a jerk
and now he caught it in the butt.

547
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:22,593
He's so little and helpless.

548
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,232
Don't you think he's freaked?

549
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:27,493
The trout can use a couple of days
in the real world.

550
00:47:27,703 --> 00:47:29,967
You're not worried
something might happen?

551
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,741
No. For three reasons:

552
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:37,641
A. I'm not that lucky.
Two: We have smoke detectors...

553
00:47:37,847 --> 00:47:41,749
...and D: We live in the most boring
street in the United States...

554
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:46,251
...where nothing even remotely
dangerous will ever happen. Period.

555
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:14,347
<i>Who is it?</i>

556
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,780
It's Little Nero's.
I have your pizza.

557
00:48:17,386 --> 00:48:20,048
<i>Leave it on the doorstep
and get out of here.</i>

558
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,457
Okay.

559
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:25,224
What about the money?

560
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:28,062
<i>What money?</i>

561
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,556
Well, you have to pay
for your pizza, sir.

562
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:35,902
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

563
00:48:37,406 --> 00:48:39,237
That'll be $11.80, sir.

564
00:48:46,682 --> 00:48:49,310
<i>Keep the change, you filthy animal.</i>

565
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,949
<i>- Cheapskate.
- Hey.</i>

566
00:48:53,155 --> 00:48:55,487
<i>I'm gonna give you
to the count of ten...</i>

567
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:58,057
<i>... to get your ugly, yellow...</i>

568
00:48:58,261 --> 00:49:00,388
<i>... no-good keister
off my property...</i>

569
00:49:00,596 --> 00:49:02,689
<i>... before I pump you full of lead.</i>

570
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:05,595
<i>One, two... ten.</i>

571
00:49:33,729 --> 00:49:36,892
A lovely cheese pizza, just for me.

572
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:41,827
<i>- To Dallas/Forth Worth.</i>

573
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:43,869
<i>American Airlines...</i>

574
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:48,132
So we have the $500,
the pocket translator...

575
00:49:48,344 --> 00:49:50,710
...the two first-class seats,
that's an upgrade...

576
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:52,107
Is that a real Rolex?

577
00:49:53,816 --> 00:49:56,148
- Do you think it is?
- No.

578
00:49:56,352 --> 00:49:59,549
But who can tell?
I also have a ring.

579
00:49:59,755 --> 00:50:01,655
Oh, that is beautiful!

580
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:03,154
They're boarding.

581
00:50:03,759 --> 00:50:07,024
She's offered us two first-class
tickets if we go Friday.

582
00:50:07,229 --> 00:50:11,495
Plus a ring, a watch,
a pocket translator, $500 and...

583
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:12,998
The earrings.

584
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:17,035
She's got her own earrings.
A whole shoebox full of them.

585
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:18,831
- Come on, come on.
- No, but...

586
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:21,308
I'm desperate.

587
00:50:22,411 --> 00:50:26,177
I'm begging you.
From a mother to a mother. Please!

588
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,911
- Oh, Ed.
- Please!

589
00:50:31,921 --> 00:50:33,684
Oh, all right.

590
00:50:39,395 --> 00:50:41,920
<i>"Dear Santa, I got a little sister
last year.</i>

591
00:50:42,131 --> 00:50:44,725
<i>This year I'd rather have
some Clay-Doh. "</i>

592
00:50:58,614 --> 00:50:59,672
I didn't mean it.

593
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:02,942
If you come back, I'll never be
a pain in the butt again.

594
00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:06,516
I promise. Good night.

595
00:51:26,008 --> 00:51:29,171
<i>I'm dreaming</i>

596
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,640
<i>Of a white</i>

597
00:51:31,747 --> 00:51:33,738
<i>Christmas</i>

598
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:38,147
<i>Just like the ones
I used to know</i>

599
00:51:40,356 --> 00:51:44,156
<i>Where those treetops glisten</i>

600
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,091
<i>And children listen</i>

601
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:53,234
<i>To hear sleigh bells
In the snow</i>

602
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:55,596
<i>The snow</i>

603
00:52:47,756 --> 00:52:49,621
Are those microwave dinners good?

604
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:53,055
- I don't know.
- I'll give them a whirl.

605
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:00,091
For the kids.

606
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:04,599
Hold on, I got a coupon for that.

607
00:53:05,908 --> 00:53:07,808
It was in the paper this morning.

608
00:53:11,514 --> 00:53:12,446
$19.83.

609
00:53:13,082 --> 00:53:14,344
Okay.

610
00:53:18,454 --> 00:53:19,853
Are you here all by yourself?

611
00:53:21,257 --> 00:53:22,918
Ma'am, I'm 8 years old.

612
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:27,391
You think I'd be here alone?
I don't think so.

613
00:53:28,297 --> 00:53:29,195
Where's your mom?

614
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:30,990
- In the car.
- Where's your dad?

615
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,101
- He's at work.
- What about brothers and sisters?

616
00:53:34,303 --> 00:53:35,668
I'm an only child.

617
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:38,265
- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you.

618
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:41,375
- Why not?
- Cause you're a stranger.

619
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:23,213
<i>Hello, Kevin!</i>

620
00:54:26,689 --> 00:54:27,917
Shut up!

621
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,832
I don't get it.

622
00:54:43,472 --> 00:54:45,599
It looks like there's nobody's home.

623
00:54:46,642 --> 00:54:48,701
Last night the place is jumping.

624
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,072
Something ain't right.

625
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:53,105
Go check it out.

626
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,251
Now?

627
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:07,253
No, tomorrow, egghead!
Now! Go ahead.

628
00:55:09,565 --> 00:55:10,657
"Now."

629
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:29,109
Shit!

630
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:33,980
<i>Get the hell out of here.</i>

631
00:55:34,189 --> 00:55:37,352
<i>All right, Johnny.
But what about my money?</i>

632
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:38,583
<i>What money?</i>

633
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,024
<i>A.C. Said you had
some dough for me.</i>

634
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,131
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

635
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:46,130
<i>A.C. Said ten percent.</i>

636
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:49,860
<i>Too bad A.C.
Ain't in charge no more.</i>

637
00:55:50,072 --> 00:55:51,232
<i>What do you mean?</i>

638
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,965
<i>He's upstairs, taking a bath.</i>

639
00:55:54,843 --> 00:55:56,936
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

640
00:55:58,447 --> 00:56:02,645
<i>Hey, I tell you what I'm
gonna give you, Snakes.</i>

641
00:56:03,352 --> 00:56:06,583
<i>- Snakes?
- I'll give you to the count of ten...</i>

642
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:08,984
<i>... to get your ugly,
yellow, no-good...</i>

643
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:11,159
<i>... keister off my property...</i>

644
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,419
<i>... before I pump you full of lead.</i>

645
00:56:13,629 --> 00:56:16,291
<i>All right, Johnny. I'm sorry.
I'm going.</i>

646
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,365
<i>One, two... ten.</i>

647
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,612
<i>Keep the change, you filthy animal.</i>

648
00:56:46,395 --> 00:56:47,225
What happened?

649
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:50,159
I don't know who, but somebody
just got blown away.

650
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,698
Somebody beat us,
they're in there.

651
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:54,027
Two of them.

652
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:56,864
There was arguing.
One blew the other one away.

653
00:56:57,072 --> 00:56:58,664
- Who?
- I don't know.

654
00:56:59,575 --> 00:57:04,512
I recognized one of their voices.
I heard that name "Snakes" before.

655
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:08,444
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes.
I don't know no Snakes.

656
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,983
Snakes. Let's get out of here.

657
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:15,518
Hold it. Hold it.

658
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,057
Let's wait and see who it is.
We work this neighborhood too.

659
00:57:19,928 --> 00:57:21,919
Suppose the cops finger us
for a job...

660
00:57:22,131 --> 00:57:25,100
...and they ask us about
a murder in the area.

661
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,269
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a face to go with it?

662
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,100
That's a good idea.

663
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:35,667
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?

664
00:57:35,878 --> 00:57:38,039
He sounded like a snake.

665
00:57:44,686 --> 00:57:45,846
Everything's full.

666
00:57:46,054 --> 00:57:47,521
Everything's full?

667
00:57:47,723 --> 00:57:50,590
I'm very sorry, but
it is Christmas Eve.

668
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,089
What about another airline?

669
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,633
Nothing available.
May I help you get a hotel room?

670
00:58:00,836 --> 00:58:02,804
Tomorrow we can get you a flight.

671
00:58:03,005 --> 00:58:04,734
I can't wait that long.

672
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,933
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.

673
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:16,107
I'm in your way. I'm sorry.
You've places to go.

674
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:18,752
Got a ticket there, good. Excuse me.

675
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:22,321
Look, I have been awake
for almost 60 hours.

676
00:58:22,524 --> 00:58:24,014
I'm tired and I'm dirty.

677
00:58:24,226 --> 00:58:28,322
I have been from Chicago to Paris,
to Dallas, to... Where am I?

678
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:30,196
Scranton.

679
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:33,224
I'm trying to get home
to my 8-year-old son.

680
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:36,535
Now you're telling me it's hopeless?

681
00:58:36,738 --> 00:58:39,263
- I'm sorry.
- No. No way.

682
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,567
This is Christmas!

683
00:58:40,776 --> 00:58:43,244
The season of perpetual hope.

684
00:58:43,445 --> 00:58:46,346
If I have to get on
your runway and hitchhike...

685
00:58:46,548 --> 00:58:48,539
...if it costs me everything I own...

686
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,651
...if I have to sell my soul
to the Devil himself...

687
00:58:51,854 --> 00:58:54,652
...I am going to get home to my son.

688
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,926
Ma'am, if there was anything...

689
00:58:58,126 --> 00:58:59,650
Do it. Do anything.

690
00:58:59,862 --> 00:59:01,853
- I can get you a hotel room.
- What?

691
00:59:02,064 --> 00:59:06,125
Can you excuse us for a sec?
Can I see you for a second, please?

692
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:08,235
Excuse us.

693
00:59:10,305 --> 00:59:12,705
You got a little bit of a dilemma.

694
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:15,342
We got a crisis ourselves.

695
00:59:15,878 --> 00:59:18,142
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski.

696
00:59:20,616 --> 00:59:22,811
Polka King of the Midwest?

697
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,285
The Kenosha Kickers?

698
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,188
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

699
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:34,462
That's okay. I thought you might
have recognized...

700
00:59:34,663 --> 00:59:38,326
I had a few hits a few years ago.
That's why I just...

701
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:43,130
<i>"Polka, Polka, Polka"?
Polka, polka, polka</i>

702
00:59:43,338 --> 00:59:44,362
"Twin Lakes Polka"?

703
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:49,408
"Yamahoozie Polka," a.k.a.
"Kiss Me Polka"? "Polka Twist"?

704
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:51,078
These are songs?

705
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,181
Yeah. Yeah, we...
Some fairly big hits for us.

706
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,214
You know, in the early '80s.

707
00:59:56,418 --> 00:59:59,251
Yeah, we sold about 623
copies of that.

708
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:01,012
- In Chicago?
- No, Sheboygan.

709
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,850
Very big in Sheboygan.

710
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,582
Did you say you could help?

711
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:08,524
Anyway, I'm rambling on here.
Our flight was canceled...

712
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:13,133
...so we're gonna drive. See the guy
in the yellow jacket over there?

713
01:00:13,335 --> 01:00:16,771
He's gonna rent us a nice big van
to drive to Milwaukee.

714
01:00:16,972 --> 01:00:20,271
Now, I heard you had some problems
getting to Chicago?

715
01:00:20,676 --> 01:00:22,041
To see your kid or something?

716
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:26,112
Uh, my son. He...
We left, and he's there.

717
01:00:26,315 --> 01:00:29,944
If you have to get to Chicago,
we'll gladly drive you.

718
01:00:30,152 --> 01:00:32,177
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

719
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:35,121
- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure, why not?

720
01:00:35,324 --> 01:00:36,848
You've got to get home.

721
01:00:37,059 --> 01:00:40,051
- A ride to Chicago?
- Sure, it's Christmastime.

722
01:00:40,696 --> 01:00:42,254
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

723
01:00:42,464 --> 01:00:44,659
You don't mind going with polka bums?

724
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:46,663
No, I'd love to.

725
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,752
Hey, Marv. Marv, Marv!

726
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,790
Look at this.

727
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:23,232
I think we're getting scammed
by a kindergartner.

728
01:01:53,635 --> 01:01:55,865
Dad, can you come here
and help me?

729
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:02,940
Remember that kid
we saw the other day?

730
01:02:03,945 --> 01:02:05,412
He lives here.

731
01:02:05,714 --> 01:02:08,205
If the kid's here,
the parent's got to be.

732
01:02:08,817 --> 01:02:10,375
He's home alone.

733
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:20,622
What? You want to come
back tonight?

734
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:22,319
Even with the kid here?

735
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:24,556
I don't think that's a good idea.

736
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:27,496
That house is the reason
we worked this block.

737
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:30,069
Ever since I saw that house,
I wanted it.

738
01:02:30,272 --> 01:02:32,365
Let's take it one step at a time.

739
01:02:32,574 --> 01:02:37,204
We'll unload the van, get a bite
to eat, we'll come back about 9:00.

740
01:02:37,412 --> 01:02:38,640
Nine o'clock.

741
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,212
This way it's dark then.

742
01:02:40,415 --> 01:02:43,407
Yeah, kids are scared of the dark.

743
01:02:43,618 --> 01:02:46,348
You're afraid of the dark too.
You know you are.

744
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:49,188
No, I'm not.

745
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,291
- Yes, you are.
- Not, not, not.

746
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:52,585
You are so.

747
01:02:52,794 --> 01:02:54,785
Mom, where are you?

748
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:10,772
Do you play?

749
01:03:11,446 --> 01:03:14,779
Do you want to try? Go ahead,
try it. Try it!

750
01:03:42,344 --> 01:03:44,710
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

751
01:03:46,248 --> 01:03:47,943
Hey, nice shoes.

752
01:03:48,316 --> 01:03:49,806
Oh, thanks.

753
01:03:50,018 --> 01:03:53,579
Is he still here? It's really
important that I see him.

754
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:57,747
He's getting in his car.
If you hurry, you can catch him.

755
01:03:59,161 --> 01:04:03,359
How low! Giving Kriss Kringle
a parking ticket on Christmas Eve!

756
01:04:03,565 --> 01:04:06,193
What's next, rabies shots
for the Easter Bunny?

757
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:07,891
Santa, hold on.

758
01:04:10,238 --> 01:04:12,229
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Quickly.

759
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,067
Santa's running late.

760
01:04:14,276 --> 01:04:16,744
I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

761
01:04:17,245 --> 01:04:20,737
Huh, what makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

762
01:04:20,949 --> 01:04:24,385
- I'm old enough to know how it works.
- All right.

763
01:04:24,586 --> 01:04:26,645
But I also know you work for him.

764
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,786
- I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.

765
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:34,991
Kevin McCallister, 681 Lincoln Blvd.
Do you need the phone number?

766
01:04:35,363 --> 01:04:36,625
No, that's all right.

767
01:04:36,965 --> 01:04:38,728
This is extremely important.

768
01:04:38,934 --> 01:04:43,871
Please tell him instead of presents,
I just want my family back.

769
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:48,976
No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate,
Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

770
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,202
And my aunt and my cousins.

771
01:04:51,413 --> 01:04:54,541
And if he has time,
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

772
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,411
Okay.

773
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,617
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

774
01:05:00,822 --> 01:05:05,316
Wait. My elf took the last of the
candy canes home to her boyfriend.

775
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,427
- That's okay.
- No, don't be silly.

776
01:05:07,629 --> 01:05:10,496
Everybody who sees Santa
has got to get something.

777
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:14,829
Here, hold out your little paw there.
There you go.

778
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:17,635
- Don't spoil your dinner.
- I won't.

779
01:05:18,106 --> 01:05:19,471
Thanks.

780
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:32,243
Son of a...!

781
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:31,064
Merry Christmas.

782
01:08:33,535 --> 01:08:34,763
May I sit down?

783
01:08:46,147 --> 01:08:47,580
That's my granddaughter.

784
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:49,810
The little red-haired girl.

785
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,853
She's about your age.
You know her?

786
01:08:55,056 --> 01:08:56,045
No.

787
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,088
You live next to me, don't you?

788
01:08:59,527 --> 01:09:03,054
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

789
01:09:04,132 --> 01:09:08,967
There's a lot of things going around
about me, but none of it's true. Okay?

790
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:12,033
- You've been good this year?
- I think so.

791
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,837
You swear to it?

792
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:15,431
No.

793
01:09:15,643 --> 01:09:20,273
Yeah. Well, this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

794
01:09:20,648 --> 01:09:23,276
- It is?
- I think so.

795
01:09:23,485 --> 01:09:26,079
- Are you feeling bad about yourself?
- No.

796
01:09:30,525 --> 01:09:32,584
I've been kind of a pain lately.

797
01:09:33,061 --> 01:09:35,529
I said some things I shouldn't have.

798
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:38,460
I really haven't been
too good this year.

799
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,066
Yeah.

800
01:09:40,268 --> 01:09:43,533
I'm kind of upset
because I really like my family.

801
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:48,641
Even though sometimes I say I don't.
Sometimes I even think I don't.

802
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:51,707
- Do you get that?
- I think so.

803
01:09:51,946 --> 01:09:54,437
How you feel about family
is a complicated thing.

804
01:09:55,283 --> 01:09:57,649
Especially with an older brother.

805
01:09:58,419 --> 01:10:00,717
Deep down, you'll always love him.

806
01:10:00,955 --> 01:10:05,289
But you can forget that you love him.
You can hurt them, they can hurt you.

807
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,484
That's not just because you're young.

808
01:10:09,631 --> 01:10:12,293
You want to know the real
reason why I'm here?

809
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,762
Sure.

810
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:16,194
I came to hear my granddaughter sing.

811
01:10:16,538 --> 01:10:18,096
I can't come hear her tonight.

812
01:10:18,606 --> 01:10:19,630
You have plans?

813
01:10:20,108 --> 01:10:21,200
No.

814
01:10:22,143 --> 01:10:23,474
I'm not welcome.

815
01:10:24,245 --> 01:10:25,473
At church?

816
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,773
You're always welcome at church.

817
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:30,075
I'm not welcome with my son.

818
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:35,284
Years back, before you and your family
moved on the block...

819
01:10:36,057 --> 01:10:37,684
...I had an argument with my son.

820
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:39,618
How old is he?

821
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:41,385
He's grown up.

822
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:47,460
We lost our tempers, and I said
I didn't care to see him anymore.

823
01:10:48,002 --> 01:10:52,302
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

824
01:10:53,474 --> 01:10:55,738
If you miss him,
why don't you call him?

825
01:10:56,311 --> 01:10:58,506
I'm afraid if I call,
he won't talk to me.

826
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,180
How do you know?

827
01:11:01,182 --> 01:11:02,649
I don't know.

828
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:03,976
I'm just afraid.

829
01:11:04,652 --> 01:11:07,746
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

830
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:11,218
You can be old for a lot of things.

831
01:11:11,426 --> 01:11:14,224
- You're never too old to be afraid.
- That's true.

832
01:11:14,429 --> 01:11:16,363
I was afraid of our basement.

833
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,863
It's dark. There's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

834
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:23,663
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

835
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,202
Basements are like that.

836
01:11:26,441 --> 01:11:28,875
I made myself go down
to do some laundry...

837
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:31,204
...and I found out it's not so bad.

838
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:36,042
I worried about it, but if you
turn on the lights, it's no big deal.

839
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:37,383
What's your point?

840
01:11:37,785 --> 01:11:40,583
My point is,
you should call your son.

841
01:11:41,556 --> 01:11:44,320
- What if he won't talk to me?
- At least you'll know.

842
01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:48,894
Then you could stop worrying about it.
You won't have to be afraid anymore.

843
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:54,601
No matter how mad I was, I'd talk to
Dad. Especially around the holidays.

844
01:11:56,337 --> 01:11:57,929
I don't know.

845
01:11:58,139 --> 01:11:59,231
Just give it a shot.

846
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,067
For your granddaughter anyway.

847
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:04,541
I'm sure she misses you.
And the presents.

848
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:06,478
I send her a check.

849
01:12:07,181 --> 01:12:09,046
I wish my grandparents did that.

850
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,740
They always send me clothes.

851
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,921
Last year I got a sweater
with a bird knitted on it.

852
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:15,111
Oh, that's nice.

853
01:12:15,323 --> 01:12:17,450
Not for a guy in the second grade.

854
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:20,321
You can get beat up for wearing
something like that.

855
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:23,688
I have a friend who got nailed...

856
01:12:23,898 --> 01:12:26,799
...because there was a rumor
he wore dinosaur pajamas.

857
01:12:27,902 --> 01:12:30,166
You better run home where you belong.

858
01:12:30,938 --> 01:12:32,166
Think about what I said.

859
01:12:32,573 --> 01:12:34,063
- All right?
- Okay.

860
01:12:34,909 --> 01:12:36,001
It's nice talking to you.

861
01:12:37,045 --> 01:12:38,672
Nice talking to you.

862
01:12:45,086 --> 01:12:47,281
- What about you?
- Me?

863
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:49,347
Yeah. You and your son.

864
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:53,157
We'll see what happens.

865
01:12:54,562 --> 01:12:55,824
Merry Christmas.

866
01:12:56,898 --> 01:12:58,832
Merry Christmas.

867
01:13:50,818 --> 01:13:54,413
This is my house.
I have to defend it.

868
01:15:22,343 --> 01:15:25,403
We'll check it out.
We can come back for the truck.

869
01:15:33,721 --> 01:15:34,983
How do you want to go in?

870
01:15:35,523 --> 01:15:38,492
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in.

871
01:15:38,693 --> 01:15:42,026
Yeah, he's a kid. Kids are stupid.

872
01:15:44,131 --> 01:15:48,090
Bless this nutritious, microwaveable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

873
01:15:48,302 --> 01:15:50,896
...and the people who sold
it on sale.

874
01:16:16,097 --> 01:16:18,861
This is it. Don't get scared now.

875
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:34,641
Merry Christmas, little fella.

876
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:40,317
We know that you're in there,
and that you're all alone.

877
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:43,051
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

878
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,686
It's Santy Claus and his elf.

879
01:16:49,096 --> 01:16:50,757
We're not gonna hurt you.

880
01:16:50,965 --> 01:16:54,401
No, no. Got some nice
presents for you.

881
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:58,398
Be a good little fella now
and open the door.

882
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,336
What?

883
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,171
What? What?

884
01:17:08,983 --> 01:17:09,915
What?

885
01:17:10,117 --> 01:17:12,381
- What happened?
- Get that little...

886
01:17:24,131 --> 01:17:25,496
Hello.

887
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:33,604
Yes! Yes!

888
01:17:33,808 --> 01:17:35,332
The little jerk is armed!

889
01:17:35,543 --> 01:17:39,775
That's it! I'm going in the front.
You go down the basement!

890
01:20:12,533 --> 01:20:17,197
Oh, boy. That's it, you little...
You little...

891
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,266
No, not this time, you little brat.

892
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:26,544
You little creep, where are you?

893
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:51,870
Yes!

894
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:27,266
- Rip his head off...!

895
01:21:37,418 --> 01:21:38,783
You're dead, kid.

896
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,896
Where are you, you little creep?!

897
01:22:45,219 --> 01:22:47,915
Harry, I'm coming in!

898
01:22:52,526 --> 01:22:54,619
Oh, no! I'm really scared.

899
01:22:54,828 --> 01:22:58,696
It's too late for you, kid, we're
in the house. We're gonna get you.

900
01:22:58,899 --> 01:23:00,992
Okay, come and get me!

901
01:23:01,335 --> 01:23:02,393
Why, you...!

902
01:23:09,043 --> 01:23:10,271
Now you're dead!

903
01:23:36,003 --> 01:23:38,563
I'm gonna kill that kid!

904
01:23:56,023 --> 01:23:57,854
Why'd you take your shoes off?

905
01:23:58,359 --> 01:24:00,088
Why are you dressed like a chicken?

906
01:24:02,029 --> 01:24:03,690
I'm up here, you morons.

907
01:24:03,931 --> 01:24:05,421
Come and get me.

908
01:24:08,869 --> 01:24:12,168
You guys give up, or are you
thirsty for more?

909
01:24:21,982 --> 01:24:23,347
Heads up!

910
01:24:26,453 --> 01:24:28,944
Don't worry, Marv.
I'll get him for you.

911
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:34,085
Yes!

912
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:41,597
He's only a kid, Harry.
We can take him.

913
01:24:41,802 --> 01:24:44,862
Ah, shut up, will you?
What is it?

914
01:24:45,072 --> 01:24:47,233
You're missing some teeth.

915
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:49,568
Where? It's my gold tooth.

916
01:24:49,777 --> 01:24:52,803
My gold tooth. I'll kill him.
I'll kill him!

917
01:24:55,149 --> 01:24:57,344
You bomb me with
one more can, kid...

918
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:01,783
<i>...and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!</i>

919
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,251
<i>911 emergency.</i>

920
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,325
Hello, my house is being robbed.

921
01:25:08,529 --> 01:25:13,228
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name is Murphy.

922
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,170
You never know what's up there.

923
01:25:19,306 --> 01:25:20,170
There he is!

924
01:25:25,813 --> 01:25:27,508
I got you! I got him, Harry.

925
01:25:29,316 --> 01:25:30,613
I got him.

926
01:25:31,785 --> 01:25:33,013
Harry, give me a hand!

927
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:37,288
I got him!

928
01:25:38,525 --> 01:25:39,856
Harry, help me. Get up!

929
01:25:41,462 --> 01:25:42,690
I got him.

930
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:23,561
What are you doing?

931
01:26:24,404 --> 01:26:27,134
Harry, don't move.

932
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:30,975
Don't move.

933
01:26:31,445 --> 01:26:33,003
Marv, what are you doing?

934
01:26:37,718 --> 01:26:38,707
Did I get him?

935
01:26:39,887 --> 01:26:41,252
Did I get him?!

936
01:26:41,622 --> 01:26:43,715
Where is it? Where is it?

937
01:26:43,924 --> 01:26:47,553
Never mind that. Here!
How do you like it, huh? You jerk!

938
01:26:47,761 --> 01:26:50,423
Get that kid, before I...
Get that kid!

939
01:27:17,224 --> 01:27:18,521
Where'd he go?

940
01:27:19,293 --> 01:27:21,261
Maybe he committed suicide.

941
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:26,564
Down here, you big horse's ass!
Come get me before I call the police.

942
01:27:26,767 --> 01:27:28,735
- Let's get him!
- Wait, wait.

943
01:27:28,936 --> 01:27:30,801
It's just what he wants us to do:

944
01:27:31,004 --> 01:27:34,132
Go back through his fun house
so we get all tore up.

945
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:35,831
He's gonna call the cops!

946
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:37,772
From a tree house?!

947
01:27:37,978 --> 01:27:39,104
Come on.

948
01:27:40,347 --> 01:27:41,746
Out the window?

949
01:27:42,182 --> 01:27:43,581
I'm not going out the window.

950
01:27:43,784 --> 01:27:47,720
Why, you scared? Are you afraid?
Come on, get out here.

951
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:53,924
Come on.

952
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:01,400
Come on!

953
01:28:07,307 --> 01:28:10,242
- Come on. Keep going.
- Let's go back, Harry.

954
01:28:15,882 --> 01:28:16,974
Shut it, Marv.

955
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:21,485
Hey, guys!

956
01:28:22,055 --> 01:28:23,352
Check this out.

957
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:26,255
Go back. Go back.

958
01:29:14,741 --> 01:29:15,571
There he is!

959
01:29:16,209 --> 01:29:18,336
Hey, I'm calling the cops!

960
01:29:19,613 --> 01:29:22,081
Wait, wait!
He wants us to follow him.

961
01:29:22,282 --> 01:29:24,216
I got a better idea. Come on.

962
01:29:42,235 --> 01:29:43,497
Hiya, pal.

963
01:29:43,937 --> 01:29:47,168
We outsmarted you this time.
Get over here!

964
01:29:53,113 --> 01:29:54,546
What are you gonna do, Harry?

965
01:29:54,981 --> 01:29:57,006
I'll do exactly what he did to us.

966
01:29:57,217 --> 01:29:59,048
Burn his head with a blowtorch.

967
01:29:59,252 --> 01:30:01,277
I'll smash his face with an iron.

968
01:30:01,488 --> 01:30:04,321
I'd like to slap him
in the face with a paint can!

969
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,116
Shove a nail through his foot!

970
01:30:06,326 --> 01:30:11,263
I'm gonna bite off every one of
these little fingers, one at a time.

971
01:30:20,574 --> 01:30:22,906
Come on. Let's get you home.

972
01:30:45,866 --> 01:30:48,596
Wow! This is great.

973
01:30:51,972 --> 01:30:54,304
Nice move,
leaving the water running.

974
01:30:54,508 --> 01:30:58,274
Now we know each and every house
that you've hit.

975
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:04,546
We've been looking for you guys
for a long time.

976
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:07,618
Yeah. Well, remember,
we're the "Wet Bandits."

977
01:31:07,821 --> 01:31:11,848
- Wet Bandits, that's W-E-T...
- Shut up! Get in the car!

978
01:31:12,058 --> 01:31:13,787
Hey, come on. Come on.

979
01:31:14,494 --> 01:31:16,962
- Hand off the head, pal!
- Come on.

980
01:32:12,552 --> 01:32:14,611
<i>I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent.</i>

981
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:15,913
No, you're not.

982
01:32:16,122 --> 01:32:18,784
You're beating yourself up there.
This happens.

983
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:20,687
These things happen, you know.

984
01:32:20,894 --> 01:32:24,591
You want to talk about bad parents?
Look at us.

985
01:32:24,798 --> 01:32:29,531
We're on the road 48, 49 weeks a year.
We hardly see our families.

986
01:32:30,237 --> 01:32:32,501
Joe, over there. Gosh, you know...

987
01:32:32,706 --> 01:32:35,539
...he forgets his kids' names
half the time.

988
01:32:35,742 --> 01:32:39,143
Ziggy over there,
he's never even met his kid.

989
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:43,214
Eddy... Let's just hope
none of them write a book about him.

990
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:47,878
Tell me, have you gone on vacation
and left your child home?

991
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:52,622
No.

992
01:32:53,393 --> 01:32:56,362
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

993
01:32:57,063 --> 01:33:00,430
Yeah, it was terrible too.
I was all distraught and everything.

994
01:33:00,634 --> 01:33:04,832
The wife and I, we left the little
tyke there in the funeral parlor.

995
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:08,769
All day. You know, we went
back at night, when we...

996
01:33:08,975 --> 01:33:11,205
...came to our senses,
there he was.

997
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:14,539
Apparently, he was there
all day with a corpse.

998
01:33:15,615 --> 01:33:18,914
Now, he was okay.
You know, after six, seven weeks.

999
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:21,610
He came around
and started talking again.

1000
01:33:22,956 --> 01:33:25,948
They get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

1001
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:27,888
We shouldn't talk about this.

1002
01:33:28,094 --> 01:33:29,959
I was just trying to cheer you up.

1003
01:33:30,163 --> 01:33:32,290
I'm sorry I did.

1004
01:33:58,525 --> 01:33:59,651
Mom?

1005
01:34:04,864 --> 01:34:06,092
Mom?

1006
01:34:58,518 --> 01:34:59,815
Kevin!

1007
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:35,878
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1008
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,758
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

1009
01:36:07,654 --> 01:36:09,451
Where's everybody else?

1010
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:12,181
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.

1011
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,654
They wanted to so much...

1012
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:18,320
I didn't fall asleep in the back
and drool all over you, did I?

1013
01:36:18,531 --> 01:36:20,829
- You do drool!
- Shut up!

1014
01:36:23,703 --> 01:36:26,797
Kevin, my boy. How are you?

1015
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,269
You're all right.

1016
01:36:29,709 --> 01:36:31,006
I love you. You okay?

1017
01:36:35,849 --> 01:36:38,477
It's cool that you didn't
burn the place down.

1018
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:42,578
Thanks, Buzz.

1019
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:46,283
Wait a minute.
How'd you guys get home?

1020
01:36:46,493 --> 01:36:49,018
On the morning flight you didn't
want to wait for.

1021
01:36:49,229 --> 01:36:52,494
- Oh, no. Oh! Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

1022
01:36:52,699 --> 01:36:54,132
Merry Christmas.

1023
01:36:54,734 --> 01:36:56,827
Someone has to find an open store.

1024
01:36:57,036 --> 01:36:58,663
I went shopping yesterday.

1025
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:02,866
You, shopping?

1026
01:37:03,076 --> 01:37:05,874
I got some milk, eggs
and fabric softener.

1027
01:37:07,747 --> 01:37:09,647
- What?
- No kidding?

1028
01:37:09,849 --> 01:37:11,578
What a funny guy.

1029
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:13,980
What else did you do
while we were away?

1030
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:17,319
Just hung around.

1031
01:37:19,392 --> 01:37:20,882
Bring your stuff upstairs.

1032
01:37:21,094 --> 01:37:25,497
He went shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe. He's going shopping?

1033
01:37:52,425 --> 01:37:53,983
Honey, what's this?

1034
01:38:52,352 --> 01:38:55,810
Kevin! What did you do
to my room?

1035
01:38:56,305 --> 01:39:56,682
