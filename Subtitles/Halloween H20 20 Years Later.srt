00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:21,769
Shit!

3
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:52,215
Oh!

4
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,695
Hey. Hey, Miss Wittington.
What's goin' on?

5
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,134
- My house was broken into.
- No shit?

6
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,056
No shit.

7
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:02,779
Hasn't anyone told ya?
Secondhand smoke kills.

8
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:05,497
Yeah, but they're all dead.

9
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:07,531
Yeah. Yeah, it's um...

10
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:11,413
4946 Cypress Pond.

11
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,610
Okay.
Right, thanks.

12
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:16,378
They said to give 'em
15 minutes and they'll be by.

13
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:19,731
- Jimmy, where are you going?
- Check out your house.

14
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:24,091
- No, wait for the police.
- Where's the fun in that, huh?

15
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:28,448
Are you coming?

16
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,890
Nah, I-l better stay
here and protect her.

17
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,488
Oh-ho!
Right, dude.

18
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,577
Good.

19
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,851
All right, let's not anyone
mess with me here!

20
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,015
Jimmy been suspended
five times this year already...

21
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:25,132
for gettin' a little crazy
with the stick, all right?

22
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:27,170
Okay!

23
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,376
Hoo. Shit.

24
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,451
Shit!

25
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:34,249
God.

26
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,289
All right.

27
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,331
Nothin' to fear.
The coast is clear.

28
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,052
- You sure?
- Yup.

29
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:48,897
I checked all the rooms
and all the closets.

30
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,134
Nothing's missing?

31
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:54,298
I don't think so, but they, uh,
they did a real number on your office.

32
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:57,731
- My office?
- Yeah, there's crap everywhere.

33
00:04:57,927 --> 00:05:02,650
Oh, and, uh, also they messed up
your kitchen really bad, too. Ick.

34
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,771
Good night.

35
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,539
So much for the cops.

36
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:29,134
Perfect.

37
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:37,131
- We got beer!
- Yes!

38
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,615
We'll get messed up, man.

39
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,617
I say we egg the house
across the street.

40
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,651
- Shut up, dude.
- Why not?

41
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,657
Shit.

42
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:27,169
Even a stronger nation than now.

43
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:29,893
You see? You see?
Your stupid minds...

44
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,249
Jimmy!

45
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:45,457
Oh, my God! Oh.

46
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,977
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh!

47
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:14,127
Hey! Oh!

48
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,818
Help! Any...

49
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:29,090
- Looks like a prank.
- In here!

50
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,369
Police! Anybody home?

51
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:41,651
In here, goddammit!

52
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:52,814
Team 9-10 requests
burglary detectives at, uh,

53
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:57,137
4946 Cypress Pond Road.

54
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,375
Hey, Bobby!

55
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,450
What do ya got?

56
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,815
Looks like we hit
the Daily Double here.

57
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:07,216
- What, another B and E?
- Yeah. The window here.

58
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:25,930
So, whose house is this, anyway?

59
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:29,097
Marion Wittington.
Dr. Sam Loomis's nurse.

60
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:31,210
He was that shrink
that died a few years ago.

61
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,216
He lived here.
She took care of him.

62
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,695
Oh, I remember him.
I saw a thing on 60 Minutes on him.

63
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,731
Spent his life tracking down
that Halloween guy...

64
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,737
who butchered all those kids
up in Haddonfield, right?

65
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:42,328
- Michael Myers.
- Right.

66
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:46,618
- Hey, you don't think Michael Myers...
- They never found his body.

67
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,651
Yeah, but that was,
like, 20 years ago.

68
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:58,251
Fuck me.

69
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:00,256
Loomis was obsessed
with Michael Myers.

70
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:03,417
This is quite a love fest.

71
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:06,578
- I'll call up to Haddonfield and warn 'em.
- There's no way, Fitz.

72
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,611
Just a precaution.
Tomorrow's Halloween.

73
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,333
All right, you tell 'em to look for
a guy with a cane and Alzheimer's.

74
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,690
The guy would be
younger than I am, okay?

75
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,976
I was 15 when he killed
his sister back in '63.

76
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:20,057
Yes, Fitzsimmons. Patch me through
to Haddonfield, please.

77
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:23,695
- Yeah.
- Michael Myers.

78
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:26,049
Yeah, right.

79
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:07,054
I met him 15 years ago.

80
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,090
I was told
there was nothing left.

81
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:11,734
No reason, no conscience.

82
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:15,409
No understanding. Even the most
rudimentary sense of life and death,

83
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:20,898
of good or evil, right or wrong.

84
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,977
I met this six-year-old child

85
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:29,054
with this blank, pale,
emotionless face, and...

86
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,696
the blackest eyes.

87
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:35,089
The devil's eyes.

88
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,174
I spent eight years trying to reach him...

89
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,449
and then another seven
trying to keep him locked up

90
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:09,447
because I realized that what was
living behind that boy's eyes

91
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:13,129
was purely, and simply...

92
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:15,216
Evil.

93
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:19,088
Mom! Mom! Mom. Mom.

94
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:22,450
Mom! Mom! Mom. Mom!

95
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:26,095
You okay? You all right?

96
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:30,815
Oh. Oh!

97
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:35,012
Everything's okay. It's okay.

98
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,577
- Do you need somethin'?
- Oh! Uh, yeah.

99
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,577
Yeah, please. Thanks.

100
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:44,088
- Sure.
- It's okay.

101
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:56,568
Nightmares.

102
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:59,247
Nightmares.

103
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,176
Nightmares.

104
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:39,816
- Making toast.
- Mm“

105
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:43,575
No.
None for me, thanks.

106
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:47,328
- Caffeine is not a food group.
- We're out of Percodan.

107
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:52,298
Got mail.
It's from your dad.

108
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,211
- Birthday card.
- It's only two months late. I'm impressed.

109
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:03,735
Cash is good. I'm gonna need
it when I go to Yosemite.

110
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,731
- You're not going.
- Yes, I am.

111
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,772
No, you're not.

112
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,891
Yes, I am, and with your full blessing.
Do you want to know why?

113
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,977
- Why?
- Because today is the day.

114
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,529
I can feel it.
Today is the day...

115
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,298
that you're going to realize
that I'm 17 years old...

116
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:24,934
and your overprotection and paranoia
is inhibiting my growth process.

117
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,369
Want to go camping?
I'll take you camping.

118
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,655
I don't want to go with you.

119
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:34,698
Sorry.

120
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:37,936
- Dad would let me go.
- Well, Dad...

121
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,937
is an abusive, chain-smoking
methadone addict.

122
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:43,129
Who would attract
someone like that?

123
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:46,498
- Ouch.
- And just think, he left you.

124
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:49,532
Look, John.

125
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:52,412
I know you get your smart mouth
from my side of the family,

126
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:53,655
so I'll give you a break.

127
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,772
- But point check, you're going too far.
- No, I'm goin' to Yosemite.

128
00:16:56,967 --> 00:17:00,176
- No, you're not.
- Look, Mom, help me out here.

129
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,052
I need a little more open air.
I've earned it.

130
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,015
Look, I know today is the day,
but I think that...

131
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:10,177
- Oh, really? What day is that, John?
- Halloween.

132
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:13,649
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

133
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,896
Look, Mom, we're through with all that.

134
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,731
We really are.

135
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:29,967
You know what you're becoming?

136
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,295
You're becoming an Oedipal
enabler, you know that?

137
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:35,138
- Thank you.
- I'm serious!

138
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,415
Twenty years from now, you're still
going to be living with her.

139
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,450
Probably running some weird motel
out in the middle of nowhere.

140
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:41,490
- So this means no Yosemite?
- Correct.

141
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,577
- Now, how do I get out of it?
- Why don't you want to go?

142
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:46,418
Oh, it's so lame.
No, no, no. It's worse.

143
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,770
L-I went there
two summers ago with my family.

144
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:52,535
Loathsome. No, it's worse.
It'll come to me.

145
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:55,738
Wretched. You know?
Okay, think-think...

146
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:57,771
campfires, s' mores...

147
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:22,649
Repugnant!
That's it, repugnant.

148
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,737
I would rather have
my eyes pierced.

149
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:28,969
I'm very sorry.
I wish I could help. I'm sorry.

150
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,090
- But he promised that...
- No. I'm not going.

151
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:33,938
You couldn't pay me to go.

152
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:40,013
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Oh... Uh, my dad.

153
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,017
He flaked on my
financial aid again.

154
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,654
The bursar's being such a dick.
Now I can't go to Yosemite.

155
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:46,973
- You're not going either?
- No.

156
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,975
I'm not going.

157
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,976
- How are you going to get out of it?
- Please.

158
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:53,137
Hey. Hold on. We ditch Yosemite.

159
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,689
It means we could have
a Halloween party, just the four of us.

160
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:58,049
Whole place would be empty.
We'd have the run of it.

161
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,531
- We could have a roaming orgy.
- I love the way this man thinks!

162
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:04,777
Hope that's not
the only thing you love about me.

163
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:11,415
- Hey, come on.
- All right, let's go.

164
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:40,977
Okay. You see,
I told you we'd make it.

165
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:43,529
When I was a little girl,
we used to pee in the woods.

166
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:59,894
- Ohh! Uh...
- Don't worry!

167
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,779
Come on.

168
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:09,015
Mom, that's the boys' room.

169
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,209
Then the boys are just
gonna have to deal with it.

170
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,651
Hello?

171
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:20,893
Okay. Coast is clear.

172
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:34,934
Okay. Come on.

173
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:44,138
I'll be just next door.
Mom's gotta go too.

174
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,290
- Oh!
- Mom?

175
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:52,370
I know.

176
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:01,018
- Mom?
- It's just the door, Casey.

177
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:09,012
Here's some tissues...
Casey?

178
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:06,414
Spiders!

179
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:19,218
All right.
Ready? You know why you're here.

180
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:22,815
The buses leave for Yosemite
at 4:15, sharp.

181
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:34,496
And now it's time for me
to do my obligatory plea...

182
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,418
that you uphold the
standards of Hillcrest.

183
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,975
And that means
no musical sleeping bags.

184
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,976
No booze.

185
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:46,057
No drugs, no kidding.

186
00:22:46,247 --> 00:22:48,932
Undoubtedly, someone will
ruin it for the rest of them...

187
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:52,131
so I just want to remind you that
the entire teaching faculty has...

188
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,695
- Hey! Guess what this is?
- What?

189
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:58,892
It's my history report.
Forgot to hand it in.

190
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,249
Guess who's not going to Yosemite.
I'm so bummed.

191
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:03,330
Guess who has a fever of 102...

192
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:05,336
and has to stay in bed
all weekend long.

193
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:08,929
- You two company?
- So, what's the plan?

194
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:11,734
Romantic dinner,
candlelight, soft music.

195
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:15,056
- Animal sex.
- You need a hormone suppressant.

196
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:17,898
You're embarrassing
the newlyweds, Charles.

197
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:20,608
That's it.
Have a good time.

198
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:27,414
And why aren't you
going camping, Miss Tate?

199
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,258
Because it sounds like fun.
And you, Mr. Brennan?

200
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:33,178
Guidance counselors aren't usually
a big hit in the wilderness.

201
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:36,291
Besides, somebody has to stay behind and
watch over the three or four outcasts.

202
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:38,291
Oh, good morning, Miss Tate.

203
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:40,450
- Good morning, Norma.
- Your mail and messages are on your desk,

204
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:42,854
along with the new
quarter budget, and oh,

205
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,494
surprise, surprise, the drains in the
girls' shower room are clogged again.

206
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,008
- Can I talk to you alone for one second?
- But, I... I called the plumber,

207
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,011
and he assured me that
he will be here as soon as he can...

208
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,898
Thank you, Norma.
Thank you very much.

209
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,489
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Place of employment.

210
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,850
I'm sorry, I, I just...
I needed a fix.

211
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:07,450
- We still on for lunch?
- Uh-huh. 1:00.

212
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:11,891
You are, without a doubt,
the most amazing,

213
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:14,694
challenging woman
I have ever met.

214
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,697
And what's wrong now?

215
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:20,414
Can you just stop with the
Keri analysis just once, please?

216
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:22,696
You can do it tomorrow,
all you want.

217
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,493
But please, can I just
have today off?

218
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:28,850
- Whatever you want.
- Thank you.

219
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,699
- Lunch. Don't forget.
- 1:00.

220
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,731
Uh-.

221
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:00,695
"He turned, just in time
to see her enter the room,"

222
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:05,735
with her long, slender legs
that climbed high up her skirt,

223
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:08,534
leading to two tumultuous,

224
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:11,732
"round, melon breasts."

225
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,737
Round melon what?

226
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,737
Now why do you want
to label it like food?

227
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:19,295
And what kind of melon you talkin' about?
Cantaloupe? Watermelon? What?

228
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:22,571
Baby, it's fiction! People like
to read descriptive adjectives.

229
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,974
- It sets the scene.
- It's stupid is what it is.

230
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:26,976
It's sensual and romantic.

231
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:31,855
Ronny, it's unrealistic. This whole
writing career is unrealistic.

232
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:34,574
Hey, we're married now,
baby, we gotta get serious.

233
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:37,890
- This is serious.
- Honey, I been patient, but this writing thing

234
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:41,250
just ain't takin' off, and I want
a baby before I get so old...

235
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:43,530
- I can't get my butt back.
- You gotta give me a chance, honey.

236
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:47,493
I have to express myself creatively.
We payin' the bills, aren't we?

237
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:49,894
- Uh! Fuck me! Shit!
- What?

238
00:25:50,087 --> 00:25:52,454
Not you, honey. Hold on for a sec.
You scared the shit out of me!

239
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:54,968
Sorry, Ronny.
I gotta ask a favor, man.

240
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:56,936
- I'm not lettin' you out of here.
- Aw, come on, man.

241
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,408
- Jus-Just for lunch. Please.
- Look, your mom told me...

242
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:01,848
the next time I let you loose,
I was gonna be fired.

243
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:04,055
Look, man.
I got a date with Molly tonight.

244
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:05,169
Mmmmm.

245
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:07,769
And I want to make it special.
What do you say?

246
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,533
Look, I promise I'll be back
for afternoon classes.

247
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:15,014
Huh? I just want
to get a gift.

248
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,175
Come on, man, have a heart.

249
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:23,658
No. No. Can't do it.

250
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:27,056
Aw, come on, man.
Okay, how about this?

251
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:30,570
- You accidentally press the gate.
- Mmmmm.

252
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:32,815
And when you have
your back turned, we sneak out.

253
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:35,135
Ronny, don't you get your ass fired...

254
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:44,172
- Don't you do me wrong, okay?
- Not a chance, man! Cool.

255
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,051
- All right.
- Get outta here, get outta here.

256
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:47,976
Comb your hair.

257
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,579
Just one more book.

258
00:26:49,768 --> 00:26:52,738
Just one more, and I promise
I'll work with your daddy, all right?

259
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,810
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, Jesus, Will.

260
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:54,295
- I'm sorry. I thought you saw me.
- No.

261
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:57,212
You see me now?

262
00:27:57,447 --> 00:28:00,098
How are you doin'?

263
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:13,129
You wanna talk about it?

264
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:18,370
I think I'm losing John.

265
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:23,374
I think he's finally
tired of my bullshit.

266
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:28,011
How about you?

267
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,016
You tired of my bullshit?

268
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,688
I'm a counselor.
I'm attracted to it.

269
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:39,496
- So counsel me.
- Oh, no. I know better.

270
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:41,815
I love you just the way you are.

271
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:48,134
Do you think it's possible...

272
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,170
that something so tragic
can happen to somebody...

273
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:52,176
that they never recover from it?

274
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:56,452
I like to believe that
recovery is always possible.

275
00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:05,214
There's a little back story
that I haven't been, um...

276
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:11,611
- completely successful with.
- I know.

277
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:15,857
I've tried everything. I really have.
I've tried everything.

278
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:21,372
Twelve steps, uh,
self-help, group therapy,

279
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:26,287
shrinks, meditation...

280
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:32,093
- Everything.
- That's not everything.

281
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:36,178
Oh, yeah?
What else is there?

282
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,735
I'm a really good listener.

283
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:50,569
Maybe.
Some night, by a...

284
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:52,657
warm fire.

285
00:29:58,768 --> 00:30:00,770
I'll be right back.

286
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:09,893
Can I get another glass
of Chardonnay, please?

287
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:14,897
- Today.
- Yes, ma'am.

288
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:16,970
Thank you.

289
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:30,093
Thanks.

290
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:35,010
Thank you very much.

291
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:51,776
God. I can't believe
we're doin' this.

292
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,856
- Desperate measures.
- It's illegal.

293
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:55,896
It's harmless, and expected.

294
00:30:56,127 --> 00:30:58,016
Studies have proven that
all teenagers, at some point

295
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,779
- in their adolescent lives, have shoplifted.
- What studies?

296
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:02,692
Hey. We could have
avoided this whole thing

297
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,657
if you woulda simply scored
some of your mom's booze.

298
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:06,093
Look, my mom's a functioning alcoholic.

299
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,130
- She accounts for every...
- John!

300
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:12,056
- John, what are you doing here?
- Just gettin' some off-campus lunch.

301
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:15,730
You're not allowed to have
little off-campus lunches, John.

302
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:19,694
- You know that. You too, Charlie.
- Sorry, Miss Tate.

303
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:24,097
Come on, I'll drive you back.

304
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:26,409
You know what?
Charlie, here.

305
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:28,928
Go get in the car.
I'll be right there.

306
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:30,732
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

307
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:32,771
Mom, I'm really uncomfortable
with you saying that word.

308
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:35,971
Well, then don't put me
in the position, John.

309
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:38,654
Do you know what day it is?

310
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:40,815
Of all the days for
you to pull this shit...

311
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:46,497
What do you think you can do?
Just wander around town?

312
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,496
I don't ask you for very much.

313
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:51,970
- Just give me one day!
- Mom, I've given you 17 years!

314
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,329
And I need you
to be responsible.

315
00:31:54,528 --> 00:31:55,892
Do you know what that means?

316
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:58,215
Responsible. Don't talk to me
about responsible, Mom!

317
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:02,253
- I just need this one thing!
- Mom, I am not responsible for you!

318
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:06,453
That's it. That's enough.
I can't take it, Mom.

319
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:08,456
He's dead.

320
00:32:08,648 --> 00:32:11,618
Michael Myers is dead.

321
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:16,374
- What do you want me to say?
- That it's over?

322
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:21,289
That we should try to get on with
some attempt at a happy existence, Mom.

323
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:24,218
Because all the shit that's going on
in your head is leakin' out on me.

324
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:26,375
And I can't take it anymore.

325
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:31,731
You told me yourself
you watched him burn.

326
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:36,697
- I didn't e-exactly stay to see his ashes, John.
- Mom, 20 years.

327
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:39,811
Twenty years.

328
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:42,739
Don't you think he would
have shown up by now?

329
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,294
What's he waitin' for, huh?

330
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:50,175
Okay, Mom. I can't live
like this. I'm sorry.

331
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:53,617
Wha...
What does that mean, John?

332
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,969
If you want to stay handcuffed
to your dead brother, that's fine.

333
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,610
But you're not draggin' me along.
Not anymore.

334
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:09,653
- Yes?

335
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:14,576
♪ Bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a ♪

336
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:31,970
Ronny?

337
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:36,092
- Mom, let me.
- Where the hell is he?

338
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:43,012
- Ronny!

339
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,169
Hey, Ronny!

340
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:04,808
- Where the hell were you?
- Norma told me to walk the perimeter.

341
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:07,616
And where were you
when these two got out?

342
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:11,413
Eyes up, Ronny.

343
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:20,416
Psycho.

344
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:55,769
Janice!

345
00:34:55,967 --> 00:35:00,211
Don't send down any more, all right?
I gotta go to class.

346
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,699
Janice?

347
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:28,336
- Oh! Uh!
- Shh! The best part.

348
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:33,894
Oh!

349
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:36,328
Do I get points or what?

350
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,370
Huh?

351
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:42,174
You score. Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,530
Hmm. Well, it just
occurred to me today...

353
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:48,214
that I've never
celebrated Halloween before.

354
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,250
And why is that?

355
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:53,093
Oh, we've got a psychotic
serial killer in the family who

356
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:55,655
loves to butcher people
on Halloween, and

357
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,817
I just thought it
in bad taste to...

358
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:00,816
celebrate.

359
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:03,055
So why now?

360
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,291
Mm, because there comes a point in your
life where you have to concentrate

361
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:08,376
on what's right about it.

362
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:12,336
Really?

363
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,258
And you...

364
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,610
are a sterling example...

365
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:22,737
of what's right.

366
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:27,532
And tonight you get
my full concentration.

367
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:32,538
I'm honored.

368
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:43,729
Very good point, A.J.
So, what could Victor have done...

369
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,850
to save Elizabeth?

370
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:54,694
Anybody at all?

371
00:37:56,768 --> 00:38:00,374
Come on, people.
Did anybody read the book?

372
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:05,728
Guys.
It's "Frahnk-en-steen."

373
00:38:05,927 --> 00:38:10,012
You could have watched the movie!

374
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:13,848
Molly. Please.

375
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:15,970
Do you have any thoughts
on Victor and Elizabeth?

376
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,694
Well, uh...
Um...

377
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:22,130
Well, I think that Victor should have
confronted the monster sooner.

378
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,176
I mea... He's completely responsible
for Elizabeth's death.

379
00:38:24,407 --> 00:38:27,968
He was, he was so paralyzed by fear
that he never did anything.

380
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:30,813
It-It took death
for the guy to get a clue.

381
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:35,456
And why do you think he was
finally able to confront his monster?

382
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:36,774
I think that Victor had reached

383
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:38,975
a point in his life where he
had nothing left to lose.

384
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,739
I mean, the monster saw to that
by killing off everybody that he loved.

385
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:43,856
Victor finally had to face it.

386
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:46,654
It was about redemption.
It was his fate.

387
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:53,855
Okay, everybody, um,
have a good time!

388
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,014
John!

389
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,656
What?

390
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:28,291
It's a permission slip.

391
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:30,808
Bus leaves in 45 minutes.

392
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:34,375
- Go pack quick.
- Ma, I don't have to go.

393
00:39:34,608 --> 00:39:36,371
Go, just go! Have fun.

394
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,292
- You sure?
- Yes. Look, it's good for you.

395
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:41,576
It's good for me.

396
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:44,930
So, just call me.
You know, call. And call.

397
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:47,494
If you feel like
you've called too many times,

398
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,894
call once more.

399
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,977
Have a great time.

400
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,255
Thanks, Mom.

401
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,332
- Hey.
- So what was that all about?

402
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,336
She changed her mind
about Yosemite.

403
00:40:06,528 --> 00:40:08,416
- So now you're goin'?

404
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:10,450
Ah, I wouldn't say that.

405
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:32,132
I don't know.
If we were at the midterm...

406
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:35,170
No, she's doing fine.

407
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,450
No..

408
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,854
Mrs. Cheney,
can I call you right back?

409
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:09,335
- Oh! Oh!
- Damn it!

410
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:13,613
Oh, Miss Tate, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I-l didn't mean to make you jump.

411
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:17,129
- It's okay.
- Well, it's Halloween. I guess everyone...

412
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:19,615
is entitled to one good scare.

413
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:24,369
- I've had my share.
- U-Uh, Miss Tate,

414
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:27,047
I know it's not my place.

415
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:31,013
If I could be maternal
for a moment,

416
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:33,858
I don't like to see you like this.

417
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:37,290
I've seen you
like this before, and...

418
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:40,889
we've all had bad
things happen to us.

419
00:41:41,087 --> 00:41:44,695
The trick is to concentrate on today!

420
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:48,731
What do I know?

421
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:52,932
You just take care
of yourself, okay?

422
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:55,368
Thank you very much.
I'll see you Monday.

423
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:05,937
Oh! Mi-Miss Tate,
uh, Happy Halloween.

424
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:07,811
"She took off her clothes,
revealing her satiny-soft femininity."

425
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:09,975
And Lawrence looked at her
with lust in his eyes...

426
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:13,410
and said, 'I want to invade
every part of your being.

427
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:16,578
"I want to tantalize myself
with your sweet nectar!"

428
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,611
Oh, Tanya better not
fall for that shit.

429
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:22,016
- I smell that a mile away.
- "And Tanya laughed at him."

430
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:24,090
'You don't expect me to fall
for that shit, ' she said."

431
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,052
That's right,
make her smart. That's it.

432
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:29,136
- Oh, shit, honey, someone's here.
Can I call you back?

433
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:31,375
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'll hold on.
I wanna know what stupid line...

434
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,173
- Tanya falls for.
- The same one you did. Hold on a second.

435
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:48,855
- Hello!

436
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:50,890
Hello!

437
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,777
- Hey, honey.
- What's up? Where did you go?

438
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:59,011
I don't know. Some car at the gate.
I'm gonna have to call you.

439
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:19,610
- Hey.
- Wait, wait. What's goin' on, baby?

440
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:22,413
- I don't know.

441
00:45:22,608 --> 00:45:24,690
Honey... Where'd you...
Ronny!

442
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:28,016
You always fuckin' doin' this. You get
me goin', and then you gotta go. Ro...

443
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:32,654
Hello?

444
00:47:05,487 --> 00:47:07,251
- Aah!
- Oh!

445
00:47:07,447 --> 00:47:09,769
I keep scaring you today.

446
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,699
Wh-What are you doing?

447
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:15,732
Uh, n..

448
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:20,612
Nothing. I, um..

449
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:22,651
What are you doing?

450
00:47:22,847 --> 00:47:25,772
I'm making the rounds. I still
have to check on the kids, but...

451
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:29,768
I was hoping I would have the honor of
spending the evening with you tonight.

452
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,170
I'd like the company.

453
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:37,577
- Give me 20.
- Okay.

454
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:39,611
I'm okay.

455
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:57,935
Hello?

456
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:02,328
Do you want to die tonight, Cici?

457
00:48:02,568 --> 00:48:06,732
Oh, uh, come on... in.

458
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:11,535
Sarah, Molly.

459
00:48:11,728 --> 00:48:15,015
Just checking on the Hillcrest remains.
You girls okay?

460
00:48:15,247 --> 00:48:16,294
Good. Thanks, Mr. Brennan.

461
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:18,455
And how are you, Mr. Brennan?
Looking cute as ever.

462
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:21,014
Thank you, Sarah.
What are you two up to tonight?

463
00:48:21,207 --> 00:48:23,575
Well, we thought we'd hit the town,
pick up some guys.

464
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:26,452
You know, drop some Roofies in their
drinks. Have a whole date-rape evening.

465
00:48:26,648 --> 00:48:28,854
- Oh. Sounds good.
- Care to join us?

466
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,733
I can't. I'm, uh, I'm having
my nipples pierced.

467
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:34,009
- Oh.
- But you two have a good time.

468
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:37,131
- Will do.
- If you need anything, contact me or Miss Tate.

469
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:39,295
- Okay?
- Thanks, Mr. Brennan.

470
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:41,017
Behave.

471
00:48:41,207 --> 00:48:44,610
My stash. Come on.

472
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:52,050
- Come on.
- All right. Send it through here.

473
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:56,170
Come on, man. Let's go.

474
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,490
Yeah.

475
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:01,531
Come on.

476
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,457
John.

477
00:49:05,648 --> 00:49:07,616
Come on!

478
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:12,216
I got you.

479
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:58,651
Fuck it.

480
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:10,657
I thought we'd do this right.

481
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:12,691
Come on in.

482
00:50:16,407 --> 00:50:19,331
Oh, I love food.
I really do.

483
00:50:19,528 --> 00:50:22,292
I hope you don't mind
if I get really big and dumpy.

484
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,296
- It's my goal in life.
- Oh, no.

485
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:27,776
I, uh, I always found obesity
to be very sexy.

486
00:50:28,007 --> 00:50:30,214
God, you are so Renaissance.

487
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:44,418
Oh, the buffet has arrived!

488
00:50:44,648 --> 00:50:46,968
Ah, for your pleasure tonight,

489
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:51,651
we have prepared Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday's Hillcrest dinner selections,

490
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:54,293
ignoring Meat Loaf Monday
and Turkey Tuesday.

491
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:56,650
Thank you very much.
I hate that meat loaf.

492
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:57,690
Where's the booze?

493
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,732
- We need a corkscrew for that.
- Oh, I'll go get it.

494
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:04,569
- Just don't start anything without me.
- Don't worry.

495
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,377
I'm not who you think I am.

496
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:35,810
Okay.

497
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:37,850
Who are you?

498
00:51:40,688 --> 00:51:43,167
My name's not Keri Tate.

499
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:46,371
Mmm.

500
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:48,410
What is it?

501
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,729
Laurie Strode.

502
00:51:56,688 --> 00:51:58,656
- Strode?
- Strode.

503
00:51:58,887 --> 00:52:01,094
Okay.

504
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:03,938
I changed my name
when I went into hiding.

505
00:52:04,127 --> 00:52:06,368
Oh, I like that.
That's like... like the...

506
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:08,416
Like the witness protection program.

507
00:52:08,648 --> 00:52:11,298
What, did you like rat out
the mob or something?

508
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:17,616
My brother killed my sister...

509
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:20,014
- When she was 17.
- Wow.

510
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:23,137
Well, that's... "sucky."

511
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:27,090
How'd he do that?

512
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:30,336
With a really big,
sharp kitchen knife.

513
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:32,769
That's terrible.

514
00:52:33,007 --> 00:52:34,737
Take off your clothes.

515
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:36,856
You said you'd listen.

516
00:52:37,047 --> 00:52:39,779
Okay.

517
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:47,371
They locked him up
for a long time,

518
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:50,895
but he got out and...

519
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:53,568
he came after me,

520
00:52:53,768 --> 00:52:56,418
but I got away.

521
00:52:56,608 --> 00:53:00,054
But he killed
a lot of my friends.

522
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:06,176
- It happened...
- On Halloween.

523
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:09,416
- You've heard the story.
- Who hasn't?

524
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:13,613
Michael Myers.

525
00:53:13,807 --> 00:53:16,253
It's like 20 years ago, right?

526
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:19,018
1978.

527
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:22,131
And the girl that... What happened
to the sister? She died, right?

528
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:27,372
No, she faked her death.

529
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:31,736
And now she's the headmistress...

530
00:53:31,927 --> 00:53:35,409
of a very posh, secluded private
school in northern California.

531
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:37,690
What?

532
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:40,208
Hoping and praying every year...

533
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:44,655
that her brother won't find her.

534
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,214
You're tellin' me the truth?

535
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,495
- Now do you want a drink?
- Yeah.

536
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,577
I'll be right back.

537
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,498
Explains a lot, doesn't it?

538
00:54:09,728 --> 00:54:13,209
So you... you have been living
with this for 20 years?

539
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:16,537
Something like that.

540
00:54:16,728 --> 00:54:19,412
But honey, you-you don't...

541
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:21,894
You don't think that
after all this time h-he'd...

542
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:25,216
He'd still be comin'
after you, do you?

543
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:30,609
He sat in a sanitarium
for 15 years, waiting for me.

544
00:54:32,327 --> 00:54:34,216
And then...

545
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:40,497
One rainy night, he decides
to go trick-or-treating.

546
00:54:46,847 --> 00:54:48,737
How old were you?

547
00:54:55,247 --> 00:54:57,136
Seventeen.

548
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:01,896
What?

549
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:07,049
Do you think they made it to Yosemite?
Do you think they're there?

550
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:08,254
I don't know.

551
00:55:08,447 --> 00:55:11,531
I just... I just want
to call Johnny. Just...

552
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:17,327
What is it?
Keri, what are you doing?

553
00:55:17,528 --> 00:55:19,370
My phone's dead.

554
00:55:23,247 --> 00:55:25,170
Shit.

555
00:55:35,927 --> 00:55:39,010
- What's goin' on?
- Somebody didn't go to Yosemite.

556
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:41,255
Keri. Uh, what are you doing?

557
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:44,537
- I'm just gonna go find John.
- Th... This is nuts.

558
00:55:44,728 --> 00:55:47,048
I hope so.

559
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,811
- Jesus!
- Christ!

560
00:55:52,327 --> 00:55:53,488
Ronny, the phones are out.

561
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:56,133
I know, and there's a strange car
parked down at the gate,

562
00:55:56,327 --> 00:55:58,489
but I can't seem to find
any signs of trespassing.

563
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,610
Fuck.

564
00:55:59,807 --> 00:56:01,809
Okay, th-there's no reason
to get upset yet.

565
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,129
Let's just calm down.

566
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,569
Look, I'm gonna go look
for John and the kids.

567
00:56:06,807 --> 00:56:08,572
See if you can get the phones
working, and we'll meet back

568
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:10,491
at the gate, okay? Come on.

569
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:14,935
Charlie!

570
00:56:15,127 --> 00:56:17,289
Charlie?

571
00:56:17,528 --> 00:56:20,371
Where are you, Charlie?
We're waiting on you.

572
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:25,018
Charlie.

573
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:27,529
Inconsiderate, party of one,

574
00:56:27,728 --> 00:56:29,889
your table's ready.

575
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:36,010
Charlie?

576
00:56:42,648 --> 00:56:44,616
Hi! Gotcha.

577
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:46,617
You shit.

578
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,327
I found these, but no corkscrew.

579
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:52,815
Come on. I'm hungry!
Where are you going now?

580
00:56:53,007 --> 00:56:55,294
To see if there's
a corkscrew upstairs.

581
00:56:55,487 --> 00:56:57,650
I'll be right back.

582
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,930
Charlie.

583
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:33,450
Shit.

584
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:19,736
Hi.

585
00:58:45,407 --> 00:58:47,978
Shit.

586
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:51,294
Lights up, Charlie.

587
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:54,377
No sex games till I've eaten.

588
00:58:58,927 --> 00:59:00,816
Fuck.

589
00:59:11,568 --> 00:59:14,218
Charlie.

590
00:59:14,447 --> 00:59:17,257
Charlie, what are you...

591
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:20,490
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God!

592
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:24,652
No!

593
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:28,814
Oh, my...

594
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:36,089
Aaah!

595
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:47,930
Oh!

596
00:59:54,487 --> 00:59:57,013
. Oh!

597
01:00:17,887 --> 01:00:21,414
♪ They're laid to rest before ♪

598
01:00:21,608 --> 01:00:24,372
- Did you hear that?
- No. What was that?

599
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:30,089
I'm gonna go check
on those guys.

600
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:32,335
They've been gone for a while.

601
01:00:32,568 --> 01:00:34,536
- What do you think they're doin'?
- Hmm.

602
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:37,014
- Mmmmm.
- Kind of rates a cheap scare, doesn't it?

603
01:00:37,207 --> 01:00:39,050
- Let's go.
- All right.

604
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:54,536
Oh, fuck!

605
01:00:54,728 --> 01:00:56,651
Please.

606
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,258
Oh, please!

607
01:01:31,528 --> 01:01:35,009
- Hello!
- Maybe they just skipped to dessert.

608
01:01:37,487 --> 01:01:39,570
- What the hell's that?
- Oh, man.

609
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:44,370
What the fuck?

610
01:01:55,207 --> 01:01:57,734
This is a sick joke.

611
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:25,775
Oh, shit!

612
01:02:27,568 --> 01:02:29,456
Who's that?

613
01:02:29,688 --> 01:02:32,088
Let's get out of here.

614
01:02:32,287 --> 01:02:35,052
Keep moving. Keep moving!

615
01:02:36,528 --> 01:02:39,133
Go. Go.

616
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:41,415
- Go.
- Come on!

617
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:51,933
- Come on!
- John, please!

618
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,614
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

619
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:57,970
We're gonna go to the dorms,
and we're gonna call the cops. Okay?

620
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:00,648
Come on.

621
01:03:00,887 --> 01:03:03,174
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, please!

622
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:11,849
Aaah!

623
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:14,014
God!

624
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:17,254
Come on!

625
01:03:17,487 --> 01:03:19,296
Come on. Come on.

626
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:32,098
Get up.

627
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,976
Oh! My keys.

628
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:45,648
- Fuck! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- Come on. Come on.

629
01:03:45,887 --> 01:03:48,936
I can't find it! Oh, God.

630
01:03:49,127 --> 01:03:51,368
- Find the fucking keys!
- I know!

631
01:03:53,608 --> 01:03:56,451
Fuck!

632
01:03:57,608 --> 01:03:59,736
Oh... shit!

633
01:04:02,568 --> 01:04:03,807
Molly!

634
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:05,729
Molly, no!

635
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:08,089
Molly!

636
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:20,696
Somebody open the fucking door!

637
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:27,133
Oh, my God!

638
01:04:29,087 --> 01:04:31,614
Somebody open the door!

639
01:04:56,407 --> 01:04:58,375
What happened?

640
01:04:58,568 --> 01:04:59,807
Oh, God, he's stabbed.

641
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:01,048
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

642
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:03,454
Oh, God.

643
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:10,015
- Wait.
- Who was that?

644
01:05:12,087 --> 01:05:14,010
My brother.

645
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:22,931
Get in there.
Barricade the door. Lock it.

646
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,448
- Do as I say, now!
- Go.

647
01:05:25,648 --> 01:05:27,968
Go!

648
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:30,295
All right, what do we do?
What do we do?

649
01:05:30,487 --> 01:05:32,330
Try to live.

650
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:45,251
- Go.
- What?

651
01:05:45,447 --> 01:05:47,211
- Jump. Go!
- Keri.

652
01:05:47,407 --> 01:05:50,138
- I'm not leaving you.
- I'm not leaving John.

653
01:05:52,728 --> 01:05:54,809
Keri!

654
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:11,933
Oh.

655
01:06:15,887 --> 01:06:18,891
Oh, no!

656
01:06:19,127 --> 01:06:20,573
Oh! Oh, God!

657
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:24,609
Oh, God. Oh, no.

658
01:06:24,807 --> 01:06:28,209
Oh.

659
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:33,251
Oh, God. Oh.
I thought...

660
01:06:34,287 --> 01:06:36,734
Will!

661
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,214
Oh, fuck!

662
01:07:18,887 --> 01:07:21,094
Open up! It's me!

663
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,255
- Open up!
- Oh. my God!

664
01:07:23,447 --> 01:07:25,973
Go. Go!

665
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:38,773
Run! Run!

666
01:07:39,927 --> 01:07:41,816
Run!

667
01:07:45,887 --> 01:07:48,778
Oh, my God!

668
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,536
Shit!

669
01:07:55,768 --> 01:07:58,008
Come on.

670
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,891
Go! Now!

671
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:10,133
Mom!

672
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,335
Mom!

673
01:08:16,528 --> 01:08:19,451
Oh, my God!

674
01:08:36,608 --> 01:08:38,371
Miss Tate, come on!

675
01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:42,094
Go.

676
01:08:42,287 --> 01:08:44,938
- What?
- Go!

677
01:08:45,127 --> 01:08:47,892
I want you to drive down
the street to the Becker's.

678
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:50,818
It's a mile down the road. Tell them
to call an ambulance and get the police.

679
01:08:51,007 --> 01:08:54,011
- No, we're not leaving you.
- Do as I say, now!

680
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:56,209
- Mom?
- I'll be right behind you.

681
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:00,372
- Mom!
- I'll be right behind you. Go!

682
01:09:48,568 --> 01:09:50,650
Michael!

683
01:09:54,127 --> 01:09:56,050
Michael!

684
01:10:05,087 --> 01:10:07,010
Michael?

685
01:11:34,367 --> 01:11:36,769
Ohh!

686
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:41,498
- He's dead. He's dead. H-He's dead.
- No. No.

687
01:14:41,688 --> 01:14:45,089
- Shh, shh, shh, shh. He's dead.

688
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:48,814
He's dead, gone.
Shh, shh. Shh.

689
01:15:07,047 --> 01:15:10,893
I got it! Hey, baby,
I'm gonna write a romantic thriller!

690
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:13,010
- What?
- Yeah, a thriller.

691
01:15:13,207 --> 01:15:16,576
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

692
01:15:16,768 --> 01:15:20,135
Yeah! I'm fine.
The bullet just grazed me.

693
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:38,256
Don't move.

694
01:15:38,447 --> 01:15:40,769
Load him in!
Shut the door!

695
01:15:40,967 --> 01:15:43,811
- Hey, hey! Wait a minute.
- You, move!

696
01:15:48,608 --> 01:15:52,373
Watch out!

697
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:24,649
Come on.

698
01:17:26,927 --> 01:17:28,737
Come on. Get up.

699
