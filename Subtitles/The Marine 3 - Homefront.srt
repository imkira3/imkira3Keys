1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:06,275
<i>In the summer of 2002, I was 19 years old.</i>

3
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,196
<i>Lived my whole life
in Bridgeton, Washington.</i>

4
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,742
<i>After high school, I did what everybody
did: worked at the lumber mill.</i>

5
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,082
<i>But unlike most people here
who never leave...</i>

6
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,126
<i>...I knew I wanted something more.</i>

7
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,172
<i>Something to get me out of Bridgeton
and also serve my country.</i>

8
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,386
<i>So I enlisted
in the United States Marine Corps.</i>

9
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,692
<i>It was the toughest training of my life.</i>

10
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,694
<i>We prepared for everything.</i>

11
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,366
<i>By land, sea or air.</i>

12
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,536
<i>Wherever combat may be,
Marines are prepared.</i>

13
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,379
<i>It wasn't just about
achieving your goals...</i>

14
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,714
<i>...but about believing in yourself.</i>

15
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,306
<i>Our motto: Semper Fi.</i>

16
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,976
<i>Always faithful. Always loyal.</i>

17
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,602
<i>To your comrades in arms.</i>

18
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,062
<i>To your country.</i>

19
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,064
<i>To your family.</i>

20
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:48,919
<i>I saw the world.</i>

21
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,422
<i>For more than 10 years,
I moved about the globe.</i>

22
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,758
<i>Missions. Deployments. War.</i>

23
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,403
<i>Every now and again, you get to take leave.</i>

24
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,948
<i>My folks passed away a few years back.</i>

25
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:23,078
<i>Family for me now is just my two sisters,
Lilly and Amanda.</i>

26
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,667
<i>It's been over 14 months
and today I'm going home.</i>

27
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:42,056
<i>Not a whole lot's changed
Since I've been gone</i>

28
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,728
<i>Same old band
Still plays the same old songs</i>

29
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:55,194
<i>Yeah, this hole-in-the-wall dive bar
Don't ever get old</i>

30
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,533
<i>Oh, they never did sell out
And I'm still sold</i>

31
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:06,580
<i>Hello, my friend
How long's it been?</i>

32
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,084
<i>Yesterdays are here again</i>

33
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:15,422
<i>Shoot the moon
Till that big old ball falls down</i>

34
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,718
<i>Small-town boys haven't changed their ways</i>

35
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,222
<i>Still livin' in the glory days</i>

36
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,601
<i>Same old stories
Just keep getting better somehow</i>

37
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:32,523
<i>It's time to put a fresh coat of new paint
On this old town</i>

38
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:49,039
<i>Well, I remember not so long ago</i>

39
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:56,046
<i>The newness of that old familiar glow</i>

40
00:04:57,006 --> 00:05:03,053
<i>Yeah, these neon lights
Have got that same old buzz</i>

41
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:09,768
<i>This place is what it is
And what it was</i>

42
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,981
<i>Hello, my friend
How long's it been?</i>

43
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,318
<i>Yesterdays are here again</i>

44
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:22,406
<i>Shoot the moon
Till that big old ball falls down</i>

45
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,077
<i>Some folks still haven't changed their ways</i>

46
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,581
<i>Still livin' in the glory days</i>

47
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:35,252
<i>Same old stories
Just keep getting better somehow</i>

48
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,174
<i>It's time to put a fresh coat of new paint
On this old town</i>

49
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,608
You lost, boy?

50
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,866
Your daddy know you're out playing cop?
Now you take a good look, smartass.

51
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,242
Chief.

52
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,619
Of what? Mall security?

53
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,456
Marine or not, I will kick your ass.

54
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,208
Huh?
Come here.

55
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,295
Well, how you doing, man?
Good. You?

56
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,255
I can't complain. I try not to.

57
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:24,635
Just look at you, pal. You're looking good.
Real good. A little heavy, but healthy.

58
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,970
You know.
You look as dumb as ever.

59
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,223
Yeah, well, what do you do?
Yeah.

60
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,643
So how long are you home for?
Two weeks.

61
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,189
More than enough time for you and me
to get in trouble. Come on. Car's this way.

62
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,359
What happened to Woody's?

63
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,028
Went to shit when his kid took over.

64
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,494
Let's head it up.

65
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,125
Jeez. This thing steers like
a nightmare. It's unbelievable.

66
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,876
Well, it is a piece of junk.
Yeah.

67
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,088
Can't get anything new?
Bridgeton can't afford a new truck?

68
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,091
Bridgeton can't afford shit, man.
You know that.

69
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,848
You seen my little sister running around?
Time to time.

70
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,935
How's she doing?
Lilly's Lilly. You know? She's having fun.

71
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,020
She's looking for a job right now.
For a job?

72
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,106
Mm-hm.
I thought you set her up at Creston's?

73
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:23,026
I did. Went pretty good
for a couple weeks there too, but...

74
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,654
Then she went and told old Cresty
to go fuck himself.

75
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,449
She told Cresty to go fuck himself?
That's so you know.

76
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,201
Lilly's Lilly.
Yeah, Lilly is Lilly.

77
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,710
Whoa. Amanda.
Cooking school has not paid off.

78
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,300
<i>Soon the time is only hours</i>

79
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:50,053
<i>That we'll be going home again</i>

80
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,017
There he is.

81
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,734
Oh.
Oh, it's so good to see you in one piece.

82
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,819
You look great.
You look good.

83
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,572
I don't know about this. No.
You don't know about this?

84
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,619
- I love it!
- Get over... You love it?

85
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,749
Your hair's gotten longer.

86
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,668
Yours has too.
You staying out of trouble?

87
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,920
Hmm.
Hmm?

88
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,755
What do you need?
What can I get you?

89
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,799
A cold beer.
Done.

90
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,680
Cheers.
Cheers.

91
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,432
Here's to coming home in one piece.

92
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:42,147
Plenty more where that came from. They can't
wait to see the local celebrity down at the bar.

93
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,443
I got burgers. I got ribs.
The ribs are done in, like, 10.

94
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,403
The burgers are pretty much ready now.

95
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,447
I think they were ready
about 10 minutes ago.

96
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,786
- Maybe stay away from the burgers.
- We got lots more.

97
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,790
I made potato salad. I've got pie.
I got pecan and...

98
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:04,127
Whoa, whoa. Trying to fatten me up already?
That's what I do. I gotta fatten you up.

99
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,880
Here, have more.

100
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,715
I'm good.

101
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,429
Mom and Dad been asking about you.
How's Bernie and Gernie?

102
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,640
Starting to think they love you
more than me.

103
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,809
Of course they do.
What's Bernie been up to?

104
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,811
- Golf. You believe that?
- Really?

105
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,646
Golfing?
Must be a quick learner.

106
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,690
He's about a 12 handicap.
Twelve?

107
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,900
- Guess what mom is.
- What?

108
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,027
Nine.
Heh, heh, heh.

109
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:33,448
Bernie must be pissed.
Yeah. Dad's losing sleep over it too.

110
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,535
Speaking of losing sleep,
how are you sleeping?

111
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,079
I'm sleeping.
That is a complete lie.

112
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,374
What about you? Still crawling out
the window at midnight?

113
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,917
I'm still coming home at 4 a.m.

114
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,924
How's work?

115
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,264
Good.
You and Cresty getting along?

116
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,392
Swimmingly.
Swimmingly, huh?

117
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,521
I heard you told him to go fuck himself.

118
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,236
Um... Cresty's an asshole.

119
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,866
He's an asshole, but he gave you a job.
Later, Jake. It's not a big deal.

120
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,869
It's not a big deal?
You gonna find her another job?

121
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,830
I'll go check on that meat.

122
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,708
Welcome home.

123
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,501
You big buzz kill.

124
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,445
Mrs. Swanson.
Yes?

125
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,658
I'm running a bit behind today. I told
Mr. Vidier I was gonna push him 12 minutes.

126
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,701
So that bumps everyone else down.
Sure.

127
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,411
I had to drop off the kids today.

128
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,248
So can you push everyone down
15 minutes and call my trainer.

129
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,251
See if she can get me in at 12:15.
I should be done by then.

130
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,045
I should be all caught up.

131
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,255
My wife called...

132
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,846
On the fucking ground or die!

133
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,224
- Move it!
- Everybody down!

134
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,102
- Get down on the ground!
- Get on the ground! Move!

135
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,603
Move!

136
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,360
Everyone remain calm and quiet.

137
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:39,741
If you move or make any sound,
you will die.

138
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,541
You. Up.

139
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,344
Brendon and Liam.

140
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,263
Grades three and five.

141
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,056
Centerville Elementary School.

142
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,102
Your wife, Lynn? She's at Pilates till 10
where she goes every Tuesday and Thursday.

143
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,732
Then she goes to her part-time gig
at Our Lady of Victory Church.

144
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,276
You have a beautiful family, Glen.

145
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:18,488
But they will all be dead by day's end
if you do not cooperate with me fully.

146
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,656
Do you understand?

147
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,241
Mm-hm.

148
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:26,329
Have your tellers open their drawers
and give the cash to my men now.

149
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,998
Ms. Swanson. Ms. Swanson?

150
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,834
Have your tellers give these men
anything that they want.

151
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,419
Right now.
Okay.

152
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,629
Say it loud or she dies.

153
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,341
Ms. Swanson, have them open the drawers
and give the men the money. Now.

154
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,634
Now! Now!

155
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,893
- Hurry up!
- Open the fucking drawers.

156
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,772
Okay, okay!

157
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,114
I don't like bankers.

158
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,034
I'm a regional manager.

159
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,328
I don't make decisions. I follow orders.

160
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,208
How many houses
have you foreclosed on this year?

161
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,002
How many?

162
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,171
Too many.

163
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,548
Too many.
You know why?

164
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,510
It's greed, Glen.

165
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,263
Greed, people. It's a disease...

166
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,060
...that is eating away at our nation
from the top down.

167
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,356
Personal responsibility.
That's what builds a nation.

168
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,363
You take what you need.

169
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,866
No more. No less.

170
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,005
Let's go.

171
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,842
They'd be so proud of you.

172
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,845
Now me, not so much.

173
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,848
Divorced. No kids. Broke.

174
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,978
Property tax is killing me,
and I may have to sell the place.

175
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:59,065
It's just... It's too big for me and Lilly
and it doesn't make sense.

176
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,779
How much do you need?
No. You've done enough.

177
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,032
We live here. We'll pay the bills.
How much?

178
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,492
Mandy, have you seen my boots?

179
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,786
They're on the porch.
They were covered in mud.

180
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,997
That's why they're called
boots, not slippers.

181
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,165
You wear them outdoors.

182
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,627
Getting dressed around here
is like a frigging Easter egg hunt.

183
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,175
Has she thought about taking classes again?
You can have that chat tomorrow.

184
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,886
She'd love to give you her thoughts
on higher education.

185
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,764
Christ, Amanda.
She's gotta do something with herself.

186
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,850
Have you even talked to her about...?
Enough, Jake. I'm tired.

187
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,518
I just want to relax.

188
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,146
Okay.

189
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,691
Bye.
I'll see you guys later.

190
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,526
Where you going?

191
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,820
Out.

192
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,864
Darren's waiting.
Darren?

193
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,450
Darren Carlyle. Miller's kid.
You remember him.

194
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,243
I remember not liking him.

195
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,331
Jake, relax. Please. He's a good guy.

196
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,250
He's not some idiot
like the rest of the losers around here.

197
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,045
Didn't he go to juvie for selling weed?
Years ago.

198
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,130
I...

199
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,882
...love you.

200
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,509
So much.

201
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,636
Bye.

202
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,807
You're real subtle.

203
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,184
It's a gift.

204
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,563
Hey, baby.
Hey, you.

205
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,399
Come here.

206
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,234
Mm.

207
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,071
Wow. You look nice.

208
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,907
Thanks.

209
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,464
I noticed your brother's back.
Yep.

210
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,592
He still got a stick up his ass?
Yep.

211
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,099
He never liked me much anyways.

212
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,809
Let's just go.

213
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,604
Hey, Darren, come on in for a sec.
Have a beer or something.

214
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,692
Um...
Jake, you're not my dad. Okay?

215
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,028
Roger that?

216
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,696
Let's go. Now.

217
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,657
Go. Come on. Please. Drive.

218
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,579
Come on. Let's go. Whoa!

219
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,415
<i>Be my virgin number 72</i>

220
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,293
Whoo!

221
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,766
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

222
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,520
Well, that's interesting. Yeah.

223
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,149
That's the kind of news
I could have used last week.

224
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,322
Problem?

225
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,491
Summit's been moved up.

226
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,117
Tomorrow afternoon.

227
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,079
We can be ready.
The RDX?

228
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,123
I'll talk to Eckert.
His boys can make it by morning.

229
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,584
All right. Let's make it work.

230
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,837
Clear.

231
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,177
Disable that sensor.
You don't need it anyway.

232
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,721
Almost there.

233
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,518
Jackson, give them their bit.

234
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,939
- No more, no less.
- Payday, boys, payday.

235
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,191
A change of plans.

236
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,653
We move tomorrow.
Late afternoon.

237
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,697
Which means this car needs
to be ready by morning.

238
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,076
And the RDX rigged as soon
as possible.

239
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,832
How about you start telling us
what the actual game plan is?

240
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,253
Your lap dog over there
seems to know everything.

241
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,172
I know him. I trust him.

242
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,218
Well, that's just cute.

243
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,555
Congratulations to you.

244
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,849
But we've all put our ass on the line.

245
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,142
And don't forget:

246
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,103
They're my contacts
that are gonna score us the RDX.

247
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,230
Not yours.

248
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,315
Not his.

249
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,317
Mine.

250
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,695
You ground us.
You take our phones away.

251
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,906
You put us in a little corner
and lock us up in here like convicts.

252
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,701
I'm getting sick of working
with blinders on.

253
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,703
Blinders on?
Yeah.

254
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,958
For the integrity of the mission, I haven't
done anything that we haven't agreed to.

255
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,585
Integrity?

256
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,591
"The integrity of the mission."
I like that. No, I do.

257
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,677
This coming from a guy
who gets all bent out of shape...

258
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,556
...when we take a step outside to get
a breath of fresh air from this shit-hole.

259
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,101
But it's all for the integrity
of the mission.

260
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,353
Yeah, I get it. Okay.

261
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,274
Oh, yeah. One more thing,
that's bullshit.

262
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,195
Christ, Eckert, I get it.

263
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,240
Pope don't trust us.
Hell, he don't trust no one.

264
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,784
Don't take it so personal.
No, I get it too.

265
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,454
I am all for the cause.

266
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,123
Things in this country are fucked up.
Mm-hm.

267
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,626
But I want you to know one thing.

268
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:13,296
I'm not some monkey that's gonna do
a dance every time the music plays.

269
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:16,591
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What's the target?

270
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,138
By day's end tomorrow, you will know.

271
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,324
<i>You ain't never home</i>

272
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,534
All right, see you, man.

273
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,456
What'd I tell you?

274
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,459
Hey. Can I get a beer, man?
Payton.

275
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,212
Jake. Hey, man.
How's it going?

276
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,214
Good. Just got back.
How you been?

277
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,008
Ah. Awful. Hey. Let me get you a drink.
Awful?

278
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,095
No, I'm good. I'm just waiting on Hark.
Have you seen him?

279
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,846
No. No, I haven't.

280
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,975
Cheers.
Cheers.

281
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,818
Mm. I see Twig's here.
Twig's here?

282
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,695
Yeah, in the back.

283
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,240
What is it, like family night?

284
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,787
Man, seeing you again,
it reminds me of my little brother.

285
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,206
How's Petey doing?
Oh, terrible.

286
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,293
He married some ugly girl.
Sounds like Petey.

287
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:38,548
Dude, give me a little bit of room here.
What is your problem?

288
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,092
Dude, I ain't got no problem.
You got a problem?

289
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,178
Just fucking beat it, man.

290
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,057
Back the fuck off.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down.

291
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,102
All right?
How about we call it a night?

292
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,730
You know, he's kind of drunk.
You know?

293
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,567
Mother...!

294
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,741
Jesus fucking Christ, Jake.

295
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:47,200
Before you say anything... If we weren't
pals, you'd be in jail right now.

296
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,331
So let me get this straight.

297
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,125
You come home.
You tell Amanda how to run the house.

298
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,753
You disapprove of Lilly's lifestyle.
Look at me, dude.

299
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,130
And the boyfriend.
You hate him too.

300
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,549
You know...
Don't talk.

301
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,009
So then what?

302
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,179
You come down for a cold one
and brutalize a redneck?

303
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,474
I've had better days.
If you are going to come home...

304
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:15,103
...you're gonna have to learn how
to assimilate to normal society.

305
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,611
Look, Lilly's dating a punk.
His name's Darren.

306
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,988
He's actually a pretty nice kid.
He's a loser.

307
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,616
You're a broken record.
Who do you want her dating?

308
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,410
A neurosurgeon?
Rocket scientist?

309
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,286
What do you want? This is Bridgeton.

310
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,998
Are you gonna take this guy home?
Do I have to?

311
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,084
For the sake of
the civilized world, yes.

312
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,963
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go see
a gentleman about his missing teeth.

313
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,173
Call me later.
Yeah.

314
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,553
Call me later?

315
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,014
Hark and I have been
seeing each other a bit.

316
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,519
You've been seeing Hark.

317
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,897
You know what's funny? You don't
even approve of your own best friend.

318
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,525
You come home every time
like a bull in a china shop.

319
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,278
Me, Hark, Lilly,
we love you to death but...

320
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,196
You gotta let this go, Jake.

321
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,158
We don't need a protector.
We're all grown up here.

322
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:15,037
Do you want a ride or don't you?
Yes.

323
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,321
- You ready?
- Just give me a couple of minutes.

324
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,631
I'll get you out of this junkyard.
Gotta find this connector.

325
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,216
Cool?

326
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:35,433
<i>Stand tall and proud
On your rusty bow</i>

327
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,477
You all right?

328
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,146
<i>The sight of land won't let you down</i>

329
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,606
Mm.

330
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,066
What's on your mind?

331
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,903
<i>When the fog has cleared
I'm an island now</i>

332
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,821
Do you want to stay here forever?

333
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,032
Here?

334
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,160
No, just gotta get this
battery connector off,

335
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,746
then we can get the hell
out of here.

336
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,957
No. I meant here in Bridgeton.

337
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,919
Oh. Heh.

338
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,506
No. Not really.

339
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,257
Why not?

340
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,676
Not sure where I'd go.

341
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,179
Yeah, me neither.

342
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:16,390
My brother wants
to get to know you better.

343
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,101
Wants to have you over
for dinner.

344
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,272
<i>'Cause I fall sleep with dignity</i>

345
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,734
<i>And you're safe</i>

346
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:27,944
Fuck that.

347
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:32,907
<i>'Cause you filled that hole
Before it was empty</i>

348
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,826
You know military guys
remind me of my stepdad.

349
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,036
I know.

350
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,455
You know,
it's that "do this, do that" attitude.

351
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:43,668
"Cut your hair. Go to school.
Get a job."

352
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,504
It's never good enough.

353
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,466
Even when I get a fucking job,
I gotta get a better one.

354
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,887
<i>I thought I heard bells
But I confused the sound</i>

355
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,138
Hey.

356
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,141
Come on.

357
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,895
<i>I'm an island now</i>

358
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,404
Yeah.

359
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,839
All right, you two stay back.

360
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,508
Keep your eyes open. I don't
trust this guy. ECKERT: Oh.

361
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,845
Surprise, surprise.

362
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,972
Do you trust him?

363
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,600
His stuff is legit.

364
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,518
I trust that.
We'll see.

365
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,186
Let's go.

366
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,959
Eckert.

367
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,878
Let's take a look.

368
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:12,131
He's all business. Ha.

369
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,300
I like that.

370
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:19,680
USDA prime cut.

371
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,849
Check it out.

372
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,983
Looks good.
Good.

373
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,653
What did I tell you?

374
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,120
You might want to hold on there.

375
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,040
Gentlemen, I think we have a problem.

376
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,835
I don't like problems.
Shit, neither do I.

377
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,089
The change in schedule
was a real pain in my ass.

378
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,556
What the fuck's going on up there?
I don't know.

379
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,934
Rush order comes with a price.

380
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,144
What you've got in your hands
is what you get.

381
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,938
We had a deal. Right?

382
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:13,734
That was the deal. Look, I understand,
y'all don't like a curve ball.

383
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:19,949
If you need time to think about it, we can
put this off to tomorrow or the next day.

384
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,367
Can't wait till tomorrow.

385
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,956
Holy shit.
It's okay, it's okay.

386
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,711
Eckert, you son of a bitch.

387
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,258
Get down.
Go!

388
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,885
Let's go. Get in the car.
Go, go, go.

389
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,901
Hey, what's up?
Amanda, it's me. I just saw a shooting.

390
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,404
Come on, baby. Come on!
Get it going! No, I'm with Darren.

391
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,408
It's three guys, and they
just shot him in the head.

392
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:06,495
Just calm down and tell me where you are.
We're at Grayson's junkyard.

393
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,663
Yeah, by the river.

394
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,793
Shit.

395
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,963
Go, go, go. Fuck.

396
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,567
- What's up?
<i>- Jake, Lilly just called me.</i>

397
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:34,190
She was screaming, crying.
She said that she saw somebody get shot.

398
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:38,235
She... Something's wrong. Something's wrong.
I called Hark, but he didn't answer.

399
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,363
Where?
<i>Grayson's junkyard.</i>

400
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,815
Everything go okay?
Yeah, great.

401
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,068
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell is this now?

402
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,904
Hostages.
When did that become part of the plan?

403
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:26,242
I say we kill them now and throw them
off the boat but no one listens to me.

404
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,744
Yeah, well, killing kids
is never part of the plan.

405
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:32,414
No, it's not. We'll split them up
and shut them up. Let's go.

406
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:36,001
Just hold... Hold him.

407
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,379
- Darren!
- Aah!

408
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,256
No!
Boss man. Boss man.

409
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,008
She's got one of these.
Give it. No.

410
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,766
Can't have these on my boat.

411
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,937
Take her.

412
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,106
Let me go.

413
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,283
How much longer?
I'd say no longer than three hours.

414
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,243
Good. Let's go.

415
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,134
Cazel, enough.

416
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:26,969
Come on, man.

417
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,600
Fuck you, man.

418
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,812
You touch Lilly and I'll fucking kill you!

419
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,061
Hold it.

420
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:07,152
I got no trouble with you.
My sister is missing.

421
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,655
I got trouble with that.

422
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,374
Where is she?

423
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,090
She's in the old ferry.

424
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,717
Okay?

425
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,276
But it really doesn't matter
to you now, does it?

426
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,115
Up, up, up.

427
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,223
<i>I'm in the forest near
Grayson's junkyard. No sign of Lilly.</i>

428
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,809
<i>I think she's on the old Cascadia.
Headed there now.</i>

429
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:21,977
Talk to Hark?
<i>Yeah.</i>

430
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,188
I'm waiting for him out by Route 37.

431
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,649
Tell him he'll find some bodies
north of the junkyard into the trees.

432
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,819
Grown men, 30s. See if he can ID them.
Okay.

433
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,406
He's gonna want some backup.
It's not safe out here. You understand?

434
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,159
Yes. No, I understand, Jake.

435
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:41,288
Just find her, okay. Just find her.
Talk to you in a bit.

436
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,505
Shit.

437
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,843
Darren! Darren!

438
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,534
Psst.

439
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,996
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon.

440
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:26,458
Agent Wells, FBI. Drop your weapon.

441
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,627
Do it.

442
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,468
Hands on your head.

443
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,555
You okay?

444
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,525
What we got here is Jake Carter,
4670 Grandview Road.

445
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,610
Local boy, huh?

446
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,906
Sergeant, USMC.

447
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,908
Active duty?

448
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,661
What are you doing?
My sister's been abducted.

449
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,288
Your sister?

450
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:09,710
<i>Thompson,
get to the forest at Grayson's junkyard.</i>

451
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,754
<i>I got a Marine here telling me
there's three dead bodies out there.</i>

452
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:21,680
- Call the state police.
- No need for that.

453
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,267
Special Agent Thompson, FBI.
You must be Chief Harkin.

454
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,977
That's right.

455
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:30,230
We got three bodies here and two kids
missing. Possibly abducted.

456
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,357
Two kids missing?

457
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,443
One of them is my little sister.

458
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,946
All right, you two need to come
with me.

459
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,128
This way.

460
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,679
- That's gonna be the maximum.
- What can that penetrate?

461
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,974
Amanda Carter.

462
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,394
Chief Harkin.
I'm Special Agent Wells.

463
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,190
We believe your sister and her friend
are being held on the old Cascadia.

464
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:16,777
I don't understand. What's going on?
It's complicated.

465
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,616
Look, I'm sorry we can't treat this
strictly as a kidnapping.

466
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,493
There's a lot more at play here.

467
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,164
Jonas Pope has been on our watch list for some time.
He is not your usual extremist.

468
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,334
He was raised by a loving middle-class
family in Spokane.

469
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:36,004
His father leveraged their home
to pay for his college education.

470
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,800
Pope earned his doctorate in philosophy
from Seattle Pacific.

471
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:43,178
Parents had all their savings wrapped up
in the market. It collapsed.

472
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:46,098
They got hit hard, lost their house.
His dad killed himself.

473
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,184
A year later, his sister was diagnosed
with ovarian cancer.

474
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:52,479
She was dropped from her insurance carrier
when she hit stage Ill.

475
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,274
Pope flew to Spokane to meet
with the insurance adjuster.

476
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,360
He pulled a .22, shot her in her face.
Jesus.

477
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,280
From there, he went into hiding
thanks to Galen Jackson.

478
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,199
Jackson's leader of a small militia group
out of Billings, Montana.

479
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,327
Anti-establishment radical, gun fanatic,
weapons expert.

480
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:12,541
They're preparing for some kind of attack
involving RDX. A very powerful explosive.

481
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,959
Okay, I get it.

482
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:17,254
I'd like to know how you plan to rescue
my sister and her boyfriend.

483
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:20,299
- We're going in.
- I can help you.

484
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,469
Infiltration-extraction. It's what I do.
Not here. My men, my men only.

485
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,889
You just storm in with our sister inside?
We're waiting for a signal.

486
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,141
From who?

487
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,476
A reliable source.
Undercover?

488
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,229
Last night, he told us of this
hideaway on the Cascadia.

489
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,566
But he still hadn't learned
the location of the attack.

490
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,527
We haven't heard from him since.

491
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,573
Now, if you'll excuse me.

492
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,500
- So how do I look?
- I'd shoot you.

493
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,589
Great work, boys.

494
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,883
Great work.

495
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,224
Gentlemen.

496
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:15,854
Everything that we have worked for
ends today.

497
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:23,278
Our target is an engine of greed...

498
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:26,073
...a cancer to our society.

499
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,284
By the end of this day...

500
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,454
...our voices will be heard.

501
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,790
As one.

502
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,881
As one.

503
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,330
What is it?

504
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,125
Somebody's making a call.

505
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,365
Yeah, I know.

506
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,034
Yeah. I know.
I'm doing my best, all right?

507
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,455
Yeah, I'm doing my best. It's impossible.
These guys aren't gonna...

508
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,873
Hang up.

509
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,712
Look, it's not what you think.
Who were you talking to?

510
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,214
My girlfriend down in Tacoma.

511
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:12,220
She's pregnant. All right?
I was just calling to check on her.

512
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,140
Four months in. Last time we spoke,
she had stomach pains.

513
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,893
It's all I was doing. I'm
not bullshitting you.

514
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,188
The rules are the rules.
Stop. Wait.

515
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,483
I'm with you on this, Pope. I'm all in.

516
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,819
I was just calling to check on my girl.
That's all I was doing.

517
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:29,488
Redial.

518
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,240
What?
Redial.

519
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,367
All right.

520
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:38,914
I wanna hear it.

521
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:47,255
<i>What happened? I lost you.</i>
Yeah, I'm sorry. We had a bad connection.

522
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:52,802
<i>I'm seeing my doctor in the morning.
Gonna run some tests. Another ultrasound.</i>

523
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:58,099
<i>Is this the number I can reach you at?</i>
I'm gonna have to check back with you.

524
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,186
I'm gonna have to go now, babe. Okay?
<i>Okay.</i>

525
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,271
<i>I love you, babe.</i>
I love you too.

526
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,981
<i>Bye.</i>

527
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,246
Next time you want to contact her,
talk to me first.

528
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,747
Okay?

529
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,249
Yeah.

530
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,503
Yeah, okay.

531
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,221
Come on! Let me out!

532
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:47,774
Let me out!

533
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,612
This can't be much fun for you.

534
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,906
I'm sorry.

535
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,243
You and your friend.

536
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,579
What were you doing
out there today?

537
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,417
Hoping for some privacy.

538
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,503
Seems like
we crashed your party.

539
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,674
Seems we crashed yours.

540
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,094
Hm.

541
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,605
Do you like rich people?

542
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,026
Rich people. Do you like them?
I don't know.

543
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,778
Who is the richest person you know?

544
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:39,075
Come on, simple question.
Who is the richest person you know?

545
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,371
Um... My friend's dad.

546
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,207
He's a contractor.

547
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:51,463
He makes like $300,000 a year.
Okay.

548
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,882
Okay. I don't mind that sort of rich guy.

549
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:57,927
He's doing something for society.
He builds houses.

550
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,221
People actually live in houses. Right?

551
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,225
There are others out there
that make 10 times, 50 times that...

552
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,978
...by doing absolutely nothing.

553
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,398
Nothing for society.

554
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,068
They just move money around.

555
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:17,489
But here's the real kicker.
They'll buy companies.

556
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:22,702
Companies like companies that build houses.
They'll buy the company...

557
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:28,917
...strip it down, fire half the people,
and then sell that company for a profit.

558
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:32,003
That's not rich.

559
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,421
That's obscene.

560
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,927
What do you want?

561
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,179
I just wanna be heard.

562
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,108
One more question.

563
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,444
Are you happy with the world
that you live in?

564
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,117
No.
No?

565
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,536
Neither am I.

566
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,710
All good here, boss?
Yeah. All good.

567
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,630
Teddy, keep her company.

568
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,949
Hi.

569
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,826
Alone at last.

570
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,623
Keep you company.

571
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,629
I like your jeans.
Don't touch me.

572
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:01,342
Why you gotta be like that? I ain't so bad.

573
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,180
When you know me...

574
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,932
Hey, hey, hey.

575
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,435
Be nice. Hey, hey, hey.

576
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,020
Don't make me hurt you.

577
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:17,776
I really don't want to hurt you.
Don't fucking touch me.

578
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,867
Stop touching... Help!
Shh.

579
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,703
Help!
All right! All right!

580
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,834
What the fuck? What do you want?

581
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:08,576
My name is Alec Simms, I'm a federal agent.
I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay?

582
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,120
Are you all right? That's fine.

583
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,748
Give me your wrist. Come here.
I could've done that.

584
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,918
Come on, this way.
Okay.

585
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,755
What?
Darren.

586
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,174
I'll get him,
but we need to get you out of here.

587
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:27,262
No, I'm coming with you. Please.
We need to get you off this boat.

588
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,055
Please.
Okay.

589
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,419
Okay. Shh.

590
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,849
Teddy's dead.
What?

591
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:15,351
The boy and the girl are gone.
Find them.

592
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:18,813
They'll compromise our location.
Somebody's already onto us.

593
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,106
What?

594
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:25,904
Where?
Nine o'clock and 2 o'clock.

595
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,116
Feds.

596
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,243
Somebody tipped them off.

597
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,997
Look, we've got enough weapons
and ammo to handle just about anybody.

598
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:39,334
We're gonna see this thing through, right?

599
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,544
Hell, yeah, we are.

600
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,853
- Agents down. All units move in, move in!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

601
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,189
You think that's a good idea?
Stay out of it.

602
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:03,900
Don't go in yet, not like that.
I got two men down.

603
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:07,445
They're just gonna let you walk in?
We got a plan. If you'll excuse me.

604
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:10,198
What's the plan?
Get your hand off of me.

605
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,617
My sister is in there.
I know that.

606
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:17,413
There are thousands of other lives at stake.
So if you'll excuse me, sergeant...

607
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,666
...fuck off and let me do my job.
Fuck off?

608
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,501
Oh, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

609
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:23,878
I got a lot more on my plate
than stupid kids.

610
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,713
Stupid kids?

611
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:31,219
Sarge, I don't know if you're some kind
of war hero, a tank mechanic, a cook.

612
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:36,015
And I don't give a shit. You just
touched a federal agent. Arrest him!

613
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,939
Jake.

614
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,733
That's enough.

615
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,069
This is their call. That's the law.

616
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,741
Turn around and put your hands
behind your back.

617
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,870
Right now.

618
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,963
Thanks, chief.

619
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,259
Behind your back.

620
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,096
All agents, move in.

621
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,265
Let's go. Here we go. Come on.

622
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,899
Cazel, the bow.
Jackson, broadside. Let's go.

623
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,403
I want another 60 and the deuce on the bow.
Browder, stick with Cazel.

624
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,032
Let's go. In. Move, move.

625
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,617
Get in here. Stay here, stay quiet.

626
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,453
I'll be back, okay? Lock it.
Okay.

627
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,460
Thank God.

628
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,809
Stay down, stay down.

629
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,943
Fire!

630
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,497
<i>Man down. Man down.</i>

631
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,617
- Thompson, we...
- Make the call.

632
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,988
- We gotta get on the boat!
- Make the call.

633
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,170
Oh, God.

634
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,345
Call it off. Call it off!

635
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:22,723
- Do you hear this?
<i>- Call it off, for chrissake.</i>

636
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,402
Where the fuck have you been?

637
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,613
With Pope.

638
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,593
Let me take a look.

639
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,021
Come on, it's clear. Let's go.
Let's go.

640
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,475
You're gonna take some heat for this.

641
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,852
Yep.

642
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,200
Be smart.

643
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,740
Talk to me.
What the hell is going on?

644
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,659
I've got two innocents on board.
We know that.

645
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,037
What else you got?
He's moving this afternoon.

646
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,788
<i>What's the target?</i>
Still no word.

647
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:36,167
<i>Delivery system?</i>
He's packed every ounce of into RDX into...

648
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,590
Okay.
Okay.

649
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,594
Come on.

650
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:51,182
Okay, let's go.

651
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,938
- Hey!
- Shit!

652
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,774
Go, go, go.

653
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,610
Which way?
Go to the stairs. Go!

654
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,030
Run!

655
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,618
Here, Darren!

656
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:13,954
Go, go, go!

657
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,041
You're dead!
It's fucking locked.

658
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,043
Try the window.

659
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,134
Come on, Darren. Come on!

660
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:29,762
No!

661
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,307
No!

662
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,312
Get the fuck off of me!

663
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:46,112
Help me! Darren!

664
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:51,492
Your girlfriend's dead.
Lilly! Lilly!

665
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:17,203
- No. No.
- Stop it.

666
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,625
What happened?
He was making a call.

667
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,461
Didn't get much out.
Are you sure?

668
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,505
Yeah.
Are you?

669
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:31,759
I'm sure.
All right, what's the plan?

670
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:35,012
Get us out of this clusterfuck if you ask me.
Nobody asked you.

671
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,682
All right, sit down. Sit.

672
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,523
Amanda.

673
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,653
Who is Amanda?

674
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,864
I'll ask you one last time.
Who is Amanda?

675
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:56,909
She's my sister.

676
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,341
Lilly?
Hi, Amanda.

677
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:14,426
You probably figured something
was up.

678
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:18,013
And I assume you've connected with the
feds, who apparently have found me.

679
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,642
So if you could be so kind, could you put
the man in charge on the phone?

680
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:32,111
This is Special Agent Wells.
Well, you did one hell of a job today.

681
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:33,862
<i>You call me for a reason, asshole?</i>

682
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,490
Well, after presiding over
so many pointless deaths...

683
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:38,951
...you must be a big hit
amongst your colleagues.

684
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,160
So I was wondering...

685
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:43,289
...maybe you'd like to do something today
you'd be proud of.

686
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:48,085
That would be?
<i>Saving the life of a young lady.</i>

687
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,839
Put her on the phone.
Okay.

688
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,924
Lilly, say hello.
Amanda, there are five guys...

689
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,134
Shh.

690
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,764
Wells? I'm giving up.
But I am not surrendering.

691
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:02,600
You can't have it both ways.

692
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,519
Don't tell me what I can't have.

693
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,730
I want an escort out of here with the girl.

694
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:12,359
If I pass through without any trouble,
I will let Lilly go, unharmed.

695
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:13,819
We'll send a car right over.

696
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:15,029
<i>No.</i>

697
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,990
<i>There's a state police substation
10 miles down Route 37.</i>

698
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,285
I want a state trooper here
in 20 minutes.

699
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,203
Standard cruiser, clear windows.

700
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,248
No SUV. No vans. No surprises.

701
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:29,752
One trooper in a patrol car
and I want his name in advance.

702
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:35,549
If he's not driving up the bow of this
ferry in 20 minutes, the girl dies.

703
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,305
Call the state police.

704
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:26,016
Go.

705
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,822
Shit.

706
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,349
Damn it.

707
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,464
- I can pull...
- Shut her up.

708
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,448
I've been doing this my whole life.

709
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,575
Where are we going?

710
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:08,202
Are you gonna let me go?

711
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,370
Listen.

712
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:15,542
If we get out of here alive and we make it
to our destination, I will let you go.

713
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,758
Okay, okay, okay.

714
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,268
Pretty good match, huh?

715
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,978
Perfect.

716
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,272
Switch the plates.
Yeah.

717
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:34,408
Darren, it's me.
Calm down. Calm down.

718
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:37,911
Fuck. Christ, man.
What are you doing here?

719
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:40,038
Oh, fuck.
You okay?

720
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:41,999
Yeah, man, I'm fine. I'm fine.

721
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,250
Where's Lilly?

722
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:46,586
Fuck, I don't know, man.
You know, I'm looking for her.

723
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:50,090
She told me to leave, but I'm not going
anywhere. I'm staying right here.

724
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,843
Hey, you did good, kid.

725
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:58,432
Hey, hey, you know how to use that thing?
Been hunting my whole life, man.

726
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:01,727
Any idea where they took Lilly?
Yeah.

727
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:05,439
I think they're in the carport. That's
where all the activity was going down.

728
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,857
Let's go.

729
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:09,151
Hey. Easy.

730
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,120
Hey.

731
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,205
Hey, she's right there.
Shh.

732
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,042
Hey, get out of here.

733
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,461
What about Lilly?
You heard me. Get out of here.

734
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,755
Wha...? Fuck that, man. She's right there.

735
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,257
I will get Lilly.

736
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:34,301
You just go.

737
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:36,470
Let me do what I do.

738
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:40,640
Okay.

739
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,811
We enter the underground
parking structure right here, off Helmsley.

740
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,730
Right? We come straight through here.

741
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:50,817
Park between these sections and blow the
entire support structure of the building.

742
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,903
Wha...? You're blowing up a building?

743
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,449
Did you not hear what I said
about the rich?

744
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:59,326
Why?
To make them listen!

745
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:03,497
You see...

746
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:06,458
...if you kill a couple of CEOs,
you make the local news.

747
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:12,506
If you knock off a dozen, you make
the CNN/Fox cycle for about three days.

748
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:17,511
You take down 20 fat cats...

749
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:21,098
...and 30 stories of glass and steel,
then you make history.

750
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:23,517
But what about the workers?

751
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,435
What about everybody else?

752
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,193
Show me the rig.
Yeah.

753
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,955
All right, so...

754
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,164
Check it out.

755
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:50,544
Right now it is on standby.

756
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,796
Plenty of time to get
the hell out of Dodge.

757
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:55,715
Once the car is in position,
we enter the code here.

758
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,218
Countdown begins.

759
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:02,347
Put your fucking hands up.

760
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,184
All right.
Uncuff the girl.

761
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:07,978
I'm sorry?

762
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:09,563
Jake.

763
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,482
You think I'm playing?
No, I don't.

764
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,235
No!

765
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:21,283
No! Stop it!

766
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,577
Shut her up.
Stop!

767
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:26,746
POPE
Eckert. Get her in the car.

768
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:31,001
Move. Come on.

769
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:37,841
Shit!

770
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:39,759
Get in the car.

771
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:42,637
Jackson. Jackson, what happened?

772
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,514
He shot me.

773
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,351
Not good, pal.
Get out of here.

774
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:51,104
Get in the car and get the fuck out of here.
Go! ECKERT: Pope!

775
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:53,940
Jake!

776
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:58,278
Jake!

777
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:01,031
Run!

778
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:03,033
Pope, I can handle him.

779
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:05,952
Leave me the gun,
get the fuck out of here.

780
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,622
Pope, you gotta be in Seattle
in 40 minutes.

781
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,415
Go, brother.

782
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,043
- What's he know?
- We gotta go.

783
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,295
Does he know anything?
I'll take care of him.

784
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:16,713
I'll take care of him!

785
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,424
Pope, we gotta go!
Go!

786
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,636
Go, brother, I'll be fine.

787
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:29,809
Shit.

788
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:35,815
Go!

789
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,586
Where are they?

790
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:03,843
<i>Amanda?</i>

791
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,137
Yes. This is Amanda.

792
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,973
Please can I just speak
with Lilly?

793
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:09,683
Let me talk to Lilly.
<i>Put Wells on.</i>

794
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,519
Please just let me talk...
Put Wells on the fucking phone!

795
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,104
No, no, no, stop.
Hey!

796
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:16,022
Give him the phone.

797
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:23,154
Yeah.
<i>Wells, you listen to me.</i>

798
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:25,031
<i>No tails, no choppers, no tracking...</i>

799
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,534
...or I shoot the girl in the head.
You understand?

800
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,327
Understood.

801
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:35,542
All right, ready the men,
he's on his way, just south of Route 23.

802
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,837
We're gonna follow shortly.
What are you doing?

803
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,506
Gonna nail this son of a bitch.

804
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:45,278
Thought I told you to leave.

805
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:46,988
Fuck that.

806
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:51,910
I'll thank you later.

807
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:43,002
This is downtown.

808
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:46,840
Medical building. Helmsley Avenue.

809
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:54,055
They took Lilly.
Yeah. They took Lilly.

810
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:56,182
Downtown Seattle.

811
01:13:56,349 --> 01:14:00,520
That means
they're gonna pass through Bridgeton.

812
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:02,439
They're gonna go right through town.

813
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,441
I'll see you later.

814
01:14:34,888 --> 01:14:36,890
Easy, easy.

815
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:43,313
Relax back there. Stop fucking fidgeting.

816
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,734
Come on, light's green.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

817
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:05,835
Go, go, go!

818
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,712
- Fuck.
- Go, go, go!

819
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,598
Step out of the vehicle with your hands up.

820
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,892
They got us boxed in.

821
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,062
Fuck it.

822
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:33,071
It's not the statement I wanted to make,
but it'll make the headlines.

823
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:39,619
Out of the car slowly
with your hands in clear view.

824
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,329
Let's do it.

825
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:08,314
Cover me!

826
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:11,442
Go!

827
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:18,408
Get out! Get out! Let's go! Go!

828
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:32,839
Stop!

829
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,706
Shit!

830
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:09,000
Hold it there.

831
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,419
Take your shot.

832
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,048
Go ahead. Take it.

833
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,342
Take it.
Stop.

834
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,636
Take it!

835
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,857
Stop right there.

836
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:39,781
He can't take that shot.

837
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:42,909
But I can.

838
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:31,791
Jake.

839
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:38,381
You're not hurt?

840
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:46,848
The car. It's a bomb.

841
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:49,350
The... It's a bomb, the car.

842
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:50,893
He triggered it.

843
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,312
I saw him do it.

844
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:01,195
How much time?

845
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,405
Not good.

846
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,365
Jesus.

847
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,452
Get out of here, kid. Go.

848
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:08,995
Go.

849
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:14,417
Go to the cedar mill by the river.
Open road. LILLY: Amanda!

850
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:49,262
<i>Alone I face the sun</i>

851
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:54,225
<i>The burning has begun</i>

852
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:57,228
<i>I live to find a way</i>

853
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:02,358
<i>A never-ending phase</i>

854
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:11,617
<i>My heart is on display</i>

855
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:16,956
<i>And I long to find my place</i>

856
01:21:17,123 --> 01:21:21,294
<i>A light to shine right through</i>

857
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:27,133
<i>All of the shadows on my face</i>

858
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,637
<i>So shine for me as one</i>

859
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:37,310
<i>Cast a shadow on the sun</i>

860
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:41,355
<i>A light to find my way</i>

861
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:46,903
<i>I hope tomorrow comes today</i>

862
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:50,448
<i>And I will be the one</i>

863
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:56,871
<i>A shadow on the sun</i>

864
01:21:57,038 --> 01:22:01,000
<i>A light to find a way</i>

865
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:04,712
<i>Because tomorrow comes today</i>

866
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:10,718
<i>And I have the strength to overcome</i>

867
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:15,890
<i>I have the will to carry on</i>

868
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:20,978
<i>And I'm not scared to face this world</i>

869
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,356

<i>All my buddies that I grew up with</i>

883
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:41,632
<i>Got a wife, a job, a mortgage</i>

884
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:45,219
<i>And a couple of kids</i>

885
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:50,599
<i>Well on their way to that life uptown</i>

886
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:56,355
<i>And I'm trying like hell
Just to settle down</i>

887
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:59,650
<i>I wanna be a good man</i>

888
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:02,653
<i>I wanna do the right thing</i>

889
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:06,699
<i>I wanna do a damn good job
And earn my keep</i>

890
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:14,707
<i>But I slip sometimes
I trip sometimes</i>

891
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:20,129
<i>And the devil gets ahold of me</i>

892
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:27,678
<i>I don't blame you
If you can't stay</i>

893
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:33,058
<i>No woman ought to have to live this way</i>

894
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:38,731
<i>Wondering when the man will come around</i>

895
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:45,321
<i>While he's out there
Trying just to settle down</i>

<i>A wild river runs inside every man</i>

902
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:32,618
<i>And he does his very best

903
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:38,707
<i>But something that he's looking for
And hasn't found</i>

904
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:44,713
<i>Makes it hard as hell
To ever settle down</i>

905
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:51,136
<i>Oh, I'm trying like hell
Just to settle down</i>

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
