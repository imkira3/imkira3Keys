00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,660
Thiobacillus, which,

3
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:36,207
William, is a remarkable bacterium
because...

4
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,793
It's the only known organism
that lives in sulfuric acid.

5
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:41,129
That's right, and...

6
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,424
- Yes, Miss Rouhani?
- Deinococcus radiodurans.

7
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:48,428
First discovered in 1956, breeding
inside drums of radioactive waste.

8
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:51,556
That's correct. So, pompejana,
Thiobacillus, Deinococcus.

9
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:54,100
Which of these three
would most likely survive

10
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,688
in the extreme environment of the
Jupiter moon Callisto, and why?

11
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:00,148
Tom, can you get the lights, please?

12
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,649
That's your lab report question
for this week,

13
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,569
and it's due in my box
by midnight on Friday.

14
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,112
That's all for today. Thank you.

15
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,119
So, are you coming
to the faculty conference tonight?

16
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,579
To listen to Dean Stoff lecture

17
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:17,080
about how the universe
is like a beautiful woman?

18
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,502
- Think I'll pass.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

19
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:24,588
- Uh-uh.
- I could pick you up.

20
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:27,884
Um...

21
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:32,805
Can't. I have to get back
to my own extreme environment.

22
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:33,932
But thank you.

23
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:35,849
- See you tomorrow.
- Yep.

24
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,862
Come on. Go.

25
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:50,239
Jacob?
- Go, go!

26
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,994
Come on, come on.

27
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:57,079
- Yes!
- Jacob, dinner.

28
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:06,798
- You finished your homework?
- Yes. You just killed me.

29
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:09,133
Good. Now that you're dead,
you can shut that off

30
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,844
and come down for dinner.

31
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,262
Did you order pepperoni tonight?

32
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:14,514
- No. Are these clean?
- Yeah.

33
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:15,974
We've had pizza twice this week,

34
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:19,727
so I made you a proper meal tonight,
with vegetables.

35
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,855
Vegetables? Ew.

36
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,022
Stop being such a stepmom.

37
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:28,068
Where'd you get this?

38
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,363
It was Dad's.

39
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:34,157
Yeah, I know. Where was it?

40
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,245
I found it in the downstairs bathroom.
It's mine now.

41
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,332
Okay.

42
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:46,171
Okay. Come on,
I said please shut that off.

43
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:48,047
- You didn't say "please."
- Jacob.

44
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,548
Helen.

45
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,516
- Hello?
- Helen Benson?

46
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,977
- Yes.
- Dr. Helen Benson?

47
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:04,439
- You're at 106 Longwood Road?
- Who is this?

48
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,357
Someone should be there shortly.

49
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:09,652
What do you mean,
someone's coming here? Who is this?

50
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:12,863
Everything will be
explained to you en route.

51
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:15,199
En route where?

52
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:19,287
- Hello?
- They should be there soon.

53
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:20,787
Yes, they're at your door now.

54
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,584
Hold on a minute.

55
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:33,510
Dr. Benson, if you'll come with us...

56
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,261
- What's happening?
- Everything will be explained,

57
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:37,931
but you must come with us right away.

58
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:41,142
- Am I under arrest?
- You're in Federal custody.

59
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,977
Why?

60
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:45,939
- What is this about?
- Everything will be explained en route.

61
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:47,065
I have a child here.

62
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:49,526
Is there anyone
who can look after the boy?

63
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:51,152
- No.
- Can his father take care of him?

64
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:52,612
No, his father isn't here.

65
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,448
- I can take care of myself.
- Jacob, you can't take care of yourself.

66
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:57,617
- There's just no way...
- You're coming with us, Dr. Benson.

67
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:58,951
Helen?

68
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,126
Jacob, grab your coat.
You're gonna stay at Isabel's.

69
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:13,048
Attention, Bravo,
prepare to move out.

70
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:15,927
It's going to be okay.

71
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:18,554
Dr. Benson, there isn't much time.

72
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,934
Okay, we've got her. Let's go.

73
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:46,291
Two stoplights down, then left,
there's an on-ramp to the highway.

74
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,293
- Do you see it?
- This must be a mistake.

75
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:51,838
Helen Benson,
Social Security number 51-48-7843?

76
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:53,006
- Yeah.
- There's no mistake.

77
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:55,592
- What is this about?
- Everything will be explained.

78
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:56,718
Stop the car.

79
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:58,553
- Can you stop the car, please?
- Ma'am.

80
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:00,597
I'm not under arrest. You can't do this.

81
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:03,308
- This is a matter of national security.
- National security?

82
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:05,018
Well, that just means
whatever you want it to mean.

83
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:08,188
I'm just asking you to tell me
why I'm needed, or to let me go.

84
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:10,940
Ma'am, I can't tell you
why you're needed because I don't know.

85
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,483
But I know they need you,
and I know it's urgent.

86
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,443
How do you know that?

87
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,451
Where are all the cars?

88
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,662
- They shut down the highway.
- They shut it down?

89
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:26,497
- For what?
- For us.

90
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:15,963
- Hi. I'm Yusef.
- Helen.

91
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:19,425
Helen, do you have any idea
why this is happening to us?

92
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,219
- No.
- Well, think.

93
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:22,846
What do we have in common?

94
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,139
- What do you do for a living, Yusef?
- I'm a nuclear physicist.

95
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,724
- I'm an astronomer.
- A geologist.

96
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:29,185
- I'm an astrobiologist.
- Fossil record study?

97
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:31,896
No, microbiology.
Theories of life beyond Earth.

98
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:35,817
- All right, so we're all scientists.
- No, not me. I'm a civil engineer.

99
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,360
Put it all together. What do you get?

100
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,363
I've participated in government
mobilizations like this before.

101
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,115
War games and preparations
for certain scenarios...

102
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,325
- Is that what you think this is?
- No.

103
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:46,785
Whatever it is, it's not a game.

104
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:25,074
Your attention, please!

105
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:28,620
Make your way directly across
the courtyard to the main barracks.

106
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,539
Leave all your cell phones
and cameras here.

107
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:35,585
I repeat, cell phones
and cameras are not allowed inside.

108
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:37,712
Leave any cell phones and cameras here.

109
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:39,171
Helen!

110
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:41,883
Can we bring her up?

111
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:43,426
you need to give up
your cell phones...

112
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,886
Your attention, please...
- Thank you.

113
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:48,097
...make your way directly across
the courtyard to the main barracks...

114
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:49,349
- Helen.
- Hi, Michael.

115
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,975
- Been a long time.
- Are you behind all this?

116
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:52,894
Yes. I'm glad you came.

117
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:55,772
- It's not like I had a choice.
- Sorry about that.

118
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:57,440
I had you put on the "vital" list.

119
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,192
I thought it was important
to have you part of this team.

120
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,360
Why?

121
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,363
I've been keeping up with the work you've
been doing with Professor Barnhardt.

122
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,156
What does it have to do with this?

123
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,907
I'll have to crash-brief you
in the conference room.

124
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:17,293
Object 07/493 was first spotted
just beyond Jupiter's orbit

125
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,337
by the Spaceguard program.

126
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:23,716
It was notable for the fact that it was
not moving in an asteroidal ellipse,

127
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,177
but rather, it had a hyperbolic orbit

128
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:29,848
and was shooting
through our solar system.

129
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:32,183
The object was moving at speeds

130
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:35,895
of up to three times 10-to-the-seventh
meters per second.

131
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:40,859
At first, it was projected to pass
millions of miles outside of Earth's orbit.

132
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:43,319
However, we soon discovered
that the object

133
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:47,323
was not following
a gravitationally freefall trajectory.

134
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:51,869
As such, its path was recalculated.

135
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:00,378
It was at this time
a crisis response team was activated

136
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,671
and everything you see around you
was set in motion.

137
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:09,429
Can we launch a missile to intercept it?

138
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:13,141
The military is attempting to do just that.
In fact, they may launch
several.

139
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:16,019
But, given the speed
at which this object is moving,

140
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,647
our chances of success are slim, at best.

141
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,524
Why don't they evacuate the area?

142
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:23,276
We simply do not have enough time.

143
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:27,113
The affected area contains
some 8 million inhabitants.

144
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:30,783
The best we can do
is to plan for the aftermath.

145
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:32,743
How long do we have?

146
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:38,332
Seventy-eight minutes.

147
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:45,214
Hey.
What did the cops want, anyway?

148
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:53,056
Well, there's going to be
a big storm tonight,

149
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:56,642
and they needed some scientists
to help out, you know,

150
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,271
with planning stuff. So...

151
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,736
Pretty soon you're all gonna
go down to the basement, okay?

152
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:08,071
I already told Isabel.

153
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:09,822
I haven't seen anything on TVabout...

154
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:11,490
Jacob, just...

155
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:15,411
Just do it. All right?

156
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:17,413
All right. I should go.

157
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:21,750
Wait... Can we talk just a little bit longer?

158
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:25,462
We're having dinner now.
I really should go.

159
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:29,384
You know I love you very much.

160
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:31,301
Okay. Bye, Helen.

161
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:42,104
Is that a cell phone?

162
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:46,733
Can I borrow it?

163
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,580
What are the odds of an asteroid
making impact in Manhattan?

164
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,790
Astronomical.
Plus, there's no light signature.

165
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,083
Then it can't be an asteroid.

166
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,794
- A primordial black hole, perhaps.
- Do you know what that would mean?

167
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:07,130
Look, whatever it is,
if this object is moving

168
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,549
at three times 10-to-the-seventh
meters per second,

169
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:11,676
there will be no aftermath.

170
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:16,681
If they can't stop it before it hits,
there will be nothing left but
dust.

171
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:21,019
It will sterilize the Earth.
This is all theater.

172
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,687
They're saying we lost launch capability.

173
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:25,106
What? How?
- What does that mean?

174
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:27,692
- The missile's disabled.
- Disabled by what?

175
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:30,236
- They don't know.
- But they can restore it, right?

176
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:33,280
There's a fallback. They have to launch.

177
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,915
Object impact in seven, six...

178
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,042
"Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

179
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,377
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven...

180
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:49,296
...three, two, one...
- "...Give us this day..."

181
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,099
- Where is it?
- Could they have made a mistake?

182
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,685
Wait! Roger that.

183
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:04,938
They're saying
the object's still in its approach.

184
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:07,273
Well, then, where is it?
- It's slowing down.

185
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:08,816
Awesome.
- Slowing down?

186
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:10,275
I see it.

187
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:23,451
Radiation levels are slightly elevated,
but it's not dangerous.

188
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:26,287
I'm getting a lot of
electrostatic interference.

189
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:27,913
Yeah, me too.

190
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,543
Did you feel that?

191
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:35,212
Feel what?

192
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:39,424
I feel it.

193
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,306
It's close.

194
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,876
Checkmate 0-6,
who has tactical command here?

195
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:58,170
This is 2917. I need to know
who has jurisdiction on this site.

196
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,970
Checkmate 0-3,
this is Gator 2-3. We're blind here.

197
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,097
Checkmate 0-6,
do you copy? Over.

198
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:55,812
What the hell is that thing?

199
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:57,981
I need the rules of engagement now.

200
00:21:57,981 --> 00:21:59,858
Target is advancing.

201
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:03,193
Target is advancing.
Repeat, target is advancing.

202
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:10,868
Sniper team is in place.

203
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:14,913
Sniper team leaders, come back. I repeat...

204
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,920
Do not fire!
- It's coming right at us!

205
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,672
It's coming out!

206
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:25,215
Hold your fire!
- Do we engage?

207
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:28,093
Hold your fire!
- Fire!

208
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:34,309
- Cease fire!
- All stations, cease fire!

209
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:36,852
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Do not shoot!

210
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,070
We need a medic!

211
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:42,084
Klaatu barada nikto!

212
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:16,161
We need that DNA swab. DNA swab now!

213
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:19,080
- It's soaking through.
- Where's the O2? Stat.

214
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,123
Get me the O2, stat.

215
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,209
Go. No one else!

216
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,308
What am I supposed to do now?
Do I start an IV?

217
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:41,519
No, no. We don't know its physiology.
For all we know, the fluids may kill it.

218
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,104
What do I do, then?
What do I do?

219
00:24:43,104 --> 00:24:44,856
Its blood is red.
It must have hemoglobin.

220
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:48,026
- Okay, she's right. Start the drip.
- Okay. I... I can't find a vein.

221
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:50,945
- It doesn't have any veins!
- Look for a central line site, then.

222
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:52,280
Going into cardiac arrest!
Do I defib?

223
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,199
- Yeah, get in there now. Go! Go!
- Clear!

224
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:01,748
- The monitor just shorted out!
- Heart rate is stabilizing! It's stabilizing.

225
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:03,916
What now? What now?

226
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:08,712
Do you have a surgeon?

227
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:14,718
Normally, for a gunshot,
we'd be using a general anesthetic.

228
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:19,223
But, as we don't know
how the patient will react,

229
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,436
I have opted for a local.

230
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:29,650
I'm making the first incision now.

231
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:37,574
No explosions. So far, so good.

232
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,536
Pale flesh,

233
00:25:41,704 --> 00:25:44,456
a texture something akin to...

234
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,585
What?

235
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:49,504
Whale blubber.

236
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:51,380
I'm taking a specimen now.

237
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,220
Pack that on ice and chopper it
to a genomics lab for DNA mapping.

238
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,305
I'd like a sample of that as well.

239
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:02,975
I am entering the wound, and...

240
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:06,854
My God.

241
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:10,608
What is this?

242
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:13,486
I'm sorry. I'm a little taken aback.

243
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:16,155
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

244
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:18,950
That's the thing. It's all so familiar.

245
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,912
The outer layer of the flesh is exotic,
it's strange,

246
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:27,416
but as I go deeper,
there's muscle, vein, nerve, bone.

247
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:31,628
I'm extracting the bullet.

248
00:26:38,928 --> 00:26:44,559
This gray flesh,
it seems to be just falling away.

249
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,020
It's... It's removing itself.

250
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:52,941
I think I need to keep extracting it.

251
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,527
Yes. Continue.

252
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:59,531
Can you explain any of this?

253
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:56,255
It's dreaming.

254
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,551
Any signs of neural activity?

255
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:02,469
It lit up the fMRI like Times Square.

256
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,600
Get help.

257
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:12,646
Code white! Subject is conscious!

258
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:15,774
Help!

259
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:26,118
It's looking at you.
Try saying something to it.

260
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:28,579
My name is Dr. Helen Benson.

261
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:32,208
We're trying to help you.

262
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,711
You have nothing to fear from us.

263
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:36,211
Help you.

264
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:38,922
Nothing to fear.

265
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,553
Global markets are
panicked in early trading this morning

266
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:45,763
in response to the crisis in Central Park.

267
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:48,349
Trading has been halted
on the New York Stock Exchange,

268
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:52,228
the Nikkei and Hang Seng, as Manhattan
prepares for a massive evacuation.

269
00:28:52,228 --> 00:28:53,855
In other cities around the world,

270
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:57,108
people are voluntarily evacuating
population centers,

271
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:59,152
fearing that the sphere in Central Park

272
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:01,571
may be the vanguard
of an impending alien invasion.

273
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:05,283
The President and Vice President have
been taken to separate, secure
locations.

274
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:08,161
Until this situation
has some kind of resolve,

275
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:11,331
I am the eyes and the ears
of the Presidency.

276
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:13,124
So, what do we know?

277
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:15,126
Madam Secretary, we lost contact

278
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:18,004
with one of our DSCS-3
listening satellites orbiting Earth.

279
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:19,172
What is that image?

280
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,424
Are you saying that sphere
in Central Park isn't the only one?

281
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:23,426
In fact, we have intelligence
that smaller spheres

282
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,720
have landed at other locations
around the world.

283
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,305
Do we have briefings on that?
And, General,

284
00:29:27,305 --> 00:29:29,599
where exactly
are these spheres right now?

285
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,810
I think we're asking the wrong questions.

286
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,854
What questions should we be asking?

287
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:37,273
Well, let's start with this.
Where is our satellite?

288
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:38,858
We lost contact with it.

289
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:40,818
In the scheme of things,
the loss of one satellite

290
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:43,029
- isn't necessarily our concern.
- DSCS-3

291
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:45,949
stands for "Defense Systems
Communication Satellite."

292
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:47,951
Remember what it communicates with?

293
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,037
They were able to access our
defense mainframe via that satellite.

294
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:53,414
That's how they temporarily shut down
our missile defenses

295
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:54,582
and entered our airspace.

296
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:57,377
We've changed all the codes.
- And on top of that,

297
00:29:57,377 --> 00:30:00,922
there is a vast amount
of vital intelligence on that mainframe.

298
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:03,299
They know everything about us now.

299
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,177
- And we know nothing about them.
- Almost nothing.

300
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:08,137
The fact that they chose
to disable our defenses

301
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:10,597
tells us something about their intentions.

302
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:17,438
Madam Secretary,
we brought in several specialists

303
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:19,774
to analyze the tissue samples
we harvested from the being.

304
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:22,694
This is our chief geneticist,
Dr. Hideo Ikegawa.

305
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:24,904
This is our chief astrobiologist,
Dr. Helen Benson.

306
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:26,613
- Hello.
- Doctor?

307
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:29,701
The being is in a nascent state.

308
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:34,080
The DNA samples we've taken seem
to represent three distinct life forms.

309
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,877
- Three different DNA types?
- Yes, including the being's brain.

310
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:42,505
The body tissue is human,
as far as we can tell.

311
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:43,882
The gray flesh encasing it

312
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:48,178
is organic material,
some kind of bioengineered spacesuit.

313
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:51,514
What it resembles, oddly enough,
is placental tissue.

314
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:54,851
Which makes sense, given the placenta's
a life-support system.

315
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,187
And that, basically,
in order to survive in our environment,

316
00:30:57,187 --> 00:31:00,982
the being had to be born here,
in its human form.

317
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:02,400
They must have come here in the past

318
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,737
and obtained a DNA sample
from a human subject.

319
00:31:05,737 --> 00:31:09,698
Now, since that birth,
the being has grown exponentially.

320
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:12,868
This is one hour after surgery.

321
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:15,204
Three hours.

322
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:18,374
Six hours.

323
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:21,753
How much can you tell us about it
by decoding its DNA?

324
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:25,131
You don't understand.
These are the Dead Sea Scrolls.

325
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:27,717
Geneticists are gonna be
studying this code for generations.

326
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:28,885
No, they aren't.

327
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:31,095
This code is the property
of the US government.

328
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:34,224
Its very existence is classified.

329
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:35,349
I want to see it.

330
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:48,612
Water.

331
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:50,615
Bring him up.

332
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:54,744
Does it actually speak our language?
Or does it just parrot what it's heard?

333
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:57,997
No, it seems to already
understand our language.

334
00:31:57,997 --> 00:32:00,458
They've compromised our satellites.
They know everything about us.

335
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,042
Mr. Driscoll.

336
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,864
My name is Regina Jackson.

337
00:32:30,864 --> 00:32:34,950
I'm the Secretary of Defense
of the United States of America.

338
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:39,538
This body will take some getting used to.

339
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:48,673
I've been sent here to determine
who or what you represent,

340
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:51,049
and what your intentions are.

341
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,303
It feels unreal to me.

342
00:32:57,473 --> 00:32:58,932
Alien.

343
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:04,438
It will take time to adapt.

344
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:08,275
What were you before you were human?

345
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,532
Different.

346
00:33:14,532 --> 00:33:16,158
Different how?

347
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:19,328
It would only frighten you.

348
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,123
Do you have a name?

349
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,667
Klaatu.

350
00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:30,881
Do you represent a civilization?

351
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:36,429
I represent a group of civilizations.

352
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:39,057
Where is this group of civilizations?

353
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:41,184
All around you.

354
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:43,645
What is your purpose in coming here?

355
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:47,524
There is a gathering of world leaders
not far from here.

356
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,151
I will explain my purpose to them.

357
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:52,904
I'm afraid that's not possible.

358
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:56,032
Perhaps you should explain yourself
to me instead.

359
00:33:56,032 --> 00:33:59,035
Do you speak for the entire human race?

360
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:02,371
I speak for
the President of the United States.

361
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:08,961
Now, please, tell me,
why have you come to our planet?

362
00:34:11,714 --> 00:34:13,424
Your planet?

363
00:34:13,424 --> 00:34:15,884
Yes. This is our planet.

364
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,430
No. It is not.

365
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:25,562
We've decided to sedate him
and move him to a more secure location.

366
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:28,189
- Are you going to interrogate him?
- That's a possibility.

367
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:31,568
Madam Secretary, as scientists,
we can't consent to this.

368
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:34,112
He says he wants to speak to the UN.

369
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,030
History has lessons to teach us

370
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,200
about first encounters
between civilizations.

371
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,621
As a rule, the less advanced civilization
is either exterminated or enslaved.

372
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:48,459
I'm thinking of Pizarro and the Incas,
Columbus and the Native Americans...

373
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,336
The list goes on.

374
00:34:50,336 --> 00:34:54,716
Unfortunately, in this case,
the less advanced civilization is us.

375
00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:58,386
This is a representative
of an extraterrestrial civilization.

376
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:01,639
This is the most important discovery
in the history of mankind.

377
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,976
It may well be the last discovery
in the history of mankind.

378
00:35:04,976 --> 00:35:07,979
We need to know what they're planning,
and we need to know now.

379
00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:11,441
So you want to drug him?
Interrogate him?

380
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:13,985
I'm sorry, we won't do that.
Do you understand?

381
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:16,279
I understand completely.

382
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:18,990
Of course, if you won't do it,
we'll have to call in someone who will.

383
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,201
Well, I'm sure
you can find someone who will...

384
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:22,743
I'll do it.

385
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,164
Helen.

386
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:27,623
I'll do it.

387
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,401
That won't be necessary, Doctor.

388
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:58,487
We've already prepared
the solution for you.

389
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:02,366
I just need a syringe.

390
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:17,172
I want to apologize to you.
It seems we got off to a bad start.

391
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:19,968
It seems we did.

392
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:22,345
We're going to transport you
to a different facility

393
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:25,430
- for better medical care.
- No, you are not.

394
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:28,475
- Excuse me?
- I am leaving.

395
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,937
I can't allow you to do that.

396
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:34,816
- It is not up to you.
- This is a military installation.

397
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:37,318
You're surrounded by hundreds of soldiers.

398
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:38,820
There's no leaving here.

399
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,446
I have done nothing wrong.

400
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:42,991
You invaded our airspace.

401
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:46,161
That automaton
that emerged from the sphere,

402
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,620
it attacked our troops.

403
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,622
It acted to defend me.

404
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:52,250
It activates in the presence of violence.

405
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,126
Dr. Benson? Please.

406
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:17,399
Run.

407
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:21,612
It's done.

408
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:25,949
If you'll come with us, ma'am...

409
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:50,307
Keep moving, please.

410
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:43,610
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

411
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:51,034
Are you currently in a seated position?

412
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:54,706
Yes.

413
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:56,248
Are you human?

414
00:38:58,084 --> 00:38:59,585
My body is.

415
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:03,005
Do you feel pain?

416
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:05,757
My body does.

417
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:13,557
Are you aware of an impending attack

418
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,518
on the planet Earth?

419
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,065
You should let me go.

420
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,616
I'll repeat the question.

421
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:59,812
What gate did you use to enter this base?

422
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:01,272
East loading door.

423
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:03,483
How do I get there?

424
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:06,653
One hundred yards left
from the back of this building.

425
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:08,821
Is there a security code?

426
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:13,033
Four-four-Bravo-three-zero.

427
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:16,246
What size is that suit?

428
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,039
Forty-two long.

429
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,498
Take it off.

430
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:00,874
Attention!
All security personnel

431
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:02,834
report to your designated posts.

432
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:06,587
All civilian personnel
report to Operations immediately.

433
00:41:16,514 --> 00:41:19,266
- I'm leaving you now.
- No.

434
00:41:47,629 --> 00:41:49,506
Put every arm of the government,

435
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:53,593
military, law enforcement,
Federal, state and local, on high alert.

436
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:56,221
- If the media gets word that we lost...
- Use a cover story.

437
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:57,931
We can't risk a panic.

438
00:41:57,931 --> 00:41:59,641
Call him an escaped convict.

439
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:03,061
Use every surveillance satellite,
every drone aircraft,

440
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:06,313
every freeway camera.
Use every resource we've got.

441
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:15,824
Attention:
All scheduled trains

442
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,993
into and out of Penn Station Manhattan

443
00:42:18,993 --> 00:42:21,663
are canceled due to
the ongoing evacuation

444
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:24,331
and the security perimeter in Central Park.

445
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:31,923
We ask that our passengers
remain calm and orderly

446
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:33,967
during these difficult circumstances.

447
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:38,012
Any disturbance will be subject
to immediate arrest by Transit police.

448
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:40,013
Excuse me. Excuse me.

449
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:47,272
We are committed
to providing you quality service.

450
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:48,897
Thank you.

451
00:42:55,113 --> 00:42:57,740
We ask that our
passengers remain calm and orderly

452
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,617
during these difficult circumstances.

453
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:10,336
Any disturbance will be subject
to immediate arrest by Transit police.

454
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:13,882
You're not getting the ticket.
All right, back off!

455
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,926
- Don't push me. I want the ticket.
- Look, I don't...

456
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:20,096
- Now just give me the ticket!
- I'm not giving you anything!

457
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:23,098
Give me the...
What's the matter with you?

458
00:43:39,032 --> 00:43:42,076
Rising global unrest
is causing leaders around the world

459
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:45,622
to criticize the US response
to the arrival of the spheres.

460
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:47,957
Reactions from both
national and international

461
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:49,792
religious communities have been varied.

462
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:52,420
While some have responded
with hope and measured optimism,

463
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,257
most religious communities have
considered recent events as apocalyptic.

464
00:43:56,257 --> 00:43:59,427
At gatherings and prayer vigils
in virtually every major city,

465
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:02,180
many see the arrival
of the Central Park sphere

466
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,390
as a sign of a new era,
or perhaps even the end of the world.

467
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,896
The rapture, the tribulation
and the impending battle of Armageddon

468
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:12,397
dominate much of the discussion.

469
00:44:27,622 --> 00:44:30,291
Leaders around the world
are protesting the US's decision

470
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:34,254
to deny foreign scientists
full access to the being.

471
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,130
Have you done your homework?

472
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,842
School's canceled on account of the aliens.

473
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,553
- They say it's an invasion.
- Well, they're wrong.

474
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,054
- What makes you so sure?
- I just know.

475
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:46,766
Don't get that!

476
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:48,685
- Jacob!
- Hello?

477
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:51,396
May I speak
to Dr. Helen Benson, please?

478
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:52,938
It's for you.

479
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,236
- Hello?
- Dr. Helen Benson?

480
00:44:58,236 --> 00:45:00,989
- Yes.
- I'm calling from Newark Penn Station.

481
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,533
We've got your patient here.

482
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,076
Oh, um...

483
00:45:05,076 --> 00:45:09,622
Sorry, I think there's been a mistake.
I'm not that kind of a doctor.

484
00:45:09,622 --> 00:45:11,832
Hold... Hold on a second.

485
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:14,501
He says you got his medicine.

486
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:18,756
I'll be right there.

487
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:20,883
and stressed
the need for calm and understanding...

488
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:30,059
Sorry. Excuse me?

489
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:33,313
Excuse me! I'm sorry, someone
called me. My name's Dr. Benson.

490
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,440
Okay, he's over there.
He's your problem now.

491
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,317
Go ahead, take him. He's your problem.

492
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:54,584
Evacuation registration point
is located two blocks this way.

493
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:58,630
You know, I took a huge risk
back at the hospital.

494
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,631
Did I make a mistake?

495
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:03,885
Are you a friend to us?

496
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:06,094
I'm a friend to the Earth.

497
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,559
Let's keep it steady, folks.
Let's keep going forward.

498
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,610
Hello.

499
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,362
Hi.

500
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,862
Okay.

501
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,032
- Now what?
- Drive.

502
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,343
Look in your pocket.

503
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,181
Your inside pocket.

504
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,214
Turn left.

505
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,150
Striker 2829,
descend and maintain 2,000

506
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,486
to established vectors to the target area.

507
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,945
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

508
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,074
All right, everybody, we got our mission!

509
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:53,203
All right, target acquired and
confirmed, sir. We are locked on.

510
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,122
Madam Secretary,
they're sending in the drones.

511
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:58,333
Bring in the Reapers! We have go!

512
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:02,377
- Roger that! Descending to 1,200.
- Let's light this thing up.

513
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:14,264
Arm your Sidewinder missiles!

514
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,477
Roger that, Colonel.
Sidewinder missiles armed.

515
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,155
- He's activating!
- Fire! Fire, fire!

516
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,956
- Missiles intercepted!
- Get out of there!

517
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,874
Withdraw and realign
for another sortie!

518
00:48:39,874 --> 00:48:43,168
Negative! I've lost link! I've lost control!

519
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,507
Who's in control of the aircraft, then?

520
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:53,762
Striker 28 headed for orb perimeter!
I am out of control!

521
00:49:03,481 --> 00:49:05,315
Anyone got any other ideas?

522
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,822
Why are people running?
We should stay and fight.

523
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:15,368
They didn't come here to hurt us.

524
00:49:15,368 --> 00:49:18,955
Well, we should kill them anyway,
just to make sure.

525
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:22,709
Don't say that.
- That's what Dad would have done.

526
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,295
I think he would have looked
for a different way.

527
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,755
He would have fought.

528
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:32,634
- I like to think I knew him pretty well.
- I knew him, too. Longer than you.

529
00:49:33,636 --> 00:49:35,430
What do you think?

530
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,890
Of what?

531
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,435
Should people run,
or should we stay and fight?

532
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,145
- Neither.
- What should we do, then?

533
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,148
There's nothing you can do.

534
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,277
This is it. Pull in here.

535
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,997
McDonald's?

536
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:07,629
Where are you going?
Jacob, where are you going?

537
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,379
To the bathroom!

538
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:15,594
Where is the boy's father?

539
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:19,014
He's dead.

540
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,768
How did he die?

541
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,727
He was in the Army.

542
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:29,901
So the boy wishes his soldier father were
here to rescue the world from the aliens.

543
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,987
The boy wishes his father were here
for a lot of reasons,

544
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:35,447
aliens being the least of them.

545
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,872
He wasn't even that kind of a soldier.
He was an engineer.

546
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:47,335
He went over there to build, not to fight.

547
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,169
And his mother?

548
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,006
She died when he was a baby.

549
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:58,762
I married his father.
A year ago, he was killed.

550
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,643
Why did you come here?

551
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,230
I came to save the Earth.

552
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,899
From what?

553
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,068
He's here.

554
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,250
Your tea, Grandfather.

555
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,042
Thank you.

556
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:42,557
Are you one of them?

557
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,057
One of who?

558
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,644
Never mind. Sorry.

559
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:51,398
You've been out of
contact for a long time.

560
00:51:52,525 --> 00:51:53,942
I had a dangerous assignment.

561
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,945
This is hostile territory.

562
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,781
I've noticed.

563
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:02,075
I was hoping I could reason with them.

564
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,245
I'm afraid they are not a reasonable race.

565
00:52:06,664 --> 00:52:10,752
I've been living amongst them
for seventy years now.

566
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,377
I know them well.

567
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,755
And?

568
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:18,133
Any attempt to intercede with
them would be futile.

569
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,844
They are destructive,

570
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:23,680
and they won't change.

571
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:28,853
Is that your official report?

572
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:33,941
The tragedy is, they know
what's going to become of them.

573
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,778
They sense it.

574
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,240
But they can't seem
to do anything about it.

575
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:49,414
It's decided then.

576
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,293
I'll begin the process as soon as possible.

577
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,630
We should make preparations
for our departure.

578
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,757
I'm staying.

579
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:01,928
You can't stay here.

580
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,012
I can, and I will.

581
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,224
- If you stay, you'll die.
- I know.

582
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,228
This is my home now.

583
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:16,192
You yourself called them
a destructive race.

584
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,734
That's true.

585
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,446
But, still, there is another side.

586
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,201
You see, I... I love them.

587
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,123
This is a very strange thing.

588
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,379
I can't find a way to explain it to you. I...

589
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:40,799
For many years, I...
I cursed my luck for being sent here.

590
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,386
Human life is difficult.

591
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,057
But as this life is coming to an end,

592
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:54,438
I consider myself lucky to have lived it.

593
00:53:59,944 --> 00:54:05,074
No sudden movements. No aggressive
actions. No matter what happens,

594
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:06,493
no gunfire.

595
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,370
Track is in place, sir.
Containment panels are in position.

596
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:12,498
- We're ready on your order.
- On my command,

597
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,543
move the panels into place.

598
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,295
- Three, two...
- Three, two...

599
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:19,964
...one.

600
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:23,008
Synchronize established,
ISI ready to copy.

601
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:37,189
Containment panels
are secure, and we're still here.

602
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,450
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

603
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,077
The escaped convict
they showed on the news,

604
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,830
- I just saw the guy at the gas station.
- Can you describe him?

605
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,540
He was in a little car,
on the south block...

606
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,166
9- 1-1, what is your emergency?

607
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,085
I just saw that wanted man
over by the McDonald's.

608
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,419
Can you
describe the car, sir?

609
00:54:58,419 --> 00:54:59,921
Silver four-door,
with a woman and a kid.

610
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,799
I need 3 units to look
for a silver Honda near Ochada orchards.

611
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,426
3-1 responding.
We are patrolling the orchards off I-67.

612
00:55:05,426 --> 00:55:07,177
HP-28, follow up.

613
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,723
This is it. Stop here.

614
00:55:13,434 --> 00:55:15,310
You shouldn't...

615
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,278
Uh, Helen? Who is this guy?

616
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,821
A friend.
- What kind of friend?

617
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,826
Scootch over. He's a work friend.

618
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,705
What's his name?

619
00:55:35,456 --> 00:55:37,417
- Klaatu.
- Klaatu?

620
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,002
- Yeah.
- What kind of name is that?

621
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,713
It's foreign, I think.

622
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:49,012
- I never heard you talk about him before.
- I haven't known him for
very long.

623
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,514
We're just giving him a ride.

624
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,973
Where?

625
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,478
- Here.
- The forest?

626
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,735
Stay here.

627
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:08,031
I want you to lock the door, okay?
And don't open it for anyone but me.

628
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,656
I'm serious.

629
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,775
Helen, what's going on?

630
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,117
We're getting images of these spheres
from all over the world.

631
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,078
Okavango, Kobe, Baku...

632
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,913
Which of our agencies gathered this intel?

633
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:05,749
Ma'am, none of them.
We pulled these off the Internet.

634
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,423
Is that them?

635
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,636
No. It's us.

636
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,391
Those are ordinary cephalopods.

637
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,100
Squid. Octopus.

638
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:31,817
I don't like him. He's weird, and...
Why are we driving him around, anyway?

639
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,777
Um...

640
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,616
It's complicated.

641
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,618
Is he coming home with us?

642
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,662
No. No.

643
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:47,208
Well, what if you decide you like him
and he wants to move in?

644
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,502
No, it's not like that. God, no.

645
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,129
Listen to me.

646
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,506
No one is moving in.
You don't understand.

647
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,259
Whatever. You wait for him.
I'm going home.

648
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,759
Jacob.

649
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,224
Jacob!

650
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,561
Jacob!

651
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:11,148
What is the matter with you?

652
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,685
These spheres
now appear to be leaving

653
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,437
in the same mysterious manner
as they came.

654
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,356
Hopefully this mass exodus
will bring an end

655
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,025
to the panic and unrest
we've been seeing around the world.

656
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,236
The only sphere
that doesn't appear to be leaving

657
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:59,489
is the giant sphere in Central Park.

658
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,949
You think we scared them off?

659
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,535
They're not afraid of us.

660
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,092
I need to get back to the city.

661
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,886
Not till you tell me what's going on.

662
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:25,181
- Did you do that?
- Yes.

663
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,684
Jacob, get in the car.

664
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,727
- He's one of them.
- Please get in the car.

665
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,064
Get in the car.

666
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,496
I need to know what's happening.

667
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,957
This planet is dying.

668
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,084
The human race is killing it.

669
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,586
So you've come here to help us.

670
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,213
No, I didn't.

671
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,886
You said you came to save us.

672
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,430
I said I came to save the Earth.

673
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,681
You came to save the Earth

674
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,476
from us.

675
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,898
You came to save the Earth from us.

676
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:19,694
We can't risk the survival of this planet
for the sake of one species.

677
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,572
- What are you saying?
- If the Earth dies, you die.

678
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,407
If you die, the Earth survives.

679
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,786
There are only a handful of planets
in the cosmos

680
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,914
that are capable
of supporting complex life.

681
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:34,083
- You can't do this.
- This one can't be allowed to perish.

682
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,378
We can change!
We could still turn things around!

683
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:40,089
We've watched, we've waited,
and hoped that you would change.

684
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,799
- Please.
- It's reached the tipping point.

685
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,176
- We have to act.
- Please!

686
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,552
We'll undo the damage you've done

687
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:47,222
and give the Earth a chance
to begin again.

688
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:51,726
Don't do this. Please.
We could change.

689
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,812
We can change.

690
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:58,524
The decision is made.
The process has begun.

691
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,819
Oh, God.

692
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,090
It won't make any difference, Helen.

693
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:26,802
Even if they arrest me, even if they kill me,
the process will continue.

694
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:31,224
Both of you, hands on the car right now!

695
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,976
- Is that a child in the car?
- Yes.

696
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:39,607
This is HP-28. I'm on I-67.
I have the FBI suspect in custody

697
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:43,528
along with one adult female
and one child. Awaiting instructions.

698
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,779
70140, roger.

699
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,323
Tell the child to get out of the car.

700
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:50,325
- Get the kid out of the car!
- Honey, come.

701
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,205
Okay, you two, over there.

702
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,834
You, I'm not going to tell you again.
Hands on the car.

703
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,044
- Please don't hurt him.
- I'm not going to hurt him,

704
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,088
- so long as he...
- I wasn't talking to you.

705
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,508
The pain will only last a moment.

706
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,234
You killed him!
You killed him! You killed him!

707
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,569
- Jacob. Jacob!
- Let me finish.

708
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:30,783
Shh. Shh.
- You killed him! You killed him!

709
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,410
- Come sit down.
- He killed him!

710
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,331
He'll be all right.

711
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,921
I don't understand.

712
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:30,510
You're going to kill us all,
but you saved him.

713
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,554
He was an obstacle. I meant him no harm.

714
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:39,769
You could stop this, couldn't you?
If you wanted to.

715
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,481
I tried to reason with you.
I tried to speak with your leaders.

716
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,984
Those aren't our leaders.

717
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:49,362
If you want to speak to one
of our leaders, I'll take you to one.

718
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,280
Let me take you.

719
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,287
Get in the car.

720
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,001
Maybe they were just
collecting specimens from our planet.

721
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:07,379
It's not our planet.
That's what he said to me in the hospital.

722
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:12,926
An ark.

723
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,180
- Excuse me?
- It's an ark.

724
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,725
So are all the other spheres.

725
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,227
They're saving as many species
as they can.

726
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,272
If the sphere is an ark,
then what comes next is...

727
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,149
The flood.

728
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,840
Karl, we're here.

729
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,514
All right, let's get you settled.

730
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:09,234
That's a Nobel Prize.

731
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,402
He won it for his work
on biological altruism.

732
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:18,075
Probably still be in his desk drawer
if I hadn't gotten it framed for him.

733
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,204
- You tired?
- Just a little.

734
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,292
Close, but no.

735
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:35,092
I wouldn't.

736
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,344
He won't mind.

737
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:46,688
He's one of them.
You shouldn't be helping him.

738
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,605
We should stop him.

739
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:57,364
For just this once,
I need you to trust me.

740
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,327
Is it possible?

741
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:01,428
I have so many questions to ask you.

742
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,611
It's Bach.

743
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,449
It's beautiful.

744
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,744
So we're not so different after all.

745
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,122
I wish that were true.

746
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:35,964
So is it a machine
or a living thing?

747
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:39,092
- It's both, or neither.
- What do you mean, neither?

748
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,636
It seems to be some sort
of silicon-based hybrid.

749
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:45,473
We're calling it GORT,
Genetically Organized Robotic Technology.

750
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,517
The military and their acronyms.

751
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,519
We've used every
diagnostic method available,

752
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:53,189
MRI, thermal imaging, PET scan,
but it was impervious.

753
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,692
So we attempted
a robotically-assisted exploration

754
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,485
- using a diamond drill.
- And?

755
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:01,280
The drill bit fractured. It'll take
24 hours to fix it robotically.

756
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:50,037
Colonel, we don't have 24 hours.
Send somebody in there to fix that drill.

757
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:54,417
Food and fuel hoarding
have led to shortages which erupted

758
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:57,337
into looting incidents throughout Asia
and South America. Many...

759
01:10:57,337 --> 01:10:59,005
... outbreaks of rioting and unrest

760
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,215
in such cities as Guangdong, China,

761
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:04,719
London, and Chicago due to the shortages
of such basic commodities as fuel,

762
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:10,475
food and drinking water. Many point to
the Central Park sphere as...

763
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:13,853
Amidst the chaos
in the New York-New Jersey areas,

764
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:16,439
local police are looking
for an escaped convict

765
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,775
whose name is not being released.

766
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:22,028
Authorities believe that he is
a significant threat to the public

767
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,782
and are asking for any information
that could lead to his capture.

768
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:29,786
If you have seen this man,
contact the number on your screen below.

769
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:30,995
There must be alternatives.

770
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:34,165
You must have some technology
that could solve our problem.

771
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,709
Your problem is not technology.

772
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:40,296
The problem is you.
You lack the will to change.

773
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,840
Then help us change.

774
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,842
I cannot change your nature.

775
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:46,177
You treat the world
as you treat each other.

776
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:50,890
But every civilization
reaches a crisis point eventually.

777
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,519
- Most of them don't make it.
- Yours did. How?

778
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:57,897
Our sun was dying.
We had to evolve in order to survive.

779
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:01,067
So it was only when your world
was threatened with destruction

780
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:04,070
- that you became what you are now.
- Yes.

781
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,239
Well, that's where we are.

782
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,325
You say we're on the brink
of destruction, and you're right.

783
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:14,080
But it's only on the brink
that people find the will to change.

784
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,124
Only at the precipice do we evolve.

785
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:20,503
This is our moment.

786
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,797
Don't take it from us.
We're close to an answer.

787
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:31,972
What's wrong?

788
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:54,161
Jacob! Can you get your boots on?

789
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:58,958
He can't get caught.
What do I do?

790
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,669
Change his mind.
Not with reason, but with yourself.

791
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,850
It's too late for that.

792
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:48,048
Jacob!

793
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,761
Down here! He's here!

794
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,347
- Down here! He's here!
- What are you doing?

795
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,225
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to help them!

796
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:59,269
- That's why I called them.
- What?

797
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:01,938
- I told them where we are!
- Jacob, you didn't!

798
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:06,109
- We shouldn't be helping him!
- Jacob, I'm trying to help us.

799
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,528
We should kill him!
That's what Dad would have done!

800
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:11,656
- You fight me on everything. Everything!
- If my dad were here...

801
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,074
But he isn't here! He's gone!

802
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:20,706
Jacob...

803
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:28,589
We've extracted the female.
Returning to base.

804
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:40,601
- Got a visual on the male.
- Yeah, I see him.

805
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:45,606
Yep, got him.
Target acquired. Permission to engage.

806
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:50,904
You are clear to engage.
You are go to take out the target.

807
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:52,362
Roger that.

808
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,446
Please don't hurt me.

809
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:44,706
Thanks.

810
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:54,258
I don't know where we are.

811
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:02,808
Can you help me get home?

812
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:11,024
This way.

813
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,904
- He's come to exterminate us, hasn't he?
- You can't stop him.

814
01:16:55,904 --> 01:16:58,823
The only chance we have
is if he changes his mind.

815
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,700
You have to let me talk to him!

816
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,410
What makes you think he'll listen to you?

817
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:05,955
I don't know that he will.
But I think he trusts me.

818
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,581
And I don't think he wants to do this.

819
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:09,876
We have the situation under control.

820
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:12,629
Madam Secretary, General Quinn
needs to see you in the briefing room.

821
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,588
He says it's urgent.

822
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:19,676
You're not in control.
You don't know what he's capable of!

823
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:25,557
But she didn't do anything wrong!
So they should let her go, right?

824
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:29,062
You are afraid
you're going to be left alone.

825
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,772
I already am alone.

826
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:35,234
Helen's just someone that was stuck with
me when my dad died. You know?

827
01:17:37,195 --> 01:17:41,156
Oh, I forgot. You're an alien.
You don't understand anything.

828
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,541
We're good to go.

829
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,052
Hold it.

830
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,182
Your sleeve.

831
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,226
Oh...

832
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,524
Let... Let me out!

833
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:15,817
- Open the airlock.
- No.

834
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:17,694
- Open the door!
- Then we have to flash.

835
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:20,446
- Our protocol...
- I decide what protocol is.

836
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:23,032
Open the door! Let me out!

837
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:26,411
- Reset the drill.
- Let me out! Open it!

838
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:28,371
I said, reset the drill.

839
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:31,832
Let me out! Let me out! Open the door!

840
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,209
Let me out!

841
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:44,303
Sir, the restraints!

842
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:41,151
Open the door! Open the door!

843
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,738
This facility has been sealed.

844
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:49,034
No one leaves.

845
01:20:06,136 --> 01:20:09,471
We've lost contact
with the flash chamber, sir.

846
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:23,902
Whiskey Task Force, engage!

847
01:20:47,177 --> 01:20:49,553
Were there any survivors?
- No.

848
01:20:50,305 --> 01:20:52,432
As you know, at 0524 hours,

849
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:54,893
our pilots launched a salvo
of Sidewinder air-to-air missiles

850
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:57,562
- into the heart of the mass.
- And?

851
01:20:57,562 --> 01:20:59,647
Every strike made it larger.

852
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:02,357
And this mass, where is it heading?

853
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:04,610
Everywhere.

854
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:59,415
- Dr. Benson.
- Madam Secretary, please.

855
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:04,211
I don't want to die here in this room
without seeing my son one more
time.

856
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:07,924
Do you really think you can persuade him?

857
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:10,509
I think you should let me try.

858
01:22:14,222 --> 01:22:15,974
Go on, then.

859
01:22:15,974 --> 01:22:19,769
But I make you no promises.
I still answer to the President.

860
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:23,480
- You're on your own.
- No, she's not. I'll go with you.

861
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:27,151
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

862
01:22:50,884 --> 01:22:52,718
It doesn't work.

863
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,310
Go ahead.

864
01:23:09,152 --> 01:23:11,111
It's me. Are you okay?

865
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,281
I'm fine.

866
01:23:15,617 --> 01:23:17,409
He's right here.

867
01:23:18,203 --> 01:23:20,370
She wants to talk to you.

868
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:23,165
Yes.

869
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:26,628
I need to get back to the city.

870
01:23:26,628 --> 01:23:28,754
- Yes.
- Tell her I know where we can meet her.

871
01:23:43,228 --> 01:23:45,813
I told Helen we should kill you.

872
01:23:46,898 --> 01:23:49,025
Yes, I heard that.

873
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:52,278
- I didn't mean it, though.
- You didn't?

874
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:54,154
Well, not anymore.

875
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,288
So what's gonna happen to us?

876
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,627
I was just wondering the same thing.

877
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:19,388
- End of the world!
- Good luck!

878
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:24,561
This is it! This is where
we're supposed to meet her!

879
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:26,019
Come on!

880
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:37,364
Hurry up! It's this way!

881
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:13,942
You can do this. Just like with the trooper.

882
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:18,448
There are some things I can't do.

883
01:25:18,448 --> 01:25:20,407
But you have powers.

884
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:24,828
I'm sorry.

885
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,540
Please.

886
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,211
Please!

887
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:38,050
Jacob, nothing ever truly dies.

888
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:42,054
The universe wastes nothing.
Everything is simply

889
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:44,181
transformed.

890
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:48,185
Just leave me alone.

891
01:26:32,188 --> 01:26:35,358
- It's not fair.
- No.

892
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:37,276
No, it isn't fair.

893
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:40,905
He left me alone.

894
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:43,949
Oh, baby, you're not alone.

895
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,244
And he didn't leave you.

896
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:52,082
I see him in you. All the time.

897
01:26:52,834 --> 01:26:54,752
All the time.

898
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:57,421
Sometimes it's hard for me to bear.

899
01:26:58,965 --> 01:27:00,632
You miss him, too?

900
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:03,635
So much.

901
01:27:08,516 --> 01:27:11,560
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

902
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:14,938
Okay.

903
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:46,428
It's all right. He's here to help.

904
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,434
There's another side to you.

905
01:27:56,731 --> 01:27:58,357
I feel it now.

906
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:16,834
Is that how it ends?

907
01:28:19,128 --> 01:28:20,337
Yes.

908
01:28:21,506 --> 01:28:23,340
You can't stop it?

909
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:26,009
I don't know.

910
01:28:31,057 --> 01:28:34,853
It would come at a price
to you and your way of life.

911
01:28:34,853 --> 01:28:37,938
But we can change. You know that now.

912
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:40,692
Please.

913
01:28:40,692 --> 01:28:43,152
Please, just give us a chance.

914
01:28:45,947 --> 01:28:47,740
I'll try.

915
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,908
I must get back to the city.

916
01:29:08,887 --> 01:29:12,431
Of course, Mr. President.
I understand the situation.

917
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,727
But with all due respect, sir,

918
01:29:15,727 --> 01:29:18,938
any further military action
will only make things worse.

919
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:22,483
I believe we may still be able
to open a dialog...

920
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:31,367
Yes, Mr. President. As you wish, sir.

921
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:32,826
Thank you.

922
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:02,690
Checkpoint.

923
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:05,234
We can't stop. There isn't time.

924
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:15,202
- Dive!
- Look out!

925
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,374
Lincoln-Bravo-1 to Lincoln-Bravo-2,

926
01:30:19,374 --> 01:30:21,709
a black SUV crashed our checkpoint
with the suspects.

927
01:30:21,709 --> 01:30:25,087
- En route to your position.
- Roger that, Bravo-1.

928
01:30:31,553 --> 01:30:34,722
Bravo-1, we've got orders
to let them through. Do you copy?

929
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:36,181
Roger that.

930
01:30:38,518 --> 01:30:40,270
They're slowing down.

931
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:42,938
- They're letting us through.
- Why?

932
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:00,873
Where is everybody?

933
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,334
They've cleared the area.

934
01:31:05,211 --> 01:31:06,421
Stop the car.

935
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:08,338
- What?
- Stop the car!

936
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,004
Jacob! Jacob!

937
01:31:48,004 --> 01:31:49,839
I'm okay.

938
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:51,340
Michael?

939
01:32:03,061 --> 01:32:05,521
We have to get to the sphere.

940
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,241
Helen!

941
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:35,342
We won't make it!

942
01:32:50,233 --> 01:32:52,651
I can't keep them out for long.

943
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:00,993
Mom.

944
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:11,171
What's happening to him?

945
01:33:11,171 --> 01:33:12,671
Jacob.

946
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,549
They're inside him.

947
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:19,094
He's dying.

948
01:33:20,388 --> 01:33:21,972
Help him.

949
01:33:28,396 --> 01:33:31,690
Help him. Please.

950
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:21,574
Your professor was right.

951
01:34:21,574 --> 01:34:23,367
At the precipice,

952
01:34:24,369 --> 01:34:25,869
we change.

953
01:37:42,525 --> 01:37:44,318
It's leaving.

954
01:37:50,575 --> 01:37:52,035
No.

955
01:37:52,035 --> 01:37:53,785
He's leaving.
