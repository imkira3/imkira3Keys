RIDDICK: You mean
the whispers?

325
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,567
What whispers?

326
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,613
Telling me to go for
the sweet spot just to
the left of the spine,

327
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,865
fourth lumbar down,

328
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,867
the abdominal aorta.

329
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,037
It's a metallic taste,
human blood.

330
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,121
Copperish.

331
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,499
If you cut it with
peppermint schnapps,
it goes away...

332
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,001
Do you want to
shock me with
the truth now?

All you people are
so scared of me.

that as a compliment.

But it ain't me you
gotta worry about now.

Show me your eyes,
Riddick.

337

You'd have to come
a lot closer for that.

Okay, I can do it.

get sent to a slam

you'll never see

You dig up a doctor

20 menthol Kools

I think he went off
on the guy,
buried him in the hills.

Now he's got you believing
there's something there.

01:38:21,353 --> 01:38:23,771
I am the captain
of this ship

1126
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:27,317
and I am not leaving
anyone on this rock with
those fucking things,

1127
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:28,818
even if it means...

(FRY GRUNTING)

1129
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,365
Get that thing
off my neck.

1130
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:35,533
Shut up!

1131
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:38,578
You'd die for them?

1132
01:38:38,662 --> 01:38:40,121
I would try for them.

1133
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:43,333
You didn't answer me.

1134
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:45,752
Yes, I would, Riddick.

1135
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:47,879
I would.

1136
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:49,964
I would die for them.

1137
01:38:56,221 --> 01:38:57,847
How interesting.

(THUDDING)

1139
01:39:18,243 --> 01:39:19,953
Never had a doubt.

Anyone not
ready for this?

There is my God,

Don't stop!

01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:21,848

Hold onto me.

We're gonna
get out of here.
I got you. Come on.

1160
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:45,992
Come on, Riddick!
Get up!

1161

Get up!

He died somewhere
on that planet.
