1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,700
Saigon.

3
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,470
Shit.

4
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,557
I'm still only in Saigon.

5
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:42,610
Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up
back in the jungle.

6
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:52,328
When I was home after my first tour,
it was worse.

7
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:03,255
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.

8
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:15,350
I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce.

9
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,064
When I was here, I wanted to be there.

10
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:26,861
When I was there, all I could think of
was getting back into the jungle.

11
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,116
I'm here a week now.

12
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:37,663
Waiting for a mission.

13
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:40,290
Getting softer.

14
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:48,799
Every minute I stay in this room,
I get weaker.

15
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,293
And every minute
Charlie squats in the bush,

16
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,053
he gets stronger.

17
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:02,020
Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter.

18
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,369
Everyone gets everything he wants.

19
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,163
I wanted a mission.

20
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,499
And for my sins, they gave me one.

21
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,419
Brought it up to me like room service.

22
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:57,756
Captain Willard, are you in there?

23
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:00,092
Yeah, I'm coming.

24
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:02,845
It was a real choice mission.

25
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,432
And when it was over,
I'd never want another.

26
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,685
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

27
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:20,695
What does it look like?

28
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:32,615
- Are you Captain Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

29
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:34,250
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

30
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:37,211
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the door?

31
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,466
We have orders to escort you to the airfield.

32
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:47,462
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

33
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:48,562
What'd I do?

34
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:50,841
There's no charges, Captain.

35
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:54,853
You have orders to report
to COMSEC Intelligence at Nha Trang.

36
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,931
- I see.
- All right?

37
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:00,525
- Nha Trang for me?
- That's right.

38
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:04,154
Come on, Captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

39
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:07,073
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

40
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:11,819
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

41
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,205
Come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.

42
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:16,073
- Don't be an ass.
- Get hold of him good.

43
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:18,326
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.

44
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,502
- In we go.
- Now stand underneath this, Captain.

45
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:37,602
I was going to the worst place in the world
and I didn't even know it yet.

46
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,598
Weeks away
and hundreds of miles up a river

47
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:44,684
that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable,

48
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,811
plugged straight into Kurtz.

49
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:49,614
Insult me again and I'll kick your ass...

50
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,692
It was no accident
that I got to be the caretaker

51
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,245
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory

52
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,957
any more than being back in Saigon
was an accident.

53
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:04,128
There is no way to tell his story
without telling my own.

54
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,872
And if his story is really a confession...

55
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,123
Captain Willard reporting, sir.

56
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:09,215
...then so is mine.

57
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:12,511
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

58
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:16,223
- Stand at ease.
- General.

59
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,594
Do you want a cigarette?

60
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:22,437
No, thank you, sir.

61
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,475
Captain, have you ever seen
this gentleman before?

62
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:27,693
No, sir.

63
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:30,654
- Met the General or myself?
- No, sir.

64
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,155
Not personally.

65
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,733
You've worked a lot on your own,
haven't you, Captain?

66
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,943
Yes, sir, I have.

67
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,486
Your report specifies Intelligence,

68
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,621
Counterintelligence with COMSEC, I Corps.

69
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,499
I'm not presently disposed
to discuss those operations, sir.

70
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,219
Did you not work for the CIA in I Corps?

71
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,756
No, sir.

72
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,508
Did you not assassinate
a government tax collector,

73
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:04,311
Quang Tri Province, June 18, 1968?

74
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:08,356
Captain?

75
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:14,571
Sir, I am unaware
of any such activity or operation,

76
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,902
nor would I be disposed
to discuss such an operation

77
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:23,455
if it did, in fact, exist, sir.

78
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:37,585
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

79
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:40,804
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

80
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,474
I noticed that you have

81
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:46,894
a bad hand, there. Are you wounded?

82
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,597
I had a little fishing accident on R&R, sir.

83
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:52,232
- Fishing on R&R?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,060
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

85
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,445
Yes, General. Very much so, sir.

86
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:59,481
Well, let's see what we have here.

87
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:02,992
Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

88
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:07,288
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.

89
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:11,042
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

90
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:17,499
Captain, I don't know
how you feel about this shrimp,

91
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,834
but if you'll eat it,

92
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:23,136
you'll never have to prove your courage
in any other way.

93
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,182
Right, well,
why don't I just take a piece here?

94
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:31,603
Captain, you've heard
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

95
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:36,233
Yes, sir, I've heard the name.

96
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,185
Jesus.

97
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:40,779
Operations officer, Fifth Special Forces.

98
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,941
Luke, would you play that tape
for the Captain, please?

99
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,494
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

100
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,706
October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter Victor King.

101
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,875
These were monitored out of Cambodia.

102
00:12:56,336 --> 00:12:58,629
This has been verified
as Colonel Kurtz's voice.

103
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:01,465
I watched a snail

104
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,760
crawl along the edge

105
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,555
of a straight razor.

106
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:10,766
That's my dream.

107
00:13:12,978 --> 00:13:14,728
It's my nightmare.

108
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,232
Crawling, slithering

109
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:22,152
along the edge

110
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:26,990
of a straight razor,

111
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,743
and surviving.

112
00:13:33,497 --> 00:13:38,084
Transmission 11, received '68,
December 30, 0500 hours.

113
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:40,170
Sector King Zulu King.

114
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:44,048
But we must kill them.

115
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,341
We must incinerate them,

116
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,177
pig after pig,

117
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:51,388
cow after cow,

118
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:55,184
village after village,

119
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:57,019
army after army.

120
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,314
And they call me an assassin.

121
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:05,611
What do you call it
when the assassins accuse the assassin?

122
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:07,404
They lie.

123
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:10,491
They lie, and we have to be merciful

124
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:12,700
for those who lie.

125
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:16,177
Those nabobs,

126
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,249
I hate them.

127
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,127
I do hate them.

128
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:31,669
Walt Kurtz was one of the most
outstanding officers

129
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,888
this country's ever produced.

130
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:37,391
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

131
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:40,769
And he was a good man, too.

132
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,771
A humanitarian man.

133
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:45,899
A man of wit and humor.

134
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:49,444
He joined the Special Forces.

135
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:53,323
And after that,

136
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:58,161
his ideas, methods,

137
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:01,865
became

138
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:05,752
unsound.

139
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:12,774
Unsound.

140
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:22,718
Now he's crossed into Cambodia
with this Montagnard army of his

141
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:26,564
that worship the man like a god.

142
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:30,776
And follow every order, however ridiculous.

143
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:36,281
Well, I have some other shocking news
to tell you.

144
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:39,325
Colonel Kurtz is about to be

145
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:41,995
arrested for murder.

146
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,873
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?

147
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:50,003
Kurtz had ordered the execution
of some Vietnamese intelligence agents.

148
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:52,755
Men he believed were double agents.

149
00:15:54,258 --> 00:15:56,843
So he took matters into his own hands.

150
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:01,097
Well, you see, Willard,

151
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,266
in this war, things get

152
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:07,644
confused out there.

153
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:12,057
Power, ideals, the old morality,

154
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:14,818
and practical military necessity.

155
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,281
But out there with these natives,

156
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,368
it must be a temptation

157
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:26,413
to be God.

158
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,377
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart

159
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:37,340
between the rational and the irrational,

160
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:40,051
between good and evil.

161
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,929
And good does not always triumph.

162
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:47,850
Sometimes

163
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,187
the dark side

164
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:56,233
overcomes what Lincoln called,
"The better angels of our nature."

165
00:16:58,152 --> 00:17:00,570
Every man has got a breaking point.

166
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,198
You and I have them.

167
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,035
Walt Kurtz has reached his,

168
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:11,748
and very obviously he has gone insane.

169
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:28,889
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

170
00:17:33,478 --> 00:17:37,106
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat,

171
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:41,902
pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba,

172
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,239
follow it, learn what you can
along the way.

173
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:48,150
When you find the Colonel,
infiltrate his team

174
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,828
by whatever means available

175
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,746
and terminate the Colonel's command.

176
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,463
Terminate the Colonel?

177
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:07,961
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint,

178
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:13,766
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable human conduct.

179
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:17,103
And he is still in the field,
commanding troops.

180
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:21,940
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

181
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:27,112
You understand, Captain,
that this mission does not exist,

182
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:30,782
nor will it ever exist.

183
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:28,797
How many people had I already killed?

184
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:32,801
There were those six
that I knew about for sure.

185
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:36,846
Close enough to blow their last breath
in my face.

186
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:44,144
But this time it was an American
and an officer.

187
00:19:55,698 --> 00:20:00,035
That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me, but it did.

188
00:20:02,664 --> 00:20:06,116
Shit, charging a man with murder
in this place

189
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:09,794
was like handing out speeding tickets
at the Indy 500.

190
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,050
I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do?

191
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:21,556
But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him.

192
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,898
Did you check the tank?

193
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:32,233
Yeah.

194
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:37,904
I was being ferried down the coast
in a Navy PBR.

195
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:42,367
A type of plastic patrol boat,
a pretty common sight on the rivers.

196
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:45,070
They said it was a good way
to pick up information and move

197
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,414
without drawing a lot of attention.

198
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,416
And that was okay.

199
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,835
I needed the air and the time.

200
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,080
Only problem was, I wouldn't be alone.

201
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,007
Morning, Captain.

202
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:02,304
The crew were mostly just kids.

203
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:05,764
Rock 'n' rollers
with one foot in their graves.

204
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,184
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

205
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,973
The machinist, the one they called Chef,
was from New Orleans.

206
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,609
He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.

207
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,445
Probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans.

208
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,231
Lance, on the forward .50s,
was a famous surfer

209
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,650
from the beaches south of LA.

210
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,370
To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.

211
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,826
Clean, Mr. Clean,
was from some South Bronx shithole,

212
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,995
and I think the light and space of Vietnam

213
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,297
really put the zap on his head.

214
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,594
Then there was Phillips, the Chief.

215
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,548
It might have been my mission,
but it sure as shit was the Chief's boat.

216
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:50,884
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water

217
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:53,019
to get into the Nung River.

218
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,897
They're both hot, belong to Charlie.

219
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,024
Don't worry about it.

220
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:01,401
Don't smoke.

221
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,490
You know,
I've pulled a few special ops in here.

222
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,533
About six months ago,

223
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,496
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Luong.

224
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,666
He was regular Army, too.

225
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,837
I heard he shot himself in the head.

226
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:33,015
At first, I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier.

227
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,310
I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.

228
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,815
Third-generation West Point,
top of his class,

229
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:46,529
Korea, Airborne,
about 1,000 decorations, et cetera, et cetera.

230
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,202
I had heard his voice on the tape
and it really put the hook in me,

231
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:58,581
but I couldn't connect up
that voice with this man.

232
00:23:05,673 --> 00:23:08,550
Like they said, he had an impressive career.

233
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,302
Maybe too impressive.

234
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:13,888
I mean, perfect.

235
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:18,802
He was being groomed
for one of the top slots in the corporation,

236
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:21,729
General, Chief of Staff, anything.

237
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:28,102
In 1964, he returned from a tour
with advisory command in Vietnam

238
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:30,237
and things started to slip.

239
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:34,867
His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.

240
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,954
Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them.

241
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:43,743
During the next few months,
he made three requests for transfer

242
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:49,088
to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia,
and was finally accepted.

243
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,259
Airborne?

244
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:57,764
He was 38 years old.

245
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:01,934
Why the fuck would he do that?

246
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:07,565
1966, joins Special Forces,

247
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:10,067
returns Vietnam.

248
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:13,813
- Hey, what's that?
- Arc light.

249
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:16,815
- What's that?
- B-52 strike.

250
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:17,715
Man.

251
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,152
- What's that?
- Arc light.

252
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:23,288
I hate that. Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.

253
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:25,365
Charlie don't never see them
or hear them, man.

254
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,701
- There they are.
- Concussion will suck the air

255
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,127
out of your damn lungs.

256
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:32,831
- Something terrible is gonna happen.
- Smoke!

257
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,666
Secondary burning.

258
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,627
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

259
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:37,761
Let's have a look, Chief.

260
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:44,016
It was the air cav, First of the Ninth.

261
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,555
That's them.

262
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:47,978
Our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.

263
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:51,857
But they were supposed to be
waiting for us another 30 km ahead.

264
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:56,695
Well, Airmobile,
those boys just couldn't stay put.

265
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:12,335
Kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

266
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:26,091
First of the Ninth
was an old cavalry division

267
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,719
that had cashed in its horses for choppers
and gone tear-assing around Nam

268
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,604
looking for the shit.

269
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:35,984
They'd given Charlie a few surprises
in their time here.

270
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:40,529
What they were mopping up now
hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.

271
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,108
Just keep running by. Run for television.

272
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,610
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep... Go on! Keep going.

273
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,279
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

274
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:49,446
Don't look at the camera.

275
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:51,740
Just go by like you're fighting.
Like you're fighting.

276
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,493
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through!

277
00:25:54,593 --> 00:25:57,121
Go through! Just go by! Keep on going!

278
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:01,049
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

279
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:24,655
Where can I find the CO?

280
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:27,033
That's the Colonel coming down!

281
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,544
The CO's on that chopper.

282
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:05,986
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line back
about 100 yards!

283
00:27:06,196 --> 00:27:09,615
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!

284
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,405
- Body cards!
- Sir?

285
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,624
- Bring my body cards!
- Yes, sir!

286
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:25,247
I'm the fourth tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

287
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:28,299
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

288
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:29,834
Captain Willard!

289
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:33,713
I carry priority papers from
COMSEC Intelligence, II Corps.

290
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:37,467
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you
on the requirements of my mission.

291
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,220
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

292
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,056
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

293
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:45,058
- We'll see what we can do, but...
- Colonel.

294
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:46,985
...just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

295
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:55,734
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

296
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:59,871
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds,

297
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:03,667
six of clubs, eight of spades.

298
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:07,004
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

299
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:08,839
Four of diamonds.

300
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:13,760
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

301
00:28:14,178 --> 00:28:16,922
- What?
- Death cards!

302
00:28:17,022 --> 00:28:19,683
- Death?
- It lets Charlie know who did this.

303
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,930
- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you.

304
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,649
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

305
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:36,866
This is an area that is controlled
by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

306
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:43,998
We are here to help you.

307
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:50,579
- We are here to extend a welcome hand...
- Come on.

308
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,706
...to those of you who would like...
- Everybody in?

309
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:56,384
...to return to the arms
of the South Vietnamese government.

310
00:28:58,262 --> 00:28:59,512
Hurry up!

311
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,091
Move it out!

312
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:08,897
This is an area that is controlled
by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

313
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,232
Hey! What's this?

314
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:13,735
What is this?

315
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,812
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.

316
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:19,148
About the only thing
that's holding his guts in, sir,

317
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:20,741
- is that pot lid.
- Yeah?

318
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,451
What does he have to say?

319
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,204
This soldier is dirty VC.

320
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:28,665
He wants water. He can drink paddy water.

321
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:32,411
Get out of here! Give me that canteen.

322
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:35,414
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to...

323
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:38,342
Get out of here! I'll kick your fucking ass!

324
00:29:38,593 --> 00:29:39,835
He killed a lot of our people!

325
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:42,755
Any man brave enough
to fight with his guts strapped on him

326
00:29:42,855 --> 00:29:44,672
can drink from my canteen any day!

327
00:29:44,772 --> 00:29:48,551
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those sailors
is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

328
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:51,437
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

329
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,357
Yeah? Here.

330
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:57,693
Repeat, we have a body count. We have...

331
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:04,692
- What's your name, sailor?
- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, sir!

332
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,912
- Gunner's Mate Third Class...
- Wait. Lance Johnson, the surfer?

333
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:11,532
- Yes, sir.
- Well, it's an honor to meet you, Lance.

334
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:13,951
I've admired your nose riding for years.

335
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,995
I like your cutback, too.
I think you have the best cutback there is.

336
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:19,790
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

337
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,875
I'm Bill Kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.

338
00:30:21,975 --> 00:30:23,969
- This guy with you?
- Yeah.

339
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,297
I want you to meet some guys.
This is Mike from San Diego.

340
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:29,007
- Far out.
- Johnny from Malibu.

341
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:31,218
- John, hi. Far out.
- Pretty solid surfers.

342
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:33,095
None of us are anywhere
near your class, though.

343
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:34,595
No way.

344
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:38,441
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.
I like to finish operations early,

345
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:41,652
fly down to Vung Tau for the evening glass.

346
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:44,105
- Been riding since you got here?
- No way.

347
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:46,323
I haven't surfed since I been here.

348
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:50,611
Through Christ our Lord,
from whom all good things come.

349
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:53,531
Through him in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

350
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:57,285
all glory and honor is yours,
Almighty Father. Amen.

351
00:30:57,385 --> 00:31:01,338
Let us pray with confidence to the Father
in the words our savior gave us.

352
00:31:01,882 --> 00:31:05,885
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

353
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:08,595
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done

354
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:10,805
on Earth as it is in heaven.

355
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:13,016
Give us this day our daily bread...

356
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:17,929
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

357
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:21,482
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

358
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:34,536
Kilgore had had a pretty good day
for himself.

359
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:36,947
They choppered in the T-bones
and the beer

360
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:39,458
and turned the LZ into a beach party.

361
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:43,370
The more they tried
to make it just like home,

362
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,006
the more they made everybody miss it.

363
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:49,468
Make my meat rare, rare but not cold!

364
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:58,101
Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.

365
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:02,438
He loved his boys
and you felt safe with him.

366
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:06,100
He was one of those guys
that had that weird light around him.

367
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,520
You just knew he wasn't gonna get
so much as a scratch here.

368
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,449
What happened to your mission, Captain?
Nha Trang forget all about you?

369
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,167
Airborne.

370
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,214
Sir, two places we can get into the river...

371
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:30,999
- Yeah.
...here and here.

372
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:33,543
It's a pretty wide delta,
but these are the only two spots

373
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:34,886
I'm really sure of.

374
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:39,140
Well, that village you're pointing at
is kind of hairy, Willard.

375
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:41,885
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy,

376
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:43,720
got some pretty heavy ordnance.

377
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,606
I lost a few recon ships in there
now and again.

378
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:49,150
What's the name of that goddamn village?
Vin Drin...

379
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:51,403
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

380
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:54,614
Damn gook names all sound the same.

381
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:59,326
Mike, you know anything
about this point at Vin Drin Dop?

382
00:32:59,703 --> 00:33:01,203
That's a fantastic peak.

383
00:33:01,997 --> 00:33:03,906
- Peak?
- About six foot.

384
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:07,201
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak.
It's got both the long right and left slide

385
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:09,412
with a bowl section. It's unbelievable.

386
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:11,588
It's just tube city.

387
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,378
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
A good peak.

388
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:20,006
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

389
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:22,049
It's all goddamn beach break.

390
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:24,134
It's really hairy in there, sir.
That's where we lost McDonald.

391
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,476
They shot the hell out of us there.

392
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,313
That's Charlie's point.

393
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,225
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.

394
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:34,277
There's always a good offshore breeze
in the morning.

395
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:36,487
We may not be able to get the boat in.

396
00:33:36,697 --> 00:33:39,032
The draft at the mouth of that river
may be too shallow.

397
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:43,403
We'll pick your boat up and put it down
like a baby, right where you want it.

398
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:46,664
This is the First of the Ninth air cav, son.
Airmobile.

399
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,076
I can take that point and hold it
just as long as I like.

400
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:53,337
And you can get any place up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

401
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,547
Hell, a six-foot peak.

402
00:33:57,633 --> 00:33:59,460
All right, take a gunship
back to the division.

403
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,628
Lance, go with Mike
and let him pick out a board for you,

404
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:03,464
and bring me my Yater Spoon, the 8'6".

405
00:34:03,564 --> 00:34:06,058
- I don't know, sir, it's...
- What is it, soldier?

406
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,969
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

407
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:11,063
Charlie don't surf!

408
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,047
Hey, Jesus, Clean,
you ain't gonna believe this. Look.

409
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:42,551
Hey, man! They're picking up the boat!

410
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:49,224
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

411
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:53,353
All right, son, let her rip.

412
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:55,146
Let's go!

413
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:22,055
I never have gotten used to a light board,
and I can't get used to one.

414
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:24,774
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.

415
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:28,312
- You prefer a heavy or a light board?
- Heavier.

416
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:29,605
- Really?
- Yeah!

417
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:31,732
I thought all the young guys
like lighter boards.

418
00:36:31,832 --> 00:36:34,026
You can't ride the nose on those things.

419
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:37,445
Big Duke Six, this is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

420
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:40,907
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on heading 2-7-0.

421
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:42,625
Assume attack formation.

422
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,411
That's a roger, Big Duke.
Okay, we're going in.

423
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:49,415
Lance, we'll come in low
out of the rising sun,

424
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:51,550
and about a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

425
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,345
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

426
00:36:54,554 --> 00:36:57,932
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

427
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,643
Hey, they're gonna play music!

428
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:10,193
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?

429
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:13,947
So we don't get our balls blown off.

430
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:30,045
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on psy war op, make it loud.

431
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:33,924
This is a Romeo Foxtrot. Shall we dance?

432
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:40,013
- Jimmy!
- Yes, sir!

433
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:20,835
Run, Charlie!

434
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,639
We got some...
There's more and more down there.

435
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:45,400
Look out, automatic .50-cal!
.50-cal in the open!

436
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,646
I've spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go down and check it out.

437
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:51,906
All right, this is Fox Five. We're going in.

438
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,037
- All right. What a shot.
- Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.

439
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:07,589
Get you a case of beer for that.

440
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:31,729
6-4-1-0, we're over the village right now.

441
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:33,689
I think I see a vehicle
down in the courtyard.

442
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:36,949
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Well done, hawks. Well done.

443
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:40,286
I want some 20 Mike-Mike Vulcan
right along those tree lines.

444
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:42,205
Ripple the shit out of them.

445
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:44,699
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
.50 caliber onboard.

446
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:47,460
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.

447
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,339
Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.

448
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,882
Don't these people ever give up?

449
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,387
Nice shot, Bill.

450
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,849
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

451
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:07,221
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get out of here!

452
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:09,264
Un-ass that shit. Get it out of here!

453
00:42:09,364 --> 00:42:13,151
Get it out. It's just a flare. It's all right.
It's just a flare.

454
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,488
- Everybody all right? Lance, you all right?
- I'm fine!

455
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:32,795
Get down!

456
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:57,570
I'm not going! I'm not going! I'm not going!

457
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:14,160
We just got a secondary
down there in the plaza.

458
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,122
Blue Three, Blue Four,
hold out over position...

459
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:20,049
Duke Six, Duke Six,
we've got wounded down there.

460
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,056
My God! Oh, my God!

461
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:32,060
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

462
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:34,354
Please! Help me!

463
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:39,776
- Please, God! Help me!
- Stay with me, son, you're gonna be okay.

464
00:43:40,486 --> 00:43:42,938
- Let's give him some morphine.
- My God! My God!

465
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:47,318
- 0-3-7-7-4-2.
- Where's that duster?

466
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:50,154
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

467
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,780
I want my men out.

468
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,865
Somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke.

469
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:57,919
This is 10-10. We're gonna be in,
throw them on and get out...

470
00:44:19,816 --> 00:44:22,484
She's got a grenade! She's got a grenade!

471
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:27,356
Jesus! The whole goddamn thing just...

472
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,491
- She blew the shit out of...
- Fucking savages.

473
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:34,529
- Can I get a medevac?
- What's going on... Christ, she's a sapper.

474
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,698
I'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny.

475
00:44:36,798 --> 00:44:38,792
Go in there.
Put that right skid right up her ass.

476
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,873
We gotta get some air in these trees.
It's goddamn eat up with enemy down there.

477
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,250
I'm taking fire. I'm taking hits all over...

478
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,678
Three o'clock! Three o'clock, my position!
Drawing fire, drawing heavy fire!

479
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:54,431
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! I'm going in.
My tail rotor's out. I got control.

480
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:06,060
- What do you think?
- Wow, this is really exciting, man.

481
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,563
- No, no! The waves! The waves!
- Right.

482
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:12,408
Look at that, breaks both ways.
Watch. Watch.

483
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,869
Look! Good six-foot swells!

484
00:45:40,185 --> 00:45:41,352
Come here, Lance.

485
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:45,772
Incoming!

486
00:45:50,236 --> 00:45:53,397
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.

487
00:45:53,497 --> 00:45:57,492
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

488
00:45:59,912 --> 00:46:01,538
Come here! Come here!

489
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,785
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

490
00:46:06,885 --> 00:46:09,671
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is.
Go change.

491
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,380
It's still pretty hairy out there, sir.

492
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:13,791
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

493
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:16,294
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

494
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:18,387
That clear? Now get going.

495
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,058
I'll cover for them.
And bring a board for Lance!

496
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:25,436
We can't do shit until the boat gets here.

497
00:46:25,854 --> 00:46:29,348
Lance, I'll bet you can't wait
to get out there.

498
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:31,476
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

499
00:46:31,576 --> 00:46:35,438
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think of that?

500
00:46:35,538 --> 00:46:37,648
We ought to wait for the tide to come up.

501
00:46:37,748 --> 00:46:40,533
- Lance, come here. Look. Look!
- Incoming!

502
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:45,830
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!

503
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:50,168
You wanna wait here for six hours?

504
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:55,632
Yo! Hey! Chief!

505
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:06,725
Okay, fellas, quit hiding. Come on!

506
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:09,686
- Let's go, dickheads, take off!
- God damn it!

507
00:47:09,938 --> 00:47:12,481
Don't you think it's a little risky for R&R?

508
00:47:12,607 --> 00:47:17,186
If I say it's safe to surf this beach, Captain,
it's safe to surf this beach!

509
00:47:17,286 --> 00:47:21,615
I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fucking place.

510
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,120
Give me that RT, soldier.

511
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:29,832
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.

512
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,960
God damn it! I want that tree line bombed!

513
00:47:33,128 --> 00:47:35,795
Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.

514
00:47:36,004 --> 00:47:37,797
Blow them into the Stone Age, son!

515
00:47:39,091 --> 00:47:40,550
No, back, no!

516
00:47:41,343 --> 00:47:44,637
All right, now. Let me take care of this.
You all right? Get that out of here!

517
00:47:44,888 --> 00:47:48,049
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.

518
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:50,552
- No, ma'am. Sorry!
- Jimmy!

519
00:47:50,652 --> 00:47:52,345
Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three, roger.

520
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:54,389
They need some napalm
down there in the tree line.

521
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:56,224
Can you guys push ground
and put it down there?

522
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:58,184
Right, One-Three.
We're fixing to fuck with them.

523
00:47:58,284 --> 00:48:00,894
- What's the target?
- We're trying to suppress some mortar fire

524
00:48:00,994 --> 00:48:02,437
off the tree line down there.

525
00:48:02,537 --> 00:48:05,232
- Roger. Here we come.
- Good, give it all you got.

526
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:07,734
Bring in all your ships.

527
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:10,370
Medevac him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.

528
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:15,458
No, no, no, you got to go with him.
Come on! Go! Go!

529
00:48:15,668 --> 00:48:18,495
Get it out of here!
And tell my guys I want my board!

530
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,122
Big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three.

531
00:48:20,222 --> 00:48:22,958
The jets are inbound now.
You got about 30 seconds to on-station.

532
00:48:23,058 --> 00:48:25,802
Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.

533
00:48:29,264 --> 00:48:30,681
Don't worry.

534
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,259
We'll have this place cleaned up
and ready in a jiffy, son.

535
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,852
Don't you worry.

536
00:48:35,061 --> 00:48:36,687
Give me those shorts.

537
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,359
These are from the air cav,
a present from me and the boys.

538
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:45,988
I want to see you do
your stuff in them out there. Okay?

539
00:49:09,386 --> 00:49:10,929
You smell that?

540
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,556
- Do you smell that?
- What?

541
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,100
Napalm, son.

542
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,937
Nothing else in the world smells like that.

543
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,356
Come on. Move it! Move it! Move it!

544
00:49:23,274 --> 00:49:25,859
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

545
00:49:26,444 --> 00:49:29,021
You know, one time
we had a hill bombed for 12 hours.

546
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:31,490
And when it was all over, I walked up.

547
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,702
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

548
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:40,991
But the smell, you know,
that gasoline smell...

549
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:42,751
The whole hill,

550
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,587
it smelled like

551
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:49,549
victory.

552
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,056
Someday this war's gonna end.

553
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:13,531
Lance, the wind!

554
00:50:14,283 --> 00:50:15,608
- The wind!
- What?

555
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:19,202
It's blowing on shore! It's coming on shore.
It's gonna blow this place out!

556
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,739
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

557
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:25,158
It's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doing it!

558
00:50:25,258 --> 00:50:28,662
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel,
but I'm afraid that does it.

559
00:50:28,762 --> 00:50:32,416
The kid's got a reputation. You can't
expect him to surf those sloppy waves.

560
00:50:32,516 --> 00:50:35,010
- I understand what you're saying.
- Yeah, I'm an artist, Bill.

561
00:50:35,177 --> 00:50:38,096
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- Lance, look.

562
00:50:38,347 --> 00:50:40,215
I apologize. It's not my fault.

563
00:50:40,315 --> 00:50:41,967
The waves are getting
blown out by the napalm.

564
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:43,059
Hey, Bill, don't get me wrong...

565
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,102
It was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

566
00:50:45,228 --> 00:50:46,595
I accept your apology.

567
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:49,223
All right, then. But if you could
hang around just 20 minutes...

568
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:51,191
- Maybe some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes.

569
00:50:52,193 --> 00:50:54,820
- I'm an artist!
- Keep walking.

570
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:59,575
Okay, give it a try, guys!
One goes left and one goes right.

571
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,319
Look, Lance.

572
00:51:01,419 --> 00:51:03,237
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!

573
00:51:03,337 --> 00:51:05,197
- Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
- No.

574
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:06,574
- You sure?
- Yeah!

575
00:51:06,674 --> 00:51:09,877
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- It's the fucking napalm!

576
00:51:10,378 --> 00:51:12,171
Just wait 20 minutes!

577
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:14,380
Damn! Fuck!

578
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:16,215
They're looking for you!

579
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:22,722
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you going?

580
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,560
Incoming!

581
00:51:29,855 --> 00:51:33,066
- The colonel's surfboard!
- Get the fuck off me! It's mine!

582
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,363
- Guys, help!
- Get the board and let's get out of here!

583
00:51:42,658 --> 00:51:44,076
Fucking Airborne!

584
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,309
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

585
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:19,769
Come on. Let's get high.

586
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:21,813
- Want to smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

587
00:52:21,913 --> 00:52:24,156
Someday this war's gonna end.

588
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,993
That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat.

589
00:52:28,453 --> 00:52:30,371
They weren't looking
for anything more than a way home.

590
00:52:30,664 --> 00:52:31,914
Captain?

591
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:38,044
Trouble is, I'd been back there
and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.

592
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,175
Buddha time, here.

593
00:52:45,052 --> 00:52:48,430
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

594
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,770
If that's how Kilgore fought the war,

595
00:52:56,063 --> 00:52:59,441
I began to wonder
what they really had against Kurtz.

596
00:53:00,151 --> 00:53:02,609
It wasn't just insanity and murder.

597
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:06,405
There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.

598
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,617
I mean, he never was hurting for pussy.

599
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:20,169
I'm not here.

600
00:53:21,296 --> 00:53:24,423
I'm walking through the jungle
gathering mangos.

601
00:53:25,341 --> 00:53:27,134
I meet Raquel Welch.

602
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:32,138
I make a nice mango cream pudding,

603
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:38,227
kind of spread it around on us.

604
00:53:38,479 --> 00:53:44,525
She's into mangos, too.
She's, like, one limb above me.

605
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:47,153
We're both in the jungle here, nude.

606
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:49,063
- Hey, Chief.
- Yeah?

607
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:51,115
Here comes that Colonel guy again.

608
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,953
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like?

609
00:53:57,121 --> 00:54:02,417
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.

610
00:54:02,668 --> 00:54:07,756
Just give me back the board, Lance.
It was a good board, and I like it.

611
00:54:08,758 --> 00:54:11,134
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.

612
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:12,920
He's a determined motherfucker!

613
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,546
I will not hurt or harm you.

614
00:54:14,646 --> 00:54:18,099
- Cocksucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you.

615
00:54:18,476 --> 00:54:21,019
Just give me back the board, Lance.

616
00:54:21,312 --> 00:54:23,480
It was a good board, and I like it.

617
00:54:24,398 --> 00:54:27,149
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.

618
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:31,862
- I will not hurt or harm you.
- Jesus Christ.

619
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:33,940
That guy's too fucking much, man.

620
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,450
Do you think he would have shot us?

621
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:38,361
He wouldn't have shot us on the beach,

622
00:54:38,461 --> 00:54:40,454
but I think he would have shot us
if he saw me taking his board.

623
00:54:44,376 --> 00:54:45,834
Let's get this board out of my turret.

624
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:48,087
Sucker.

625
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:50,289
How am I going to shoot him
the next time he comes around?

626
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:52,423
Hey, Chef, make some room back there
for the board.

627
00:54:56,804 --> 00:54:58,221
Sock it to me, Lance.

628
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:05,720
I wonder if that's the same chopper.

629
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,565
Hell, he's probably got them
all over the river with that recording.

630
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:10,984
We'll have to hole up here till dark, Chief.

631
00:55:11,402 --> 00:55:13,403
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

632
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:15,238
What makes you say that?

633
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,357
You think that big cav colonel
wants everyone upriver

634
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:18,942
to know we stole his board?

635
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,409
I didn't steal it!

636
00:55:23,246 --> 00:55:27,082
Captain? Just how far up this river
we going?

637
00:55:28,376 --> 00:55:30,294
It's classified, Chief. I can't tell you.

638
00:55:33,381 --> 00:55:34,798
We're going up pretty far.

639
00:55:37,427 --> 00:55:38,927
Is it gonna be hairy?

640
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:41,597
I don't know, kid.

641
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:44,266
Yeah, probably.

642
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:47,768
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

643
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:49,645
Fuck.

644
00:56:00,282 --> 00:56:03,117
Never get a chance to know what the fuck
you are in some factory in Ohio.

645
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:09,790
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get
those mangoes now, okay?

646
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,201
- Take somebody with you.
- Yeah, I'll take...

647
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:13,961
I'll go with him.

648
00:56:19,675 --> 00:56:20,675
Chef?

649
00:56:21,677 --> 00:56:23,637
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

650
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:26,806
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

651
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:30,477
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

652
00:56:31,646 --> 00:56:34,939
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

653
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:41,528
Yes, sir. See, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier,

654
00:56:41,905 --> 00:56:43,489
a great saucier.

655
00:56:44,115 --> 00:56:47,493
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.

656
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:54,083
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.

657
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:05,094
Then I was supposed to go to Paris,
study at the Escoffier School.

658
00:57:06,304 --> 00:57:09,430
But then I got orders for my physical.

659
00:57:22,694 --> 00:57:25,780
Hell, I joined the Navy.
Heard they had better food.

660
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:29,158
A cook school, that did it.

661
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:33,204
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't want to hear about that.

662
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:39,584
They lined us up in front of 100 yards
of prime rib.

663
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,963
All of us lined up, looking at it.

664
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:45,715
Magnificent meat, really.

665
00:57:46,426 --> 00:57:48,218
Beautifully marbled.

666
00:57:50,763 --> 00:57:56,560
Next thing, they're throwing the meat
into these big cauldrons. All of it, boiling it.

667
00:57:57,854 --> 00:58:00,230
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.

668
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:03,774
I couldn't fucking believe that one.

669
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:07,862
That's when I applied for radioman school,
but then they gave me the...

670
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:51,446
What is it?

671
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:54,782
Charlie?

672
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,377
It's a tiger!

673
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,758
Tiger, man! It's a tiger!

674
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:16,462
Battle stations. Lance, up front!
On the .60, Clean!

675
00:59:16,562 --> 00:59:17,804
- Got it, man.
- Holy shit.

676
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:21,717
- Chef, come on!
- Fucking tiger!

677
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:23,936
- Captain, come on!
- What's happening?

678
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:26,479
- Let's go!
- Tiger!

679
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,724
Chief, you were right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

680
00:59:29,824 --> 00:59:32,568
- Bring that .60 forward!
- Never get out of the boat!

681
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:37,990
Never get out of the boat!
I gotta remember. Never get out of the boat.

682
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:43,579
- What happened? How many is it?
- A fucking tiger!

683
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,448
- What?
- A fucking tiger!

684
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,000
- Tiger?
- Yes! I've had it!

685
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:51,712
I've had the whole
goddamn fucking shit, man!

686
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:56,299
You can kiss my ass on the county square,
because I'm fucking bugging out.

687
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,176
I didn't come here for this.

688
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:00,929
I don't fucking need it! I don't want it.

689
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,849
I didn't get out of the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

690
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:10,722
All I wanted to do was fucking cook!
I just wanted to learn to fucking cook, man!

691
01:00:10,822 --> 01:00:14,526
- It's all right. It's all right.
- What happened, bro?

692
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,564
You're all right. You're gonna be all right.

693
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:21,031
- All right. It's gonna be all right.
- You're all right.

694
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:24,535
It's gonna be all right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

695
01:00:24,786 --> 01:00:26,362
Never get out of the fucking boat.

696
01:00:26,462 --> 01:00:29,707
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Goodbye!

697
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:33,669
Never get out of the boat.

698
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:36,213
Absolutely goddamn right.

699
01:00:38,008 --> 01:00:40,384
Unless you were going all the way.

700
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,516
Kurtz got off the boat.

701
01:00:49,226 --> 01:00:51,436
He split from the whole fucking program.

702
01:00:54,898 --> 01:00:59,527
How did that happen?
What did he see here that first tour?

703
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:08,661
Thirty-eight fucking years old.

704
01:01:10,497 --> 01:01:14,459
If you joined the Green Berets, there was
no way you'd ever get above colonel.

705
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,753
Kurtz knew what he was giving up.

706
01:01:19,672 --> 01:01:23,717
And the more I read and began
to understand, the more I admired him.

707
01:01:25,345 --> 01:01:27,713
His family and friends
couldn't understand it,

708
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:29,890
and they couldn't talk him out of it.

709
01:01:31,934 --> 01:01:35,304
He had to apply three times
and he put up with a ton of shit.

710
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:38,440
But when he threatened to resign,
they gave it to him.

711
01:01:42,654 --> 01:01:45,905
The next youngest guy in his class
was half his age.

712
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:49,525
They must have thought he was some
far-out old man,

713
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:51,118
humping it over that course.

714
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:55,790
I did it when I was 19
and it damn near wasted me.

715
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:03,297
A tough motherfucker. He finished it.

716
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:11,763
He could have gone for General,
but he went for himself instead.

717
01:02:15,226 --> 01:02:16,768
"Dear Eva,

718
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:22,649
"today was really a new one.
Almost got eaten alive by a fucking tiger.

719
01:02:25,069 --> 01:02:27,070
"Really un-fucking-believable, you know?

720
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:30,198
"We're taking this guy, Captain Willard,
up the river,

721
01:02:30,324 --> 01:02:33,076
"but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him."

722
01:02:36,372 --> 01:02:38,322
"Thought you might have heard by now
from Elwood.

723
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:41,041
- "I'll be coming home..."
- October 1967,

724
01:02:41,418 --> 01:02:44,586
on special assignment,
Kon Tum Province, II Corps.

725
01:02:44,713 --> 01:02:48,132
Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined local forces,

726
01:02:48,758 --> 01:02:50,634
rated a major success.

727
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:58,350
He received no official clearance.
He just thought it up and did it.

728
01:03:00,895 --> 01:03:02,271
What balls.

729
01:03:04,357 --> 01:03:07,316
They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one.

730
01:03:07,443 --> 01:03:11,529
But after the press got a hold of it,
they promoted him to full colonel instead.

731
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:18,745
Man, the bullshit piled up so fast
in Vietnam,

732
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:20,705
you needed wings to stay above it.

733
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,903
This sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit.

734
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,072
Expecting us this time?

735
01:03:58,409 --> 01:03:59,659
Damned if I know.

736
01:04:05,457 --> 01:04:07,458
Hello. Hello...

737
01:04:07,709 --> 01:04:08,876
Jesus.

738
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:18,344
- Everything goes back up into the truck.
- What?

739
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:20,304
We gotta get all that stuff up.

740
01:04:27,437 --> 01:04:29,221
Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

741
01:04:29,321 --> 01:04:31,189
- Let's go!
- I bet you we can score up here.

742
01:04:31,565 --> 01:04:34,067
Man, check out the bikes, Lance.

743
01:04:35,152 --> 01:04:37,854
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

744
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:40,323
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, sukiyaki.

745
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,325
Yeah, man. This is something.

746
01:04:46,622 --> 01:04:48,198
- Please!
- This must be the guy.

747
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:49,916
Right over there.

748
01:04:50,668 --> 01:04:53,127
Sergeant. Sergeant?

749
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:01,877
Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR 5.

750
01:05:01,977 --> 01:05:04,797
Come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
One hour. That's all.

751
01:05:04,897 --> 01:05:06,974
- What do you want?
- Can I get some Panama Red with it?

752
01:05:07,433 --> 01:05:09,927
Panama Red. Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

753
01:05:10,027 --> 01:05:12,721
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

754
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:14,431
- I don't have no destination.
- I can't do a goddamn thing

755
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:16,308
without a destination.
You got a destination?

756
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:17,476
- Sergeant.
- I need diesel fuel.

757
01:05:17,576 --> 01:05:19,603
All right. You got a destination?
I need a destination.

758
01:05:19,703 --> 01:05:21,730
I can't do a goddamn thing
without a destination.

759
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,732
Sarge, these guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

760
01:05:24,832 --> 01:05:27,318
I carry priority papers
from COMSEC Intelligence, II Corps.

761
01:05:27,418 --> 01:05:30,405
Okay, right, sir.
Hey, listen, it's a real big night.

762
01:05:30,505 --> 01:05:31,831
Eight bucks for that...

763
01:05:33,959 --> 01:05:35,751
All right. Damn.

764
01:05:36,753 --> 01:05:39,505
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

765
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,758
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

766
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:46,387
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

767
01:05:47,598 --> 01:05:50,473
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

768
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,927
Hey, listen, would you guys like some seats,
some press box seats for the show?

769
01:05:54,027 --> 01:05:56,897
You want those?
The show, man. The show out here.

770
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,725
- Bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

771
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:01,602
You got it. You gonna be here?

772
01:06:01,702 --> 01:06:06,740
Listen, Captain, on the house.
No hard feelings, huh?

773
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:48,321
How you doing out there?
I said, "How you doing out there?"

774
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:53,034
Want to say hello to you from all of us
up here to all of you out there

775
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,454
who worked so goddamn hard
in Operation Brute Force!

776
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:59,248
Hello, all you paratroopers out there!

777
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:02,877
And the Marines! And the sailors!

778
01:07:04,088 --> 01:07:05,830
We want to let you know
that we're proud of you!

779
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,715
'Cause we know how tough
and how hard it's been.

780
01:07:08,217 --> 01:07:09,217
Yeah!

781
01:07:09,677 --> 01:07:12,803
And to prove it, we're gonna give you some
entertainment we know you're gonna like.

782
01:07:13,388 --> 01:07:16,473
Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty.

783
01:07:18,643 --> 01:07:22,938
Miss May, Miss Terry Teray! Yeah!

784
01:07:23,481 --> 01:07:28,443
And the Playmate of the Year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!

785
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:21,987
What's the matter?

786
01:08:22,087 --> 01:08:25,040
They've got them here tonight.

787
01:08:31,047 --> 01:08:32,505
Grease my gun!

788
01:08:40,847 --> 01:08:42,806
I'm ready to... baby!

789
01:08:59,824 --> 01:09:01,908
You're cute. I like you.

790
01:09:02,493 --> 01:09:05,078
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

791
01:09:07,206 --> 01:09:08,289
Oh, my God...

792
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah!

793
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:13,795
You fucking bitch!

794
01:09:14,046 --> 01:09:15,088
Take it off!

795
01:09:18,217 --> 01:09:20,593
Hey, lover! You want us to come over?

796
01:09:21,136 --> 01:09:24,055
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!

797
01:09:26,683 --> 01:09:28,351
Sign my centerfold!

798
01:09:29,519 --> 01:09:31,804
Come on, baby! Come up here now.

799
01:09:31,904 --> 01:09:34,064
Get your goddamn hands off of my girl!

800
01:09:45,284 --> 01:09:46,576
Start her up.

801
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:53,166
Come on!

802
01:09:55,753 --> 01:09:57,086
Will you sign these?

803
01:09:57,921 --> 01:09:59,839
Girls! Let's go!

804
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:19,692
So long!

805
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:04,276
Charlie didn't get much USO.

806
01:11:06,654 --> 01:11:09,406
He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.

807
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:17,831
His idea of great R&R
was cold rice and a little rat meat.

808
01:11:20,417 --> 01:11:26,255
He had only two ways home,
death or victory.

809
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,811
No wonder Kurtz put a weed
up Command's ass.

810
01:11:42,397 --> 01:11:45,183
The war was being run
by a bunch of four-star clowns

811
01:11:45,283 --> 01:11:47,525
who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away.

812
01:11:50,529 --> 01:11:53,114
Man, that was far fucking out.

813
01:11:53,324 --> 01:11:56,034
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

814
01:11:56,869 --> 01:11:59,120
Hey, Clean, look at that. She was here, man.

815
01:11:59,914 --> 01:12:02,707
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

816
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:05,118
You can really get hung up
on these broads, man,

817
01:12:05,218 --> 01:12:06,828
just like that cat in the delta.

818
01:12:06,928 --> 01:12:08,546
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?

819
01:12:09,006 --> 01:12:12,050
The one that went up for murder.
He was an Army sergeant.

820
01:12:12,218 --> 01:12:15,836
Remember? This cat, man,
he really dug his Playboy, man.

821
01:12:15,936 --> 01:12:21,592
I mean, this cat, when the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

822
01:12:21,692 --> 01:12:24,395
Look at these beautiful fucking jugs, man!

823
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:27,890
Yeah. So anyway,
he was working ARVN patrols, you know,

824
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:31,318
had one of them cocky gook
asshole lieutenants and shit.

825
01:12:31,611 --> 01:12:34,689
And one day, the gook took his magazine
from him and wouldn't give it back to him.

826
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:36,615
He said, "Give me my magazine back."

827
01:12:36,783 --> 01:12:40,786
Gook said, "You shut up.
I have you court-martial."

828
01:12:41,495 --> 01:12:43,571
- Typical fucking ARVN.
- Yeah.

829
01:12:43,671 --> 01:12:47,659
- So then the gook starts to go too far.
- Chef, take the wheel.

830
01:12:47,759 --> 01:12:51,212
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's titties.

831
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:52,880
Take the wheel.

832
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:57,760
He started sticking pinholes and mutilating
the centerfold and all kinds of shit like that.

833
01:12:57,928 --> 01:13:00,722
And the sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.

834
01:13:01,015 --> 01:13:03,308
"You leave your shitty little gook hands
off of that girl.

835
01:13:03,434 --> 01:13:04,809
"Don't do her like that," right?

836
01:13:05,102 --> 01:13:09,104
- Gook say, "Fuck you," in Vietnamese.
- Damn.

837
01:13:10,606 --> 01:13:13,183
The sergeant, man,
he just couldn't handle it no more.

838
01:13:13,283 --> 01:13:18,447
He just picked up his iron,
flipped it to rock 'n' roll and...

839
01:13:19,782 --> 01:13:23,068
Gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the Playboy mag

840
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:25,787
and blew his ass clean off of the dock.

841
01:13:25,913 --> 01:13:30,000
There wasn't no more lieutenant that day.
That was it for his ass.

842
01:13:31,836 --> 01:13:35,380
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.

843
01:13:35,757 --> 01:13:37,590
They stuck his ass in the LBJ.

844
01:13:37,799 --> 01:13:40,885
It's too bad he didn't get no medals
or nothing.

845
01:13:44,306 --> 01:13:47,266
Fucking ARVN, man.
They should have killed the fuck.

846
01:13:49,019 --> 01:13:51,312
Should have given the fucker a Silver Star.

847
01:13:53,315 --> 01:13:55,066
Bummer for the gook, though, ain't it?

848
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:05,200
Good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AFVN.

849
01:14:05,326 --> 01:14:08,945
It's about 82 degrees in downtown Saigon
right now, also very humid.

850
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:11,323
And we have an important message
for all GIs

851
01:14:11,423 --> 01:14:13,742
who are living off base
from the Mayor of Saigon.

852
01:14:13,842 --> 01:14:14,834
Yeah!

853
01:14:14,934 --> 01:14:17,670
He'd like you to hang your laundry up
indoors instead of on the windowsills.

854
01:14:17,922 --> 01:14:20,006
The Mayor wants you
to keep Saigon beautiful.

855
01:14:21,175 --> 01:14:22,751
And now, here's another blast from the past

856
01:14:22,851 --> 01:14:25,587
going out to big Sam
who's all alone out there

857
01:14:25,687 --> 01:14:27,798
with the First Battalion, 35th Infantry,

858
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:32,218
and dedicated by the fire team
at An Khe to their groovy CO...

859
01:14:32,318 --> 01:14:34,895
- The Rolling Stones, Satisfaction.
- All right!

860
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:38,690
Work out, Clean!

861
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:40,859
Get down, Bubba!

862
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:52,204
Hang on, Lance!

863
01:14:59,253 --> 01:15:00,711
Get down, Bubba!

864
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:10,972
Yeah!

865
01:15:20,732 --> 01:15:22,900
I see you is right on target.

866
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,647
Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

867
01:15:28,747 --> 01:15:30,115
All right!

868
01:15:30,867 --> 01:15:32,242
Look out, Lance!

869
01:15:40,585 --> 01:15:44,004
"Commitment and Counter-Insurgency,
by Colonel Walter E. Kurtz.

870
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:49,968
"As long as our officers and troops perform
tours of duty limited to one year,

871
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:53,262
"they will remain dilettantes in war
and tourists in Vietnam.

872
01:15:56,183 --> 01:15:59,010
"As long as cold beer, hot food, rock 'n' roll

873
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:01,846
"and all the other amenities
remain the expected norm,

874
01:16:01,946 --> 01:16:04,482
"our conduct of the war
will gain only impotence.

875
01:16:05,317 --> 01:16:06,942
"We need fewer men and better.

876
01:16:07,194 --> 01:16:11,447
"If they were committed, this war could be
won with a fourth of our present force."

877
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,608
- Shit.
- Holy shit.

878
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:16,619
Chicken time. You ain't shitting, bro.
They're motherfucking...

879
01:16:19,372 --> 01:16:21,080
- Who is that?
- What's going on?

880
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:25,376
Is that you, Lazzaro?

881
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:45,146
- Fire on the canopy!
- I got it! I got it! Get out of there!

882
01:16:45,981 --> 01:16:49,274
Get out! I got it! Yeah! I got it!

883
01:16:51,152 --> 01:16:52,770
Lance, get down!

884
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,571
Put that fucker out, man!

885
01:17:01,871 --> 01:17:03,622
What the fuck they think they're doing?

886
01:17:28,063 --> 01:17:31,190
Late summer, autumn 1968.

887
01:17:32,317 --> 01:17:35,570
Kurtz's patrols in the highlands
coming under frequent ambush.

888
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,489
The camp started falling apart.

889
01:17:45,288 --> 01:17:46,538
November.

890
01:17:47,123 --> 01:17:50,875
Kurtz orders assassination of three
Vietnamese men and one woman.

891
01:17:52,211 --> 01:17:55,547
Two of the men were colonels
in the South Vietnamese army.

892
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:01,595
Enemy activity in his old sector
dropped off to nothing.

893
01:18:05,016 --> 01:18:07,142
Guess he must have hit
the right four people.

894
01:18:10,062 --> 01:18:14,148
He joined the Special Forces.
And after that, his...

895
01:18:15,734 --> 01:18:18,978
The Army tried one last time
to bring him back into the fold.

896
01:18:19,078 --> 01:18:20,104
...methods...

897
01:18:20,204 --> 01:18:22,982
And if he'd pulled over,
it all would have been forgotten.

898
01:18:23,082 --> 01:18:24,116
...unsound.

899
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,745
- But he kept going...
- Now he's crossed into Cambodia...

900
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:29,655
...and he kept winning it his way...

901
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:31,665
...with this Montagnard army of his...

902
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:32,833
...and they called me in.

903
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:38,212
...man like a god. And follow every order,
however ridiculous.

904
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:45,219
They lost him. He was gone.

905
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,557
Nothing but rumors
and random intelligence,

906
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:51,684
mostly from captured VC.

907
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:57,106
The VC knew his name by now,
and they were scared of him.

908
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:01,402
He and his men were playing hit and run,
all the way into Cambodia.

909
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,361
I know where I'm going.
I'm going to the White House

910
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:14,782
to have dinner with
the President of the United States, baby.

911
01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:16,124
That's where I'm going.

912
01:19:17,251 --> 01:19:19,127
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.

913
01:19:20,963 --> 01:19:22,130
Clean.

914
01:19:26,427 --> 01:19:30,180
- How long has that kid been on this boat?
- Seven months.

915
01:19:31,265 --> 01:19:33,808
He's really specializing in busting my balls.

916
01:19:34,643 --> 01:19:36,811
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same of you.

917
01:19:37,688 --> 01:19:40,398
Yeah? What do you think, Chief?

918
01:19:41,191 --> 01:19:42,233
I don't think.

919
01:19:43,485 --> 01:19:46,404
My orders say I'm not supposed to know
where I'm taking this boat, so I don't!

920
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:50,491
But one look at you,
and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

921
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:05,213
We're going upriver
about 75 klicks above the Do Luong bridge.

922
01:20:09,844 --> 01:20:12,846
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

923
01:20:13,889 --> 01:20:16,808
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

924
01:20:19,353 --> 01:20:22,522
You just get me close to my destination,
and I'll cut you and the crew loose.

925
01:20:26,193 --> 01:20:27,693
All right, Captain.

926
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:50,841
"Dear Son,

927
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,461
"I'm afraid that both you and your mother

928
01:20:53,561 --> 01:20:56,345
"will have been worried at not hearing
from me during the past weeks.

929
01:20:57,431 --> 01:20:59,891
"But my situation here
has become a difficult one.

930
01:21:01,435 --> 01:21:04,187
"I have been officially accused of murder
by the Army.

931
01:21:11,653 --> 01:21:14,489
"The alleged victims
were four Vietnamese double agents.

932
01:21:15,073 --> 01:21:18,075
"We spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence.

933
01:21:20,829 --> 01:21:24,748
"When absolute proof was completed,
we acted, we acted like soldiers.

934
01:21:26,292 --> 01:21:28,084
"The charges are unjustified.

935
01:21:28,878 --> 01:21:34,257
"They are, in fact, and in the circumstances
of this conflict, quite completely insane.

936
01:21:45,353 --> 01:21:48,605
"In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action.

937
01:21:50,273 --> 01:21:54,777
"There are many moments for ruthless
action, what is often called ruthless,

938
01:21:55,737 --> 01:21:58,489
"what may, in many circumstances,
be only clarity.

939
01:21:59,324 --> 01:22:01,609
"Seeing clearly what there is
to be done and doing it."

940
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:02,735
Medevac, come in.

941
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,530
"...directly, quickly, awake..."

942
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,240
Alpha Tango Tango. Echo Tango Alpha...

943
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:08,950
- "...looking at it."
...request dust-off.

944
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,868
Three, maybe four KIAs. Over.

945
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:13,712
"I will trust you to tell your mother
what you choose about this letter.

946
01:22:14,422 --> 01:22:17,999
"As for the charges against me,
I am unconcerned."

947
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,099
Medevac, come in.

948
01:22:19,844 --> 01:22:23,797
"I am beyond their timid, lying morality.
And so I am beyond caring."

949
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,465
Medevac, do you read? Over.

950
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:28,935
"You have all my faith. Your loving father."

951
01:22:49,289 --> 01:22:50,455
Jesus.

952
01:22:50,582 --> 01:22:52,791
No wonder I couldn't get them on the radio.

953
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:54,793
What a dump.

954
01:22:59,549 --> 01:23:01,008
- Hi, there!
- How you doing?

955
01:23:01,301 --> 01:23:05,004
Wow. That's a nice little boat you got there.
Never seen one up here before.

956
01:23:05,104 --> 01:23:08,473
You know, we called in a request
for a medevac. You guys receive it?

957
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,601
Medevac? No.

958
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:14,228
Yeah, we passed
a downed Huey with some KIAs.

959
01:23:14,354 --> 01:23:16,188
- On your way here?
- Yeah.

960
01:23:16,565 --> 01:23:19,317
- You going up this river?
- Way up.

961
01:23:19,776 --> 01:23:24,113
- Way upriver? Forget it.
- Why? Why?

962
01:23:24,781 --> 01:23:27,025
Well, we want to send
some people downriver.

963
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:29,611
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?

964
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:33,164
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.

965
01:23:40,379 --> 01:23:42,122
- Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?

966
01:23:42,222 --> 01:23:43,624
Why don't you see
what you can do with that engine?

967
01:23:43,724 --> 01:23:45,383
- I'm gonna have a look around.
- All right.

968
01:23:45,843 --> 01:23:47,510
Hey, don't leave without me.

969
01:24:10,492 --> 01:24:14,203
- Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
- Don't ask me, man.

970
01:24:35,349 --> 01:24:37,600
Give me my clothes back, asshole!

971
01:24:41,188 --> 01:24:42,188
Asshole!

972
01:24:47,945 --> 01:24:50,029
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

973
01:24:51,156 --> 01:24:53,866
He stepped on a land mine
about two months ago.

974
01:24:54,326 --> 01:24:57,278
- Got all blown to hell.
- Who's in charge here?

975
01:24:57,378 --> 01:25:00,873
Charge? I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.

976
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:04,576
Just doing what I'm told.
Shit, I'm just a working girl.

977
01:25:04,676 --> 01:25:06,545
What about you, fella?

978
01:25:07,588 --> 01:25:10,632
Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam.
You mark my words.

979
01:25:10,842 --> 01:25:13,293
- Keep it in that condition.
- Hey, get off my back. Get off my back.

980
01:25:13,393 --> 01:25:14,845
- No, man, I'm telling you.
- Lay off!

981
01:25:17,557 --> 01:25:20,475
Hey, hey, come here!

982
01:25:20,977 --> 01:25:23,353
Is that your boat? Come on inside.

983
01:25:25,356 --> 01:25:26,557
What do you want?

984
01:25:26,657 --> 01:25:29,316
Come on inside. I want to talk to you.
Come on!

985
01:25:32,696 --> 01:25:34,113
Get out of the rain.

986
01:25:34,531 --> 01:25:35,573
Get off me!

987
01:25:36,825 --> 01:25:39,285
Come on. Cut this shit. Hey, Chef. Come on.

988
01:25:40,287 --> 01:25:43,330
Hey, how you doing, Captain?
I want you to meet some people.

989
01:25:45,667 --> 01:25:49,912
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit, Chef. Your ass is shit.

990
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:51,839
You're a motherfucker, man.

991
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,136
What a motherfucker, man!

992
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:02,348
God damn, my ear, you motherfucker!

993
01:26:04,977 --> 01:26:07,604
Get him off me, Chef! You smartass.

994
01:26:09,774 --> 01:26:11,024
Hey, guys.

995
01:26:12,109 --> 01:26:14,019
I got you! I got your ass!

996
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:17,197
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas.

997
01:26:19,158 --> 01:26:20,700
- You pulled my fucking...
- Guys.

998
01:26:22,036 --> 01:26:24,286
I just made a deal
with the people from Hau Phat.

999
01:26:25,205 --> 01:26:28,624
I negotiated two barrels of fuel
for a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1000
01:26:36,674 --> 01:26:37,966
Captain!

1001
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:41,128
Hey, hey, you shitting me?

1002
01:26:41,228 --> 01:26:44,515
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of barrels
and get up to that big tent.

1003
01:26:44,849 --> 01:26:46,058
Come on!

1004
01:26:48,019 --> 01:26:49,228
Captain.

1005
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:53,439
You're giving away our fuel
for a Playmate of the Month?

1006
01:26:53,607 --> 01:26:56,275
Nope. Playmate of the Year, Chief.

1007
01:26:56,693 --> 01:26:58,694
Warm them up, baby! Warm them up!

1008
01:26:59,404 --> 01:27:01,147
Warm them up.

1009
01:27:01,247 --> 01:27:03,950
Captain, we get in a firefight
and run out of fuel,

1010
01:27:04,409 --> 01:27:06,077
I want you to tell me how she was.

1011
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:10,248
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1012
01:27:14,753 --> 01:27:17,421
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?

1013
01:27:20,258 --> 01:27:22,884
Forget it, Captain. I'll stay with the boat.

1014
01:27:24,303 --> 01:27:26,304
Hey, Captain, give me a hand.

1015
01:27:48,618 --> 01:27:53,990
I got every one of your pictures.
I got the centerfold, the Playmates Review,

1016
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:58,460
the Playmate of the Year runoff.
I even got the calendar.

1017
01:27:58,795 --> 01:28:00,754
Hey, oiseau.

1018
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,799
Wait, how come you got a bird?

1019
01:28:04,259 --> 01:28:06,427
I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.

1020
01:28:07,137 --> 01:28:09,722
- Busch Gardens?
- Yeah, I used to train birds there.

1021
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:16,561
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.

1022
01:28:16,812 --> 01:28:18,271
Is it coming?

1023
01:28:25,362 --> 01:28:28,198
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.

1024
01:28:28,991 --> 01:28:31,201
He's not one of my regular birds.

1025
01:28:32,995 --> 01:28:36,623
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1026
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:43,420
Being Playmate of the Year
is the loneliest experience I can imagine.

1027
01:28:44,923 --> 01:28:50,344
It's like you try to express
your feelings to someone

1028
01:28:51,721 --> 01:28:53,013
and show them your heart...

1029
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,850
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.

1030
01:29:02,065 --> 01:29:05,776
But would you just mind
putting this black wig on for me, please?

1031
01:29:06,694 --> 01:29:11,322
And there's this glass wall between you,
this invisible glass,

1032
01:29:11,949 --> 01:29:14,700
and they can see your mouth moving.

1033
01:29:14,993 --> 01:29:17,278
I used to train birds for at least two years...

1034
01:29:17,378 --> 01:29:18,613
- That's beautiful, yeah.
...at Busch Gardens.

1035
01:29:18,713 --> 01:29:20,949
This was cascading
over your right shoulder,

1036
01:29:21,049 --> 01:29:22,750
and this, this was open here.

1037
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,586
But they can't hear what you're saying.

1038
01:29:26,588 --> 01:29:30,792
I used to train them to stand on their head
and fly upside down and ride little bicycles.

1039
01:29:30,892 --> 01:29:32,301
Your right hand was kind of over there.

1040
01:29:33,262 --> 01:29:36,179
- Hey, Chef!
- Hey, come on, get out of here, man!

1041
01:29:37,056 --> 01:29:39,633
- Later! Later!
- Does he want to talk to you?

1042
01:29:39,733 --> 01:29:40,759
Give me 15 minutes.

1043
01:29:40,859 --> 01:29:44,729
You can never really make them hear
what you're trying to say.

1044
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:46,723
You okay with kind of bending?

1045
01:29:46,823 --> 01:29:48,733
That's it. Yeah, your ass was sticking out
just a little...

1046
01:29:49,193 --> 01:29:50,485
Hey, man, fuck off!

1047
01:29:50,695 --> 01:29:51,736
Fifteen minutes!

1048
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,532
That's why I tried so desperately

1049
01:29:56,409 --> 01:30:00,245
to show somebody that I had some talent.

1050
01:30:00,413 --> 01:30:03,664
Little baby macaws.
Have you ever seen a baby macaw?

1051
01:30:04,124 --> 01:30:05,533
- That's kind of...
- They're all blue.

1052
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:07,668
- Come on, man! Take off, would you?
- Open up!

1053
01:30:08,378 --> 01:30:10,170
I got my rights, man!

1054
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,499
They make you do things
that you don't want to do.

1055
01:30:13,599 --> 01:30:17,761
Like... Like this picture here.

1056
01:30:20,307 --> 01:30:23,309
I started feeling repulsed with myself.

1057
01:30:24,394 --> 01:30:25,803
You were just kind of bending forward.

1058
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:27,938
...really, really cute.
- Your ass, kind of out a bit.

1059
01:30:28,064 --> 01:30:30,356
- I love training birds.
- That's it.

1060
01:30:30,733 --> 01:30:33,901
That's it. That's it. VoilÃ !

1061
01:30:35,154 --> 01:30:37,572
You're beautiful. I just want to...

1062
01:30:39,783 --> 01:30:45,830
You know, I can't believe it. Me, Jay Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here, you know?

1063
01:30:46,415 --> 01:30:50,535
Maybe I'm unfit to have a relationship

1064
01:30:50,635 --> 01:30:54,964
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1065
01:30:55,632 --> 01:30:59,009
Just think, if it hadn't been
for the Vietnam War,

1066
01:30:59,135 --> 01:31:02,679
- I never would've met you, Miss December.
- Miss May.

1067
01:31:04,057 --> 01:31:09,478
I wish... I wish I could find just one person

1068
01:31:12,899 --> 01:31:14,983
that could share my point of view.

1069
01:31:22,283 --> 01:31:23,784
You kiss like a bird!

1070
01:31:24,285 --> 01:31:26,577
God! Kiss me, kiss me.

1071
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:28,621
Who is that?

1072
01:31:28,997 --> 01:31:31,165
You're driving me crazy! Kiss me!

1073
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:34,668
- Oh, my God.
- I love birds!

1074
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,841
You finished yet?

1075
01:31:42,386 --> 01:31:43,928
Holy fuck!

1076
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:50,851
Make like a bird! Make like a bird!
Fly, baby! Cockatoo me!

1077
01:31:51,186 --> 01:31:53,895
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!

1078
01:31:54,063 --> 01:31:56,598
- Fly like an eagle!
- It drives me crazy!

1079
01:31:56,698 --> 01:31:58,441
It drives me crazy!

1080
01:32:08,244 --> 01:32:11,204
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1081
01:32:14,542 --> 01:32:19,329
Lance, there were things
that they made me do

1082
01:32:19,429 --> 01:32:20,913
that I didn't want to do.

1083
01:32:21,013 --> 01:32:24,750
They said,
"Pull the ribbons between your legs,"

1084
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:27,136
and I didn't want to do it,

1085
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:31,098
but they said that was
what was expected of me,

1086
01:32:31,266 --> 01:32:33,559
that that's what people wanted to see.

1087
01:32:55,747 --> 01:32:58,833
- Who are you?
- I'm next, ma'am.

1088
01:33:00,752 --> 01:33:02,295
Hell, I didn't know he was a cherry.

1089
01:33:02,421 --> 01:33:05,206
- Didn't know you never got no pussy.
- Shove it, fuck-up!

1090
01:33:05,306 --> 01:33:08,426
Sure sorry about that. If I had known,
I'd have taken you to New Orleans...

1091
01:33:08,802 --> 01:33:11,129
- Man, fuck you.
...introduce you to cooze, Bubba!

1092
01:33:11,229 --> 01:33:14,140
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy. Cherry boy.

1093
01:33:15,349 --> 01:33:16,884
You're a fucking dog!

1094
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:20,061
Come on down to New Orleans, Bubba,
and I'll get you fixed up, you prick.

1095
01:33:20,313 --> 01:33:21,354
Lay off, Chef.

1096
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:24,141
You're the only fucking prick
I see around here.

1097
01:33:24,241 --> 01:33:26,693
If I want to play with a prick,
I'll play with my own!

1098
01:33:27,069 --> 01:33:28,979
- Lay off, Chef!
- What are you gonna do with it, cherry boy?

1099
01:33:29,079 --> 01:33:31,072
- Fucking cherry boy!
- Chef, I said lay off!

1100
01:33:31,616 --> 01:33:34,159
Chef, knock it off! Give him a break!

1101
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:37,954
What do you think I said?
And give your jaws a rest!

1102
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:41,374
And this ain't the Army. You are a sailor!

1103
01:33:42,417 --> 01:33:46,128
So get out of that frizzly Army-looking shirt
and stop smoking that dope!

1104
01:33:46,463 --> 01:33:47,463
You hear me?

1105
01:33:52,219 --> 01:33:54,803
Lance, what's with all the green paint?

1106
01:33:55,013 --> 01:33:56,847
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

1107
01:33:57,515 --> 01:33:59,099
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1108
01:33:59,851 --> 01:34:02,853
I want you to stay awake up there, man.
You got a job to do.

1109
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:23,831
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

1110
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:26,793
Let's take a look. Lance.

1111
01:34:27,002 --> 01:34:30,046
Bring them in.
Clean, on the .60. Chef, get a .16.

1112
01:34:31,131 --> 01:34:32,840
Clean, get on that .60!

1113
01:34:36,136 --> 01:34:37,177
What's up, Chief?

1114
01:34:39,514 --> 01:34:41,682
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1115
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:44,810
Well, let's forget routine now
and let them go.

1116
01:34:45,103 --> 01:34:47,312
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1117
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:48,855
I'm gonna take a look.

1118
01:34:50,525 --> 01:34:52,101
Chief, my mission's got priority here.

1119
01:34:52,201 --> 01:34:54,653
Hell, you wouldn't even be
in this part of the river if it wasn't for me.

1120
01:34:55,697 --> 01:34:58,365
Until we reach your destination, Captain,
you're just on for the ride.

1121
01:34:59,951 --> 01:35:02,703
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on, throw the rope, asshole.

1122
01:35:02,829 --> 01:35:05,037
All right. Come on. Let's bring it over.

1123
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:21,220
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1124
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:30,896
Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker! Move it!

1125
01:35:33,566 --> 01:35:35,734
- You two, come on.
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.

1126
01:35:36,068 --> 01:35:37,277
I got you, Chief.

1127
01:35:41,657 --> 01:35:42,866
It's clear, Chief.

1128
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:52,075
Okay, that's them. That's them.

1129
01:35:52,175 --> 01:35:53,752
- They're okay.
- Board and search it.

1130
01:35:55,212 --> 01:35:56,955
It's just a fucking boat.
There ain't nothing on it, Chief.

1131
01:35:57,055 --> 01:35:58,332
Board it and search it.

1132
01:35:58,432 --> 01:36:00,758
Just some baskets and some ducks,
fucking bananas.

1133
01:36:01,301 --> 01:36:02,885
- Ain't nothing on it.
- Don't be ashamed, Chef.

1134
01:36:03,011 --> 01:36:04,045
What's wrong with you?
Go on and search it.

1135
01:36:04,145 --> 01:36:06,263
There's a goat and some fish.

1136
01:36:07,057 --> 01:36:08,466
- Chef!
- Bunch of fucking vegetables.

1137
01:36:08,566 --> 01:36:10,801
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothing on it, man!

1138
01:36:10,901 --> 01:36:12,436
- Get on it!
- All right!

1139
01:36:13,104 --> 01:36:15,064
Move it, asshole! God damn it!

1140
01:36:15,398 --> 01:36:18,100
Just some pigs. Look, mangos.

1141
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,186
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fucking rice.

1142
01:36:20,286 --> 01:36:22,905
- Look in there, Chef. Look in it.
- Some fucking fish.

1143
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:26,783
More coconuts. Rice. Here's rice.

1144
01:36:28,285 --> 01:36:29,660
What's in that vegetable basket?

1145
01:36:30,287 --> 01:36:31,746
Get out of here! Come on!

1146
01:36:32,039 --> 01:36:34,999
- Get over there, God damn it.
- Chef, check that vegetable basket.

1147
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:36,534
- All right!
- Shut up, slope.

1148
01:36:36,634 --> 01:36:38,536
- There ain't nothing in here.
- What's in the boxes?

1149
01:36:38,636 --> 01:36:39,662
Not a fucking thing.

1150
01:36:39,762 --> 01:36:41,081
- Look in that tin can.
- Nothing.

1151
01:36:41,181 --> 01:36:43,541
- That rusty can.
- Just fucking rice, that's all!

1152
01:36:43,641 --> 01:36:44,834
- There ain't nothing on it!
- Check the yellow can.

1153
01:36:44,934 --> 01:36:47,220
Check the yellow can.
She was sitting on it. What's in it?

1154
01:36:51,683 --> 01:36:52,683
Chef!

1155
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,688
Motherfuckers!

1156
01:37:07,824 --> 01:37:09,741
- Hold it!
- Come on, let's kill them all.

1157
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:12,994
- Fucking cocksucking mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1158
01:37:13,121 --> 01:37:15,739
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit out of all of them.

1159
01:37:15,839 --> 01:37:19,000
- Chef, hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

1160
01:37:19,961 --> 01:37:22,086
Why the fuck not?

1161
01:37:23,547 --> 01:37:25,131
- Clean?
- I'm good.

1162
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:35,925
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1163
01:37:36,025 --> 01:37:38,060
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding, huh?

1164
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,105
- You all right?
- See what she was running for?

1165
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:49,310
It's a fucking puppy.

1166
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,774
Give me that dog!

1167
01:37:52,874 --> 01:37:54,693
- No, you're not gonna get it!
- Fucking give it to me!

1168
01:37:54,793 --> 01:37:56,619
Give me the fucking dog, asshole!

1169
01:37:57,037 --> 01:38:00,707
- Fuck you! Fucking mango, too!
- Chef.

1170
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:02,329
You want that?

1171
01:38:02,429 --> 01:38:04,544
Chef, she's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1172
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:06,663
- Chef!
- Yes!

1173
01:38:06,763 --> 01:38:08,457
She's moving behind you. Check her out!

1174
01:38:08,557 --> 01:38:10,216
All right. All right.

1175
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:12,627
Come on, Clean, God damn it.
Give me a hand.

1176
01:38:12,727 --> 01:38:14,596
She's not dead, she's wounded.
Clean, give him a hand.

1177
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:19,057
Just take it easy. Take it easy.
Slow down and take it easy.

1178
01:38:19,726 --> 01:38:21,594
All right, Chef, just wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Chef.

1179
01:38:21,694 --> 01:38:23,061
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing, Chef?

1180
01:38:23,354 --> 01:38:26,607
- She's hurt. She's bleeding.
- Man.

1181
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:29,234
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

1182
01:38:29,944 --> 01:38:31,028
What are you talking about?

1183
01:38:31,446 --> 01:38:32,813
We're taking her
to some friendlies, Captain.

1184
01:38:32,913 --> 01:38:34,406
She's wounded, she's not dead.

1185
01:38:34,908 --> 01:38:36,700
- Get out of there, Chef.
- The book says, Captain...

1186
01:38:48,253 --> 01:38:50,546
Fuck you. Fuck him.

1187
01:38:51,256 --> 01:38:52,965
I told you not to stop. Now let's go.

1188
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,944
It was the way we had over here
of living with ourselves.

1189
01:39:58,321 --> 01:40:01,240
We'd cut them in half with a machine gun
and give them a Band-Aid.

1190
01:40:03,827 --> 01:40:10,665
It was a lie, and the more I saw of them,
the more I hated lies.

1191
01:40:13,168 --> 01:40:17,171
Those boys were never gonna look at me
the same way again.

1192
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:20,458
But I felt like I knew
one or two things about Kurtz

1193
01:40:20,558 --> 01:40:22,760
that weren't in the dossier.

1194
01:40:27,808 --> 01:40:31,894
Do Luong bridge was the last Army outpost
on the Nung River.

1195
01:40:36,232 --> 01:40:38,567
Beyond that, there was only Kurtz.

1196
01:40:40,695 --> 01:40:44,323
Lance! Hey, Lance, what do you think?

1197
01:40:44,907 --> 01:40:45,949
It's beautiful.

1198
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:50,746
I mean, what's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.

1199
01:40:51,789 --> 01:40:54,374
Hey, you know that last tab of acid
I was saving?

1200
01:40:54,792 --> 01:40:57,294
- Yeah.
- I dropped it.

1201
01:40:57,462 --> 01:40:59,504
You dropped acid? Far out.

1202
01:41:12,059 --> 01:41:15,311
- Take me home.
- God damn you!

1203
01:41:24,863 --> 01:41:26,663
God damn!

1204
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,366
You'll get what you deserve!

1205
01:41:37,583 --> 01:41:40,327
Is there a Captain Willard onboard?

1206
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:41,787
- Yeah!
- Captain Willard?

1207
01:41:41,887 --> 01:41:44,706
- Yeah, who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1208
01:41:44,806 --> 01:41:46,383
Get that light off me.

1209
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:50,837
I was sent here from Nha Trang with these
three days ago, sir.

1210
01:41:50,937 --> 01:41:54,099
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1211
01:41:54,558 --> 01:41:56,342
You don't know
how happy this makes me, sir.

1212
01:41:56,442 --> 01:41:58,094
- Why?
- Now I can get out of here,

1213
01:41:58,194 --> 01:41:59,770
if I can find a way.

1214
01:42:03,775 --> 01:42:06,485
You're in the asshole of the world, Captain!

1215
01:42:11,241 --> 01:42:13,025
Captain, where you going?

1216
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:15,786
See if I can find some fuel,
get some information.

1217
01:42:17,288 --> 01:42:21,200
- Pick me up on the other side of the bridge.
- Somebody go with him. Chef!

1218
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:24,127
I'll go. I wanna go.

1219
01:42:38,934 --> 01:42:40,476
You get your ass in gear.

1220
01:43:16,345 --> 01:43:19,597
Come on, man. Listen to the music, man.

1221
01:43:20,056 --> 01:43:23,926
- Where can I find the CO?
- You came right to it, son of a bitch!

1222
01:43:24,026 --> 01:43:27,354
Lance! Get down here!

1223
01:43:30,317 --> 01:43:34,361
- You still got a Commanding Officer here?
- Beverly Hills.

1224
01:43:34,696 --> 01:43:35,696
What?

1225
01:43:35,947 --> 01:43:40,735
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills.

1226
01:43:40,835 --> 01:43:43,412
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1227
01:44:18,571 --> 01:44:21,482
- God damn it, you stepped in my face!
- We thought you were dead.

1228
01:44:21,582 --> 01:44:23,408
Well, you thought wrong, damn it.

1229
01:44:27,247 --> 01:44:29,323
I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I?

1230
01:44:29,423 --> 01:44:31,208
You think you're so bad, nigga?

1231
01:44:31,751 --> 01:44:33,118
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1232
01:44:33,218 --> 01:44:35,754
Gooks.
What the fuck you think I'm shooting at?

1233
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:38,582
I'm sorry, sir.
There are gooks out there by the wire,

1234
01:44:38,682 --> 01:44:40,333
but I think I killed them all.

1235
01:44:40,433 --> 01:44:42,426
You ain't shot shit, man. Listen!

1236
01:44:44,346 --> 01:44:47,265
Shit, he's trying to call his friends, man.
Send up a flare.

1237
01:44:55,899 --> 01:44:58,059
You think you're so bad, nigga?
You think you bad, huh?

1238
01:44:58,159 --> 01:44:59,394
They're all dead, stupid.

1239
01:44:59,494 --> 01:45:01,946
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1240
01:45:02,447 --> 01:45:04,949
Who's the Commanding Officer here?

1241
01:45:05,117 --> 01:45:06,450
Ain't you?

1242
01:45:08,619 --> 01:45:12,455
You think you're so bad, huh?
I got something for your ass now, nigga!

1243
01:45:12,582 --> 01:45:14,332
I got something for you now!

1244
01:45:16,586 --> 01:45:18,295
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1245
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:22,541
- Go get the roach, man.
- Go get the roach, man.

1246
01:45:22,641 --> 01:45:26,094
- Go get the roach, nigga!
- I'm gonna go get the roach.

1247
01:45:30,433 --> 01:45:34,019
Roach. Roach. Roach.

1248
01:45:34,812 --> 01:45:37,438
Got slopes on the wire, man.
Do you hear them?

1249
01:45:37,606 --> 01:45:40,274
- Lance!
- Do you hear them?

1250
01:45:44,821 --> 01:45:46,280
Go bust them!

1251
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,161
Hey, GI, fuck you!

1252
01:46:01,588 --> 01:46:03,838
You hear him out there on the wire, man?

1253
01:46:04,673 --> 01:46:07,959
- Yeah.
- I'll kill you, GI!

1254
01:46:08,059 --> 01:46:09,135
You need a flare?

1255
01:46:11,138 --> 01:46:11,738
No.

1256
01:46:13,766 --> 01:46:15,600
He's close, man.

1257
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:18,186
He's real close.

1258
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:42,641
GI, fuck you!

1259
01:46:52,637 --> 01:46:54,096
Motherfucker.

1260
01:46:55,223 --> 01:46:57,140
Hey, soldier,

1261
01:47:01,103 --> 01:47:03,062
do you know who's in command here?

1262
01:47:05,857 --> 01:47:06,857
Yeah.

1263
01:47:22,082 --> 01:47:23,082
Shit!

1264
01:47:28,087 --> 01:47:31,373
Yo, Chief, man,
two guys just got blown off that bridge.

1265
01:47:31,473 --> 01:47:34,009
You hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.

1266
01:47:38,264 --> 01:47:40,090
- What's that?
- Mail, man.

1267
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:42,851
Later on the mail! Watch them trees.

1268
01:47:45,187 --> 01:47:47,731
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1269
01:47:47,857 --> 01:47:49,433
Let's move out.

1270
01:47:49,533 --> 01:47:54,069
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1271
01:47:55,572 --> 01:47:59,241
- Let's just get going.
- Which way, Captain?

1272
01:48:05,331 --> 01:48:07,332
You know which way, Chief.

1273
01:48:08,126 --> 01:48:09,918
You're on your own, Captain.

1274
01:48:11,337 --> 01:48:12,629
Do you wanna go on?

1275
01:48:13,131 --> 01:48:17,334
Like this bridge, we build it every night,
Charlie blows it right back up again

1276
01:48:17,434 --> 01:48:20,094
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1277
01:48:20,637 --> 01:48:22,138
Think about it.

1278
01:48:25,225 --> 01:48:27,643
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1279
01:48:32,149 --> 01:48:34,525
Chef, on the bow.

1280
01:48:35,694 --> 01:48:37,570
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go.

1281
01:49:34,334 --> 01:49:35,793
Whose package is that?

1282
01:49:36,044 --> 01:49:40,214
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit. Wait a minute, is that it?

1283
01:49:40,549 --> 01:49:42,257
- That's it for you.
- Lance!

1284
01:49:43,092 --> 01:49:45,385
Mr. L.B. Johnson, there you go.

1285
01:49:46,929 --> 01:49:49,881
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waiting for this one.

1286
01:49:49,981 --> 01:49:52,642
I got another one, got a box from Eva.

1287
01:49:53,519 --> 01:49:56,062
"Lance, I'm fine. I'm fine, Lance.

1288
01:49:56,438 --> 01:50:00,233
"Sue and I went tripping to Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1289
01:50:00,401 --> 01:50:03,395
- Man, I want to get back to Antoine's.
- "Of course I remember the time we went..."

1290
01:50:03,495 --> 01:50:06,072
How could I fucking forget, man? Beautiful.

1291
01:50:07,158 --> 01:50:09,692
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1292
01:50:09,792 --> 01:50:11,026
"Let me know."

1293
01:50:11,126 --> 01:50:14,580
Jim, it's here. It really is here.

1294
01:50:19,085 --> 01:50:21,412
"There has been a new development
regarding your mission

1295
01:50:21,512 --> 01:50:23,873
"which we must now communicate to you.

1296
01:50:23,973 --> 01:50:25,966
"Months ago,
a man was ordered on a mission

1297
01:50:26,092 --> 01:50:27,634
"which was identical to yours.

1298
01:50:28,303 --> 01:50:31,930
"We have reason to believe
that he is now operating with Colonel Kurtz.

1299
01:50:33,766 --> 01:50:37,393
"Saigon was carrying him MIA
for his family's sake.

1300
01:50:37,603 --> 01:50:39,604
"They assumed he was dead.

1301
01:50:40,022 --> 01:50:43,107
"Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife."

1302
01:50:47,404 --> 01:50:49,447
Captain Richard Colby,

1303
01:50:51,366 --> 01:50:53,034
he was with Kurtz.

1304
01:50:54,453 --> 01:50:55,620
Disneyland.

1305
01:50:56,496 --> 01:50:59,123
Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.

1306
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:02,410
"Charles Miller Manson
ordered the slaughter

1307
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:05,787
"of all in the home anyway
as a symbol of protest."

1308
01:51:05,887 --> 01:51:06,963
That's really weird, ain't it?

1309
01:51:08,549 --> 01:51:11,259
- Purple haze, look.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1310
01:51:11,636 --> 01:51:15,096
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Chief, rainbow reality, man.

1311
01:51:15,348 --> 01:51:17,474
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.

1312
01:51:17,808 --> 01:51:20,644
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1313
01:51:21,479 --> 01:51:24,272
She pictures me at home
having a beer and watching TV.

1314
01:51:26,234 --> 01:51:27,567
Hey, Lance, man.

1315
01:51:28,236 --> 01:51:29,945
Hot potato! Hot potato!

1316
01:51:30,738 --> 01:51:32,521
I'm so glad you decided to join...

1317
01:51:32,621 --> 01:51:35,574
Eva's not sure if she can
have a relationship with me, you know?

1318
01:51:36,534 --> 01:51:42,164
Here I am, 13,000 fucking miles away,
trying to keep a relationship open, my ass.

1319
01:51:42,791 --> 01:51:45,876
That's much more than I can say
for some of your friends.

1320
01:51:46,294 --> 01:51:49,789
If this tape is any good,
I will have Dad and the family

1321
01:51:49,889 --> 01:51:52,841
- send you a tape of their own...
- Hey, Lance.

1322
01:52:11,610 --> 01:52:12,735
There! Over there!

1323
01:52:15,322 --> 01:52:17,782
Motherfuckers!

1324
01:52:28,334 --> 01:52:29,793
There! Over there!

1325
01:52:33,423 --> 01:52:35,340
Lance! Chef!

1326
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:43,849
- Chef, Chef, check out Clean!
- Captain, he's hit, he's hit! Clean's hit!

1327
01:52:44,392 --> 01:52:46,135
- Lance!
- Where'd the dog go?

1328
01:52:46,235 --> 01:52:49,062
Lance. Lance, check out Clean!

1329
01:52:49,522 --> 01:52:52,516
Where's the dog?
We got to go back to get the dog!

1330
01:52:52,616 --> 01:52:56,185
- Hey, Clean.
- It's always been nice to have...

1331
01:52:56,285 --> 01:52:58,446
Hey, Bubba!

1332
01:52:58,739 --> 01:53:02,858
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!

1333
01:53:02,958 --> 01:53:05,570
- And so, I'm hoping...
- Bubba!

1334
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:10,533
...that pretty soon,
not too soon, but pretty soon,

1335
01:53:10,633 --> 01:53:14,337
I'll have a lot of grandchildren
to love and spoil,

1336
01:53:14,921 --> 01:53:17,882
and then when your wife get them back,
she'll be mad with me.

1337
01:53:20,302 --> 01:53:25,597
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama will come
to celebrate your coming home.

1338
01:53:26,098 --> 01:53:28,258
Granny and Dad
are trying to get enough money

1339
01:53:28,358 --> 01:53:29,634
to get you a car.

1340
01:53:29,734 --> 01:53:33,271
But don't tell her, because that's our secret.

1341
01:53:34,648 --> 01:53:39,444
Anyhow, do the right thing,
stay out of the way of the bullets,

1342
01:53:39,987 --> 01:53:43,940
and bring your heinie home
all in one piece

1343
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:48,244
because we love you very much.
Love, Mama.

1344
01:53:56,628 --> 01:53:59,963
Oh, man. You're so young.

1345
01:54:07,639 --> 01:54:08,839
Clean.

1346
01:55:22,169 --> 01:55:23,377
Hold on.

1347
01:55:26,214 --> 01:55:28,007
Throw me the glasses.

1348
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:43,271
Lance, take the .16 on the bow.

1349
01:55:45,691 --> 01:55:48,943
Chef, Chef, on the .60.

1350
01:56:11,633 --> 01:56:12,883
Fuck me.

1351
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:51,796
Lance.

1352
01:57:21,659 --> 01:57:25,495
Cover the Captain.
Lance, cover the Captain.

1353
01:57:43,471 --> 01:57:45,180
They're French. They're French.

1354
01:57:46,725 --> 01:57:49,810
Chef, pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1355
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:51,854
Stand fast! Captain...

1356
01:58:27,263 --> 01:58:29,389
All right, you men, put down your weapons.

1357
01:59:18,437 --> 01:59:19,813
New Orleans.

1358
01:59:24,527 --> 01:59:26,361
We lost one of our men.

1359
01:59:30,074 --> 01:59:35,078
We French always pay respects
to the dead of our allies.

1360
01:59:36,789 --> 01:59:38,581
You are all welcome.

1361
01:59:41,335 --> 01:59:43,461
My name is Hubert de Marais.

1362
01:59:44,964 --> 01:59:47,214
This is my family's plantation.

1363
01:59:48,133 --> 01:59:50,300
It has been such for 70 years.

1364
01:59:52,303 --> 01:59:55,055
And it will be such until we are all dead.

1365
02:02:07,183 --> 02:02:12,646
Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller
on behalf of a grateful nation.

1366
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,537
This food is really wonderful, isn't it?
The wine, the sauces. I can't believe it.

1367
02:02:37,637 --> 02:02:39,589
Can I speak with the chef?

1368
02:02:39,798 --> 02:02:41,757
The chef speaks only Vietnamese.

1369
02:02:42,092 --> 02:02:46,045
No kidding. He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1370
02:02:46,145 --> 02:02:48,806
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.

1371
02:02:51,143 --> 02:02:52,643
Hey, Lance.

1372
02:03:21,422 --> 02:03:23,040
This is Baudelaire.

1373
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:26,208
It's a very cruel poem for children,
but they need it,

1374
02:03:26,308 --> 02:03:28,969
because life sometimes is very cruel.

1375
02:03:30,805 --> 02:03:32,431
As you can see...

1376
02:03:35,769 --> 02:03:39,605
- Attacks repelled by the family.
- Just for this war.

1377
02:03:40,106 --> 02:03:42,650
Viet Cong, 58.

1378
02:03:42,859 --> 02:03:44,693
North Vietnamese, 12.

1379
02:03:45,403 --> 02:03:47,279
South Vietnamese, 11.

1380
02:03:48,198 --> 02:03:49,990
Americans, six.

1381
02:03:51,534 --> 02:03:54,369
Yes, well, they were perhaps mistakes.

1382
02:04:15,557 --> 02:04:18,476
May I present Captain Willard?
He's of a paratroop regiment.

1383
02:04:19,061 --> 02:04:21,228
- Madame Sarrault.
- Captain.

1384
02:04:48,922 --> 02:04:51,833
I'm sorry, Captain.
Was just a little story about Paris

1385
02:04:51,933 --> 02:04:53,167
and people starving during the war.

1386
02:04:53,267 --> 02:04:55,336
They are around the table
and there was a silence.

1387
02:04:55,436 --> 02:04:57,972
Somebody says, "An angel is passing by."

1388
02:04:58,306 --> 02:05:00,975
So somebody said, "Let's eat it."

1389
02:05:09,109 --> 02:05:12,445
How long can you possibly stay here?

1390
02:05:12,863 --> 02:05:14,404
We stay forever.

1391
02:05:15,156 --> 02:05:16,906
No, no, I mean,

1392
02:05:18,576 --> 02:05:20,618
when will you go back home to France?

1393
02:05:23,831 --> 02:05:25,582
I mean, this is our home, Captain.

1394
02:05:26,125 --> 02:05:27,792
- Sooner or later you're gonna...
- No!

1395
02:05:29,962 --> 02:05:33,631
You don't understand our mentality,
the French Officer mentality.

1396
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:36,877
At first, we lose in Second World War.

1397
02:05:36,977 --> 02:05:39,763
I don't say that you Americans win,
but we lose.

1398
02:05:42,265 --> 02:05:45,134
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Nigeria, we lose.

1399
02:05:45,234 --> 02:05:47,019
In Indochina, we lose.

1400
02:05:47,687 --> 02:05:50,147
But here, we don't lose.

1401
02:05:50,815 --> 02:05:55,903
This piece of earth, we keep it!
We will never lose that, never!

1402
02:06:01,409 --> 02:06:03,160
The Americans,

1403
02:06:06,039 --> 02:06:08,639
in 1945, yes,

1404
02:06:09,416 --> 02:06:11,501
after the Japanese War,

1405
02:06:12,336 --> 02:06:14,746
your President Roosevelt
didn't want the French people

1406
02:06:14,846 --> 02:06:16,923
to stay in Indochina.

1407
02:06:18,842 --> 02:06:21,628
So, you Americans

1408
02:06:21,728 --> 02:06:23,679
invent the Viet Minh.

1409
02:06:25,682 --> 02:06:27,517
- What's he mean?
- Yeah, that's true.

1410
02:06:27,726 --> 02:06:30,186
The Viet Cong were invented
by the Americans, sir.

1411
02:06:31,522 --> 02:06:32,730
The Americans?

1412
02:06:33,357 --> 02:06:37,692
Now you take the French place,
and the Viet Minh fight you,

1413
02:06:38,277 --> 02:06:40,145
and what can you do?

1414
02:06:40,245 --> 02:06:42,697
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1415
02:06:42,865 --> 02:06:45,951
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1416
02:06:46,369 --> 02:06:48,370
The Russians want to help them.

1417
02:06:48,746 --> 02:06:51,373
"Come and give us some money.
We are all communists.

1418
02:06:51,707 --> 02:06:53,992
"Chinese, give us guns.
We are all brothers."

1419
02:06:54,092 --> 02:06:55,544
They hate the Chinese.

1420
02:06:56,420 --> 02:07:00,590
Maybe they hate Americans less
than the Russians and the Chinese.

1421
02:07:00,967 --> 02:07:02,668
I mean, if tomorrow
the Vietnamese are communists,

1422
02:07:02,768 --> 02:07:05,010
they will be Vietnamese communists.

1423
02:07:05,637 --> 02:07:08,347
And this is something
that you never understood, you Americans.

1424
02:07:09,057 --> 02:07:11,342
I don't know. Maybe in the future

1425
02:07:11,442 --> 02:07:13,894
we can make something with the Viet Minh.

1426
02:07:14,146 --> 02:07:15,729
Don't you understand?

1427
02:07:16,064 --> 02:07:18,774
The VC say, "Go away! Go away!"

1428
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:21,602
That's finished for all the white people
in Indochina.

1429
02:07:21,702 --> 02:07:24,864
If you're French, American,
that's all the same.

1430
02:07:25,073 --> 02:07:28,742
Go! They want to forget you. Look at them.

1431
02:07:30,871 --> 02:07:33,621
Look, this is the truth. An egg.

1432
02:07:36,792 --> 02:07:38,334
The white left.

1433
02:07:39,837 --> 02:07:41,713
The yellow stay.

1434
02:07:49,763 --> 02:07:50,922
When I was in Saigon,

1435
02:07:51,022 --> 02:07:54,759
I spoke to an American politician
and he explained it very well.

1436
02:07:54,859 --> 02:07:58,471
He said, "Look, yesterday it was Korea,

1437
02:07:58,571 --> 02:08:04,443
"today, Vietnam, tomorrow, Thailand,
the Philippines, and then maybe Europe."

1438
02:08:07,113 --> 02:08:08,230
Why not Europe?

1439
02:08:08,330 --> 02:08:10,699
Look what happened
in Czechoslovakia recently!

1440
02:08:10,867 --> 02:08:12,484
And even before the Second World War,

1441
02:08:12,584 --> 02:08:14,653
the Americans knew
exactly what was going on.

1442
02:08:14,753 --> 02:08:17,164
They don't want that shit to take over!

1443
02:08:20,084 --> 02:08:24,580
- All you white people are shit.
- They are fighting. Fighting for freedom.

1444
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:26,797
Freedom? Bullshit.

1445
02:08:27,174 --> 02:08:29,884
French bullshit. American bullshit.

1446
02:08:30,344 --> 02:08:32,053
Dien Bien Phu is a trap.

1447
02:08:32,888 --> 02:08:35,973
All soldiers know they are already dead.

1448
02:08:38,018 --> 02:08:39,936
You know anything about Dien Bien Phu?

1449
02:08:43,065 --> 02:08:47,018
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't, not really.

1450
02:08:47,118 --> 02:08:50,112
Dien Bien Phu was an error, you know?
A military mistake.

1451
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:53,907
A mistake? A voluntary mistake! Voluntary!

1452
02:08:56,619 --> 02:09:00,580
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.

1453
02:09:01,332 --> 02:09:03,075
Generals and colonels
believe it's impossible

1454
02:09:03,175 --> 02:09:07,462
for the Viets to get a cannon
up there in the mountains, but they do.

1455
02:09:08,214 --> 02:09:11,007
Then they wait for the rain to come.

1456
02:09:12,176 --> 02:09:16,221
When it comes, no airplane can fly there.

1457
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:22,051
And our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
I mean, you know, 90 meters, 70 meters...

1458
02:09:22,151 --> 02:09:25,312
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.

1459
02:09:25,897 --> 02:09:29,358
And they only do that
to be dead with their friends.

1460
02:09:31,361 --> 02:09:32,695
No, no!

1461
02:09:35,865 --> 02:09:38,033
The French army was sacrificed,

1462
02:09:38,243 --> 02:09:40,945
sacrificed by the politicians safe at home.

1463
02:09:41,045 --> 02:09:43,747
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1464
02:09:44,958 --> 02:09:48,451
The students are marching in Paris,
protesting, demonstrating.

1465
02:09:48,551 --> 02:09:50,670
They stab the soldiers in the back.

1466
02:09:50,796 --> 02:09:54,674
The soldier would open the grenade,
it wouldn't work.

1467
02:09:54,967 --> 02:09:56,759
A piece of paper would fall.

1468
02:09:59,138 --> 02:10:02,390
Union of French Women.
"We are for the Viets."

1469
02:10:02,683 --> 02:10:03,933
Traitors.

1470
02:10:04,393 --> 02:10:06,519
Communist traitors at home.

1471
02:10:07,938 --> 02:10:09,480
Dien Bien Phu...

1472
02:10:09,857 --> 02:10:12,400
Okay, the French is shit.

1473
02:10:14,528 --> 02:10:16,820
No one cares. No one wants to.

1474
02:10:19,449 --> 02:10:23,410
Why don't you Americans learn from us?
From our mistakes?

1475
02:10:23,745 --> 02:10:25,738
Mon dieu, with your army,
your strength, your power,

1476
02:10:25,838 --> 02:10:27,039
you can win if you want to.

1477
02:10:30,084 --> 02:10:31,501
You can win.

1478
02:10:34,714 --> 02:10:37,924
You know,
I'm sure we can make something there.

1479
02:10:38,676 --> 02:10:40,260
I'm sure about it, you know?

1480
02:10:40,803 --> 02:10:43,346
I never do something wrong
to the people here.

1481
02:10:43,930 --> 02:10:47,350
I'm sorry, you know, but the communists
at home have never been traitors.

1482
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:24,636
Excuse me. I have to go.
Captain, good night.

1483
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:27,547
- I was a socialist, you know?
- I know we can stay.

1484
02:11:27,647 --> 02:11:31,643
I know that we can stay. We can stay.

1485
02:11:34,563 --> 02:11:37,932
You know, we always help the people.

1486
02:11:38,032 --> 02:11:39,733
We work with the people.

1487
02:11:56,292 --> 02:12:00,421
See, Captain, when my grandfather

1488
02:12:01,881 --> 02:12:04,133
and my uncles and father came here,

1489
02:12:06,718 --> 02:12:09,303
there was nothing. Nothing.

1490
02:12:10,681 --> 02:12:12,849
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1491
02:12:14,768 --> 02:12:18,521
So, we worked hard, very hard.

1492
02:12:18,689 --> 02:12:23,484
We brought the rubber from Brazil
and then planted it here.

1493
02:12:24,403 --> 02:12:27,697
We took the Vietnamese, work with them,

1494
02:12:28,115 --> 02:12:29,449
make something.

1495
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,201
Something out of nothing.

1496
02:12:33,786 --> 02:12:37,456
So when you ask me
why we want to stay here, Captain,

1497
02:12:39,041 --> 02:12:41,452
we want to stay here because it's ours.

1498
02:12:41,552 --> 02:12:43,003
It belongs to us.

1499
02:12:43,713 --> 02:12:45,380
It keeps our family together.

1500
02:12:47,133 --> 02:12:49,134
I mean, we fight for that.

1501
02:12:51,053 --> 02:12:52,846
While you Americans,

1502
02:12:53,764 --> 02:12:58,643
you are fighting
for the biggest nothing in history.

1503
02:13:06,610 --> 02:13:08,360
I'm sorry, Captain.

1504
02:13:08,862 --> 02:13:13,574
I will see if your men
need any help to repair your boat

1505
02:13:13,867 --> 02:13:17,244
so that you can go on with your war.

1506
02:13:52,404 --> 02:13:55,072
I apologize for my family, Captain.

1507
02:13:57,116 --> 02:13:59,243
We have all lost much here.

1508
02:14:00,787 --> 02:14:03,872
Hubert, his wife and two sons.

1509
02:14:08,294 --> 02:14:10,462
And I have lost a husband.

1510
02:14:16,386 --> 02:14:20,180
- I understand.
- You are tired of the war.

1511
02:14:22,267 --> 02:14:24,392
I can see on your face.

1512
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:31,148
It was the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1513
02:14:32,359 --> 02:14:33,401
We call them...

1514
02:14:36,530 --> 02:14:38,322
"The lost soldiers."

1515
02:14:43,203 --> 02:14:45,746
If you like, we can have some cognac.

1516
02:14:50,501 --> 02:14:51,101
No.

1517
02:14:52,545 --> 02:14:55,505
I'll see about my men and...

1518
02:15:03,306 --> 02:15:05,890
The war will be still here tomorrow.

1519
02:15:16,652 --> 02:15:18,694
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1520
02:15:26,703 --> 02:15:29,371
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.

1521
02:15:30,624 --> 02:15:33,292
No, I don't drink wine.

1522
02:15:36,713 --> 02:15:41,216
I do like cognac,
but I don't want any now, thank you.

1523
02:15:44,845 --> 02:15:47,597
Well, then I must drink alone.

1524
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:01,277
Will you go back, after the war, to America?

1525
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:08,242
- No.
- Then you're like us.

1526
02:16:08,494 --> 02:16:10,161
Your home is here.

1527
02:16:27,762 --> 02:16:31,682
Do you know why you can never
step into the same river twice?

1528
02:16:33,935 --> 02:16:37,104
Yeah, 'cause it's always moving.

1529
02:16:38,523 --> 02:16:41,649
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.

1530
02:16:48,949 --> 02:16:53,244
It was the morphine he took
for the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1531
02:16:56,915 --> 02:17:00,543
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

1532
02:17:04,297 --> 02:17:05,965
And I said to him,

1533
02:17:06,717 --> 02:17:10,093
"There are two of you, don't you see?

1534
02:17:11,178 --> 02:17:14,806
"One that kills and one that loves."

1535
02:17:16,934 --> 02:17:18,601
And he said to me,

1536
02:17:19,478 --> 02:17:23,106
"I don't know whether
I am an animal or a god."

1537
02:17:26,569 --> 02:17:28,194
But you are both.

1538
02:18:10,068 --> 02:18:11,819
You want more?

1539
02:18:17,534 --> 02:18:21,370
All that matters is that you are alive.

1540
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:24,957
You are alive, Captain.

1541
02:18:29,253 --> 02:18:30,879
That's the truth.

1542
02:19:44,785 --> 02:19:48,288
There are two of you, don't you see?

1543
02:19:49,623 --> 02:19:53,792
One that kills and one that loves.

1544
02:20:23,155 --> 02:20:25,698
Can't see nothing. We're stopping.

1545
02:20:26,199 --> 02:20:28,568
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1546
02:20:28,668 --> 02:20:31,495
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

1547
02:20:32,247 --> 02:20:33,823
I ain't risking no more lives.

1548
02:20:33,923 --> 02:20:36,834
I'm in command here, God damn it.
You'll do what I say.

1549
02:20:39,004 --> 02:20:41,172
You see anything, Chef?

1550
02:20:43,175 --> 02:20:45,509
Why don't they fucking attack, man?

1551
02:21:04,737 --> 02:21:06,863
Watch it over here, Chief.

1552
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:09,658
Got a stump.

1553
02:21:11,077 --> 02:21:12,452
Lance, on the .50s.

1554
02:21:14,245 --> 02:21:16,038
He was close.

1555
02:21:18,083 --> 02:21:19,750
He was real close.

1556
02:21:22,045 --> 02:21:26,916
I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him,
as if the boat were being sucked upriver

1557
02:21:27,016 --> 02:21:29,885
and the water was flowing back
into the jungle.

1558
02:21:32,430 --> 02:21:34,840
Whatever was going to happen,

1559
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:38,894
it wasn't gonna be
the way they called it back in Nha Trang.

1560
02:21:43,565 --> 02:21:44,808
Arrows!

1561
02:21:44,908 --> 02:21:45,908
Fire!

1562
02:21:48,237 --> 02:21:49,487
Chef, open up! Fire!

1563
02:21:54,618 --> 02:21:56,577
Lance, fire!

1564
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:07,714
Chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing.

1565
02:22:08,215 --> 02:22:09,798
They're just little toy arrows.

1566
02:22:10,091 --> 02:22:12,009
Cut it out! Quiet!

1567
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:14,511
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!

1568
02:22:14,929 --> 02:22:17,264
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1569
02:22:17,682 --> 02:22:18,882
Quiet!

1570
02:22:20,059 --> 02:22:22,845
You got us in this mess,
and now you can't get us out

1571
02:22:22,945 --> 02:22:24,855
because you don't know
where the hell you're going, do you?

1572
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:26,606
Do you?

1573
02:22:27,608 --> 02:22:30,485
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1574
02:22:32,113 --> 02:22:34,448
- Lance, get the wheel!
- Fire!

1575
02:22:35,116 --> 02:22:38,659
You savages!
Come and get it, you son of a bitches!

1576
02:22:59,139 --> 02:23:00,739
A spear.

1577
02:24:20,259 --> 02:24:23,094
My mission is to make it up into Cambodia.

1578
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:26,171
There's a Green Beret colonel up there
who's gone insane

1579
02:24:26,271 --> 02:24:28,140
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1580
02:24:29,559 --> 02:24:32,227
That's fucking typical! Shit!

1581
02:24:32,603 --> 02:24:34,563
Fucking Vietnam mission!

1582
02:24:34,897 --> 02:24:38,642
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1583
02:24:38,742 --> 02:24:42,571
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1584
02:24:43,322 --> 02:24:46,199
Shit! That's fucking crazy.

1585
02:24:46,784 --> 02:24:49,744
I mean, I thought
you were going in to blow up a bridge

1586
02:24:49,871 --> 02:24:52,747
or some fucking railroad tracks
or something.

1587
02:24:53,748 --> 02:24:55,783
- Sorry.
- No, no, wait, wait.

1588
02:24:55,883 --> 02:24:59,162
We'll go together on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1589
02:24:59,262 --> 02:25:02,923
We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?

1590
02:26:09,989 --> 02:26:13,951
Part of me was afraid of what I would find
and what I would do when I got there.

1591
02:26:16,995 --> 02:26:21,457
I knew the risks, or imagined I knew.

1592
02:26:24,002 --> 02:26:28,172
But the thing I felt the most,
much stronger than fear,

1593
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,717
was the desire to confront him.

1594
02:27:44,413 --> 02:27:45,705
Just keep moving.

1595
02:27:46,415 --> 02:27:50,084
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1596
02:29:17,002 --> 02:29:20,171
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1597
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:24,592
I ain't coming in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1598
02:29:26,011 --> 02:29:29,263
Zap them with your siren, man.
Zap them with your siren.

1599
02:29:39,691 --> 02:29:41,525
There's mines over there
and mines over there, too.

1600
02:29:41,693 --> 02:29:44,153
And watch out. Those goddamn monkeys
bite you, I'll tell you.

1601
02:29:45,029 --> 02:29:47,531
That's a pretty one.
Move it right in toward me.

1602
02:29:48,950 --> 02:29:50,868
I'm an American. Yeah.

1603
02:29:51,161 --> 02:29:52,828
An American civilian. Hi, Yanks.

1604
02:29:53,538 --> 02:29:55,037
Hi, American.

1605
02:29:55,539 --> 02:29:56,956
American civilian. It's all right.

1606
02:29:57,708 --> 02:30:00,626
And you got the cigarettes.
And that's what I've been dreaming about.

1607
02:30:01,795 --> 02:30:02,795
Chef.

1608
02:30:03,630 --> 02:30:06,299
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1609
02:30:10,596 --> 02:30:12,221
I'm a photojournalist.

1610
02:30:12,890 --> 02:30:14,891
I've covered the war since '64.

1611
02:30:15,267 --> 02:30:17,810
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and Nam.

1612
02:30:22,482 --> 02:30:25,233
I'll tell you one thing,
this boat is a mess, man.

1613
02:30:26,235 --> 02:30:27,561
Who are all these people?

1614
02:30:27,661 --> 02:30:32,741
Yeah, they think you've come
to take him away,

1615
02:30:33,075 --> 02:30:35,952
- and I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1616
02:30:38,247 --> 02:30:40,999
Him! Colonel Kurtz.

1617
02:30:42,043 --> 02:30:44,753
These are all his children, man,
as far as you can see.

1618
02:30:46,047 --> 02:30:48,548
Hell, man, out here, we're all his children.

1619
02:30:49,466 --> 02:30:52,843
Could we talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1620
02:30:53,428 --> 02:30:59,099
Hey, man, you don't talk to the Colonel.
Well, you listen to him.

1621
02:31:00,602 --> 02:31:02,603
The man's enlarged my mind.

1622
02:31:03,480 --> 02:31:06,849
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.

1623
02:31:06,949 --> 02:31:10,144
Sometimes you'll say hello to him, right,

1624
02:31:10,244 --> 02:31:12,605
and he'll just walk right by you
and he won't even notice you.

1625
02:31:12,705 --> 02:31:16,192
And then suddenly he'll grab you,
he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say,

1626
02:31:16,292 --> 02:31:19,361
"Do you know that 'if' is the middle word
in 'life'? If you can keep your head

1627
02:31:19,461 --> 02:31:21,238
"when all about you are losing theirs
and blaming it on you,

1628
02:31:21,338 --> 02:31:22,789
"if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."

1629
02:31:24,083 --> 02:31:27,293
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1630
02:31:28,087 --> 02:31:33,833
"I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas."

1631
02:31:33,933 --> 02:31:35,468
Stay with the boat.

1632
02:31:36,387 --> 02:31:39,264
Don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.

1633
02:31:41,809 --> 02:31:46,478
He can be terrible, he can be mean,
and he can be right.

1634
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:50,315
He's fighting the war. He's a great man.

1635
02:31:58,408 --> 02:32:01,618
I wish I had words, you know?
I wish I had words.

1636
02:32:02,036 --> 02:32:04,580
I can tell you something,
like, the other day he wanted to kill me.

1637
02:32:05,206 --> 02:32:07,416
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1638
02:32:07,917 --> 02:32:09,501
Because I took his picture.

1639
02:32:10,503 --> 02:32:12,795
He said, "If you take my picture again,

1640
02:32:14,172 --> 02:32:17,800
"I'm gonna kill you," and he meant it.

1641
02:32:20,554 --> 02:32:24,515
So you just lay cool.
Play it cool, laid back. Dig it.

1642
02:32:25,142 --> 02:32:26,851
He gets friendly again. He really does.

1643
02:32:28,478 --> 02:32:30,855
But you don't judge the Colonel.

1644
02:32:31,773 --> 02:32:33,899
You don't judge the Colonel
like an ordinary man.

1645
02:32:40,865 --> 02:32:42,866
Okay, watch it now. These are Americans.

1646
02:32:42,992 --> 02:32:43,992
Americans!

1647
02:32:44,327 --> 02:32:45,827
You can feel the vibe of this place.

1648
02:32:46,829 --> 02:32:50,248
Let me take your picture.
Could you hold... Hello? Hello?

1649
02:32:50,374 --> 02:32:51,875
Could you hold up a minute?

1650
02:33:14,230 --> 02:33:15,397
Colby.

1651
02:33:31,873 --> 02:33:32,956
The heads.

1652
02:33:33,999 --> 02:33:39,212
You're looking at the heads.
Sometimes he goes too far.

1653
02:33:40,089 --> 02:33:41,923
He's the first one to admit it.

1654
02:33:43,050 --> 02:33:45,301
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1655
02:33:47,262 --> 02:33:50,215
If you could have heard the man
just two days ago.

1656
02:33:50,315 --> 02:33:54,769
If you could have heard him then, God...
You're gonna call him crazy?

1657
02:33:55,437 --> 02:33:56,813
Fucking A.

1658
02:33:58,273 --> 02:34:03,652
- I just wanna talk to him.
- Well, man, he's gone away.

1659
02:34:05,530 --> 02:34:07,940
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1660
02:34:08,040 --> 02:34:09,032
I'll wait for him.

1661
02:34:09,132 --> 02:34:13,286
He feels comfortable with his people.
He forgets himself with his people.

1662
02:34:15,707 --> 02:34:17,999
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1663
02:34:18,626 --> 02:34:22,838
- Maybe we should wait back at the boat.
- Okay, Chef.

1664
02:34:23,464 --> 02:34:27,884
- We'll go back to the boat for a while.
- Yeah, stay with Lance.

1665
02:34:51,533 --> 02:34:55,870
This Colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy. He's evil!

1666
02:34:57,329 --> 02:34:58,947
That's what the man's got set up here!

1667
02:34:59,047 --> 02:35:02,125
Man, it's fucking Pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1668
02:35:02,877 --> 02:35:04,210
Shit, he's loco.

1669
02:35:04,754 --> 02:35:07,748
- Then you'll help me?
- Help you? Fucking A, I'll help you.

1670
02:35:07,848 --> 02:35:09,249
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.

1671
02:35:09,349 --> 02:35:10,383
Good boy.

1672
02:35:11,218 --> 02:35:12,669
We could blow all them assholes away.

1673
02:35:12,769 --> 02:35:15,388
They're so fucking spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1674
02:35:16,307 --> 02:35:20,810
I ain't afraid of all them fucking skulls
and altars and shit.

1675
02:35:22,938 --> 02:35:26,565
I used to think if I died in an evil place,

1676
02:35:27,108 --> 02:35:29,193
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to heaven.

1677
02:35:30,153 --> 02:35:32,953
But now, fuck.

1678
02:35:35,325 --> 02:35:37,618
I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1679
02:35:38,203 --> 02:35:41,030
So what do you wanna do? I'll kill the fuck.

1680
02:35:41,130 --> 02:35:42,748
- No, no.
- Get out of here.

1681
02:35:42,999 --> 02:35:44,625
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1682
02:35:45,376 --> 02:35:48,921
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around,
check the place out,

1683
02:35:49,547 --> 02:35:51,714
see if I can find the Colonel, okay?

1684
02:35:53,759 --> 02:35:56,135
- What do you want me to do?
- Damn it.

1685
02:35:56,678 --> 02:36:02,683
Here, you take the radio,
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours,

1686
02:36:05,562 --> 02:36:06,896
you call in the air strike.

1687
02:36:09,691 --> 02:36:11,067
Air strike?

1688
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:17,490
The code is "Almighty,"
coordinates 0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1689
02:36:18,407 --> 02:36:19,741
It's all in there.

1690
02:36:21,410 --> 02:36:24,037
0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1691
02:36:32,922 --> 02:36:36,258
Everything I saw told me that Kurtz
had gone insane.

1692
02:36:40,638 --> 02:36:46,308
The place was full of bodies.
North Vietnamese, Viet Cong, Cambodians.

1693
02:36:53,984 --> 02:36:56,986
If I was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way.

1694
02:37:31,437 --> 02:37:33,855
It smelled like slow death in there.

1695
02:37:35,441 --> 02:37:38,693
Malaria, nightmares.

1696
02:37:41,487 --> 02:37:43,530
This was the end of the river, all right.

1697
02:37:57,837 --> 02:37:59,254
Where are you from, Willard?

1698
02:38:04,844 --> 02:38:06,428
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1699
02:38:12,392 --> 02:38:15,019
- Were you born there?
- Yes, sir.

1700
02:38:17,189 --> 02:38:19,857
- Whereabouts?
- Toledo, sir.

1701
02:38:27,199 --> 02:38:28,991
How far are you from the river?

1702
02:38:35,957 --> 02:38:37,666
The Ohio River, sir?

1703
02:38:40,211 --> 02:38:41,878
About 200 miles.

1704
02:38:49,887 --> 02:38:52,847
I went down that river once
when I was a kid.

1705
02:38:57,728 --> 02:39:00,438
There's a place in the river,
I can't remember.

1706
02:39:00,815 --> 02:39:05,734
It must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1707
02:39:06,069 --> 02:39:08,813
It's all wild and overgrown now,

1708
02:39:08,913 --> 02:39:15,411
but for about five miles, you'd think that
heaven just fell on the Earth,

1709
02:39:16,830 --> 02:39:18,789
in the form of gardenias.

1710
02:39:35,097 --> 02:39:40,143
Have you ever considered
any real freedoms?

1711
02:39:45,941 --> 02:39:48,860
Freedoms from the opinion of others?

1712
02:39:52,406 --> 02:39:54,365
Even the opinions of yourself?

1713
02:40:10,548 --> 02:40:14,134
Did they say why, Willard?

1714
02:40:16,387 --> 02:40:21,099
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

1715
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:38,949
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.

1716
02:40:43,163 --> 02:40:46,665
No longer classified, is it?

1717
02:40:54,006 --> 02:40:55,423
What did they tell you?

1718
02:40:58,427 --> 02:41:04,724
They told me that you had gone
totally insane,

1719
02:41:07,686 --> 02:41:14,025
and that your methods were unsound.

1720
02:41:17,863 --> 02:41:19,781
Are my methods unsound?

1721
02:41:25,870 --> 02:41:32,042
I don't see any method at all, sir.

1722
02:41:39,134 --> 02:41:42,761
I expected someone like you.

1723
02:41:46,141 --> 02:41:47,390
What did you expect?

1724
02:41:55,649 --> 02:41:57,233
Are you an assassin?

1725
02:42:02,114 --> 02:42:03,281
I'm a soldier.

1726
02:42:07,161 --> 02:42:08,744
You're neither.

1727
02:42:10,914 --> 02:42:15,500
You're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks

1728
02:42:20,256 --> 02:42:21,923
to collect a bill.

1729
02:43:05,884 --> 02:43:11,512
Why? Why would a nice guy like you
wanna kill a genius?

1730
02:43:18,479 --> 02:43:20,230
Going down pretty good, huh?

1731
02:43:20,856 --> 02:43:21,656
Why?

1732
02:43:23,651 --> 02:43:25,318
You know?

1733
02:43:26,111 --> 02:43:28,154
Do you know that the man,

1734
02:43:31,659 --> 02:43:33,660
the man really likes you?

1735
02:43:36,956 --> 02:43:42,834
He likes you. He really likes you,
but he's got something in mind for you.

1736
02:43:44,504 --> 02:43:46,088
Aren't you curious about that?

1737
02:43:46,673 --> 02:43:52,135
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1738
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:58,433
There's something
happening out here, man.

1739
02:44:01,854 --> 02:44:04,356
You know something, man?
I know something that you don't know.

1740
02:44:04,856 --> 02:44:06,274
That's right, jack.

1741
02:44:06,566 --> 02:44:11,946
The man is clear in his mind,
but his soul is mad.

1742
02:44:13,907 --> 02:44:14,907
Yeah.

1743
02:44:16,326 --> 02:44:20,329
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this. He hates it.

1744
02:44:21,415 --> 02:44:24,615
But the man's...

1745
02:44:28,797 --> 02:44:31,299
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

1746
02:44:33,217 --> 02:44:36,886
And a voice, a voice...

1747
02:44:40,224 --> 02:44:44,561
He likes you 'cause you're still alive.
He's got plans for you.

1748
02:44:44,979 --> 02:44:49,607
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.

1749
02:44:50,568 --> 02:44:52,027
You're gonna help him.

1750
02:44:52,403 --> 02:44:54,821
What are they gonna say, man,
when he's gone?

1751
02:44:54,947 --> 02:44:59,575
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1752
02:44:59,701 --> 02:45:00,735
What are they gonna say about him?

1753
02:45:00,835 --> 02:45:05,289
What are they gonna say?
"He was a kind man. He was a wise man.

1754
02:45:05,540 --> 02:45:09,001
"He had plans. He had wisdom."
Bullshit, man!

1755
02:45:09,419 --> 02:45:13,464
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1756
02:45:17,260 --> 02:45:18,060
You.

1757
02:45:23,683 --> 02:45:25,601
Almost eight hours.

1758
02:45:28,145 --> 02:45:31,345
God. I'm asleep.

1759
02:45:33,525 --> 02:45:36,277
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1760
02:45:48,374 --> 02:45:49,374
Fuck.

1761
02:45:53,796 --> 02:45:55,379
Has it been eight hours?

1762
02:45:58,466 --> 02:46:03,136
Hello, Almighty, Almighty,
this is PBR Street Gang.

1763
02:46:03,638 --> 02:46:04,805
Radio check. Over.

1764
02:46:05,807 --> 02:46:08,475
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty standing by. Over.

1765
02:47:32,056 --> 02:47:34,516
What the hell! Jesus!

1766
02:47:41,524 --> 02:47:42,924
Christ!

began, is beginning to make itself felt.

"where he could simply be unable
to continue fighting."

1779
02:50:38,903 --> 02:50:40,528
Is this familiar?

1780
02:50:41,781 --> 02:50:44,824
"Because Lyndon Johnson fears
that the US public

1781

1787

No date, Time magazine.

1788

"Sir Robert Thompson, who led the victory
over communist guerrillas in Malaya,

How do they smell to you, soldier?

1794

You'll be free. You'll be under guard.
Read these at your leisure.

Don't lose them.

Don't try to escape. You'll be shot.

1797
02:52:12,368 --> 02:52:14,327
We can talk of these things later.

1798

"We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men

- He's out there.

1803
02:55:55,174 --> 02:55:56,667
"In our dry cellar..."

1804
02:55:57,292 --> 02:56:03,214
- He's really out there.
- "Shape without form, shade without color,

"Paralyzed force, gesture without motion..."

1807

- Do you?
- "Those who have crossed..."

1808
02:56:14,559 --> 02:56:18,562
This is dialectics. It's very simple dialectics.
One through nine,

1809
02:56:18,897 --> 02:56:22,266
no "maybes," no "supposes," no fractions.
You can't travel in space.

1810
02:56:22,366 --> 02:56:26,728
You can't go out into space, you know,
without like... With fractions.

1811
02:56:26,828 --> 02:56:28,647
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1812
02:56:28,747 --> 02:56:31,366
What are you gonna do when you go
from here to Venus or something?

1813
02:56:31,575 --> 02:56:33,485
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1814
02:56:33,585 --> 02:56:35,654
Dialectic logic is,
"There's only love and hate."

1815
02:56:35,754 --> 02:56:37,789
You either love somebody
or you hate them.

1816
02:56:38,249 --> 02:56:39,249
Mutt!

1817
02:56:41,669 --> 02:56:42,711
You mutt.

1818
02:56:43,754 --> 02:56:48,758
This is the way the fucking world ends.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!

1819
02:56:49,510 --> 02:56:51,503
"Not with a bang, a whimper."

1820
02:56:51,603 --> 02:56:53,929
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, jack.

1821
02:57:23,751 --> 02:57:26,461
On the river, I thought
that the minute I looked at him,

1822
02:57:26,587 --> 02:57:28,337
I'd know what to do.

1823
02:57:29,298 --> 02:57:35,970
But it didn't happen. I was in there
with him for days, not under guard.

1824
02:57:36,972 --> 02:57:41,142
I was free.
But he knew I wasn't going anywhere.

1825
02:57:42,603 --> 02:57:45,897
He knew more
about what I was going to do than I did.

1826
02:57:52,987 --> 02:57:56,490
If the generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw,

1827
02:57:57,450 --> 02:58:00,035
would they still want me to kill him?

1828
02:58:01,287 --> 02:58:03,163
More than ever, probably.

1829
02:58:04,624 --> 02:58:06,533
And what would his people
back home want,

1830
02:58:06,633 --> 02:58:09,669
if they ever learned
just how far from them he'd really gone?

1831
02:58:12,256 --> 02:58:15,674
He broke from them,
and then he broke from himself.

1832
02:58:17,344 --> 02:58:21,514
I'd never seen a man so broken up
and ripped apart.

1833
02:58:22,516 --> 02:58:26,644
I've seen the horrors,
horrors that you've seen.

1834
02:58:29,314 --> 02:58:33,234
But you have no right to call me a murderer.
You have a right to kill me.

1835
02:58:34,569 --> 02:58:40,533
You have a right to do that.
But you have no right to judge me.

1836
02:58:47,873 --> 02:58:52,877
It's impossible for words to describe

1837
02:58:55,214 --> 02:59:00,414
what is necessary to those

1838
02:59:02,888 --> 02:59:08,560
who do not know what horror means.

1839
02:59:11,020 --> 02:59:12,229
Horror.

1840
02:59:15,233 --> 02:59:17,860
Horror has a face.

1841
02:59:20,154 --> 02:59:22,281
And you must make a friend of horror.

1842
02:59:23,992 --> 02:59:28,829
Horror and moral terror are your friends.

1843
02:59:29,414 --> 02:59:34,209
If they are not,
then they are enemies to be feared.

1844
02:59:35,712 --> 02:59:37,587
They are truly enemies.

1845
02:59:42,593 --> 02:59:45,428
I remember when I was with Special Forces.

1846
02:59:49,933 --> 02:59:53,853
It seems a thousand centuries ago.

1847
02:59:57,441 --> 03:00:03,279
We went into a camp
to inoculate some children.

1848
03:00:07,867 --> 03:00:13,413
We'd left the camp after we had
inoculated the children for polio.

1849
03:00:15,875 --> 03:00:19,252
And this old man came running after us,
and he was crying, he couldn't see.

1850
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:25,375
We went back there

1851
03:00:25,475 --> 03:00:30,931
and they had come
and hacked off every inoculated arm.

1852
03:00:33,308 --> 03:00:40,105
There they were, in a pile.
A pile of little arms.

1853
03:00:42,233 --> 03:00:44,485
And I remember,

1854
03:00:48,365 --> 03:00:51,158
I cried. I wept like

1855
03:00:53,328 --> 03:00:55,996
some grandmother.

1856
03:00:58,166 --> 03:01:01,417
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

1857
03:01:03,170 --> 03:01:05,421
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

1858
03:01:06,298 --> 03:01:08,132
I never want to forget.

1859
03:01:09,802 --> 03:01:14,514
And then I realized, like I was shot,

1860
03:01:15,015 --> 03:01:17,183
like I was shot with a diamond,

1861
03:01:18,394 --> 03:01:21,521
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

1862
03:01:23,607 --> 03:01:28,777
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that. The genius."

1863
03:01:30,196 --> 03:01:32,572
The will to do that,

1864
03:01:34,242 --> 03:01:38,704
perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

1865
03:01:41,290 --> 03:01:43,200
And then I realized

1866
03:01:43,300 --> 03:01:46,870
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

1867
03:01:46,970 --> 03:01:50,924
These were not monsters.
These were men, trained cadres.

1868
03:01:52,385 --> 03:01:57,046
These men who fought with their hearts,
who have families, who have children,

1869
03:01:57,146 --> 03:02:00,975
who are filled with love,
but they have the strength,

1870
03:02:02,728 --> 03:02:07,528
the strength to do that.

1871
03:02:10,277 --> 03:02:14,572
If I had 10 divisions of those men,

1872
03:02:15,657 --> 03:02:18,617
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

1873
03:02:20,412 --> 03:02:24,831
You have to have men who are moral,

1874
03:02:27,168 --> 03:02:31,212
and at the same time, who are able

1875
03:02:32,840 --> 03:02:39,095
to utilize their primordial instincts to kill

1876
03:02:41,015 --> 03:02:47,604
without feeling, without passion,
without judgment. Without judgment.

1877
03:02:53,109 --> 03:02:55,736
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

1878
03:03:15,215 --> 03:03:22,011
I worry that my son
might not understand what I've tried to be.

1879
03:03:24,723 --> 03:03:29,352
And if I were to be killed, Willard,

1880
03:03:30,896 --> 03:03:36,359
I would want someone to go to my home
and tell my son everything.

1881
03:03:39,655 --> 03:03:42,657
Everything I did. Everything you saw.

1882
03:03:44,408 --> 03:03:49,913
Because there's nothing that I detest more
than the stench of lies.

1883
03:03:53,000 --> 03:04:00,006
And if you understand me, Willard,
you will do this for me.

1884
03:05:06,529 --> 03:05:08,697
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty. Over.

1885
03:05:10,491 --> 03:05:13,619
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. Over.

1886
03:05:15,872 --> 03:05:19,750
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. How do you copy?

1887
03:05:25,089 --> 03:05:27,883
They were gonna make me a Major for this,

1888
03:05:28,635 --> 03:05:31,762
and I wasn't even
in their fucking Army anymore.

1889
03:05:33,931 --> 03:05:38,643
Everybody wanted me to do it,
him most of all.

1890
03:05:40,604 --> 03:05:44,982
I felt like he was up there,
waiting for me to take the pain away.

1891
03:05:48,320 --> 03:05:52,406
He just wanted to go out like a soldier.
Standing up.

1892
03:05:53,742 --> 03:05:57,328
Not like some poor, wasted,
rag-assed renegade.

1893
03:06:01,207 --> 03:06:03,500
Even the jungle wanted him dead,

1894
03:06:04,460 --> 03:06:07,128
and that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.

1895
03:07:24,454 --> 03:07:29,666
"We train young men to drop fire on people,
but their commanders

1896
03:07:30,877 --> 03:07:35,789
"won't allow them to write 'Fuck'
on their airplanes

1897
03:07:35,889 --> 03:07:39,278
"because it's obscene!"

1898
03:09:02,090 --> 03:09:04,290
The horror.

1899
03:14:32,074 --> 03:14:37,154
Calling PBR Street Gang.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.

1900
03:14:37,254 --> 03:14:39,080
Do you read me? Over.

1901
03:14:39,957 --> 03:14:41,540
PBR Street Gang.

1902
03:14:42,167 --> 03:14:45,117
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty...

1903
03:15:22,498 --> 03:15:24,286
The horror.

1904
03:15:28,395 --> 03:15:29,996
The horror.

1905
03:15:30,305 --> 03:16:30,295
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
