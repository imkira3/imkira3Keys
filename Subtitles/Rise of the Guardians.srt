1
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,755
<i>Darkness.</i>

2
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,134
<i>That's the first thing I remember.</i>

3
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,801
<i>It was dark, and it was cold.</i>

4
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,303
<i>And I was scared.</i>

5
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,014
<i>But then,</i>

6
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,479
<i>then I saw the moon.</i>

7
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,862
<i>It was so big and it was so bright.</i>

8
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,573
<i>It seemed to chase the darkness</i> away.

9
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,654
<i>And when it did,</i>

10
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,865
<i>I wasn't scared anymore.</i>

11
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,877
<i>Why I was there
and what I was meant to do,</i>

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,717
<i>that I've never known.</i>

13
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,183
<i>And a part of me wonders if I ever will.</i>

14
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,143
Hello. Hello.

15
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,946
Good evening, ma'am. Ma'am?

16
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,858
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Can you tell me where I am?

17
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,449
Hello?

18
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,790
<i>My name is Jack Frost.</i>

19
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,289
<i>How do I know that?</i>

20
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,958
<i>The moon told me so.</i>

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,344
<i>But that was all he ever told me.</i>

22
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,300
<i>And that was a long, long time ago.</i>

23
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,420
Still waiting for cookies!

24
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,093
Yes!

25
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,517
Ah, finally!

26
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,437
Mmm! Mmm.

27
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,791
How many times
have I told you to knock?

28
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,873
- What?

29
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,083
The Globe?

30
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,292
Shoo with your pointy heads.

31
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,135
Why are you always under boot?

32
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,980
What is this?

33
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,564
Have you checked the axis?
Is rotation balanced?

34
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,933
Can it be?

35
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,639
Dingle!

36
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,854
Make preparations.

37
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,014
We are going to have company.

38
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,001
Eighteen central incisors.

39
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,218
Moscow, sector 9.
22 incisors, 18 premolars.

40
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,041
Uh-oh. Heavy rain advisory.

41
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,843
Des Moines, we've got a cusped
at 23 Maple. Head out!

42
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,720
Wait! It's her first tooth.

43
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,847
Have you ever seen
a more adorable lateral incisor

44
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,018
in all of your life?

45
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,641
Look how she flossed.

46
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,355
<i>My fellow Guardians,</i>

47
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,697
<i>it is our job to watch over
the children of the world</i>

48
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,527
<i>and keep them safe.</i>

49
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,615
<i>To bring wonder, hope, and dreams.</i>

50
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,784
<i>And so I have called us
all here for one reason,</i>

51
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,835
<i>and one reason only.</i>

52
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,913
<i>The children are in danger.</i>

53
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,226
<i>An enemy we have kept at bay
for centuries</i>

54
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,058
<i>has finally decided to strike back.</i>

55
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,099
<i>We alone can stop him.</i>

56
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,523
Oh, it's freezing!

57
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,612
Oh, I can't feel my feet!
I can't feel my feet!

58
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,538
Cookies? Eggnog? Anyone?

59
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,082
This better be good, North.

60
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,992
Sandy, thank you for coming.

61
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,127
I know, I know.

62
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,588
But I obviously wouldn't
have called you all here

63
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,086
unless it was serious.

64
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,299
Shh!

65
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,754
The Boogeyman was here! At the Pole!

66
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,088
Pitch?

67
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,011
Pitch Black? Here?

68
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,182
Yes.

69
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,098
There was black sand
covering the Globe.

70
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,517
What do you mean, black sand?

71
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,314
And then a shadow!

72
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,431
Hold on, hold on.
I thought you said you saw Pitch.

73
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,435
Well, uh, not exactly.

74
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,604
"Not exactly"? Can you believe this guy?

75
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,066
Yeah. You said it, Sandy.

76
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,828
Look, he's up to something very bad.

77
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,155
I feel it

78
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,623
in my belly.

79
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,376
Hang on, hang on. You mean
to say you summoned me here

80
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,250
three days before Easter
because of your belly?

81
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,570
Mate, if I did this
to you three days before Christmas...

82
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,627
Please, Bunny. Easter is not Christmas.

83
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,132
Here we go.

84
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,971
North, I don't have time for this!

85
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,258
I've still got two million eggs
to finish up!

86
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,268
No matter how much you paint,
is still egg.

87
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,061
Look, mate,
I'm dealing with perishables.

88
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,477
Right? You've got all year to prepare!

89
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,392
Why are rabbits always so nervous?

90
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,995
And why are you always
such a blowhard?

91
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,363
Tooth! Can't you see we're trying
to argue?

92
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,029
Sorry. Not all of us get
to work one night a year.

93
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,527
Am I right, Sandy?

94
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,658
San Diego, sector 2.

95
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,831
Come on, mate.
Pitch went out with the Dark Ages.

96
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,452
We made sure of it.

97
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,082
I know it was him.
We have serious situation.

98
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,505
Well, I've got a serious situation
with some eggs.

99
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,928
Ah! Man in Moon!

100
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,136
Sandy, why didn't you say something?

101
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,018
It's been a long time, old friend.

102
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,228
What is big news?

103
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,495
It is Pitch.

104
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,588
Manny, what must we do?

105
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,018
Uh, guys,
you know what this means?

106
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,220
He's choosing a new Guardian.

107
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,929
What? Why?

108
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,229
Must be big deal.
Manny thinks we need help.

109
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,435
Since when do we need help?

110
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,899
I wonder who it's gonna be!

111
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,980
Maybe the Leprechaun?

112
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,102
Please not the Groundhog,
please not the Groundhog.

113
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,286
Jack Frost.

114
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,879
Uh, I take it back. The Groundhog's fine.

115
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,162
As long as he helps
to protect the children. Right?

116
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,335
Jack Frost?
He doesn't care about children!

117
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,836
All right?
All he does is freeze water pipes

118
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,884
and mess with my egg hunts!

119
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,680
All right?
He's an irresponsible, selfish...

120
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,054
Guardian.

121
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,848
Jack Frost is many things,

122
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,766
but he is not a Guardian.

123
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,440
- Ya! Ugh!

124
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,995
Oh! Now that, that was fun.

125
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,124
Hey, wind!

126
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,007
Take me home.

127
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,853
Snow day!

128
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,851
Oh! It's freezing!

129
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,572
Yeah!

130
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,237
Whoa! Whoa!

131
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,910
Oh, that looks interesting. Good book?

132
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,669
- All right!
- Yeah!

133
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,247
Snow day!
- Snow day! Yeah.

134
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,582
You're welcome.

135
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,009
Hey, guys, wait up! Are you guys
coming to the egg hunt Sunday?

136
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,423
Yeah! Free candy.

137
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,663
I hope we can find the eggs
with all this snow!

138
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,138
It says here that
they found Bigfoot hair samples

139
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,312
and DNA in Michigan!

140
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,933
That's like super-close!

141
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,265
Here we go again.

142
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,350
You saw the video too, Claude.
He's out there.

143
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,148
That's what you said about aliens.

144
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,857
And the Easter Bunny!

145
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,197
The Easter Bunny is real.

146
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,403
Oh, he's real all right.

147
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,281
Real annoying, real grumpy
and really full of himself.

148
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,921
Come on!
You guys will believe anything.

149
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,655
Easter Bunny, hop, hop, hop!

150
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,833
- Ow!
- Mom, Sophie fell again!

151
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,285
You okay, Soph?

152
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,494
Jamie, hat.

153
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,796
We don't want Jack Frost
nipping at your nose.

154
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,168
Who's Jack Frost?

155
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,966
No one, honey. It's just an expression.

156
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,133
Hey!

157
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,005
"Who's Jack Frost?"

158
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,396
Okay, who threw that?

159
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,394
Well, it wasn't Bigfoot, kiddo.

160
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,317
Ahhh!

161
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,566
Jamie Bennett, no fair!

162
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,359
You struck first!

163
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,366
Free-for-all!

164
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,498
All right, who needs ammo?

165
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,346
Look at that!

166
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,882
Crud! I hit Cupcake!

167
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,884
- She hit Cupcake.
- You hit Cupcake?

168
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,177
Ohhh!

169
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,724
- Did you throw that?
- No.

170
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,271
It wasn't me!

171
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,112
- Oh, a little slippery!
- Ooh!

172
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,677
- Jamie, watch out!
- Whoa!

173
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,577
- That's the street.
- Stop! There's traffic!

174
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,741
Whoa! Don't worry, Jamie.
I got you. Hold on!

175
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,450
It's gonna be all right!

176
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,495
Keep up with me, kid! Take a left!

177
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,625
Hey, slow down!

178
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,673
Hold up. No, no, no, no.

179
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,212
Is that Jamie Bennett?

180
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,920
- There you go.
- No, no!

181
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,717
Whoa!

182
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,691
- - Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah!

183
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,113
- Wow, that looks serious.
- Jamie, are you all right?

184
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:21,994
Whoa!

185
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,743
Did you guys see that? It was amazing!

186
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,908
I did a jump and I slid under a...

187
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,542
Whoops.

188
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,785
Oh!

189
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,044
Cool! A tooth!

190
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,046
- Dude, that means cash!
- Tooth fairy cash!

191
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,127
- Oh, no! Oh!
- You lucky bum!

192
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,054
I got to put this under my pillow!

193
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,052
Oh, wait a minute.
Come on. Hold on, hold on.

194
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,553
What about all the fun we just had?

195
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,351
That wasn't the Tooth Fairy,
that was me!

196
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,923
My ears are freezing!

197
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,369
What's a guy got to do
to get a little attention around here?

198
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,063
There was a patch of ice.

199
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,689
I don't understand how it got here.

200
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,113
I mean, Easter is around the corner!

201
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,407
...it was awesome!

202
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,734
So then I was flying down this hill

203
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,410
and it was like whoosh, whoosh,
through these cars

204
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,613
and then the sled hit this thing

205
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,159
and it was like way up in the air!

206
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,957
And then, barn, the sofa hit me...

207
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,158
Wow!

208
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,585
...and see, my tooth came out!

209
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,626
All right, you.
Tooth under your pillow?

210
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,172
Yeah, I'm ready.

211
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,171
Now don't stay up trying
to see her, Jamie,

212
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,547
or she won't come.

213
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,175
But I can do it this time!
You want to help me, Soph?

214
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,471
We can hide and see the Tooth Fairy!

215
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,924
Hide, hide, hide, hide.

216
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,512
Uh-uh. Straight to bed now, mister.

217
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,593
Mom.

218
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,858
If there's something I'm doing wrong,

219
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,534
can you just tell me what it is?

220
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,874
Because I've tried everything

221
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,495
and no one ever sees me.

222
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,466
You put me here.

223
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,795
The least you can do is tell me...

224
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,680
Tell me why.

225
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,825
Right on time, Sandman.

226
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,690
Mmm.

227
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:11,202
Oh, I thought I heard
the clippity-clop of a unicorn.

228
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,200
What an adorable dream!

229
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,204
And look at her.

230
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,546
Precious child.

231
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,250
So sweet.

232
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,461
So full of hope and wonder.

233
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,839
Why, there's only one thing missing.

234
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,640
A touch of fear.

235
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,849
Mmm...

236
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,396
That never gets old.

237
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:40,234
Feel your fear. Come on.
Come on, that's right.

238
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:45,903
Yes, what a pretty little Nightmare!

239
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,238
Now,

240
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,705
I want you to go tell the others
the wait is over.

241
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,415
Don't look at me like that, old friend.

242
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,251
You must have known
this day would come.

243
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,757
My Nightmares are finally ready.

244
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,506
Are your Guardians?

245
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,014
Whoa!

246
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,084
Hello, mate.

247
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,967
Been a long time.
Blizzard of '68 I believe.

248
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,428
Easter Sunday, wasn't it?

249
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,259
Bunny! You're not still
mad about that, are you?

250
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,641
Yes.

251
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,808
But this is about something else.

252
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,597
Fellas?

253
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,141
- Hey!

254
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,391
Put me down! What the...

255
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,443
Me?

256
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,408
Not on your nelly.
See you back at the Pole.

257
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,299
Whoa!

258
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,592
He's here.

259
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,261
Quiet.

260
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,177
Hey! There he is!

261
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,592
Jack Frost!

262
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,761
Wow.

263
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,890
You got to be kidding me.

264
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,437
Hey, hey.

265
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,642
- Put me down.
- I hope the yetis treated you well.

266
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,813
Oh, yeah,

267
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,862
I love being shoved in a sack
and tossed through a magic portal.

268
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,318
Oh, good. That was my idea!

269
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,866
You know Bunny, obviously.

270
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,985
- Obviously.
- And the Tooth Fairy.

271
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,669
Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you.

272
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,113
And your teeth!

273
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,326
My What?

274
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,703
Open up!
Are they really as white as they say?

275
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,829
Yes!

276
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,752
Oh, they really do sparkle
like freshly fallen snow!

277
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,459
Girls, pull yourselves together!

278
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,820
Let's not disgrace the uniform.

279
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,334
And Sandman.

280
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,634
Sandy?

281
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,465
Sandy? Wake up!

282
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,678
Hey, ho, anyone want
to tell me why I'm here?

283
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,516
Uh, that's not really helping,

284
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,972
but thanks, little man.

285
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,437
I must've done something really bad
to get you four together.

286
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,022
Am I on the naughty list?

287
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,275
Ha! On naughty list?

288
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,776
You hold the record.

289
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,691
But, no matter. We overlook.

290
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,027
Now we are wiping clean the slate.

291
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,407
How come?

292
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,533
Ah, good question.

293
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,707
How come? I tell you how come!

294
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,251
Because now you are Guardian!

295
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,421
What are you doing?
Get off of me!

296
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,824
This is the best part!

297
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,274
Huh?

298
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,378
What makes you think
I want to be a Guardian?

299
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,387
Of course you do.

300
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,634
Music!

301
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,345
No music!

302
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,890
This is all very flattering, but, uh,

303
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,771
you don't want me.

304
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,599
You're all hard work and deadlines,

305
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,776
and I'm snowballs and fun times.

306
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,319
I'm not a Guardian.

307
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,109
Yeah. That's exactly what I said.

308
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,158
Jack, I don't think
you understand what it is we do.

309
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,990
Each of those lights is a child.

310
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,663
A child who believes.

311
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,374
And good or bad, naughty or nice,

312
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,160
we protect them.

313
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,452
Ah! Ah!

314
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,209
Tooth! Fingers out of mouth.

315
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,541
Oh, sorry. They're beautiful.

316
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,134
Okay. No more wishy-washy.

317
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,257
Pitch is out there
doing who knows what!

318
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,179
You mean the Boogeyman?

319
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,099
Yes! When Pitch threatens us,

320
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,767
he threatens them as well.

321
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,595
All the more reason
to pick someone more qualified.

322
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,646
Pick? You think we pick?

323
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,021
No, you were chosen!
Like we were all chosen.

324
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,397
By Man in Moon.

325
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,693
What?

326
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,737
Last night, Jack, he chose you.

327
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,905
Maybe.

328
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,534
Man in the Moon... He talks to you?

329
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,957
You see, you cannot say no.
It is destiny.

330
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,745
But why wouldn't he tell me
that himself?

331
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,957
After 300 years this is his answer?

332
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,293
To spend eternity like you guys.

333
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:02,098
Cooped up in some hideout thinking
of new ways to bribe kids?

334
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,886
No, no. That's not for me! No offense.

335
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,396
How is that not offensive?

336
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,605
You know what I think?

337
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,149
I think we just dodged a bullet.

338
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,271
I mean, what's this clown

339
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,274
know about bringing joy
to children anyway.

340
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,731
Uh, you ever hear of a snow day?

341
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,068
I know it's no hard-boiled egg,
but kids like what I do.

342
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,282
But none of them
believe in you, do they?

343
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,034
You see, you're invisible, mate.

344
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,415
It's like you don't even exist.

345
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,787
Bunny! Enough.

346
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,120
No, the kangaroo's right.

347
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,163
The what? What did you call me?

348
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,248
I'm not a kangaroo, mate.

349
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,796
Oh, and this whole time
I thought you were.

350
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:42,047
If you're not a kangaroo, what are you?

351
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,508
I'm a bunny. The Easter Bunny.

352
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,435
People believe in me.

353
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,194
Jack. Walk with me.

354
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,402
It's nothing personal, North.

355
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,609
But what you all do,
it's just not my thing.

356
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,568
Man in Moon says it is your thing!

357
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,744
We will see.

358
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,072
Slow down, would you?
I've been trying to bust in here for years.

359
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,115
- I want a good look.
- What do you mean, bust in?

360
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,159
Oh, don't worry.
I never got past the yetis.

361
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,585
Oh, hey, Phil.

362
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,254
Keep up, Jack, keep up!

363
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,804
Whoa! I always thought
the elves made the toys.

364
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,306
We just let them believe that.

365
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,817
Very nice! Keep up good work.

366
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,395
- I don't like it! Paint it red!

367
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,486
Step it up, everybody!

368
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,884
Fruitcake?

369
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,841
Uh, no, thanks.

370
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,549
Now we get down to tacks of brass.

371
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,430
Tacks of...

372
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,731
Who are you, Jack Frost?

373
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,893
- What is your center?
- My center?

374
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,938
If Man in Moon chose you
to be a Guardian,

375
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,150
you must have something
very special inside.

376
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,901
Hmm.

377
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,452
Here.

378
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,541
This is how you see me, no?

379
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,210
Very big, intimidating.

380
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,462
But if you get to know me a little...
Well, go on.

381
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,262
You are downright jolly?

382
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,341
But not just jolly!

383
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,889
I am also mysterious,

384
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,931
and fearless,

385
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,892
and caring!

386
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,478
And at my center?

387
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,237
There's a tiny wooden baby.

388
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,069
Look closer. What do you see?

389
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,454
You have big eyes.

390
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,624
Yes! Big eyes. Very big.

391
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,293
Because they are full of wonder.

392
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,708
That is my center.

393
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,549
It is what I was born with.

394
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:28,130
Eyes that have always seen
the wonder in everything!

395
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:32,718
Eyes that see lights in the trees
and magic in the air.

396
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:38,306
This wonder is what I put into the world!

397
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,350
And what I protect in children.

398
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,936
It is what makes me a Guardian.

399
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,940
It is my center.

400
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,450
What is yours?

401
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,405
I don't know.

402
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,003
We have a problem, mate.
Trouble at the Tooth Palace.

403
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,377
North! North!

404
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,712
I told you I'm not going with you guys!

405
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,015
There is no way
I'm climbing into some rickety old...

406
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,432
...sleigh?

407
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,569
Whoa, whoa, hey!

408
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,294
Okay. One ride, but that's it.

409
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,542
Everyone loves the sleigh!

410
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,544
Bunny, what are you waiting for?

411
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:50,302
I think my tunnels might be faster,
mate, and safer.

412
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:51,970
- Ugh! Get in!
- Whoa!

413
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,509
- Buckle up!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

414
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,216
Where are the bloody seatbelts?

415
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,968
Ha! That was just expression.
Are we ready?

416
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,062
Good. Let's go! Clear!

417
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,223
Yah!

418
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,569
Out of the way!

419
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,402
Yah!

420
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,952
Oh, no!

421
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,545
Slow down! Slow down!

422
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,088
I hope you like the loopty-loops.

423
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,216
I hope you like carrots.

424
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,468
Here we go!

425
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,096
Whoo-hoo!

426
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,145
Blastoff!

427
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,281
Whoa!

428
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,947
Ohhh...

429
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:57,994
Hey, Bunny.

430
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,164
Check out this view.

431
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,075
North! He's...

432
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,287
Aw, you do care.

433
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,086
Oh, rack off, you bloody show pony!

434
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,959
Hold on, everyone! I know a shortcut.

435
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,921
Oh, strewth, I knew I should've taken
the tunnels.

436
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,132
I say Tooth Palace.

437
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,093
Yah!

438
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:26,978
What?

439
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,356
Oh! Whoa!

440
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,479
What are they?

441
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,864
Whoa!

442
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,431
They're taking the tooth fairies!

443
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,458
Hey, little Baby Tooth, you okay?

444
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,396
- Here, take over.
- Huh?

445
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:07,894
Yah!

446
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,229
Yah!

447
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,645
They're stealing the teeth!

448
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,691
- Jack, look out!

449
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,166
Tooth! Are you all right?

450
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,541
They... They took my fairies.

451
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,546
And the teeth! All of them!

452
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,211
Everything is gone.

453
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,383
Everything.

454
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:42,850
Oh, thank goodness.
One of you is all right.

455
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,679
I have to say,
this is very, very exciting.

456
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,099
The Big Four, all in one place.

457
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,601
I'm a little starstruck.

458
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,570
Did you like my show
on the Globe, North?

459
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,073
- Got you all together, didn't I?

460
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,781
Pitch! You have got 30 seconds
to return my fairies!

461
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:05,907
Or what?
You'll stick a quarter under my pillow?

462
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,746
Why are you doing this?

463
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,120
Maybe I want what you have.

464
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,546
To be believed in.

465
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,760
Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds!

466
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,628
Maybe that's where you belong!

467
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,055
Go suck an egg, rabbit.

468
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,890
Hang on. Is that Jack Frost?

469
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,973
Since when are you all so chummy?

470
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,145
We're not.

471
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,943
Oh, good. A neutral party.

472
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,445
Then I'm going to ignore you.

473
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,065
But you must be used to that by now.

474
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,242
Pitch, you shadow-sneaking ratbag,
come here!

475
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,748
Whoa! Hey! Easy, girl, easy.

476
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,466
Look familiar, Sandman?

477
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,298
Took me a while
to perfect this little trick.

478
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,092
Turning dreams into Nightmares.

479
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,757
Don't be nervous.

480
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,020
It only riles them up more.
They smell fear, you know.

481
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,272
What fear? Of you?

482
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,191
No one's been afraid of you
since the Dark Ages!

483
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,819
Oh, the Dark Ages.

484
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,940
<i>Everyone frightened. Miserable.</i>

485
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:26,119
<i>Such happy times for me.
Oh, the power I wielded.</i>

486
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,867
<i>But then the Man in the Moon</i>

487
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:32,494
<i>chose you to replace my fear
with your wonder and light.</i>

488
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,373
<i>Lifting their hearts
and giving them hope.</i>

489
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,384
<i>Meanwhile, everyone
wrote me off as just a bad dream!</i>

490
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,878
<i>"Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of."</i>

491
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,552
<i>"There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman!"</i>

492
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,685
Well, that's all about to change.

493
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,189
Oh, look.

494
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,391
It's happening already.

495
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,563
What is?

496
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,319
<i>Children are waking up and realizing</i>

497
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,530
<i>the Tooth Fairy never came.</i>

498
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,072
I mean, such a little thing.
But to a child...

499
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,703
What's going on?

500
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,915
They... They don't
believe in me anymore.

501
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,918
Didn't they tell you, Jack?

502
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,500
It's great being a Guardian.

503
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,051
But there's a catch.

504
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,258
If enough kids stop believing,

505
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,658
everything your friends protect,

506
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,426
wonder, hopes and dreams,
it all goes away.

507
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,512
And little by little, so do they.

508
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,437
No Christmas or Easter,

509
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,356
or little fairies that come in the night.

510
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,946
There will be nothing
but fear and darkness.

511
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,738
And me.

512
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,450
It's your turn not to be believed in.

513
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,805
He's gone.

514
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,394
Okay, all right, I admit it.

515
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,316
You were right about Pitch.

516
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,235
I'm sorry about the fairies.

517
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,482
You should have seen them.
They put up such a fight.

518
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,319
Why would Pitch take the teeth?

519
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,829
It's not the teeth he wanted.

520
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,323
It's the memories inside them.

521
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,449
What do you mean?

522
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,327
That's why we collect the teeth, Jack.

523
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,173
They hold the most important memories
of childhood.

524
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,677
My fairies and I watch over them.

525
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,005
And when someone needs
to remember what's important,

526
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,432
we help them.

527
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,136
We had everyone's here.

528
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,976
Yours, too.

529
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,190
My memories?

530
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,859
From when you were young.

531
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,195
Before you became Jack Frost.

532
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,949
But I wasn't anyone before
I was Jack Frost.

533
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,034
Of course you were.

534
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,282
We were all someone
before we were chosen.

535
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,197
What?

536
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,803
You should have seen Bunny.

537
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,511
Hey, I told you never to mention that!

538
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,834
The night at the pond, I just...
I assumed...

539
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,048
Are you saying...

540
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,042
Are you saying I had a life before that,

541
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,629
with a home and a family?

542
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,799
You really don't remember?

543
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,386
All these years,
the answers were right here.

544
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,688
If I find my memories,
then I'll know why I'm here.

545
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,351
You have to show me!

546
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,854
I can't, Jack. Pitch has them.

547
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,569
Then we have to get them back!

548
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,360
Oh, no.

549
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,659
The children!

550
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,074
We're too late!

551
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,238
No! No!

552
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,207
No such thing as too late!

553
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,914
Hmm...

554
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,917
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

555
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,381
- Huh?

556
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,045
We will collect the teeth.

557
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,258
What?

558
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,928
We get teeth,
children keep believing in you!

559
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,100
We're talking seven continents
and millions of kids!

560
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,514
Give me break.

561
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,062
You know how many toys
I deliver in one night?

562
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,440
And eggs I hide in one day?

563
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,026
And, Jack, if you help us,

564
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,900
we will get you your memories.

565
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,949
Ugh!

566
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,788
I'm in.

567
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,413
Quickly! Quickly!

568
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,371
Hop to it, rabbit! I'm five teeth ahead!

569
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,797
Yeah, right.
Look, I'd tell you to stay out of my way,

570
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,131
but, really, what's the point?

571
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,379
'Cause you won't be
able to keep up anyway.

572
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,085
Is that a challenge, cottontail?

573
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,892
Oh, you don't want to
race a rabbit, mate.

574
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,716
A race? Is it a race?

575
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,552
This is going to be epic!

576
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,808
Four bicuspids over there!
An incisor two blocks east.

577
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,148
Is that a molar? They're everywhere!
Oh! Ow!

578
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,808
You Okay?

579
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,901
I'm fine. Sorry.

580
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,230
It's been a really long time
since I've been out in the field.

581
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,655
How long is a long time?

582
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,820
440 years, give or take.

583
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,611
- Hmm.

584
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,782
Ha!

585
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,287
Ahhh!

586
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,625
Twins!

587
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,253
- Oh, jackpot!

588
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,334
Looks like you're a bit of a brumby,
eh, mate?

589
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,301
- Is piece of pie.
- Ow!

590
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,348
That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy!

591
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,309
On!

592
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,944
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take it easy there, champ.

593
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,655
He's one of us!
Part of the European division. <i>Ca va?</i>

594
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,863
Huh?

595
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,708
Ha!

596
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,414
Crikey!

597
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,629
Yes!

598
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,877
No!

599
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,174
Ho, ho, ho.

600
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,848
Wow! You guys collect teeth
and leave gifts

601
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,770
as fast as my fairies.

602
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,156
You guys have been leaving gifts, right?

603
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,750
Ha!

604
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,935
The lights.

605
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,101
Why aren't they going out?

606
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,900
They're collecting the teeth?

607
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,900
Pipe down or I'll stuff a pillow with you!

608
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,831
Fine. Have your last hurrah.

609
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,412
For tomorrow,

610
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,119
all your pathetic scrambling
will be for nothing.

611
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,502
Left central incisor,

612
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,796
knocked out in
a freak sledding accident.

613
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,757
I wonder how that
could've happened, Jack.

614
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,590
Kids, huh?

615
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,930
This was always the part I liked most.

616
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,519
Seeing the kids.

617
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,440
Why did I ever stop doing this?

618
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,821
Hmm.

619
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,819
It's a little different up close, huh?

620
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,119
Thanks for being here, Jack.

621
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,621
I wish I'd known about your memory.

622
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,293
I could have helped you.

623
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,954
Yeah, well...

624
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,039
Look, let's just get you taken care of.

625
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,632
Then it's Pitch's turn.

626
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,947
Here you are!

627
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,129
Shh!

628
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,057
What gives, slowpokes?

629
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,892
How you feeling, Toothy?

630
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,103
- Believed in.

631
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,977
That's what I want to hear.

632
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,650
Oh, I see how it is. All working together

633
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,693
to make sure the rabbit gets last place.

634
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,197
You think I need help to beat a bunny?

635
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,032
Check it out, Peter Cottontail.

636
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,488
You call that a bag of choppers?

637
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,911
Now that's a bag of choppers.

638
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,951
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
This is about Tooth.

639
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,703
It's not a competition.

640
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,871
But if it was, I win! Yee-haw!

641
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,497
Oh, no.

642
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,545
Santa Claus?

643
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,907
- The Easter Bunny?

644
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,171
Sandman?

645
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,049
The Tooth Fairy! I knew you'd come!

646
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,517
Surprise! We came.

647
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,227
He can see us?

648
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,556
Most of us.

649
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,238
Shh! You guys, he's still awake.

650
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,774
Sandy, knock him out.

651
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,365
Huh?

652
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,721
With the Dreamsand, you gumbies!

653
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,780
No, stop!
That's the Easter Bunny!

654
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,373
What are you doing, Abbey? Down!

655
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,205
All right, nobody panic.

656
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,753
But that's a greyhound.

657
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,792
Do you know what
greyhounds do to rabbits?

658
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,799
I think it's a pretty safe bet
he's never met a rabbit like me.

659
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,259
Six-foot-one,

660
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,544
nerves of steel.

661
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,755
Master of tai-chi
and the ancient art of...

662
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,422
Crikey!

663
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,303
Stop! Sit!

664
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,551
Down, girl, down!

665
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,973
Whoa!

666
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,846
Sandy!

667
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,101
Sandy!

668
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,774
She's rabid!
Get this dingo off me!

669
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,947
Oh, no.

670
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,736
Candy canes...

671
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,074
Whoa!

672
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,284
Whoops.

673
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,415
Oh, I really wish
I had a camera right now.

674
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,140
Sandy, come on!
We can find Pitch!

675
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,443
Pretty.

676
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,992
Bunny, hop, hop. Hop!

677
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,326
Ooh!

678
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,702
Ow!

679
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,548
What... Huh?

680
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,463
Whoo!

681
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,845
Yes!

682
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,373
I got it.

683
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,540
Sandy!

684
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,542
Sandy, did you see that?

685
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,416
Look at this thing.

686
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,381
Frost?

687
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,260
You know, for a neutral party,

688
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,225
you spend an awful lot of time
with those weirdos.

689
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,727
This isn't your fight, Jack.

690
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,766
You made it my fight
when you stole those teeth!

691
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,516
Teeth? Why do you
care about the teeth?

692
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,405
Now this is who I'm looking for.

693
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,584
Remind me not to get on your bad side.

694
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,758
Okay, easy.
You can't blame me for trying, Sandy.

695
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,679
You don't know what it's like
to be weak and hated.

696
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,681
It was stupid of me
to mess with your dreams.

697
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,512
So, I'll tell you what.

698
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,439
You can have them back.

699
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,242
You take the ones on the left,

700
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,994
I'll take the ones on the right?

701
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,334
Boo!

702
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,672
Huh?

703
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,498
Come on!

704
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,010
You might want to duck.

705
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,187
We've got to help Sandy!

706
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,651
Yah!

707
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,408
No!

708
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,891
- Jack!

709
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,701
Don't fight the fear, little man!

710
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,130
Hurry! Hurry, Jack!

711
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:36,052
I'd say "sweet dreams,"
but there aren't any left.

712
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,226
Sandy?

713
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,436
No!

714
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:50,604
No!

715
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,633
- Jack!

716
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,259
Jack, how did you do that?

717
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:29,059
I didn't know I could.

718
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,779
Finally!

719
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,119
Someone who knows
how to have a little fun!

720
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,180
Are you all right?

721
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,347
I just...

722
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,426
I wish I could've done something.

723
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,723
Done something?

724
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,101
Jack, you stood up to Pitch.
You saved us!

725
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,352
But Sandy...

726
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,855
Would be proud of what you did.

727
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,486
I don't know who you were
in your past life.

728
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,532
But in this life, you are Guardian.

729
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:11,874
But how can I know who I am
until I find out who I was?

730
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,868
You will.

731
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,870
I feel it

732
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,750
in my belly.

733
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,718
Look how fast they're going out.

734
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,754
It's fear.

735
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,882
He's tipped the balance.

736
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,686
Hey, buck up, you sad sacks!

737
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,227
We can still turn this around!

738
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,230
Easter is tomorrow.

739
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:43,443
And I need your help.
I say we pull out all the stops

740
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:46,238
and we get those little lights
flickering again.

741
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,114
Bunny is right.

742
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,908
As much as it pains me
to say, old friend,

743
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,080
this time, Easter is more
important than Christmas.

744
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,584
Hey, did everyone hear that?

745
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,834
We must hurry to the warren.
Everyone! To the sleigh!

746
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:06,421
Oh, no, mate.
My warren, my rules. Buckle up.

747
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,430
- Shostakovich!

748
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,931
Oh!

749
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,978
"Buckle up." Is very funny.

750
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,947
Welcome to the warren.

751
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,744
Something's up.

752
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,431
Sophie?

753
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,137
- Elf, elf, elf!
- What is she doing here?

754
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,397
Ah, snow globe.

755
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,145
Crikey! Somebody do something.

756
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,480
Oh, don't look at me.
I'm invisible, remember?

757
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:03,982
Elf! Elf!

758
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,906
Don't worry, Bunny.
I bet she's a fairy fan.

759
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,949
- It's okay, little one.
- Pretty.

760
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,739
Oh! You know what?
I've got something for you!

761
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,287
Here it is!

762
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,285
Look at all the pretty teeth,

763
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,037
with little blood and gum on them!

764
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,246
Blood and gums?

765
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,501
When was the last time

766
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,674
you guys actually hung out with kids?

767
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,917
Peek-a-boo!

768
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,050
We are very busy bringing joy
to children.

769
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,013
- We don't have time...

770
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,887
- For children.
- Hmm.

771
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:38,809
If one little kid can ruin Easter,

772
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,655
then we're in worse shape
than I thought.

773
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,151
You want to paint some eggs? Yeah?

774
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,407
- Okay.
- Come on.

775
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,418
Rimsky-Korsakov!

776
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,045
That's a lot of eggs.

777
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,046
Uh, how much time do we have?

778
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,755
All right, troops,
it's time to push back.

779
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,932
That means eggs everywhere!

780
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,052
Heaps of you in every high-rise,

781
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,100
farmhouse, and trailer park!

782
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,107
In tennis shoes and cereal bowls.

783
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,523
Oh, there will be bathtubs filled
with my beautiful googies!

784
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,621
Okay, that's a little strange.

785
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,910
No, mate.

786
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,575
That's adorable.

787
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,505
There will be springtime!
On every continent!

788
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,129
And I'm bringing hope with me!

789
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,185
Too Christmas-y, mate.
Paint them blue.

790
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,145
Oh, what's over there?

791
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,944
Oh, that's a beauty!

792
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,530
Now, all we got to do is get him
and his little mates

793
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,323
through the tunnels to the top

794
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:16,160
and we'll have ourselves Easter.

795
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,915
Not bad.

796
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,260
Not bad yourself.

797
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,465
Look, I'm sorry about the whole...

798
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,684
You know, the kangaroo thing.

799
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,311
- It's the accent, isn't it?

800
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,976
Oh, poor little ankle-biter.
Look at her. All tuckered out.

801
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,773
I love her.

802
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,355
I think it's time to get her home.

803
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,652
How about I take her home?

804
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,739
- Jack, no. Pitch is...
- No match for this.

805
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,617
Which is why we need you here with us.

806
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,999
Trust me. I'll be quick as a bunny.

807
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,008
Ooh.

808
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,557
Sophie? Is that you?

809
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,065
We should get back.

810
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,527
<i>Jack!</i>

811
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,027
That voice, I know that voice.

812
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,525
<i>Jack!</i>

813
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,042
<i>Jack!</i>

814
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,590
<i>Jack!</i>

815
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,555
Don't worry, there's still time.

816
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,443
<i>Jack?</i>

817
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,959
Baby Tooth, come on!

818
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:31,245
I have to find out what that is.

819
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,593
Shh! Keep it down!

820
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,061
I'm gonna get you
out of here just as soon as...

821
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,262
<i>Jack?</i>

822
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,265
<i>Jack!</i>

823
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,609
...as I can.

824
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,951
- Looking for something?

825
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,918
Don't be afraid, Jack.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

826
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:14,126
Afraid? I'm not afraid of you.

827
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,128
Maybe not.
But you are afraid of something.

828
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,843
- You think so, huh?
- I know so!

829
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,089
It's the one thing I always know.

830
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,173
People's greatest fears.

831
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,511
Yours is that no one
will ever believe in you.

832
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:36,986
And worst of all,
you're afraid you'll never know why.

833
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,316
Why you?

834
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:43,113
Why were you chosen to be like this?

835
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,989
Well, fear not.

836
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,659
For the answer to that is right here.

837
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,120
Do you want them, Jack?
Your memories?

838
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,845
Everything you wanted to know,
in this little box.

839
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,478
Why did you end up like this? Unseen.

840
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,851
Unable to reach out to anyone.

841
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,560
You want the answers so badly.
You want to grab them

842
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,024
and fly off with them. But you're afraid

843
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,406
of what the Guardians will think.

844
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,490
You're afraid of disappointing them.

845
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,652
Well, let me ease your mind
about one thing.

846
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,162
They'll never accept you. Not really.

847
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,329
Stop it!

848
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,656
Stop it!

849
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,413
After all, you're not one of them.

850
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,081
You don't know what I am.

851
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,251
Of course I do! You're Jack Frost.

852
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,548
You make a mess wherever you go.

853
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,384
Why, you're doing it right now.

854
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,545
What did you do?

855
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,181
More to the point, Jack,
what did you do?

856
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,396
Baby Tooth!

857
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,403
<i>Happy Easter, Jack.</i>

858
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,409
No.

859
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,452
There aren't any eggs.

860
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,538
- There's nothing here.
- I give up.

861
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,331
- He didn't come.
- I don't understand.

862
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,956
Maybe he just hid them
really well this year.

863
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,116
- Kids, oh!
- I checked everywhere. There's nothing.

864
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,705
Yes, there is! There is!

865
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,256
I mean, these aren't
my best looking googies,

866
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:22,545
but they'll do in a pinch.

867
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,921
I can't believe it.

868
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,335
I know.

869
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,263
There's no such thing
as the Easter Bunny.

870
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,927
What? No.

871
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,971
Wrong! Not true!

872
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,540
- I'm right in front of you, mate.
- Why wouldn't he come?

873
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,765
They don't see me.

874
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,934
They don't see me.

875
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,490
Jack, where were you?

876
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,994
The Nightmares attacked the tunnels.

877
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:54,581
They smashed every egg,
crushed every basket.

878
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,000
Nothing made it to the surface.

879
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,002
Jack.

880
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:03,086
Where did you get that?

881
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,633
I was... It's...

882
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,088
Where's Baby Tooth?

883
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,513
Oh, Jack, what have you done?

884
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,183
That is why you weren't here?

885
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,852
You were with Pitch?

886
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,596
No, listen, listen.

887
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,191
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

888
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,226
- He has to go.
- What?

889
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,483
We should never have trusted you!

890
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,162
Easter is new beginnings, new life.

891
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,032
Easter's about hope.

892
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,622
And now it's gone.

893
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,690
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

894
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,358
Aah!

895
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,447
Let's check the park again.

896
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,655
- Really?
- For what? The Easter Bunny?

897
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,660
Guys, I told you, I saw him!

898
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,939
He's way bigger than I thought

899
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,992
and he's got these cool
boomerang things!

900
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,920
Grow up, Jamie.
- Oh, man. Seriously?

901
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,422
What's happened to you guys?

902
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,635
It was a dream!

903
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,839
You should be happy
you still get dreams like that

904
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,265
and not...

905
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,218
Nightmares.

906
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:42,889
Forget it, Jamie.

907
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,902
There's just no Easter this year.

908
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,271
He really is real!

909
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,407
I know he is.

910
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,429
I thought this might happen.

911
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,440
They never really believed in you.

912
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,810
I was just trying to show you that.

913
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,603
But I understand.

914
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,615
You don't understand anything!

915
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:37,445
No? I don't know what it's like
to be cast out?

916
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,950
To not be believed in?

917
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,250
To long for a family.

918
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,631
All those years in the shadows I thought

919
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,471
no one else knows what this feels like.

920
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,091
But now I see I was wrong.

921
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:04,054
We don't have to be alone, Jack.

922
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:08,142
I believe in you.
And I know children will, too.

923
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,272
In me?

924
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,649
Yes!

925
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,523
Look at what we can do.

926
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,493
What goes together
better than cold and dark?

927
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,283
We can make them believe.

928
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:23,992
We'll give them a world
where everything, everything is...

929
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,542
Pitch black?

930
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,828
And Jack Frost, too.

931
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,047
They'll believe in both of us.

932
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,668
No, they'll fear both of us.
And that's not what I want.

933
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,845
Now for the last time,

934
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,880
leave me alone.

935
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:46,021
Very well. You want to be left alone.
Done. But first...

936
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,309
Baby Tooth!

937
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,020
The staff, Jack!

938
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,567
You have a bad habit of interfering.

939
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:02,697
Now, hand it over, and I'll let her go.

940
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,547
All right.

941
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,219
Now let her go.

942
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,597
No.

943
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,138
You said you wanted to be alone.

944
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,723
So be alone!

945
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,189
No!

946
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,136
Baby Tooth!

947
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,597
You all right?

948
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,100
Sorry. All I can do is keep you cold.

949
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,150
Pitch was right.

950
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,942
I make a mess of everything.

951
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,446
Hey.

952
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,833
<i>Jack?</i>

953
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,132
<i>Jack!</i>

954
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,340
Oh!

955
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,962
<i>Jack!</i>

956
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:00,696
Come on, Jack,

957
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,111
you can't have fun all the time.

958
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,533
Jack, get down from there.

959
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,826
<i>- Jack!</i>
- You're funny, Jack.

960
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,993
- Be careful.

961
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,158
We will.

962
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,709
It's okay. It's okay.

963
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,178
Don't look down. Just look at me.

964
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,508
Jack.

965
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,472
I'm scared.

966
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,346
I know. I know.

967
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:35,353
But you're gonna be all right.
You're not gonna fall in.

968
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:38,189
We're gonna have a little fun instead!

969
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,694
No, we're not!

970
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,188
Would I trick you?

971
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,072
Yes! You always play tricks!

972
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,486
All right.

973
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,284
Well, not this time.

974
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,578
I promise, I promise. You're gonna be...

975
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,580
You're gonna be fine.

976
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,699
You have to believe in me.

977
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:58,083
You want to play a game?
We're gonna play hopscotch!

978
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,501
Like we play every day.

979
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,333
It's as easy as

980
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,214
one...

981
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,674
Whoa!

982
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,555
- Two.

983
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,340
Three!

984
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,718
All right.

985
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,394
Now it's your turn.

986
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:14,645
- One...

987
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,098
That's it, that's it.

988
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,769
Two.

989
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:18,983
Three!

990
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,357
- Whoa!

991
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,068
Jack!

992
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,473
Did you see... Did you see that?

993
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,263
It was me!

994
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,558
I had a family! I had a sister!

995
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,601
I saved her!

996
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,318
That's why you chose me.

997
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,077
I'm a Guardian.

998
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,076
We have to get out of here.

999
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:28,799
Okay.

1000
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,383
Come on, Baby Tooth, I owe you one!

1001
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,787
Come on! Let's go!

1002
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,991
What's wrong?

1003
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,832
None of you can fly?

1004
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,540
The lights.

1005
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,562
You're all free to go!

1006
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,478
We won't be needing
any Christmas toys this year,

1007
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,025
thank you.

1008
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:25,856
Nor ever again.

1009
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,651
They're all going out.

1010
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,661
Only six left.

1011
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,535
Six precious children

1012
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:41,201
who still believe in the Guardians
with all their hearts.

1013
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,457
Make that

1014
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:44,662
five.

1015
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,040
Oh!

1016
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,921
Four.

1017
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,048
Three!

1018
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,216
Two!

1019
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,563
One.

1020
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,064
Jamie.

1021
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,947
Okay, look.

1022
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,871
You and I are obviously
at what they call a crossroads.

1023
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,948
So here's what's gonna happen.

1024
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:25,120
If it wasn't a dream and if you are real

1025
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:29,712
then you have to prove it, like, right now.

1026
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,765
I've believed in you
for a long time, okay?

1027
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:44,264
Like, my whole life, in fact.

1028
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,607
So you kind of owe me now.

1029
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:50,570
You don't have to do much.
Just a little sign so I know.

1030
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,449
Anything.

1031
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,450
Anything at all.

1032
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,951
I knew it.

1033
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:37,943
He's real!

1034
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:47,957
Whoa!

1035
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,050
Whoa!

1036
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,838
Snow?

1037
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,186
Jack Frost.

1038
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:11,233
Did he just say...

1039
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,194
Jack Frost?

1040
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:16,197
He said it again. He said...

1041
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,361
You said...

1042
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,699
Jack Frost!

1043
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,113
That's right!

1044
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:27,042
But that's me! Jack Frost!
That's my name!

1045
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,039
You said my name!

1046
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,582
Wait. Can you hear me?

1047
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,214
Can you...

1048
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,091
Can you see me?

1049
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,763
He sees me! He sees me!

1050
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,397
- You just made it snow!
- I know!

1051
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,102
- In my room!
- I know!

1052
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,726
- You're real?
- Yeah!

1053
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,611
Who do you think brings you
all the blizzards and the snow days?

1054
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,901
And you remember when you went
flying on that sled the other day?

1055
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,737
- That was you?
- That was me!

1056
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,279
- Cool!
- Right?

1057
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,823
But what about the Easter Bunny?
And the Tooth Fairy?

1058
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,282
Real, real, real! Every one of us is real.

1059
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,498
I knew it!

1060
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,996
Jamie, who are you talking to?

1061
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,202
Um...

1062
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:14,588
Jack Frost?

1063
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,296
Okay.

1064
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,308
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1065
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,941
Ah, <i>moi deti!</i>
Come back!

1066
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,526
- North, are you okay?
- Is official.

1067
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,945
- My powers are kaput.

1068
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,609
Look!

1069
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,617
Jack!

1070
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:45,449
Are you okay?

1071
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,122
What are you doing here?

1072
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,283
Same as you.

1073
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,712
The last light.

1074
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,633
Wow. It is you! I mean, it is you!

1075
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,969
I knew it wasn't a dream!

1076
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,049
Jack, he sees you.

1077
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,053
Wait. But where's Bunny?

1078
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:13,231
Losing Easter took its toll on all of us.

1079
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,316
Bunny most of all.

1080
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,481
Oh, no.

1081
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,118
That's the Easter Bunny?

1082
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,908
Now somebody sees me!

1083
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,115
Where were you about an hour ago,
mate?

1084
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,624
What happened to him?

1085
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,501
He used to be huge and cool.
And now he's...

1086
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,329
Cute.

1087
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,627
Oh, that's good.

1088
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,088
Did you tell him to say that? That's it!

1089
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,340
Let's go! Me and you! Come on!

1090
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,846
No. Actually, he told me you were real.

1091
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,471
Just when I started to think
that maybe you weren't.

1092
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,427
He made you believe?

1093
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,646
In me?

1094
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:10,204
Get Jamie out of here.

1095
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,031
Be careful, Jack.

1096
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:17,203
Jack Frost.

1097
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,206
Let's end this, shall we?

1098
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,125
- Aah!

1099
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,346
That little trick doesn't work
on me anymore.

1100
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:33,686
This way, this way.

1101
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,773
Ahh, dead end. Other way, other way!

1102
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:41,727
Jack!

1103
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,615
That was good try, Jack. "A" for effort.

1104
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,406
He's stronger. I can't beat him.

1105
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,406
Aw!

1106
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:58,077
All this fuss over one little boy,

1107
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,168
and still he refuses to stop believing.

1108
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,091
Very well. There are other ways

1109
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,252
to snuff out a light.

1110
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,923
If you want him, you're gonna have
to go through me.

1111
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,593
Look how fluffy you are.

1112
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,062
Would you like a scratch behind
the ears?

1113
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:18,338
Don't you even think about it.

1114
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,017
I can't tell you how happy it makes me

1115
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,068
to see you all like this.

1116
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,823
You look awful.

1117
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,456
Jack. I'm scared.

1118
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,122
<i>Jack. I'm scared.</i>

1119
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,674
I know, I know.

1120
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,678
But you're gonna be all right.

1121
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,424
We're gonna have a little fun instead.

1122
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,974
That's it! That's my center!

1123
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,141
So what do you think, Jamie?

1124
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,313
Do you believe in the Boogey...

1125
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,325
Now let's go get your friends.

1126
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,536
Ohh!

1127
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,667
- Whoa!

1128
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,004
Cool!

1129
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,898
Oh.

1130
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,405
Jamie, how are you doing that?

1131
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:00,199
Jack Frost!
Come on, we need your help!

1132
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,329
Hey, is that...

1133
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:06,042
Jack Frost!

1134
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:10,251
Huh?

1135
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,592
- Merry Christmas!
- Happy Easter!

1136
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,055
Don't forget to floss!

1137
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,722
- Cupcake?
- What?

1138
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:22,730
Jamie, you were right!

1139
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:24,565
The Easter Bunny's real!

1140
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,283
- The Tooth Fairy!
- And Santa!

1141
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:27,689
They're all real!

1142
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,117
Whoo! Yeah!

1143
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:45,248
You think a few children can help you?
Against this?

1144
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,087
They're just bad dreams, Jamie.

1145
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,257
And we'll protect you, mate.

1146
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,597
Aw, you'll protect them?

1147
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,434
But who will protect you?

1148
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,281
I will.

1149
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,112
I will.

1150
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,411
- I will.
- I will.

1151
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,122
And me.

1152
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,786
I'll try.

1153
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:32,296
Still think there's no such thing
as the Boogeyman?

1154
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:43,977
I do believe in you.
I'm just not afraid of you.

1155
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,200
Huh?

1156
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,667
Yeah, Tooth Fairy!

1157
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,788
A-ha!

1158
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,338
Oh. Yeah!

1159
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,296
No! Get them!

1160
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,460
DO your jobs!

1161
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:18,425
Oh, yeah, come on, come on.

1162
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:19,551
Oh, crikey!

1163
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,520
No way!

1164
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,187
I'm just a bunny!

1165
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,312
G'day, mate.

1166
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,413
Whoa!

1167
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,245
Come on! Whoo-hoo!

1168
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,333
Let's get them!

1169
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,713
Come on, guys, we can do it!

1170
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,896
It's all ours, mate.

1171
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,602
- Thanks, Tooth.

1172
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:17,067
Ho, ho, ho.

1173
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:21,738
Wrong roof.

1174
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:39,961
Look at that!

1175
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,716
I got it!

1176
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:44,765
I know what we have to do.
Guys, come on.

1177
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:46,763
It's over, Pitch.

1178
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,802
There's no place to hide.

1179
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:58,945
Jack, look out!

1180
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:19,629
The Sandman!

1181
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:31,308
Mate, you are a sight for sore eyes.

1182
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,362
Hmm.

1183
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,667
Pretty!

1184
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,805
Your center?

1185
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:50,048
Hmm?

1186
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,134
It took a while,

1187
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:53,931
but I figured it out.

1188
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:05,731
- Oh...
- Oh!

1189
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,491
You're all on naughty list!

1190
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,944
Bunny, think fast!

1191
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,666
No.

1192
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:24,128
You dare have fun in my presence?

1193
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:29,259
I am the Boogeyman
and you will fear me!

1194
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,926
No! No.

1195
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,115
Leaving the party so soon?

1196
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:50,651
You didn't even say goodbye.

1197
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,287
A quarter?

1198
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,953
And that's for my fairies.

1199
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:04,753
You can't get rid of me! Not forever.

1200
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:07,004
There will always be fear.

1201
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:11,593
So what? As long as one child believes,

1202
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:14,642
we will be here to fight fear.

1203
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:18,637
Really? Then what are they doing here?

1204
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:25,068
They can't be my Nightmares.
I'm not afraid.

1205
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,699
Looks like it's your fear they smell.

1206
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:45,919
No, no, no. No!

1207
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,339
No!

1208
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,864
Are you ready now, Jack?
To make it official.

1209
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,746
Then is time you take Oath.

1210
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,543
Will you, Jack Frost,

1211
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:27,706
vow to watch over
the children of the world,

1212
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:29,549
to guard them with your life,

1213
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,595
their hopes, their wishes,
and their dreams,

1214
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:36,761
for they are all that we have,
all that we are,

1215
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:39,476
and all that we will ever be?

1216
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,641
I will.

1217
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:50,488
Then, congratulations,
Jack Frost, for you are now,

1218
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,690
and forevermore,

1219
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:54,116
a Guardian.

1220
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:04,972
- That's my boy.

1221
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:11,750
Keep it together, girls.

1222
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:17,923
You guys, look!

1223
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,809
- That's Santa's sleigh.
- Wow, it's real!

1224
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,846
You guys see that?

1225
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,561
Everyone loves the sleigh.

1226
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,439
Wow, look at that!

1227
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,271
Time to go.

1228
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,322
It's beautiful.

1229
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,411
Happy Easter, you little ankle-biter.

1230
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,711
I'm gonna miss you.

1231
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:50,797
Bye-bye, Bunny.

1232
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,466
You're leaving?

1233
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,343
But what if Pitch comes back?

1234
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,839
What if we stop believing again?
If I can't see you...

1235
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,717
Hey, slow down, slow down.

1236
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,428
You're telling me you stop believing in
the moon when the sun comes up?

1237
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:05,603
No.

1238
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,852
Okay. Well, do you stop
believing in the sun

1239
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,395
when clouds block it out?

1240
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,896
No.

1241
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:15,322
We'll always be there, Jamie. And now,

1242
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,733
we'll always be here.

1243
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:22,534
Which kind of makes you
a Guardian, too.

1244
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:29,995
Jack!

1245
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,383
Yah!

1246
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,611
<i>My name is Jack Frost.</i>

1247
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,442
<i>And I'm a Guardian.</i>

1248
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,152
<i>How do I know that?</i>

1249
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:04,533
<i>Because the moon told me so.</i>

1250
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,083
<i>So when the moon tells you something,</i>

1251
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:10,828
<i>believe it.</i>
