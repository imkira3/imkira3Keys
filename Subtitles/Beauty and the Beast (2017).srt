2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,956
Once upon a time,
in the hidden heart of France...

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,954
a handsome young prince...

4
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,954
lived in a beautiful castle.

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,756
Poof! Poof!

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,320
Although he had
everything his heart desired...

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,473
the prince was selfish and unkind.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,313
Master, it's time.

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,635
He taxed the village...

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,798
to fill his castle with
the most beautiful objects.

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,680
And his parties with
the most beautiful people.

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,351
Oh, how divine

13
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,478
Glamour, music and magic combine

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,871
See the maidens so anxious to shine

15
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,513
Look for a sign that enhances chances

16
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,474
She'll be his special one

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,639
What a display

18
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,310
What a breathtaking, thrilling array

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,314
Ev'ry prince
Ev'ry dog has his day

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,639
Let us sing with passion,
gusto, fit to bust, oh

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,116
Not a care in the world

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,840
Then one night...

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,152
an unexpected intruder arrived
at the castle...

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,671
seeking shelter from the bitter storm.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,396
As a gift, she offered
the prince, a single rose.

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,592
Repulsed by her haggard appearance...

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,510
the prince turned the woman away.

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,790
Hmm.

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,709
But she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances.

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,112
For beauty is found within.

31
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,952
When he dismissed her again...

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,595
the old woman's outward
appearance melted away.

33
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,630
To reveal...

34
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,633
a beautiful enchantress.

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,951
The prince begged for forgiveness,

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,599
but it was too late.

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,632
For she had seen that
there was no love in his heart.

38
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,599
Chip! Chip! Oh, my!

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,076
As punishment...

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,360
she transformed him into a hideous beast.

41
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,439
And placed a powerful spell
on the castle...

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,079
and all who lived there.

43
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,277
As days bled into years...

44
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,797
the prince and his servants
were forgotten by the world.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
For the enchantress had erased
all memory of them...

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,038
from the minds of the people they loved.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,831
But the rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,117
If he could learn to love another...

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,990
and earn their love in return
by the time the last petal fell...

50
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,800
the spell would be broken.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,672
If not, he would be doomed to
remain a beast for all time.

52
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,349
As the years passed...

53
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,479
he fell into despair and lost all hope.

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,634
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

55
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,393
Little town
It's a quiet village

56
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,230
Ev'ry day like the one before

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,074
Little town
Full of little people

58
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,476
Waking up to say

59
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,072
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

60
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,190
Bonjour!

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,115
There goes the baker
with his tray like always

62
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,199
The same old bread and rolls to sell

63
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,233
Every morning just the same

64
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,113
Since the morning that we came

65
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,714
To this poor provincial town

66
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,394
Good morning, Belle!

67
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,230
Good morning, Monsieur Jean!
Have you lost something again?

68
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,555
Well, I believe I have.

69
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,393
The problem is, I can't remember what!

70
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,874
Oh, well. I'm sure it will come to me.

71
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,356
Where are you off to?

72
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,872
To return this book to Père Robert.

73
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,997
It's about two lovers in fair Verona.

74
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,270
Sounds boring.

75
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Look there she goes
That girl is strange, no question

76
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,277
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell?

77
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,399
Never part of any crowd

78
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,073
'Cause her head's up on some cloud

79
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,870
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,230
Bonjour, good day, how is your family?

81
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,512
Bonjour, good day, how is your wife?

82
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,639
I need six eggs
That's too expensive

83
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,272
There must be more
than this provincial life

84
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,800
Ah, if it isn't the only bookworm in town.

85
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,759
So, where did you run off to this week?

86
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,434
Two cities in Northern Italy.

87
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,119
I didn't want to come back!

88
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,118
Have you got any new places to go?

89
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,230
I'm afraid not.

90
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,391
But you may reread any of
the old ones that you'd like.

91
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,471
Thank you.

92
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,840
Your library makes
our small corner of the world feel big.

93
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,189
Bye.

94
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,430
Look, there she goes
The girl is so peculiar

95
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,955
I wonder if she's feeling well

96
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,470
With a dreamy far off look
And her nose stuck in a book

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,236
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

98
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,831
Oh! Isn't this amazing

99
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,071
It's my favorite part because you'll see

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,678
Here's where she meets Prince Charming

101
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,759
But she won't discover that it's him

102
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,513
'Til chapter three

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,437
Now it's no wonder
That her name means "beauty"

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,072
Her looks have got no parallel

105
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,830
But behind that fair façade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,798
Very different from the rest of us

107
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,872
She's nothing like the rest of us

108
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,271
Yes, different from the rest of us

109
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,033
Is Belle

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,195
Look at her, LeFou.

111
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,111
My future wife.

112
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,715
Belle is the most
beautiful girl in the village.

113
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,433
That makes her the best.

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,552
But she's so well-read.

115
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,478
And you're so...

116
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,200
- athletically inclined.
- I know.

117
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,110
Belle can be as argumentative
as she is beautiful.

118
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,874
Exactly! Who needs her when you've got us!

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,440
Yes...

120
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,920
But ever since the war,

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,037
I've felt like
I've been missing something.

122
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,835
And she's the only girl
that gives me that sense of...

123
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,919
I don't know what that means.

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,560
Right from the moment

125
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,075
When I met her, saw her

126
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,955
I said she's gorgeous and I fell

127
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,199
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me

128
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,990
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

129
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,673
Look there he goes

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,993
Isn't he dreamy

131
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,517
Monsieur Gaston, oh, he's so cute

132
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,233
Be still, my heart
I'm hardly breathing

133
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,037
He's such a tall, dark
Strong and handsome brute

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,595
It's never gonna happen, ladies.

135
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,230
- Bonjour
- Pardon

136
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,356
- Good day
- Mais, oui

137
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,113
- You call this bacon
- What lovely flowers

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,270
- Some cheese
- Ten yards

139
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,430
- One pound
- 'Scuse me

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,159
- I'll get the knife
- Please let me through

141
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,191
- This bread
- Those fish

142
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,270
- It's stale
- They smell

143
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,669
- Madame's mistaken
- Well, maybe so

144
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,678
There must be more
than this provincial life

145
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,353
Good morning

146
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,511
Just watch I'm going to make Belle my wife

147
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,478
Oh! Good morning

148
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,230
Look there she goes
A girl who's strange but special

149
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,632
A most peculiar mademoiselle

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,515
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

151
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,230
But she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl

152
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,316
She really is a funny girl

153
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,316
That Belle

154
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,994
Good morning, Belle!

155
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,073
Wonderful book you have there.

156
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,994
Have you read it?

157
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,315
Well, not that one.
But, you know, books...

158
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,272
For your dinner table.

159
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,794
Shall I join you this evening?

160
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,516
Sorry, not this evening.

161
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,080
Busy?

162
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,670
No...

163
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,512
So, moving on?

164
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,000
No, LeFou.

165
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,113
It's the ones who play hard to get

166
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,953
that are always the sweetest prey.

167
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,799
That's what makes Belle so appealing.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,229
She hasn't made a fool of herself

169
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,198
just to gain my favor.

170
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,874
What would you call that?

171
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,400
Dignity?

172
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,398
It's outrageously attractive, isn't it?

173
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,476
Gaston!

174
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,789
Mmm.

175
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,070
Mmm.

176
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,840
How does a moment last forever

177
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,874
How can a story never die

178
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,758
It is love we must hold on to

179
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,956
Never easy but we try

180
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,231
Sometimes our happiness is captured

181
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,600
Somehow a time and place stand still

182
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,915
Love lives on inside our hearts

183
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,719
And always will

184
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,910
Oh.

185
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,234
Belle.

186
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,550
Hmm.

187
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,434
Could you...

188
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,510
Hand me a...

189
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,999
Thank you.

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,116
And I also need...

191
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,431
No. No. No.

192
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,630
Actually...

193
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,275
yes, that's exactly
what I need. Thank you.

194
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,757
- Papa, do you think I'm odd?
- Odd?

195
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,118
My daughter? Odd?

196
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,953
Where did you get an idea like that?

197
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,113
I don't know. People talk.

198
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,396
This is a small village, you know.

199
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,631
Small minded as well.

200
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,597
But small also means safe.

201
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,834
Even back in Paris,

202
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,151
I knew a girl like you, who was so...

203
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,632
ahead of her time.

204
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,678
So different.

205
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,429
People mocked her.

206
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,877
Until the day they all found
themselves imitating her.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,640
Please, just tell me
one more thing about her.

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,037
Your mother was...

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,116
fearless.

210
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,200
Fearless.

211
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,717
So...

212
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,591
what can I bring you from the market?

213
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,395
A rose. Like the one in the painting.

214
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,398
You ask for that every year!

215
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,233
And every year you bring it.

216
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,549
Then I shall bring you another.

217
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,198
You have my word.

218
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,840
- Goodbye, Papa.
- Goodbye, Belle.

219
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,232
Come on, Philippe.

220
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,590
You know the way.

221
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,910
I'll see you tomorrow!

222
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,397
Right. Tomorrow, with the rose.

223
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,353
Stay safe.

224
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,233
What are you doing?

225
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,270
The laundry.

226
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,360
Come! Come!

227
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,318
"The blue bird..."

228
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,676
"That flies...

229
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,109
"over the dark...

230
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,520
"wood."

231
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,790
That was amazing!

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,151
What on earth are you doing?

233
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,676
Teaching another girl to read?

234
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,837
Isn't one enough?

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,639
We have to do something.

236
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,717
You are the wildest...

237
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,639
most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.

238
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,520
Nobody deserves you.

239
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,354
But at least I know
our children will be beautiful.

240
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,796
Am I catching you at a bad time?

241
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,634
- What is it, LeFou?
- A certain damsel is in distress.

242
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,918
Ah. It's hero time.

243
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,598
I'm not done with you yet.

244
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,316
Me, neither.

245
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,717
Belle! I heard you had trouble
with the Headmaster.

246
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,360
He never liked me either.

247
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,477
Can I give you a little advice
about the villagers though?

248
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,712
They're never going to trust
the kind of change you're trying to bring.

249
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,360
All I wanted was to teach a child to read.

250
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,950
The only children you should
concern yourself with...

251
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,836
are your own.

252
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,395
I'm...

253
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,477
not ready to have children.

254
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,233
Maybe you haven't met the right man.

255
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,472
It's a small village, Gaston.
I've met them all.

256
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,915
Well, maybe you should take another look.

257
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,793
Some of us have changed.

258
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,871
Gaston...

259
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,117
we could never make each other happy.

260
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,359
No one can change that much.

261
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,556
Oh, Belle.

262
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,957
Do you know what happens
to spinsters in this village

263
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,230
after their fathers die?

264
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,232
Coins? Got any spare coins?

265
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,393
They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe.

266
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,075
This is our world, Belle.

267
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,315
For simple folk like us,
it doesn't get any better.

268
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,159
I might be a farm girl.

269
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,755
But, I'm not simple...

270
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,834
and I'm never going to marry you, Gaston.

271
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,956
I'm sorry!

272
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,953
Can you imagine?

273
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,999
Me? The wife of that boorish...

274
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,110
brainless...

275
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,476
Madame Gaston, can't you just see it

276
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,240
Madame Gaston, his little wife

277
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,356
Ugh!

278
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,678
No, sir, not me, I guarantee it

279
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,834
I want much more than this provincial life

280
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,155
I want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

281
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,994
I want it more than I can tell

282
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,074
And for once it might be grand

283
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,080
To have someone understand

284
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,197
I want so much more
Than they've got planned

285
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,351
The woods are lovely.

286
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,353
I only wish I recognized them.

287
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,712
Do you know where we are,
Philippe? Because I don't.

288
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,714
It's all right. It's all right, Philippe.

289
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,520
Hmm.

290
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,311
Yes, we can go this way.

291
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,153
Go on. To the right.

292
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,951
That's it. Steady!

293
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,554
Walk on!

294
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,155
One path closes...

295
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,560
another one opens.

296
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,749
It's all right, boy.
It's just a bit of snow.

297
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,439
In June.

298
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,710
Mind your step.

299
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,880
It's slippery.

300
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,109
Go! Go, Philippe! Come on! Come on!

301
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,317
Whoa.

302
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,634
Come on!

303
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,119
Go! Philippe, go! Go, go!

304
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,394
Whoa!

305
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,234
Philippe!

306
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,074
Good boy.

307
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,272
Go, boy. Go!

308
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,557
Oh, Philippe, you saved my life.

309
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,279
Well done. Yes.

310
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,360
They'll have to get
their dinner somewhere else,

311
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,675
won't they?

312
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,269
Look!

313
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,590
There's hay.

314
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,316
And water.

315
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,995
You're all set, my old friend.

316
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,279
I'll go pay my respects
to our unwitting host.

317
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,151
Whoever that may be.

318
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,150
Hmm.

319
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,995
Thank you.

320
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,995
Thank...

321
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,870
Hello?

322
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,880
Hello?

323
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,633
Sorry to intrude.

324
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,837
I'm just a traveler...

325
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,909
seeking shelter from the storm.

326
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,392
Sorry to disturb you.

327
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,474
Anyone home?

328
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,960
Anyone awake?

329
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,553
He must have lost his way in the woods.

330
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,632
Shut up, you idiot!

331
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,919
Excuse me?

332
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,793
Hmm.

333
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,718
Beautiful.

334
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,919
Extraordinary.

335
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,710
A man of taste.

336
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,439
He was talking about me.

337
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,156
Oops!

338
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,273
Well, wherever you are...

339
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,916
I'm just going to warm myself by the fire.

340
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,720
That's better.

341
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,513
Oh, much better.

342
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,790
Ooh.

343
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,360
Thank you.

344
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,072
Mum said I wasn't supposed to move
because it might be scary.

345
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,990
Sorry.

346
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,073
It's all right.

347
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,350
I, uh...

348
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,077
I cannot...

349
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,356
thank you enough for your hospitality.

350
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,394
I'll...

351
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,039
bid you adieu...

352
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,757
and good night.

353
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,515
Come on, Philippe! Go! Go!

354
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,238
No, wait, wait, wait!

355
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,192
Roses. I nearly forgot.

356
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,719
We're safe here.

357
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,512
I promised Belle a rose.

358
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,591
There!

359
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,791
Philippe!

360
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,270
What happened?

361
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,034
Where's Papa?

362
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,470
Take me to him!

363
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,992
Look, Cogsworth.

364
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,520
A beautiful girl!

365
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,036
Yes! I can see it's a girl.

366
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,199
I lost my hands, not my eyes.

367
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,839
But what if she is the one?

368
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,633
The one who'll break the spell?

369
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,590
Who said that?

370
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,871
Who's there?

371
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,070
Uh-oh.

372
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,995
Papa?

373
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,634
Papa, is that you?

374
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,876
Belle!

375
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,599
How did you find me?

376
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,599
Your hands are ice.

377
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,915
We need to get you home.

378
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,077
Belle, you must leave here at once!

379
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,795
This castle is alive!

380
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,513
Now go, before he finds you!

381
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,670
Who?

382
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,439
Who's there?

383
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Who are you?

384
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,558
Who are you?

385
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,831
I've come for my father.

386
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,433
Your father is a thief.

387
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,034
Liar!

388
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,349
He stole a rose.

389
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,153
I asked for the rose.

390
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,760
Punish me, not him.

391
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,872
No! He means forever.

392
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,039
Apparently, that's what
happens around here

393
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,316
when you pick a flower.

394
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,156
A life sentence for a rose?

395
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,360
I received eternal damnation for one.

396
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,756
I'm merely locking him away.

397
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,518
Now, do you still wish
to take your father's place?

398
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,994
Come into the light.

399
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,950
Choose.

400
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,390
Belle, I won't let you do this.

401
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,073
I lost your mother.

402
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,470
I won't lose you, too.

403
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,074
Now, go.

404
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,879
Go!

405
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,271
All right, Papa. I'll leave.

406
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,079
I need a minute alone with him.

407
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,916
Are you so cold-hearted...

408
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,834
you won't allow a daughter
to kiss her father goodbye?

409
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,351
Forever can spare a minute.

410
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,591
When this door closes,
it will not open again.

411
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,759
I should have been with you.

412
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,951
Oh, no, no. Belle, listen to me.

413
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,959
It's all right.

414
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,554
Now go.

415
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Live your life.

416
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,880
And forget me.

417
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,440
Forget you?

418
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,438
Everything I am is because of you.

419
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,153
I love you, Belle.

420
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,549
Don't be afraid.

421
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,192
I love you too, Papa.

422
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,559
I'm not afraid.

423
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,959
And I will escape. I promise.

424
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,390
What?

425
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,875
You took his place.

426
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,553
He's my father.

427
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,120
He's a fool.

428
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,398
And so are you.

429
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,710
Belle...

430
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,036
Papa!

431
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,918
Don't hurt him!

432
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,229
- Papa!
- No!

433
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,590
I'll come back!

434
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,589
I promise!

435
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,991
Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle...

436
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,153
but I have come to escort you
to your room.

437
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,993
My room?

438
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,234
- But I thought...
- Oh, what?

439
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,075
That "Once this door closes
it will not open again"?

440
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,117
I know.

441
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,310
He gets so dramatic.

442
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,119
Hello.

443
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,710
Ooh!

444
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,880
Oh, you are very strong.

445
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,679
This is a great quality.

446
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,396
What are you?

447
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,155
I am Lumière!

448
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,670
And you can talk?

449
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,991
Well, of course he can talk.

450
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,159
It's all he ever does.

451
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,355
Now, Lumière, as head of the household...

452
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,153
I demand that you put her
back in her cell at once.

453
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,471
What do you want to be
for the rest of your life, Cogsworth?

454
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,319
A man, or a mantle clock?

455
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,276
Ready, miss?

456
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,592
- Trust me.
- Oh...

457
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,835
You must forgive first impressions.

458
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,150
I hope you are not too startled.

459
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,152
Why would I be startled?

460
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,191
I'm talking to a candle.

461
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,993
Candelabra, please.

462
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,435
Enormous difference.

463
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,910
But consider me at your service.
The castle is your home now...

464
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,958
so feel free to go anywhere you like.

465
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,000
Except the west wing.

466
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,353
Which we do not have.

467
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,949
Why? What's in the west wing?

468
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,110
- Oh, nothing.
- Nothing.

469
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,475
- Storage space.
- Storage space.

470
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,756
- That's it.
- That's it.

471
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,870
Yes, that's it.

472
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
This way, please. To the east wing.

473
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,395
Or as I like to call it, the only wing.

474
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,631
Watch your step, s'il vous plaît!

475
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,591
Welcome to your new home.

476
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,518
It's modest, but comfortable.

477
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,638
It's beautiful.

478
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,120
But of course!

479
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,709
Master wanted you to have
the finest room in the castle.

480
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,555
Oh, dear. We were not expecting guests.

481
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,471
Enchantée, mademoiselle.

482
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,275
Don't worry.

483
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,154
I'll have this place spotless in no time.

484
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,591
This plan of yours is dangerous.

485
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,798
I would risk anything
to kiss you again, Plumette.

486
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,515
No, my love. I've been
burned by you before.

487
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,511
We must be strong.

488
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,036
How can I be strong
when you make me so weak?

489
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,674
Is everything here alive?

490
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,237
Hello. What's your name?

491
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,192
That is a hairbrush.

492
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,113
Do not be alarmed.

493
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,356
This is just your wardrobe.

494
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,070
Meet Madame De Garderobe. A great singer.

495
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,753
When she can stay awake.

496
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,551
Cogsworth! A diva needs her beauty rest.

497
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,711
Stay with us, Madame.

498
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,314
We have someone for you to dress!

499
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,636
Finally...

500
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,792
a woman.

501
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,951
Pretty eyes.

502
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,951
Proud face.

503
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,958
Perfect canvas. Yes!

504
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,477
I will find you something
worthy of a princess.

505
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,676
Oh, I'm not a princess.

506
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,990
Nonsense!

507
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,794
Now, let's see
what I've got in my drawers.

508
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,515
Oh!

509
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
How embarrassing.

510
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,038
Froufrou, come help Mama.

511
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,471
Subtle. Understated. I love it!

512
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,998
Froufrou, send my love to the maestro.

513
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,033
Picture it, LeFou.

514
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,594
A rustic cabin...

515
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,360
my latest kill roasting on the fire...

516
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,399
adorable children running
around us as my love...

517
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,679
rubs my tired feet.

518
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,592
But what does Belle say?

519
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,229
"I will never marry you, Gaston!"

520
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,790
You know, there are other girls.

521
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,676
A great hunter doesn't
waste his time on rabbits.

522
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,918
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston

523
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,072
Looking so down in the dumps

524
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,393
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston

525
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,519
Even when taking your lumps

526
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,553
There's no man in town as admired as you

527
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,633
You're everyone's favorite guy

528
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,990
Everyone's awed and inspired by you

529
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,758
And it's not very hard to see why

530
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,800
No one's slick as Gaston

531
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,593
No one's quick as Gaston

532
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,191
No one's neck's as
incredibly thick as Gaston

533
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,671
For there's no man in town half as manly

534
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,117
Perfect, a pure paragon

535
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,119
You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley

536
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,275
And they'll tell you
whose team they prefer to be on

537
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,356
Who plays

538
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,550
Darts like Gaston?

539
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,473
- Who breaks
- Hearts like Gaston?

540
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,439
Who's much more than the sum
of his parts like Gaston?

541
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,759
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating

542
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,958
My, what a guy, that Gaston

543
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,474
I needed encouragement

544
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,954
Thank you, LeFou

545
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,359
Well, there's no one
As easy to bolster as you

546
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,390
Too much?

547
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,755
Yep!

548
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,159
No one fights like Gaston

549
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,913
Douses lights like Gaston

550
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,835
In a wrestling match
Nobody bites like Gaston

551
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,520
When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver

552
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,591
And beasts of the field say a prayer

553
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,470
Aah...

554
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,516
First I carefully aim for the liver

555
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,556
Then I shoot from behind

556
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,790
Is that fair?

557
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,280
I don't care

558
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,033
No one hits like Gaston

559
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,480
Matches wits like Gaston

560
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,440
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

561
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,070
I'm especially good at expectorating

562
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,998
Ooh!

563
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,678
Ten points for Gaston!

564
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,519
Thank you. Thank you.

565
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,318
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

566
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,120
Every morning to help me get large

567
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,032
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs

568
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,194
So I'm roughly the size of a barge

569
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,679
Hey! Hey!

570
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,031
Hey!

571
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,270
Hey!

572
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,871
Hey!

573
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,872
Hey! Hey!

574
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,117
Hey! Hey! Hey!

575
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,114
Who has brains

576
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,190
Like Gaston

577
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,794
- Entertains
- Like Gaston

578
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,989
Who can make up
these endless refrains like Gaston

579
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,720
I use antlers in all of my decorating

580
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,632
Say it again

581
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,432
Who's a man among men?

582
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,433
Who's a super success?

583
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,954
Don't you know? Can't you guess?

584
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,113
Ask his fans and his five hangers-on

585
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,351
There's just one guy in town
Who's got all of it down

586
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,318
And his name's, G-A-S-T

587
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,915
I believe there's another 'T'

588
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,039
It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate

589
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,513
And I've never actually had
to spell it out loud before

590
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,918
Gaston

591
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,155
Oh, LeFou, you're the best.

592
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,516
How is it no girl has snatched you up yet?

593
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,031
I've been told I'm clingy,
but I really don't get it.

594
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,120
Please, please. Someone, someone.

595
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
- You, help...
- Whoa, whoa.

596
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,710
You must help me.

597
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,473
It's Belle! He's got, he's got Belle.

598
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,789
She's locked in a dungeon.

599
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,200
Who's got her?

600
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,151
A beast!

601
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,069
A huge, horrid, monstrous beast!

602
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,553
My daughter's life is in danger.

603
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,916
Why do you laugh? It's not a joke.

604
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,875
His castle is hidden in the woods.

605
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,957
It's already winter there.

606
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,872
Winter in June?

607
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,679
Crazy old Maurice!

608
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,717
Listen to me!

609
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,439
The beast is real.

610
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,792
Do you understand?

611
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,236
Will no one help me?

612
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,516
I'll help, Maurice.

613
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,591
What?

614
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,194
You will?

615
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,589
Everybody...

616
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,916
stop making fun of this man at once.

617
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,713
Captain, thank you.

618
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,792
Don't thank me, Maurice.

619
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,713
Lead us to the beast.

620
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,474
Come.

621
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,750
Hmm.

622
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,750
Oh.

623
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,193
Mama! There's a girl in the castle!

624
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,913
Yes, Chip, we know!

625
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,030
What kind of tea does she like?

626
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,918
Herbal, oolong...

627
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,275
chamomile...

628
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,396
I'm too excited!

629
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,280
Slow down before you break your handle.

630
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,760
- Heads up, Mrs. Potts.
- Oh.

631
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,278
Lumière!

632
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,078
- Oh!
- Be calm. Let me do the talking.

633
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,474
You're making her dinner!

634
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,472
Well, we thought you might
appreciate the company.

635
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,836
Master, I just want to assure you...

636
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,792
that I had no part in this hopeless plan.

637
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,954
Preparing a dinner, designing
a gown for her, giving her...

638
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,480
a suite in the east wing!

639
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,359
You gave her a bedroom?

640
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,960
No, no, no. He gave her a bedroom.

641
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,276
This is true.

642
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,158
But if this girl is the one
who can break the spell...

643
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,040
then maybe you could start
by using dinner to charm her.

644
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,351
- Good thinking, Cogsworth.
- What?

645
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,630
That's the most ridiculous idea...

646
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,837
I've ever heard. Charm the prisoner!

647
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,674
But you must try, Master.
With every passing day...

648
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,792
we become less human.

649
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,196
She's the daughter of a common thief.

650
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,874
What kind of person do you
think that makes her?

651
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,832
Oh, you can't judge people...

652
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,151
by who their father is, now can you?

653
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,199
You'll join me for dinner.

654
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,680
That's not a request.

655
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,160
Gently, Master.

656
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,794
The girl lost her father...

657
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,678
and her freedom in one day.

658
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,514
Yes, the poor thing is probably in there,
scared to death.

659
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,830
Exactly.

660
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,193
Just a minute.

661
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,757
You see? There she is.
Now, remember, be gentle.

662
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,832
- Kind!
- Charming!

663
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,717
Sweet!

664
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,079
And when she opens the door,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

665
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,520
Come, come. Show me the smile.

666
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,190
- Oh, mon dieu!
- Oh, no.

667
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,030
Will you join me for dinner?

668
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,353
You've taken me as your prisoner

669
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,716
and now you want to have dinner with me?

670
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,555
Are you insane?

671
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,397
Uh-oh. He's losing it.

672
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,920
Oh, dear!

673
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,791
I told you to join me for dinner.

674
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,400
And I told you no.

675
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,115
Ooh! What time is it?

676
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,356
What's happening?

677
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,513
I'd starve before I ever ate with you.

678
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,869
Well, be my guest.

679
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,713
Go ahead and starve.

680
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,200
If she doesn't eat with me...

681
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,714
then she doesn't eat at all.

682
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,710
Idiots!

683
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,675
You can't talk to us
like that. I forbid it.

684
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,754
Uh... Oh. Am I too late?

685
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,435
Shame, I was really going to
tell him off this time.

686
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,671
Oh, Master, you've returned.

687
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,672
- Oh, very funny.
- I got you there.

688
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,913
Show me the girl.

689
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,675
Another petal fell.

690
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,637
Lumière...

691
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,831
I grew three more feathers.
And I just plucked yesterday.

692
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,997
I know, darling.

693
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,514
I'm getting more metallic every day.

694
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,753
Oh, no. It's happening again. Pardon me.

695
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,912
Oh, everyone, calm yourselves.

696
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,073
- We still have time.
- Mama...

697
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,590
am I ever going to be a boy again?

698
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,240
Oh, yes, Chip. You'll have your days...

699
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,159
in the sun again. You just leave it to me.

700
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,873
I told you to go away.

701
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,799
Don't worry, dear. It's only Mrs. Potts.

702
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,710
Oh!

703
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,474
Oh, aren't you a vision!

704
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,630
How lovely...

705
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,996
to make your acquaintance.

706
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,237
It's a very long journey.
Let me fix you up...

707
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,674
before you go.

708
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,956
I have found...

709
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,515
that most troubles seem less troubling...

710
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,672
after a bracing cup of tea.

711
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,280
Slowly now, Chip.

712
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,230
Pleased to meet you.

713
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,680
Wanna see me do a trick?

714
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,112
Chip!

715
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,154
That was a very brave thing
you did for your father, dearie.

716
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,919
Yes.

717
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,559
We all think so.

718
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,915
I'm worried about him.

719
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,035
He's never been on his own.

720
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,913
Cheer up, my poppet.

721
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,430
Things will turn out in the end.

722
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,840
You'll feel a lot better...

723
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,354
after dinner.

724
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,239
But he said, "If she doesn't eat with me,

725
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,720
then she doesn't eat at all."

726
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,629
Mmm, people say a lot of things in anger.

727
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,717
It is our choice whether or not to listen.

728
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,350
You coming, poppet?

729
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,916
Go!

730
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,359
They are coming. Final checks,
everyone! Tout de suite!

731
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,431
No, you don't!

732
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,472
If the master finds out
you violated his orders

733
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,080
and fed her he will blame me!

734
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,560
Yes, I will make sure of it.

735
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,359
But did you see her stand up to him?

736
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,233
I am telling you, this girl is the one.

737
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,432
They must fall in love
if we are to be human again...

738
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,637
and how can they fall in love
if she stays in her room?

739
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,473
Hey, Chapeau, you missed a spot.

740
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,120
You know she'll never love him.

741
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,233
A broken clock is right
two times a day, mon ami...

742
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,959
but this is not one of those times.
Stand up straight!

743
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,753
It's time to sparkle!

744
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,639
Mmm! I have no taste buds,

745
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,234
but I can tell this is exquisite.

746
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,153
Off! Off me while I work!

747
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,391
Pepper, get cracking! Salt, shake a leg!

748
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,473
Not so loud! Keep it down.

749
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,791
Of course, of course!
But what is dinner...

750
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,473
without a little music?

751
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,670
Music?

752
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,480
Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?

753
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,916
It has been so long
since I have performed.

754
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,515
I can barely even remember how.

755
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,839
- Ah!
- Ooh!

756
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,509
Another cavity.

757
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,438
Maestro, your wife is upstairs...

758
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,990
finding it harder and harder
to stay awake.

759
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,079
She's counting on you
to help us break this curse.

760
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,193
Then I shall play through the dental pain.

761
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,835
Maestro, play quietly, please.

762
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,876
Oh, quietly. Sotto voce! Of course!

763
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,316
Are there any other tasteless demands...

764
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,595
you wish to make upon my artistry?

765
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,476
No, that's it.

766
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,552
There you are, dear.

767
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,472
Ma chère mademoiselle.

768
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,231
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure...

769
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,198
that we welcome you tonight.

770
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,596
Here! And now...

771
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,837
we invite you to relax.

772
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,594
Let us pull up a chair...

773
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,236
as the dining room proudly presents...

774
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,277
Your dinner!

775
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,749
Be our guest, be our guest

776
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,674
Put our service to the test

777
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,594
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chérie

778
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,712
And we'll provide the rest

779
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,679
Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres

780
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,672
Why we only live to serve

781
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,195
Try the grey stuff, it's delicious

782
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,840
Don't believe me? Ask the dishes

783
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,594
They can sing, they can dance

784
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,956
After all, miss, this is France

785
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,955
And a dinner here is never second best

786
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,835
Go on unfold your menu

787
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,474
Take a glance and then you'll

788
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,712
Be our guest, oui, our guest

789
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,473
Be our guest

790
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,630
Ooh!

791
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,070
Beef ragout

792
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,514
Cheese soufflé

793
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,154
Pie and pudding en flambé

794
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,109
We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret

795
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,475
You're alone and you're scared

796
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,631
But the banquet's all prepared

797
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,513
No one's gloomy or complaining

798
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,592
While the flatware's entertaining

799
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,353
We tell jokes, I do tricks

800
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,120
With my fellow candlesticks

801
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,791
And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet

802
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,991
Come on and lift your glass

803
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,231
You've won your own free pass

804
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,993
To be our guest

805
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,959
If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

806
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,030
Be our guest

807
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,996
Be our guest, be our guest

808
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,474
Life is so unnerving

809
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,950
For a servant who's not serving

810
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,114
He's not whole
Without a soul to wait upon

811
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,073
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

812
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,111
Eh, Cogsworth?

813
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,433
Suddenly those good old days are gone

814
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,398
Too long we've been rusting

815
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,359
Needing so much more than dusting

816
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,877
Needing exercise,
a chance to use our skills

817
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,158
Most days we just lay around the castle

818
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,800
Flabby, fat and lazy

819
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,076
You walked in and whoops-a-daisy

820
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,953
It's a guest, it's a guest

821
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,997
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed

822
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,958
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord

823
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,111
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

824
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,357
With dessert, she'll want tea

825
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,318
And my dear, that's fine with me

826
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,358
While the cups do their soft-shoeing

827
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,995
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

828
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,472
I'll get warm, piping hot

829
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,233
Heaven's sakes, is that a spot?

830
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,155
Clean it up, we want the company impressed

831
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,152
We've got a lot to do

832
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,351
Is it one lump or two?

833
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,874
For you, our guest

834
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,317
She's our guest

835
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,193
Be our guest, be our guest

836
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,118
Our command is your request

837
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,994
It's been years since we've had anybody

838
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,400
Here and we're obsessed

839
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,517
With your meal

840
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,757
With your ease

841
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,960
Yes indeed, we aim to please

842
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,794
While the candlelight's still glowing

843
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,276
Let us help you, we'll keep going

844
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,878
Course by

845
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,590
Course! One by one

846
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,434
'Til you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"

847
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,557
Then we'll sing you off to sleep

848
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,233
As you digest

849
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,798
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now let's eat up

850
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,754
Be our guest

851
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,233
Be our guest

852
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:37,476
Please be our guest

853
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,472
Pudding?

854
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,870
I don't understand why
you're all being so kind to me.

855
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,716
Surely, you're as trapped here as I am.

856
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,399
Don't you ever want to escape?

857
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,470
The master's not
as terrible as he appears.

858
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,236
Somewhere deep in his soul,
there's a prince...

859
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,479
of a fellow who just waiting
to be set free.

860
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,195
Lumière mentioned something
about the west wing.

861
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,829
Never you mind about that.

862
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,996
Off to bed with you, poppet.

863
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,476
- Good night.
- Nighty-night.

864
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,033
Straight to bed.

865
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,192
What are you doing here?
What did you do to it?

866
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,191
Nothing.

867
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,430
Do you realize what you could have done?

868
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,954
You could have damned us all!

869
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,235
Get out of here!

870
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,440
Go!

871
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,472
Checkmate. Again.

872
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,472
Wait! No! You cheated again.

873
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,320
Mademoiselle, what are you doing?

874
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,153
Getting out of here.

875
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,515
Stop!

876
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,755
Go! Go! Froufrou!

877
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,920
Yes, Froufrou. Stop her.

878
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,480
Don't let her leave!

879
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,239
Stop her!

880
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,310
No! No! Froufrou!

881
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,669
No! No, it's not play time!

882
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,752
Not now, silly boy.

883
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,274
Bad dog. Bad dog!

884
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,993
No! No! No!

885
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,389
Please don't go!

886
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,636
It's dangerous!

887
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,473
Oh, my!

888
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,316
You have to help me.

889
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,558
You have to stand.

890
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,150
No! I'm sure this is the way.

891
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,549
Do you hear those wolves?

892
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,679
That means we're getting
very close to the castle.

893
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,520
Look, enough is enough.
We have to turn back.

894
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,557
Stop!

895
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,876
That's it! There it is!

896
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,199
That's the tree!

897
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,470
I'm sure of it.

898
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,190
It was downed by lightning at the time.

899
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,113
But now...

900
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,112
it's resumed an upright position...

901
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,429
through some sort of...

902
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,351
magic or other.

903
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,631
You really wanna marry into this family?

904
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,790
So, that means...

905
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,710
that the castle is that...

906
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,790
No.

907
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,630
No, it's...

908
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,117
That way.

909
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,039
Definitely, that way.

910
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,438
I am done playing this game of yours.

911
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,193
Where is Belle?

912
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,277
The beast took her and she...

913
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,557
There are no such things as beasts.

914
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,472
Or talking teacups.

915
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,869
Or magic!

916
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,431
But there are wolves,
frostbite, and starvation.

917
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,318
Deep breaths, Gaston.

918
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,557
Deep breaths.

919
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,358
So, why don't we just turn around?
Go back to Villeneuve.

920
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,995
I'm sure Belle is at home,
cooking up a lovely dinner.

921
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,594
If you think I've made all this up...

922
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,633
then why did you offer to help?

923
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,433
Because I want to marry your daughter!

924
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,436
Now, let's go home.

925
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,358
Belle is not at home.

926
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,840
She is with the...

927
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,799
You say beast one more time...

928
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,752
I will feed you to the wolves!

929
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,275
Gaston! Stop it! Breathe!

930
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,517
Think happy thoughts. Go back to the war.

931
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,074
Blood.

932
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,675
Explosions. Countless widows.

933
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,120
- Widows.
- Yes. Yes.

934
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,560
That's it.

935
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,433
That's it.

936
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,234
Maurice!

937
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,750
Please, forgive me, old bean.

938
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,156
That's no way to talk
to my future father-in-law...

939
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,236
now is it?

940
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,396
Future father-in-law?

941
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,510
Yeah!

942
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,714
You will never marry my daughter.

943
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,080
I saw that coming.

944
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,070
If Maurice won't give me his blessing...

945
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,032
then he is in my way.

946
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,600
Once the wolves are finished with him...

947
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,434
Belle will have no one
to take care of her but me.

948
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,398
For the sake of exhausting
all of our options...

949
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,029
do we maybe wanna consider
a slightly less...

950
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,799
gruesome alternative?

951
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,836
Are you coming?

952
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,870
Yah!

953
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,796
That hurts!

954
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,799
If you held still,
it wouldn't hurt as much.

955
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,151
Well, if you hadn't run away,
none of this would have happened.

956
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,436
Well, if you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

957
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,313
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing.

958
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,200
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

959
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,029
Try to get some rest.

960
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,349
Thank you, miss.

961
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,040
We are eternally grateful.

962
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,635
Why do you care about him so much?

963
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,200
We've looked after him all his life.

964
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,794
But he's cursed you somehow. Why?

965
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,030
You did nothing!

966
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,435
You're quite right there, dear.

967
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,638
You see, when the master
lost his mother...

968
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,832
and his cruel father
took that sweet, innocent lad...

969
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,070
and twisted him up to be just like him...

970
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,637
we did nothing.

971
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,154
Let him sleep.

972
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,596
Days in the sun

973
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,754
When my life has barely begun

974
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,960
Not until my whole life is done

975
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:49,114
Will I ever leave you

976
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,037
Will I tremble again

977
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:18,240
To my dear one's gorgeous refrain

978
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,314
Will you now forever remain

979
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:27,436
Out of reach of my arms

980
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,638
Oh, those days in the sun

981
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,840
What I'd give to relive just one

982
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,354
'Night, Mama.

983
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,876
Undo what's done

984
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:42,676
And bring back the light

985
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,356
Oh, I could sing

986
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:52,549
Of the pain these dark days bring

987
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:57,630
The spell we're under

988
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,955
Still it's the wonder of us
I sing of tonight

989
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,909
How in the midst of all this sorrow

990
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,596
Can so much hope and love endure

991
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,640
I was innocent and certain

992
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,510
Now I'm wiser but unsure

993
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,273
Days in the past

994
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,556
I can't go back into my childhood

995
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,110
Oh, those precious days couldn't last

996
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,715
One that my father made secure

997
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,991
I can feel a change in me

998
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,994
Oh, hold me closer

999
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,720
I'm stronger now but still not free

1000
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,520
Days in the sun

1001
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,840
Will return we must believe

1002
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,552
As lovers do

1003
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,519
That days in the sun

1004
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:59,711
Will come shining through

1005
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,396
What happens when the last petal falls?

1006
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,358
The master remains a beast forever.

1007
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,193
And we become...

1008
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,953
- Antiques.
- Knick-knacks.

1009
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,634
Lightly-used houseware.

1010
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,717
Rubbish.

1011
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,917
We become rubbish.

1012
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,512
I want to help you.

1013
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,791
There must be some way to break the curse.

1014
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,790
Well, there is one.

1015
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,912
It's not for you to worry about, lamb.

1016
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,596
We've made our bed and we must lie in it.

1017
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,029
Drink.

1018
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,439
Thank you, Agathe.

1019
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,829
"Love can transpose to form and dignity.

1020
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,151
"Love looks not with the eyes

1021
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,277
"but with the mind and therefore..."

1022
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,593
"And therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind."

1023
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,592
You know Shakespeare?

1024
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,636
I had an expensive education.

1025
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,600
Actually, Romeo and Juliet's
my favorite play.

1026
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,350
Why is that not a surprise?

1027
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,640
I'm sorry?

1028
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,634
Well, all that heartache and pining and...

1029
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,516
So many better things to read.

1030
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,749
Like what?

1031
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,278
Well, there are a couple of...

1032
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,034
things in here you could start with.

1033
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,512
Are you all right?

1034
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,031
It's wonderful!

1035
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,836
Yes. I suppose it is.

1036
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,150
Well, if you like it so much,
then it's yours.

1037
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,039
Have you really read every one
of these books?

1038
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,116
What?

1039
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,997
Well, not all of them.

1040
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,436
Some of them are in Greek.

1041
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,233
Was that a joke?

1042
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,320
Are you making jokes now?

1043
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,795
Maybe.

1044
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,275
"The air is blue and keen and cold...

1045
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,472
"and in a frozen sheath, enrolled.

1046
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,438
"Each branch, each twig...

1047
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,475
"each blade of grass seems
clad miraculously with...

1048
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,634
"glass."

1049
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,160
I feel as if I'm
seeing it for the first time.

1050
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,515
Is there any more?

1051
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,074
Um...

1052
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,193
"But in that solemn silence
is heard the whisper...

1053
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,312
"of every sleeping thing.

1054
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,390
"Look. Look at me.

1055
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,876
"Come wake me up.

1056
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,592
"For still here I be."

1057
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,716
There's something sweet and almost kind

1058
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:17,280
But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined

1059
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,717
And now he's dear and so unsure

1060
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,112
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

1061
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,315
She glanced this way I thought I saw

1062
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,916
And when we touched
She didn't shudder at my paw

1063
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,915
No, it can't be I'll just ignore

1064
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,958
But then she's never looked at me

1065
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,520
That way before

1066
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,959
New, and a bit alarming

1067
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:34,394
Who'd have ever thought that this could be

1068
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:42,996
True that he's no Prince Charming

1069
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:49,191
But there's something in him
That I simply didn't see

1070
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,550
- Well, who'd have thought?
- Well, bless my soul!

1071
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,478
- Well, who'd have known?
- Well, who indeed?

1072
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,829
And who'd have guessed

1073
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,639
They'd come together on their own

1074
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,353
It's so peculiar
Wait and see

1075
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,240
We'll wait and see
A few days more

1076
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,677
There may be something there
That wasn't there before

1077
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,078
And here's a thought...

1078
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,038
Perhaps there's something there

1079
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,634
That wasn't there before

1080
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,832
What, Mama?

1081
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:21,837
There may be something there
That wasn't there before

1082
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,550
What is it? What's there?

1083
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,195
I'll tell you when you're older.

1084
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,152
Okay, I'm older!

1085
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,278
Chip...

1086
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,432
You are a one.

1087
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,479
What are you reading?

1088
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,630
Nothing.

1089
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,599
Guinevere and Lancelot.

1090
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,439
Well, actually...

1091
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,910
King Arthur and the Round Table.

1092
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,039
Knights and men and swords and things.

1093
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,270
Mmm.

1094
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,875
Still...

1095
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,590
it's a romance.

1096
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,915
All right.

1097
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,080
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1098
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,478
Well, I never thanked you...

1099
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,394
for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves.

1100
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,993
They know how to have a good time.

1101
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:31,234
Yes. But when I enter the room,
laughter dies.

1102
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,400
Me too.

1103
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,875
The villagers say that I'm a funny girl...

1104
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,031
but I'm not sure they mean it
as a compliment.

1105
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,190
I'm sorry.

1106
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,591
Your village sounds terrible.

1107
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,110
Almost as lonely as your castle.

1108
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,800
What do you say we run away?

1109
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,111
Another little gift from the enchantress.

1110
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,599
A book that truly allows you to escape.

1111
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,876
How amazing!

1112
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,480
It was her cruelest trick of all.

1113
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,231
It was just another curse.

1114
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:31,473
The outside world has no place
for a creature like me...

1115
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,992
but it can for you.

1116
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,197
Think of the one place
you've always wanted to see.

1117
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,470
Now find it in your mind's eye.

1118
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,833
Then feel it in your heart.

1119
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,277
Where did you take us?

1120
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,995
Paris.

1121
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,831
Oh, I love Paris.

1122
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,352
What would you like to see first?

1123
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,670
Notre Dame...

1124
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,678
The Champs-Élysées...

1125
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,870
No?

1126
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,992
Too touristy?

1127
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,913
It's so much smaller than I imagined.

1128
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:56,070
This is the Paris of my childhood

1129
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:01,314
These were the borders of my life

1130
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:05,872
In this crumbling, dusty attic

1131
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:10,080
Where an artist loved his wife

1132
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,393
Easy to remember

1133
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:19,309
Harder to move on

1134
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,637
Knowing the Paris of my childhood

1135
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,596
Is gone

1136
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,514
What happened to your mother?

1137
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,957
It was the one story
Papa could never bring himself to tell.

1138
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,799
I knew better than to ask.

1139
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,309
Oh. A doctor's mask.

1140
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,034
Plague.

1141
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,592
You must leave now.

1142
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,556
Quickly...

1143
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,353
before it takes her too.

1144
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,473
I'm sorry I ever
called your father a thief.

1145
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,674
Let's go home.

1146
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,992
This is some storm, huh?

1147
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,391
At least we're not tied to a tree

1148
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,994
in the middle of nowhere...

1149
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,072
surrounded by bloodthirsty wolves.

1150
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,038
You know it's not too late.

1151
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,389
We could always turn back...

1152
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,710
It's just...

1153
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,315
every time I close my eyes...

1154
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,153
I picture Maurice stranded alone.

1155
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,515
And then when I open them...

1156
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,360
he's...

1157
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,592
Maurice!

1158
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,194
Gaston...

1159
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,670
did you try to kill Maurice?

1160
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,679
Maurice!

1161
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,115
Thank heavens!

1162
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,956
I've spent the last five days...

1163
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,032
- trying to find you.
- You tried to kill me.

1164
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,873
You left me to the wolves.

1165
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,190
Wolves?

1166
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,114
It's one thing to rave
about your delusions.

1167
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,510
It's another to accuse me
of attempted murder.

1168
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,835
Maurice...

1169
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,075
do you have any proof
of what you're saying?

1170
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,716
Ask Agathe. She rescued me.

1171
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,240
Agathe!

1172
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,236
You'd hang your accusations
on the testimony...

1173
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,714
of a filthy hag?

1174
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,917
No offense, Agathe.

1175
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,914
Monsieur LeFou.

1176
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,080
He was there. He saw it all.

1177
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,711
Me?

1178
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,434
You're right.

1179
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,398
Don't take my word for it.

1180
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,710
LeFou...

1181
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,197
my dearest companion...

1182
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,316
did I...

1183
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,871
your oldest friend
and most loyal compatriot...

1184
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,590
try to kill the father
of the only woman I've ever loved?

1185
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,151
Well, it's a complicated question
on a number of accounts...

1186
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,559
But no.

1187
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,996
No, he did not.

1188
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,270
You...

1189
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,834
Maurice...

1190
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,280
it pains me to say this,

1191
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,080
but you've become a danger
to yourself and others.

1192
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,232
No wonder Belle ran away.

1193
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,800
You need help, sir.

1194
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,520
A place to heal your troubled mind.

1195
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,591
Everything's going to be fine.

1196
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,000
Just fine.

1197
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,115
Well, I saw her in the ballroom...

1198
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,038
and said, "You're making
everything look so beautiful.

1199
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,634
"We should have a dance tonight."

1200
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,951
I never imagined she'd actually say yes.

1201
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,270
What was I thinking?

1202
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,790
No, Master. It's perfect.

1203
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,634
The rose has only four petals left
which means tonight...

1204
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,797
you can tell her how you feel.

1205
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,800
I feel like a fool.

1206
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,632
She will never love me.

1207
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,796
Do not be discouraged.

1208
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,634
She is the one.

1209
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,110
I wish you'd stop saying that!

1210
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,994
There is no "one."

1211
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,753
You care for her, don't you?

1212
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,674
Well, then, woo her with beautiful music

1213
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,080
and romantic candlelight.

1214
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:42,358
Yes, and when the moment's just right...

1215
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,199
Well, how will I know?

1216
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,874
You will feel slightly nauseous.

1217
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,430
Don't worry, Master. You'll do fine.

1218
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,751
Just stop being so nervous

1219
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,116
and tell Belle how you feel.

1220
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,190
Because if you don't...

1221
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,552
I promise you'll be drinking cold tea
for the rest of your days!

1222
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,319
- In the dark.
- Covered in dust.

1223
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,199
Dark and very, very dusty.

1224
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,114
Start with the hair.

1225
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,998
Women love nice hair!

1226
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,434
I'll take the fingers and toes.

1227
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,558
Chapeau, brush those teeth. They need it.

1228
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:11,955
Dip, dip.

1229
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,077
Snip, snip.

1230
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,519
Polish the nails.

1231
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,512
Shine the horns.

1232
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,034
Eyes closed. Poof, poof.

1233
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,793
And to top it all off...

1234
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,674
Voilà!

1235
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,714
Okay, I can fix this.

1236
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,755
Oh! Beautiful!

1237
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,354
But something is missing.

1238
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,391
Oh, yes.

1239
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:48,398
The finishing touch.

1240
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:57,240
Tale as old as time

1241
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,475
True as it can be

1242
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,960
Barely even friends

1243
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:11,951
Then somebody bends unexpectedly

1244
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,999
Just a little change

1245
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,710
Small to say the least

1246
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,114
Both a little scared

1247
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,157
Neither one prepared

1248
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:33,552
Beauty and the Beast

1249
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,273
Ever just the same

1250
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,153
Ever a surprise

1251
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,475
Ever as before

1252
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,758
Ever just as sure

1253
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:08,995
As the sun will rise

1254
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:14,596
Tale as old as time

1255
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:21,439
Tune as old as song

1256
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,030
Bittersweet and strange

1257
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,358
Finding you can change

1258
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,911
Learning you were wrong

1259
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:49,316
Certain as the sun

1260
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,079
Rising in the east

1261
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:58,074
Tale as old as time

1262
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,597
Song as old as rhyme

1263
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,152
Beauty and the Beast

1264
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,551
Tale as old as time

1265
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,918
Song as old as rhyme

1266
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:22,311
Beauty and the Beast

1267
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,554
I haven't danced in years.

1268
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,791
I'd almost forgotten the feeling.

1269
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,871
It's foolish, I suppose...

1270
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,520
for a creature like me to hope...

1271
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,593
that one day he might earn your affection.

1272
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,552
I don't know.

1273
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,994
Really?

1274
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,277
You think you could be happy here?

1275
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,279
Can anybody be happy if they aren't free?

1276
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,879
My father taught me to dance.

1277
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,353
I used to step on his toes a lot.

1278
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,957
You must miss him.

1279
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,555
Very much.

1280
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,472
Would you like to see him?

1281
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,158
I'd like to see my father.

1282
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,914
Papa!

1283
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,352
What are they doing to him?

1284
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,153
He's in trouble!

1285
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,834
Then you must go to him.

1286
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,596
What did you say?

1287
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,871
You must go to him.

1288
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,154
No time to waste.

1289
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,476
No...

1290
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,193
you keep it with you.

1291
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,239
Then you'll always have a way
to look back on me.

1292
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,994
Thank you.

1293
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,514
Oh...

1294
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,395
Well, Master, I have had my doubts,
but everything is moving like clockwork.

1295
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,395
True love really does win the day!

1296
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,834
I let her go.

1297
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,599
You what?

1298
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,752
Master, how could you do that?

1299
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,593
I had to.

1300
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,271
But why?

1301
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,397
Because he loves her.

1302
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,434
Then why are we not human?

1303
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,070
Because she doesn't love him.
And now, it's too late.

1304
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,277
But she might still come back.

1305
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,476
No.

1306
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,754
I set her free.

1307
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,312
I'm sorry I couldn't do
the same for all of you.

1308
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,119
Now, go.

1309
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,476
Our time is almost past.

1310
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,280
Come, my love.

1311
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,113
I was the one who had it all

1312
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,033
I was the master of my fate

1313
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:34,357
I never needed anybody in my life

1314
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:38,116
I learned the truth too late

1315
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,432
I'll never shake away the pain

1316
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,396
I close my eyes but she's still there

1317
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,873
I let her steal into my melancholy heart

1318
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,712
It's more than I can bear

1319
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:05,079
Now I know she'll never leave me

1320
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:09,632
Even as she runs away

1321
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:14,397
She will still torment me
Calm me, hurt me

1322
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,837
Move me, come what may

1323
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,760
Wasting in my lonely tower

1324
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,675
Waiting by an open door

1325
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,198
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1326
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,040
And be with me for evermore

1327
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,232
I rage against the trials of love

1328
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,433
I curse the fading of the light

1329
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:53,875
Though she's already flown
So far beyond my reach

1330
01:32:54,480 --> 01:33:00,556
She's never out of sight

1331
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:05,118
Now I know she'll never leave me

1332
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:10,876
Even as she fades from view

1333
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,792
She will still inspire me

1334
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:18,592
Be a part of everything I do

1335
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,554
Wasting in my lonely tower

1336
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,637
Waiting by an open door

1337
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,397
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1338
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,518
And as the long, long nights begin

1339
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:41,078
I'll think of all that might have been

1340
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:48,952
Waiting here for evermore

1341
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,476
This man is weak.

1342
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,550
Please!

1343
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,639
He needs a hospital...

1344
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,949
not an asylum!

1345
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,359
Have you ever seen the inside
of a mad house, Maurice?

1346
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,432
You wouldn't last a week.

1347
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,557
Just give me your daughter's hand,
and I'll set you free.

1348
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,949
Never.

1349
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,599
Take him away!

1350
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,870
Stop!

1351
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,550
Papa.

1352
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,279
Oh, Belle. I thought I'd lost you.

1353
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,636
Let him out! He's hurt.

1354
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,995
We can't do that, miss.

1355
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,480
But we'll take very good care of him.

1356
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,552
My father's not crazy.

1357
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,353
Gaston, tell him!

1358
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,238
You know how loyal I am to your family...

1359
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,120
but your father's been making
some unbelievable claims.

1360
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,919
It's true, Belle.

1361
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,515
He's been raving about a beast...

1362
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,556
in a castle!

1363
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:18,439
I've just come from the castle
and there is a beast!

1364
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,632
You'd say anything to set him free.
Your word is hardly proof.

1365
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,319
You want proof?

1366
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,953
Show me the Beast!

1367
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,240
There's your proof.

1368
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,870
This is sorcery!

1369
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,840
Look at this beast!

1370
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,314
Look at his fangs!

1371
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:49,589
His claws!

1372
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,030
No. Don't be afraid.

1373
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,431
He's gentle and kind.

1374
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,274
The monster has her under his spell.

1375
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:00,755
If I didn't know better,

1376
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,355
I'd say she even cared for him!

1377
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,552
He's not a monster, Gaston.

1378
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:06,836
You are!

1379
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,200
The Beast wouldn't hurt anyone.

1380
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,158
I've heard of the effects of dark magic...

1381
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,159
but I've never before seen it
with my own eyes!

1382
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,193
This is a threat to our very existence!

1383
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,716
We can't have her
running off to warn the beast.

1384
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,995
Lock her up too.

1385
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,600
- No!
- Come here!

1386
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,239
Shut up!

1387
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,356
You won't get away with this, Gaston!

1388
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,196
Oh, Belle!

1389
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,872
Gaston, with all due respect...

1390
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,673
Do you want to be next?

1391
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,029
Fetch my horse.

1392
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,480
Stand guard!

1393
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,710
Don't let them escape.

1394
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,315
This creature will curse us all
if we don't stop him.

1395
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,759
Well, I say, we kill the beast!

1396
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,910
Kill the beast!

1397
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,034
We're not safe until he's dead

1398
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,879
He'll come stalking us at night

1399
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:57,192
Set to sacrifice our children
To his monstrous appetite

1400
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,999
He'll wreak havoc on our village

1401
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,514
If we let him wander free

1402
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:04,077
So it's time to take some action, boys

1403
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:09,634
It's time to follow me

1404
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,829
Through the mist, through the wood
Through the darkness and the shadows

1405
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:17,231
It's a nightmare
But it's one exciting ride

1406
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:20,831
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle

1407
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,391
And there's something
truly terrible inside

1408
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:27,194
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones

1409
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,552
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast

1410
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,319
Hear him roar, see him foam

1411
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,030
But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead

1412
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,236
Good and dead

1413
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:38,714
Kill the beast!

1414
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,719
Light your torch, mount your horse

1415
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,439
Screw your courage to the sticking place

1416
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,877
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

1417
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,032
Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow

1418
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:54,238
For in times like this
They'll do just as I say

1419
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,632
There's a beast running wild
There's no question

1420
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,918
But I fear the wrong monster's released

1421
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:04,596
Sally forth, tally ho
Grab your sword, grab your bow

1422
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:08,959
Praise the Lord, and here we go

1423
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,913
Show me the castle.

1424
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,119
At least he has finally learned to love.

1425
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:21,239
A lot of good that does us
if she doesn't love him in return.

1426
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:25,679
No. This is the first time
I've had any real hope she would.

1427
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,593
Did you hear that, Mama?

1428
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,160
Is it her? Is she coming back?

1429
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,430
Could it be?

1430
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,114
I told you!

1431
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,475
Sacré bleu!

1432
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,920
Invaders!

1433
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,229
Ruffians!

1434
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,232
Well, there you go.

1435
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,471
So much for true love.

1436
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,279
Man the barricades...

1437
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:45,274
and hold fast!

1438
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,635
Move aside!

1439
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:49,832
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle

1440
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:52,794
Unafraid, although
the danger's just increased

1441
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:57,798
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong

1442
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,953
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong

1443
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:02,315
Let's kill the beast!

1444
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,200
We need help.

1445
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:13,070
- I have to warn the Beast.
- Warn him?

1446
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,152
How did you get away from him?

1447
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,472
He let me go, Papa.

1448
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,793
He sent me back to you.

1449
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,872
I don't understand.

1450
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,480
Where did you...

1451
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,996
He took me there.

1452
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,795
I know what happened to Maman.

1453
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,595
Then you know
why I had to leave her there.

1454
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,796
I had to protect you.

1455
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,119
I've always tried to protect
my little girl.

1456
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,600
Probably too much.

1457
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,312
I understand.

1458
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,474
Will you help me now?

1459
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,512
It's dangerous.

1460
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:02,830
Yes.

1461
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,714
Yes, it is.

1462
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,112
I could try to pick the lock.

1463
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,916
After all...

1464
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:15,954
it's only gears and springs.

1465
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,438
But I would need...

1466
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,120
something long and sharp.

1467
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,390
Like that.

1468
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,040
Perfect.

1469
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,914
Oh, excuse me, Master.

1470
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,753
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

1471
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,474
She's not coming back.

1472
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:38,596
No.

1473
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,757
They're breaking down the doors!

1474
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,477
Doesn't matter now.

1475
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,155
Just let them come.

1476
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,960
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

1477
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,355
This isn't working!

1478
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,676
I know what to do.

1479
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,076
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

1480
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,193
Kill the beast!

1481
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,951
Are you not the least bit concerned...

1482
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:07,918
that this castle might be haunted?

1483
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,756
Don't lose your nerve, LeFou.

1484
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,116
Where are we?

1485
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,834
This place seems familiar.

1486
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,992
Like I've been here before.

1487
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,115
Oh, hello, there.

1488
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:28,599
You must be the talking tea cup.

1489
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,356
And you must be...

1490
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,709
his grandmother.

1491
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,672
Grandmother?

1492
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,957
Attack!

1493
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,359
Oh, hello!

1494
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,075
Gaston!

1495
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,115
Gaston.

1496
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,310
Help.

1497
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,834
Sorry, old friend.

1498
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,193
It's hero time.

1499
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,715
Ooh, ouch!

1500
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,316
Hello.

1501
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,680
Oh, uh... I believe this is yours.

1502
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,230
She's very headstrong.

1503
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,395
Do you have children?

1504
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,038
No one to protect you now, huh?

1505
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,390
One, two, three, four...

1506
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,711
five, six, seven, eight...

1507
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:00,916
Good show, Chip, my boy.

1508
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:03,553
Excellent!

1509
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,751
The infantry's arrived.

1510
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,437
Now, go and teach them a lesson. Go.

1511
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:13,349
Yes, those are called books,
you third rate musketeers.

1512
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,394
Oh! I'm off.

1513
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,911
Just a clock.

1514
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,277
Come here...

1515
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,794
little boys.

1516
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,277
I spin you this way. I put it on.

1517
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:36,559
Yes, pretty little boys. Yes!

1518
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,113
Beautiful!

1519
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,272
Go, be free!

1520
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,794
Be free. Be free!

1521
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,359
How do you like your tea?

1522
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,954
Piping hot?

1523
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,998
Or boiling?

1524
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,476
Oh!

1525
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:04,240
Mr. Potts!

1526
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,430
Mama!

1527
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,234
Thank you!

1528
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:16,035
Take that!

1529
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,714
Nicely handled!

1530
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,280
Well, I used to be on Gaston's side...

1531
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:22,113
but we are so in a bad place right now.

1532
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,636
- You're too good for him, anyway.
- Yeah.

1533
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:25,995
Should we get back to it, then?

1534
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,154
Such sweet music.

1535
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,159
- Stand back.
- Silence that harpsichord!

1536
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,352
- What? Uh-oh!
- Maestro!

1537
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,755
Darling! At last!

1538
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,837
I'm coming, my love.

1539
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,918
This is it!

1540
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:45,112
The fat lady is singing.

1541
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,195
Bravissima!

1542
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,757
Watch your toes!

1543
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,510
That's it! Go! Go!

1544
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:07,076
Bon voyage.

1545
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,479
Safe trip home.

1546
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,199
And stay out!

1547
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,920
Hello, beast.

1548
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,793
I'm Gaston.

1549
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,279
Belle sent me.

1550
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,270
Are you in love with her?

1551
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:53,914
Did you honestly think she'd want you?

1552
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:10,950
Belle!

1553
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,398
Where is he?

1554
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,960
When we return to the village...

1555
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,673
you will marry me.

1556
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,559
And that beast's head...

1557
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,597
- will hang on our wall.
- Never!

1558
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,234
I'm coming for you, beast.

1559
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,715
- No!
- Belle?

1560
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,236
Belle!

1561
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:10,556
You came back!

1562
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,554
- I tried to stop them!
- Stay there!

1563
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:15,150
I'm coming.

1564
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:43,835
Gaston!

1565
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,076
No!

1566
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,872
Don't let me go.

1567
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,520
Please.

1568
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,433
I'll do anything.

1569
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,914
Don't hurt me, beast.

1570
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,919
I am not...

1571
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,514
a beast.

1572
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,634
Go!

1573
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,672
Get out!

1574
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,870
Don't!

1575
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:33,280
It's too far!

1576
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,676
Please!

1577
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,195
Come on.

1578
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,154
You came back.

1579
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,317
Of course I came back.

1580
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,880
I'll never leave you again.

1581
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:33,836
I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.

1582
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:35,440
We're together now.

1583
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,839
It's gonna be fine.

1584
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,270
At least I got to see you.

1585
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,671
One last time.

1586
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:49,234
No!

1587
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:50,680
Please, no.

1588
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:55,435
Come back.

1589
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,559
We did it, Plumette!

1590
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,951
Victory is ours.

1591
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:09,631
- Oh...
- Plumette?

1592
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,800
Plumette?

1593
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,120
Oh, my darling, Plumette.

1594
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:17,554
Oh, no.

1595
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:21,239
Maestro, you were so brave.

1596
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,997
Goodbye, my love.

1597
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:26,640
Amore.

1598
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,839
No! Don't leave me!

1599
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,315
Chip!

1600
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:51,949
Chip!

1601
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,640
Have you seen Chip? He ran off.

1602
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,876
Where is my little boy?

1603
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,798
- Mama!
- Oh, no!

1604
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,394
Mom!

1605
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:24,996
Lumière...

1606
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,754
I can't...

1607
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:27,870
speak.

1608
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,553
It's all right, Cogsworth.

1609
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:30,670
I can't...

1610
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:32,390
Lumière...

1611
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,916
my friend.

1612
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,271
It was an honor to serve...

1613
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,510
with you.

1614
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:42,795
The honor was mine.

1615
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:11,920
Come back.

1616
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,634
Please don't leave me.

1617
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:18,991
I love you.

1618
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:36,831
Oh. Maestro!

1619
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,314
Madame!

1620
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,240
Maestro!

1621
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,476
Ooh.

1622
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,389
- Lumière!
- Ah?

1623
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:09,030
Cogsworth, we beat the clock!

1624
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,316
Mon ami!

1625
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,550
Plumette!

1626
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,032
Plumette!

1627
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:21,720
Oh. Mon amour.

1628
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:25,630
Oh.

1629
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,753
Oh. Oh.

1630
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:46,352
Chip! Look at you!

1631
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,600
You're a little boy again!

1632
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,877
What did I tell you, darling?

1633
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,753
You smell so good!

1634
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:01,710
Froufrou, finalmente!

1635
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,430
Darling?

1636
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,559
Oh! Mr. Potts!

1637
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,677
Beatrice! I remember!

1638
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:10,069
I do!

1639
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,316
Henry?

1640
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,796
Henry!

1641
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,519
Oh! Oh, dear.

1642
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:23,236
Oh!

1643
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:25,439
I've been so lonely.

1644
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,319
Turn back into a clock.

1645
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,034
Turn back into a clock.

1646
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,391
Lumière, look!

1647
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,354
Oh, my Prince!

1648
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,719
Hello, old friend.

1649
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,029
Oh! It's so good to see you.

1650
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,793
You saved our lives, mademoiselle.

1651
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,434
Belle! It's me!

1652
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:47,114
It's Chip!

1653
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:55,592
Tale as old as time

1654
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,879
Tune as old as song

1655
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:04,671
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change

1656
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:10,313
Learning you were wrong

1657
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:31,511
Winter turns to spring

1658
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,196
Famine turns to feast

1659
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:39,751
Nature points the way

1660
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,833
Nothing left to say

1661
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:48,916
Beauty and the Beast

1662
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:53,916
What? What is it?

1663
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,276
How would you feel about growing a beard?

1664
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:07,350
Certain as the sun

1665
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:11,639
Rising in the east

1666
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,360
Tale as old as time

1667
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:17,155
Song as old as rhyme

1668
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:20,478
Beauty and the Beast

1669
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:26,552
Tale as old as time

1670
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,957
Song as old as rhyme

1671
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:34,791
Beauty and the Beast

1672
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:20,280
How does a moment last forever?

1673
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:24,150
How can a story never die?

1674
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:28,439
It is love we must hold on to

1675
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:32,680
Never easy but we try

1676
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:37,156
Sometimes our happiness is captured

1677
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:42,313
Somehow a time and place stand still

1678
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:46,269
Love lives on inside our hearts

1679
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:50,036
And always will

1680
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:55,194
Minutes turn to hours

1681
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:00,276
Days to years then gone

1682
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:04,275
But when all else has been forgotten

1683
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:10,554
Still our song lives on

1684
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:16,439
Maybe some moments weren't so perfect

1685
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:20,236
Maybe some memories not so sweet

1686
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:24,639
But we have to know some bad times

1687
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:29,357
Or our lives are incomplete

1688
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,036
Then when shadows overtake us

1689
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:37,720
Just when we feel all hope is gone

1690
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:41,999
We'll hear our song and know once more

1691
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:46,200
Our love lives on

1692
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:57,958
Oh, oh

1693
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:12,754
How does a moment last forever?

1694
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:16,231
How does our happiness endure?

1695
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:19,996
Through the darkest of our troubles

1696
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:25,110
Love is beauty, love is pure

1697
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:29,115
Love pays no mind to desolation

1698
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:33,115
It flows like a river through the soul

1699
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:37,320
Protects, proceeds, and perseveres

1700
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:41,872
And makes us whole

1701
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,960
Minutes turn to hours

1702
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:50,353
Days to years then gone

1703
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:56,797
But when all else has been forgotten

1704
02:01:57,400 --> 02:02:03,954
Still our song lives on

1705
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:10,199
How does a moment last forever

1706
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:18,038
When our song lives on

1707
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:48,040
Ah

1708
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:58,153
Tale as old as time

1709
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:03,952
True as it can be

1710
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:08,479
Barely even friends

1711
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:15,638
Then somebody bends unexpectedly

1712
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:22,076
Just a little change

1713
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,192
Small to say the least

1714
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,080
Both a little scared

1715
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:32,074
Neither one prepared

1716
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:36,951
Beauty and the Beast

1717
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:43,394
Ever just the same

1718
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:49,752
Ever a surprise

1719
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:52,355
Ever as before

1720
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:55,638
And ever just as sure

1721
02:03:55,800 --> 02:04:00,238
As the sun will rise

1722
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:03,757
Oh

1723
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:10,434
Hey

1724
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:15,790
Ah

1725
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:20,916
Ooh

1726
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,079
Uh-huh

1727
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:29,473
Ever just the same

1728
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:35,272
And ever a surprise

1729
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,759
Ever as before

1730
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:42,754
And ever just as sure

1731
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:47,358
As the sun will rise

1732
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:51,190
Oh, oh, oh

1733
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:56,150
Tale as old as time

1734
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,951
Tune as old as song

1735
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:03,679
Oh

1736
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:07,274
Bittersweet and strange

1737
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:10,274
Finding you can change

1738
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:13,154
Learning you were wrong

1739
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:19,074
Certain as the sun

1740
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:22,159
Certain as the sun

1741
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,880
Rising in the east

1742
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,760
Tale as old as time

1743
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:30,879
Song as old as rhyme

1744
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:35,393
Beauty and the Beast

1745
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,640
Tale as old as time

1746
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:42,833
Song as old as rhyme

1747
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:49,998
Beauty and the Beast

1748
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:22,190
I was the one who had it all

1749
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:27,354
I was the master of my fate

1750
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,631
I never needed anybody in my life

1751
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:37,352
I learned the truth too late

1752
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,912
I'll never shake away the pain

1753
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:46,992
I close my eyes but she's still there

1754
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:51,831
I let her steal into my melancholy heart

1755
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:57,593
It's more than I can bear

1756
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:03,320
Now I know she'll never leave me

1757
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:07,952
Even as she runs away

1758
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:12,717
She will still torment me Calm me, hurt me

1759
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:16,874
Move me, come what may

1760
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:21,798
Wasting in my lonely tower

1761
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:26,830
Waiting by an open door

1762
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:31,320
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1763
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:37,594
And be with me for evermore

1764
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:43,315
I rage against the trials of love

1765
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:47,914
I curse the fading of the light

1766
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:52,593
Though she's already flown
So far beyond my reach

1767
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:58,798
She's never out of sight

1768
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:03,637
Now I know she'll never leave me

1769
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:08,353
Even as she fades from view

1770
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:11,035
She will still inspire me

1771
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:16,838
Be a part of everything I do

1772
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:21,999
Wasting in my lonely tower

1773
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:27,117
Waiting by an open door

1774
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:30,956
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1775
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:35,390
And as the long, long nights begin

1776
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:39,915
I'll think of all that might have been

1777
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:47,078
Waiting here for evermore

1778
