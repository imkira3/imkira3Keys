"In order to affect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions,

3
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:05,319
and to ensure the common good,

4
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:08,739
a state of emergency is declared
for these territories

5
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:11,450
by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett,

6
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:14,662
duly appointed representative
of His Majesty, the King.

7
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:18,791
By decree, according to martial law,

8
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,336
the following statutes
are temporarily amended:

9
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,089
Right to assembly, suspended.

10
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:31,053
Right to habeas corpus, suspended.

11
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:35,726
Right to legal counsel, suspended.

12
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:40,981
Right to verdict by a jury of peers,
suspended.

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,362
By decree, all persons
found guilty of piracy,

14
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:50,574
or aiding a person convicted of piracy,

15
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:54,578
or associating with a person
convicted of piracy...

16
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:59,374
...shall be sentenced to
hang by the neck until dead. "

17
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:35,286
The King and his men

18
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:39,999
Stole the Queen from her bed

19
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,673
And bound her in her bones

20
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:51,969
The seas be ours

21
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:56,391
And by the powers

22
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:04,650
Where we will, we'll roam

23
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,993
Yo ho

24
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,914
All hands

25
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:24,962
Hoist the colours high

26
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:30,008
Heave-ho

27
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:34,513
Thieves and beggars

28
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:40,894
Never shall we die

29
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:45,775
Yo ho

30
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,571
Haul together

31
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:51,781
Hoist the colours high

32
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,032
Lord Beckett!

33
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,287
They've started to sing, sir.

34
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:04,127
- Finally.
- Thieves and beggars

35
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:10,467
Never shall we die

36
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,085
Some have died and some are alive

37
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:49,465
Others sail on the sea

38
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:53,469
With the keys to the cage

39
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:55,930
And the devil to pay

40
00:04:56,056 --> 00:05:00,059
We lay to Fiddler's Green

41
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:07,108
The bell has been raised
from its watery grave

42
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:10,820
Hear its sepulchral tone

43
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:17,077
A call to all
Pay heed the squall

44
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:28,964
Turn your sails to home

45
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:33,134
Yo ho

46
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,804
Haul together

47
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:39,474
Hoist the colours high

48
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:43,603
Heave-ho

49
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:45,814
- Thieve...
- Thief and beggar.

50
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:49,193
Never shall we die

51
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:54,615
A dangerous song to be singing...

52
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:57,535
...for any who are
ignorant of its meaning.

53
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,037
Particularly a woman.

54
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:04,000
Particularly a woman alone.

55
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:06,961
What makes you think she's alone?

56
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,050
You protect her?

57
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,429
And what makes you think
I need protecting?

58
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:19,140
Your master's expecting us.

59
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:23,561
And an unexpected death'd
cast a slight pall on our meeting.

60
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:26,606
Pick those feet up!

61
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,277
On the double!

62
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:33,530
Eyes front!

63
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:43,999
No, no, no. None.

64
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,822
It always takes me
about a week to get my sea legs.

65
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:17,075
I was throwing up horribly
the last time.

66
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:30,254
Steady as she goes.

67
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:34,842
All right.

68
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:40,431
Have you heard anything from Will?

69
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:42,850
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts,

70
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:46,354
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.

71
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,940
Is he that terrifying?

72
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:53,945
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

73
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:11,463
We're through. Make ready.

74
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:19,304
Hurry now.

75
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:29,565
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

76
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,944
Well, when you put it that way...

77
00:08:34,612 --> 00:09:24,288
Remove. Please.

78
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:13,797
Captain Barbossa,
welcome to Singapore.

79
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:19,511
More steam.

80
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,077
None of that.

81
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,123
If things don't go the way we want, then
we're the only chance they've got.

82
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,967
I understand that you have
a request to make of me.

83
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:01,137
More of a proposal to put to ye.

84
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:06,934
I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

85
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:11,772
It's an odd coincidence.

86
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:14,942
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

87
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:17,403
No.

88
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:20,114
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

89
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:24,160
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

90
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:27,331
and tried to make off with these.

91
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,668
The navigational charts.

92
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:36,006
The route to the Farthest Gate.

93
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:43,013
Wouldn't it be amazing
if this venture of yours

94
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:46,475
took you to the world beyond this one?

95
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:49,394
It would strain credulity at that.

96
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:08,164
This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?

97
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,379
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.

98
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:15,713
No, no!

99
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,560
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.

100
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:33,898
- I assure you I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!

101
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,489
You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

102
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:43,908
But I cannot help but wonder...

103
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:46,911
Why?

104
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:58,799
The song has been sung.

105
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:02,094
The time is upon us.

106
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:06,390
We must convene the Brethren Court.

107
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:12,438
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honour the call.

108
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,441
More steam.

109
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:23,949
More steam!

110
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,586
- There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.

111
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:36,546
It is true.

112
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,883
It seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...

113
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,554
...is by betraying other pirates.

114
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:48,475
- We must put our differences aside.
- Wait for the signal.

115
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,728
The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

116
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:56,483
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

117
00:13:56,609 --> 00:14:02,072
Against East India Trading Company,
what value is the Brethren Court?

118
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,574
What can any of us do?

119
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:07,494
You can fight!
Get off me!

120
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,997
You are Sao Feng,
the Pirate Lord of Singapore.

121
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:15,795
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

122
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:19,715
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,

123
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,051
and those who pass the test
become legend.

124
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:25,513
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?

125
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:28,682
The most notorious pirates
from around the world

126
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,768
are uniting against our enemy,

127
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:33,938
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

128
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:41,278
Elizabeth Swann.

129
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:45,533
There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

130
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:50,246
And the eye does not go wanting.

131
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,170
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

132
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:01,883
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

133
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,176
Jack Sparrow.

134
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,265
He's one of the pirate lords.

135
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,647
The only reason...

136
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,694
...I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...

137
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:24,739
...is so I can send him back myself!

138
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:33,415
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

139
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,960
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

140
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:39,672
So we must go and get him back.

141
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:48,222
So you admit...

142
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:50,808
...you have deceived me.

143
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,226
Weapons!

144
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,689
Weapons.

145
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:01,360
Sao Feng, I assure you,
our intentions are strictly honourable.

146
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:11,370
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!

147
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,625
Kill him. He's not our man.

148
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:20,589
If he's not with you,
and he's not with us...

149
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,133
...who's he with?

150
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,636
Charge!

151
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:47,491
Will!

152
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,384
Look out! Look behind you!

153
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:08,638
Ready!

154
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:11,182
Fire.

155
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,026
Chart!

156
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,721
Boo!

157
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:54,059
Company!

158
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:57,688
Make ready. Set. Fire!

159
00:18:04,654 --> 00:18:05,654
Company!

160
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:07,740
Make ready. Set.

161
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:11,910
Fire!

162
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:31,222
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

163
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:36,227
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

164
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,729
It is coincidence only.

165
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:45,320
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

166
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:51,076
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

167
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:54,162
Why should I expect any better?

168
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:57,123
I need the Black Pearl
to free my father.

169
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,003
You're helping me to get it.

170
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:19,397
Fire in the hole.

171
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:40,960
Thank you, Jack.

172
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:46,006
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.

173
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:49,385
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

174
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:52,305
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

175
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:54,182
This way. Be quick.

176
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:03,233
Haul the snotters with a will!

177
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:05,026
Keep it taut.

178
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,072
Secure provisions and stow the cargo.

179
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:11,992
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

180
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,953
Do you think he will honour the call?

181
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,497
I cannot say.

182
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:20,625
There's an evil on these seas

183
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,047
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

184
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,618
A piece of eight.

185
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,120
Nine of them, you say.

186
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:40,249
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

187
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,959
Nine pieces of eight.

188
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,545
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.

189
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:46,964
Nothing can hold against the armada.

190
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,258
Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.

191
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,842
Nothing we know of.

192
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,597
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

193
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,393
He was mum on that, sir.

194
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:02,397
Then he knows the value of information.

195
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:05,275
Better keep this between ourselves.

196
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:08,653
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

197
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:15,243
- Admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

198
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:18,037
Yes. Something for you there.

199
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:21,499
Your new station deserves an old friend.

200
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,601
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

201
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,227
Execution.

202
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:48,319
The Brethren know they face extinction.

203
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:53,699
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

204
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:21,686
No one said anything about cold.

205
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:25,523
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

206
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:29,444
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

207
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:34,074
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

208
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:39,621
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

209
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:44,876
to a place not of death, but punishment.

210
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,755
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

211
00:23:49,215 --> 00:23:51,424
...stretching on forever.

212
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:55,387
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

213
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:02,937
I knew there was a good reason.

214
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:16,158
Nothing here is set.

215
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,870
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

216
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,291
But it leads to more places.

217
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,882
"Over the edge.

218
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:34,385
Over again. "

219
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,931
"Sunrise sets.

220
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:41,976
Flash of green. "

221
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:46,857
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

222
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,529
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

223
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:57,159
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

224
00:24:57,243 --> 00:25:01,037
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

225
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:04,458
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

226
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,335
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

227
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,590
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

228
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:19,765
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

229
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:23,185
It's not getting to the
land of the dead that's the problem.

230
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:27,190
It's getting back.

231
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:13,737
- Bosun! Head to wind! Lift the sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

232
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,992
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

233
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,412
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

234
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,873
Fetch the chest.

235
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,751
And the governor?

236
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:32,256
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

237
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,675
Does he know?

238
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,932
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

239
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,163
Step lively, men.

240
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,165
Step lively!

241
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,460
Stand fast!

242
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,843
Steady, men.

243
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:09,521
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

244
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:12,524
I will not have it on my ship!

245
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:16,154
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
because I will.

246
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:19,115
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

247
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,577
that this ship do as directed
by the Company.

248
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:30,210
We need prisoners to interrogate,

249
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:33,546
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

250
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,467
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.

251
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:41,429
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

252
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:48,144
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

253
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:52,816
This is no longer your world, Jones.

254
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:57,029
The immaterial has become...

255
00:28:58,156 --> 00:28:59,907
...immaterial.

256
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:03,077
Charge your bayonets.

257
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,453
How long do we continue not talking?

258
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,001
Once we rescue Jack
everything'll be fine.

259
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,547
Then we rescue Jack.

260
00:30:20,823 --> 00:30:24,035
For what we want most...

261
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:29,332
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

262
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:45,556
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

263
00:30:46,475 --> 00:30:49,102
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

264
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:51,187
to find a place as can't be found.

265
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,606
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

266
00:30:53,857 --> 00:30:56,359
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

267
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:58,945
To stations!

268
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,489
All hands to stations!

269
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:07,246
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

270
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,167
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

271
00:31:14,045 --> 00:31:15,295
Blimey.

272
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,688
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

273
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,399
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

274
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:39,319
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

275
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:45,326
Tie her off.

276
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,709
Hard aport.

277
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:03,469
Hold on!

278
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:40,049
Strike your colours,
you blooming cockroaches.

279
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:45,638
Dead men tell no tales.

280
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:35,272
My peanut.

281
00:33:36,857 --> 00:33:38,942
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

282
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:41,319
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

283
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:43,530
Step lively with a will.

284
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:45,198
- Aye, aye.
- Right away, sir.

285
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:46,950
I want a fire down below!

286
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:53,791
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

287
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:06,053
Haul!

288
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,517
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalise the lateens.

289
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,394
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

290
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,368
- Mr Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.

291
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,872
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

292
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:37,002
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

293
00:34:37,086 --> 00:34:40,922
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

294
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:43,425
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

295
00:34:43,509 --> 00:34:47,054
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

296
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,597
Shall I?

297
00:34:53,353 --> 00:34:56,438
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

298
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,027
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

299
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:06,323
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

300
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:08,200
Do you understand?

301
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:11,411
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

302
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:15,123
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

303
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,668
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

304
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:21,255
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

305
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:24,300
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

306
00:35:24,343 --> 00:35:27,261
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

307
00:35:30,057 --> 00:35:34,060
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

308
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:45,988
No wind.

309
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,491
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

310
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,578
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

311
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:57,500
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

312
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:12,766
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

313
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:14,518
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

314
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:18,313
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

315
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:32,995
Shoo.

316
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:53,266
A rock.

317
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:24,131
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

318
00:37:26,927 --> 00:37:28,469
A rope.

319
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:52,282
This truly is a godforsaken place.

320
00:39:53,076 --> 00:39:56,119
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.

321
00:39:57,455 --> 00:39:59,081
He's here.

322
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:02,459
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

323
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:03,960
And does it matter?

324
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:07,089
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

325
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:15,431
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

326
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:57,641
Impossible.

327
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:04,273
Boat.

328
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:14,533
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.

329
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:26,378
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

330
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:27,546
Hide the rum.

331
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,548
- Mr Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.

332
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:31,008
I thought so.

333
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,011
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

334
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:35,096
Sir?

335
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:39,184
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

336
00:41:39,268 --> 00:41:41,603
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

337
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:45,231
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.

338
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:52,238
I know that.
I know where I am.

339
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:56,534
- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.

340
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:59,120
Oh, Hector.

341
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:01,122
It's been too long. Hasn't it?

342
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:06,002
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

343
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:09,255
No, I didn't.

344
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,424
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

345
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:15,386
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

346
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:18,641
He thinks we're a hallucination.

347
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,227
William, tell me something:

348
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:25,314
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

349
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:28,943
or rather,
damsel in distress? Either one.

350
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:30,486
No.

351
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,988
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

352
00:42:33,073 --> 00:42:37,076
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

353
00:42:37,118 --> 00:42:38,494
Jack.

354
00:42:40,664 --> 00:42:42,581
This is real. We're here.

355
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:56,262
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

356
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,974
We've come to rescue you.

357
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:04,104
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

358
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:07,524
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,

359
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,778
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

360
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:16,116
I see my ship. Right there.

361
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,162
Can't spot it.

362
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:24,583
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.

363
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:27,460
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

364
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:30,881
- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.

365
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:33,800
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

366
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:37,762
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

367
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:40,432
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

368
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:42,310
And you need a crew.

369
00:43:44,396 --> 00:43:46,606
Why should I sail with any of you?

370
00:43:46,648 --> 00:43:50,151
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

371
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:57,325
Oh, she's not told you.

372
00:43:57,409 --> 00:44:00,244
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

373
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,080
As for you.

374
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:10,171
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

375
00:44:11,173 --> 00:44:13,215
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

376
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,217
Don't need you. You scare me.

377
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:17,678
Gibbs, you can come. Marty.

378
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:20,264
Cotton.

379
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:25,520
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.

380
00:44:26,689 --> 00:44:27,981
Who are you?

381
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:30,359
Tai Huang. These are my men.

382
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:34,863
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

383
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:38,951
- I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

384
00:44:39,035 --> 00:44:43,038
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

385
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:44,331
Weigh anchor.

386
00:44:47,877 --> 00:44:49,503
Jack...

387
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:54,424
Which way are you going, Jack?

388
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:59,888
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

389
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:02,516
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

390
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:04,017
What are you doing?

391
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:09,524
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

392
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:12,068
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

393
00:45:12,152 --> 00:45:14,320
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

394
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:17,907
- My ship makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

395
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,451
That makes you "Chartman. "

396
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:25,415
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

397
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:34,465
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

398
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:37,468
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

399
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:38,803
Sorry.

400
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:45,852
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

401
00:46:21,264 --> 00:46:23,140
You left Jack to the Kraken.

402
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:26,310
He's rescued now. It's done with.

403
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:31,483
Will, I had no choice.

404
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:34,569
You chose not to tell me.

405
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:37,238
I couldn't.

406
00:46:38,574 --> 00:46:40,158
It wasn't your burden to bear.

407
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,036
But I did bear it, didn't I?

408
00:46:44,747 --> 00:46:46,623
I just didn't know what it was.

409
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:49,042
I thought...

410
00:46:50,211 --> 00:46:52,212
You thought I loved him.

411
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:04,557
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

412
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:08,853
You can't.

413
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:38,592
Eerie.

414
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:42,555
That's downright macabre.

415
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:51,730
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

416
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:03,869
Be disrespectful, it would.

417
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:07,706
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

418
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:12,502
That was the duty
him was charged with...

419
00:48:12,795 --> 00:48:15,505
...by the goddess, Calypso.

420
00:48:17,383 --> 00:48:21,178
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

421
00:48:24,473 --> 00:48:26,433
And every 10 years...

422
00:48:27,268 --> 00:48:29,394
...him could come ashore...

423
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:34,733
...to be with she
who love him... truly.

424
00:48:39,072 --> 00:48:41,657
But the man has become a monster.

425
00:48:42,284 --> 00:48:46,287
So, he wasn't always... tentacley?

426
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:49,582
No.

427
00:48:51,793 --> 00:48:54,170
Him was a man...

428
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:56,255
...once.

429
00:49:03,555 --> 00:49:05,598
Now there's boats coming.

430
00:49:13,273 --> 00:49:16,025
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

431
00:49:16,652 --> 00:49:19,238
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

432
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:21,573
It's best just let them be.

433
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:38,507
It's my father. We've made it back.

434
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:41,176
Father! Father, here, look here!

435
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:44,054
Elizabeth.

436
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:47,516
We're not back.

437
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:55,691
Father!

438
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:02,448
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

439
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:05,034
No. No.

440
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,745
I think I am.

441
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,789
No, you can't be.

442
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:13,793
There was this chest, you see.

443
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:18,214
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

444
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,133
Come aboard.

445
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,968
And a heart.

446
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:27,307
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

447
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,893
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

448
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:33,980
The Dutchman must have a captain.

449
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,066
Silly thing to die for.

450
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,653
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

451
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:43,574
Come on.

452
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:48,912
A touch... of destiny.

453
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,083
Take the line.

454
00:50:55,587 --> 00:50:57,755
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

455
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,590
Father, the line! Take the line!

456
00:51:03,386 --> 00:51:05,721
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

457
00:51:05,764 --> 00:51:10,059
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!

458
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:12,686
I'll give your love to your mother.

459
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:14,855
Please, I won't let you go!

460
00:51:23,865 --> 00:51:25,116
Is there a way?

461
00:51:29,955 --> 00:51:31,623
Him at peace.

462
00:51:39,048 --> 00:51:40,632
No water.

463
00:51:41,759 --> 00:51:43,843
Why is all but the rum gone?

464
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:46,930
Rum's gone too.

465
00:51:55,106 --> 00:51:59,734
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

466
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:03,696
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

467
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:06,992
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

468
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:08,911
Forever.

469
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:12,957
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

470
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,251
Why doesn't he do something?

471
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:18,504
- Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

472
00:52:18,588 --> 00:52:22,925
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

473
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:27,972
"Over the edge. " Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

474
00:52:28,598 --> 00:52:30,558
Sunrises don't set.

475
00:52:35,063 --> 00:52:36,981
"Up is down. "

476
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:39,525
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

477
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:41,569
Why are these things never clear?

478
00:52:41,653 --> 00:52:44,488
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

479
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,662
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

480
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:53,874
- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.

481
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:56,501
That's even more
than less than unhelpful.

482
00:52:56,544 --> 00:52:59,337
Sail the seas for eternity.

483
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,340
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

484
00:53:02,383 --> 00:53:04,384
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

485
00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:09,473
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

486
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:13,477
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

487
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:17,022
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

488
00:53:17,064 --> 00:53:19,399
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

489
00:53:19,484 --> 00:53:21,735
But eternity is longer still.

490
00:53:22,487 --> 00:53:25,530
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

491
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:27,574
Or not?

492
00:53:27,658 --> 00:53:31,537
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

493
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,165
Come sunset, it won't matter.

494
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,669
Not sunset.

495
00:53:41,924 --> 00:53:43,132
Sundown.

496
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:46,636
And rise. Up.

497
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,096
What's that?

498
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:55,061
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?

499
00:53:55,103 --> 00:53:56,812
- Where?
- There.

500
00:54:18,628 --> 00:54:19,962
What is it?

501
00:54:31,975 --> 00:54:33,809
He's rocking the ship.

502
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:35,811
We're rocking the ship.

503
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:42,818
Aye. He's onto it.

504
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:46,822
He's rocking the ship.

505
00:54:46,864 --> 00:54:49,283
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

506
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:51,994
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

507
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:54,664
Time it with the swell.

508
00:54:56,292 --> 00:55:00,003
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

509
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:05,341
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

510
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,325
Now up...

511
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,578
...is down.

512
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:52,596
This was your idea.

513
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:56,683
Blessed sweet westerlies!

514
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:58,810
We're back!

515
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:03,899
It's the sunrise.

516
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:19,039
Parley?

517
00:58:19,123 --> 00:58:21,583
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

518
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:38,434
All right, then!

519
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:41,646
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.

520
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:45,399
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.

521
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:46,901
I is arguing the point.

522
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:50,571
If there's pirates a-gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

523
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:54,075
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

524
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,452
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

525
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:59,580
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

526
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:01,249
till there be none left but you.

527
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:07,631
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

528
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:08,757
Aye.

529
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:13,595
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

530
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,681
I'm still working on that.

531
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:20,269
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

532
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:27,276
Wet powder.

533
00:59:29,988 --> 00:59:33,532
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

534
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:38,078
Sorry. Effective, though.

535
00:59:39,163 --> 00:59:41,206
There's fresh water on this island.

536
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:44,918
We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

537
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:48,005
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

538
00:59:48,464 --> 00:59:50,925
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

539
00:59:50,968 --> 00:59:54,637
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

540
00:59:55,848 --> 00:59:57,181
Temporarily.

541
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,576
Mind the boat.

542
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:30,506
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

543
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:51,528
Careful! Careful!

544
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:54,990
You stupid fish!

545
01:00:55,116 --> 01:00:57,076
Actually it's a cephalopod.

546
01:00:57,535 --> 01:00:58,744
Serves you right.

547
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,872
Pin, I bet people would pay
a shilling to see this.

548
01:01:01,957 --> 01:01:05,125
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

549
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:08,212
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

550
01:01:08,296 --> 01:01:11,131
We could serve up a slice as a souvenir.

551
01:01:11,216 --> 01:01:13,802
Still thinking of running, Jack?

552
01:01:14,553 --> 01:01:17,055
Think you can outrun the world?

553
01:01:22,728 --> 01:01:26,564
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

554
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:29,359
...by and by, there be none left at all.

555
01:01:30,736 --> 01:01:35,740
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

556
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:38,952
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

557
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:42,330
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

558
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,500
But passing on, that's dead certain.

559
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:51,881
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

560
01:01:51,924 --> 01:01:53,675
It's our only hope, lad.

561
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:58,097
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

562
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:02,393
The world used to be a bigger place.

563
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:06,939
The world's still the same.

564
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,652
There's just... less in it.

565
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:36,302
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

566
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:42,893
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!

567
01:02:42,977 --> 01:02:44,978
- Singapore.
- Captain!

568
01:02:47,815 --> 01:02:48,899
Hoy!

569
01:02:49,984 --> 01:02:51,777
We got company!

570
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:04,956
He's the captain.

571
01:03:15,384 --> 01:03:16,676
Sao Feng...

572
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:21,265
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

573
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:25,686
Jack Sparrow.

574
01:03:27,689 --> 01:03:29,774
You paid me great insult once.

575
01:03:29,858 --> 01:03:31,359
That doesn't sound like me.

576
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,407
Shall we just call it square, then?

577
01:03:38,951 --> 01:03:40,118
Release her.

578
01:03:40,911 --> 01:03:44,747
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

579
01:03:45,624 --> 01:03:47,625
You heard Captain Turner.

580
01:03:49,169 --> 01:03:51,754
- Release her!
- "Captain Turner?"

581
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,590
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

582
01:03:54,675 --> 01:03:57,218
I need the Pearl to free my father.

583
01:03:57,302 --> 01:03:59,804
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

584
01:04:00,347 --> 01:04:03,183
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

585
01:04:03,226 --> 01:04:05,435
It was my burden to bear.

586
01:04:07,689 --> 01:04:11,984
He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.

587
01:04:12,068 --> 01:04:16,113
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

588
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:20,075
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

589
01:04:29,294 --> 01:04:30,752
I'm standing with them.

590
01:04:32,922 --> 01:04:38,594
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

591
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:42,306
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

592
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,936
Here is your chance to find out.

593
01:04:56,363 --> 01:04:58,031
Curious.

594
01:04:58,115 --> 01:05:01,284
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

595
01:05:01,327 --> 01:05:05,872
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

596
01:05:05,998 --> 01:05:07,916
can defeatthe Flying Dutchman.

597
01:05:08,626 --> 01:05:12,086
And so despair leads to betrayal.

598
01:05:12,463 --> 01:05:16,466
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

599
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:20,762
It's not here, Jack.

600
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:23,556
What? What isn't?

601
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:28,145
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,

602
01:05:28,188 --> 01:05:31,232
and so unavailable for use as leverage

603
01:05:31,316 --> 01:05:33,984
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

604
01:05:34,027 --> 01:05:37,321
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

605
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:39,490
By your death?

606
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:41,659
And yet here you are.

607
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,828
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

608
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:46,330
That's how I get by.

609
01:05:47,207 --> 01:05:50,834
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

610
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:54,546
Ship oars.

611
01:05:54,839 --> 01:05:56,465
Be on your guard, men.

612
01:05:59,094 --> 01:06:00,970
My men are crew enough.

613
01:06:01,012 --> 01:06:03,180
Company ship, company crew.

614
01:06:04,266 --> 01:06:07,184
You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.

615
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:09,479
And so it was.

616
01:06:12,525 --> 01:06:15,527
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

617
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:20,907
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

618
01:06:27,373 --> 01:06:32,043
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

619
01:06:33,129 --> 01:06:35,213
Square my debt with Jones...

620
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:38,091
...guarantee my freedom?

621
01:06:38,175 --> 01:06:39,801
Of course.

622
01:06:39,885 --> 01:06:41,803
It's just good business.

623
01:06:42,888 --> 01:06:47,684
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

624
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:49,936
Everything.

625
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:51,731
Where are they meeting?

626
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:54,525
Who are the pirate lords?

627
01:06:55,485 --> 01:06:58,696
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

628
01:06:59,323 --> 01:07:02,450
Prepare the brig.

629
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:10,041
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.

630
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:13,753
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?

631
01:07:20,927 --> 01:07:25,264
Shame they're not bound to honour
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

632
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:28,601
Because honour's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

633
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:32,439
There is no honour
to remaining with the losing side.

634
01:07:32,523 --> 01:07:37,069
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

635
01:07:37,111 --> 01:07:40,989
- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.

636
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:42,574
Now the Pearl!

637
01:07:43,576 --> 01:07:45,494
And what do the Brethren have?

638
01:07:46,204 --> 01:07:49,289
We have Calypso.

639
01:07:58,049 --> 01:07:59,424
Calypso.

640
01:08:01,469 --> 01:08:03,470
An old legend.

641
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:09,559
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

642
01:08:09,977 --> 01:08:15,274
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

643
01:08:15,317 --> 01:08:20,655
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

644
01:08:22,991 --> 01:08:24,617
All the Court.

645
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,162
You can keep Barbossa.

646
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:32,333
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

647
01:08:32,376 --> 01:08:34,919
And Turner. Especially Turner.

648
01:08:35,003 --> 01:08:38,464
The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

649
01:08:38,507 --> 01:08:42,844
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

650
01:08:42,928 --> 01:08:47,473
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

651
01:08:50,185 --> 01:08:52,353
What interest is she to you?

652
01:08:54,857 --> 01:08:57,234
What are you proposing, captain?

653
01:08:57,318 --> 01:09:00,320
What be accepting, cap'n?

654
01:09:01,781 --> 01:09:04,158
- The girl.
- What?

655
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,784
Jack.

656
01:09:06,453 --> 01:09:08,245
I've just recalled.

657
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:13,333
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

658
01:09:13,877 --> 01:09:16,128
So for what do I need you?

659
01:09:16,212 --> 01:09:18,213
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

660
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:20,382
Out of the question.

661
01:09:20,425 --> 01:09:22,217
It was not a question.

662
01:09:22,302 --> 01:09:24,052
Points to the thing you want most.

663
01:09:24,137 --> 01:09:26,346
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

664
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:29,641
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

665
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,728
- Dead.
- Done.

666
01:09:32,812 --> 01:09:35,481
What? Not done.

667
01:09:35,565 --> 01:09:38,108
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

668
01:09:38,193 --> 01:09:39,277
Damn.

669
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:47,243
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass

670
01:09:47,328 --> 01:09:51,831
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

671
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:54,542
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

672
01:09:54,585 --> 01:09:56,336
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

673
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:59,923
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

674
01:10:00,508 --> 01:10:02,884
Then we have an accord?

675
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:07,305
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

676
01:10:07,389 --> 01:10:10,600
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

677
01:10:10,643 --> 01:10:13,603
...able to withstand blockade for years.

678
01:10:13,646 --> 01:10:18,233
Then you'd be wishing, "If only there
was someone I had not killed inside

679
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:21,779
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside. "

680
01:10:22,656 --> 01:10:24,573
And you can accomplish all this?

681
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:28,953
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

682
01:10:29,287 --> 01:10:30,329
Who am I?

683
01:10:32,624 --> 01:10:34,333
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

684
01:10:38,171 --> 01:10:39,338
Done!

685
01:11:12,623 --> 01:11:13,790
Man overboard!

686
01:11:27,847 --> 01:11:29,055
You're mad.

687
01:11:29,348 --> 01:11:32,601
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

688
01:11:50,495 --> 01:11:53,456
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

689
01:12:00,964 --> 01:12:05,718
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

690
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:09,639
Which ship do we follow?

691
01:12:09,723 --> 01:12:14,393
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.

692
01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:17,897
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

693
01:12:20,734 --> 01:12:22,068
She's going down!

694
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:23,653
Stand clear!

695
01:12:27,742 --> 01:12:32,663
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

696
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,540
Sir.

697
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:23,965
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

698
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:27,593
Calypso.

699
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,263
Excuse me?

700
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:35,601
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...

701
01:13:36,186 --> 01:13:37,812
...but it is what we call you.

702
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,898
We being who?

703
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,447
You confirm it.

704
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,199
Confirm what?

705
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:56,081
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

706
01:13:56,166 --> 01:14:00,753
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

707
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:03,756
They bound you to human form

708
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,301
so the rule of the seas
would belong to Man, and not...

709
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,136
To me.

710
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:16,560
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

711
01:14:16,644 --> 01:14:19,229
Pretty speech from a captor.

712
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:23,317
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

713
01:14:23,651 --> 01:14:26,653
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

714
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:32,868
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

715
01:14:32,952 --> 01:14:36,748
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

716
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:40,335
I offer simply my desire.

717
01:14:41,796 --> 01:14:43,296
And in return?

718
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:48,343
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

719
01:14:52,389 --> 01:14:56,392
And if I should choose not?

720
01:14:57,895 --> 01:14:59,896
Then I will take...

721
01:15:01,232 --> 01:15:02,232
...your fury.

722
01:15:28,051 --> 01:15:29,343
Sao Feng?

723
01:15:30,929 --> 01:15:32,054
Here.

724
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:33,931
Please.

725
01:15:39,771 --> 01:15:43,315
With all nine pieces of eight...

726
01:15:45,777 --> 01:15:47,862
...you will be free.

727
01:15:49,698 --> 01:15:50,823
Take it!

728
01:15:52,659 --> 01:15:54,493
You are captain now.

729
01:15:55,662 --> 01:15:56,704
Me?

730
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:03,962
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

731
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:08,633
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

732
01:16:10,094 --> 01:16:13,638
Forgive me... Calypso.

733
01:16:22,857 --> 01:16:23,982
Sao.

734
01:16:29,071 --> 01:16:30,780
What did he tell you?

735
01:16:35,828 --> 01:16:37,704
He made me captain.

736
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,209
Set! Fire!

737
01:16:47,674 --> 01:16:49,675
You are not my captain.

738
01:16:49,968 --> 01:16:51,302
Elizabeth.

739
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:53,721
James. James.

740
01:16:58,477 --> 01:17:00,436
Thank God, you're alive.

741
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:02,688
Your father'll be overjoyed

742
01:17:02,773 --> 01:17:05,608
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

743
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:08,819
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

744
01:17:09,821 --> 01:17:11,739
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

745
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:15,826
Who among you
do you name as captain?

746
01:17:15,869 --> 01:17:17,370
Captain. Her.

747
01:17:22,001 --> 01:17:23,085
Captain?

748
01:17:23,169 --> 01:17:26,838
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

749
01:17:28,132 --> 01:17:30,092
The captain shall have my quarters.

750
01:17:31,678 --> 01:17:33,136
Thank you, sir.

751
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:36,932
- But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.

752
01:17:37,016 --> 01:17:38,517
I swear.

753
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:40,519
I did not know.

754
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:44,731
Know what?
Which side you chose?

755
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,491
Well, now you do.

756
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:04,168
Bootstrap?

757
01:18:12,761 --> 01:18:14,095
Bootstrap.

758
01:18:14,596 --> 01:18:15,805
Bill Turner?

759
01:18:16,932 --> 01:18:18,099
Bootstrap.

760
01:18:27,276 --> 01:18:29,152
You know my name.

761
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:34,032
Yes, I know your son.

762
01:18:36,118 --> 01:18:37,618
Will Turner.

763
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:40,163
William.

764
01:18:46,046 --> 01:18:48,547
He made it. He's alive.

765
01:18:48,631 --> 01:18:52,843
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

766
01:18:54,804 --> 01:18:57,181
God's wounds. He's on his way.

767
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,640
Yes, Will is alive.

768
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,643
And he wants to help you.

769
01:19:07,108 --> 01:19:10,736
He can't help me. He won't come.

770
01:19:11,488 --> 01:19:13,072
But you're his father.

771
01:19:13,907 --> 01:19:15,657
I know you.

772
01:19:16,493 --> 01:19:18,077
He spoke of you.

773
01:19:20,038 --> 01:19:23,207
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

774
01:19:24,584 --> 01:19:25,626
Me?

775
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:28,880
You're Elizabeth.

776
01:19:30,257 --> 01:19:31,716
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

777
01:19:33,511 --> 01:19:38,515
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

778
01:19:39,058 --> 01:19:41,935
Captain... Forever.

779
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:47,774
The Dutchman
must always have a captain.

780
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:50,568
And if he saves me...

781
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:53,655
...he loses you.

782
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:57,700
I see.

783
01:19:59,703 --> 01:20:01,538
He won't pick me.

784
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:04,666
I wouldn't pick me.

785
01:20:09,713 --> 01:20:11,257
Tell him not to come.

786
01:20:13,468 --> 01:20:15,594
Tell him to stay away.

787
01:20:16,888 --> 01:20:18,931
Tell him it's too late.

788
01:20:20,517 --> 01:20:22,768
I'm already a part of the ship...

789
01:20:24,855 --> 01:20:26,480
...and the crew.

790
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:29,650
Bootstrap.

791
01:20:32,737 --> 01:20:37,616
You know my name.

792
01:20:38,869 --> 01:20:40,703
Yes, I know your son.

793
01:20:41,705 --> 01:20:43,414
William.

794
01:20:46,126 --> 01:20:47,960
He's coming for me.

795
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,171
Wait and see.

796
01:20:51,256 --> 01:20:52,591
You'll see.

797
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,760
He promised.

798
01:21:12,195 --> 01:21:14,112
Swing her over.

799
01:21:15,323 --> 01:21:17,115
Ready those lines.

800
01:21:28,836 --> 01:21:30,003
Sir.

801
01:21:33,382 --> 01:21:35,259
A breadcrumb trail.

802
01:21:35,302 --> 01:21:39,639
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

803
01:21:39,723 --> 01:21:44,894
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

804
01:21:46,188 --> 01:21:50,191
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

805
01:21:52,027 --> 01:21:54,320
We can only hope
to reach our destination

806
01:21:54,363 --> 01:21:56,405
before they run out of bodies.

807
01:22:10,045 --> 01:22:13,130
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

808
01:22:14,049 --> 01:22:17,469
William, do you notice anything?

809
01:22:19,138 --> 01:22:20,347
Rather...

810
01:22:20,765 --> 01:22:24,309
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

811
01:22:25,061 --> 01:22:28,063
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

812
01:22:28,147 --> 01:22:29,606
Not as odd as this.

813
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:33,485
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

814
01:22:33,528 --> 01:22:36,571
I said to myself, "Think like Jack. "

815
01:22:36,948 --> 01:22:39,157
This is what you've arrived at?

816
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,286
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

817
01:22:42,745 --> 01:22:44,454
...accomplish your own ends?

818
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:46,331
It's like you don't know me at all.

819
01:22:49,627 --> 01:22:52,713
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

820
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:58,553
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

821
01:23:01,932 --> 01:23:03,516
I'm losing her, Jack.

822
01:23:04,226 --> 01:23:08,187
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

823
01:23:08,647 --> 01:23:12,358
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

824
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:16,070
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

825
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:19,240
...avoid the choice altogether.

826
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:21,534
Change the facts.

827
01:23:22,578 --> 01:23:25,580
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

828
01:23:26,373 --> 01:23:27,707
Who?

829
01:23:31,962 --> 01:23:32,962
You?

830
01:23:35,299 --> 01:23:38,718
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

831
01:23:38,761 --> 01:23:42,306
I slip aboard the Dutchman, find
the heart, stab the beating thing,

832
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:44,141
your father's free from his debt,

833
01:23:44,225 --> 01:23:46,935
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

834
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:50,856
You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...

835
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:54,902
- ... forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.

836
01:23:54,944 --> 01:23:58,989
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

837
01:23:59,324 --> 01:24:01,408
You have to do the job though, Jack.

838
01:24:01,534 --> 01:24:04,536
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

839
01:24:05,163 --> 01:24:07,373
Or end up just like Jones.

840
01:24:09,834 --> 01:24:11,835
I don't have the face for tentacles.

841
01:24:13,671 --> 01:24:16,256
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

842
01:24:20,261 --> 01:24:21,428
What's this for?

843
01:24:21,471 --> 01:24:24,182
Think like me. It'll come to you.

844
01:24:37,446 --> 01:24:39,823
My regards to Davy Jones.

845
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:46,579
I hate him.

846
01:24:51,168 --> 01:24:52,293
Come with me.

847
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,090
Quickly.

848
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:07,393
What are you doing?

849
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,105
Choosing a side.

850
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:39,592
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

851
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:42,011
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

852
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,473
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

853
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:49,519
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

854
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:54,733
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

855
01:25:58,237 --> 01:25:59,321
Come with us.

856
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,076
James, come with me.

857
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:08,205
Who goes there?

858
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,918
Go. I will follow.

859
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:16,171
You're lying.

860
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:21,801
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

861
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,722
...but never joined.

862
01:26:32,231 --> 01:26:33,940
Go, now.

863
01:26:39,905 --> 01:26:42,073
Back to your station, sailor.

864
01:26:43,909 --> 01:26:49,163
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

865
01:26:49,248 --> 01:26:50,957
That's an order.

866
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,669
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

867
01:26:54,753 --> 01:26:57,505
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

868
01:26:57,631 --> 01:27:00,466
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

869
01:27:00,551 --> 01:27:02,969
All hands, prisoner escape!

870
01:27:03,303 --> 01:27:05,513
- Belay that!
- James!

871
01:27:17,277 --> 01:27:19,361
Prisoner escape!

872
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:23,490
James! No!

873
01:27:32,542 --> 01:27:35,335
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

874
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,462
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

875
01:27:40,675 --> 01:27:43,218
- To the captain's cabin!
- Aye!

876
01:27:43,303 --> 01:27:45,304
Back to the ship.

877
01:27:47,265 --> 01:27:51,184
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

878
01:28:00,529 --> 01:28:02,614
I take that as a "no. "

879
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:08,661
Nice sword.

880
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,646
The Dutchman is under my command.

881
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,443
For now.

882
01:28:55,251 --> 01:28:57,294
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

883
01:28:57,379 --> 01:28:59,755
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

884
01:28:59,839 --> 01:29:03,258
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

885
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:05,761
You heard him. Step lively.

886
01:29:05,845 --> 01:29:08,180
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

887
01:29:08,264 --> 01:29:11,100
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

888
01:29:11,142 --> 01:29:12,393
Aye.

889
01:29:12,435 --> 01:29:16,605
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

890
01:29:16,648 --> 01:29:18,274
What you call him?

891
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:20,652
Larry.

892
01:29:24,365 --> 01:29:27,325
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

893
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:29,411
But we agreed on ends only.

894
01:29:29,453 --> 01:29:32,455
The means are mine to decide.

895
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:34,999
Caution, Barbossa.

896
01:29:35,084 --> 01:29:39,295
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

897
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:43,216
Or what it mean if you fail me.

898
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:49,347
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

899
01:29:49,432 --> 01:29:53,143
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

900
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:56,604
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

901
01:29:57,148 --> 01:30:00,443
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

902
01:30:00,485 --> 01:30:02,695
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

903
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:07,658
Take this fishwife to the brig.

904
01:30:09,494 --> 01:30:11,620
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

905
01:30:39,441 --> 01:30:43,445
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

906
01:30:43,529 --> 01:30:45,447
Apparently, you can.

907
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:47,657
I believe you know each other.

908
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:56,374
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

909
01:30:56,459 --> 01:30:57,834
Not yours.

910
01:30:58,252 --> 01:30:59,461
His.

911
01:31:00,379 --> 01:31:02,506
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

912
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:05,425
Sparrow?

913
01:31:06,886 --> 01:31:08,470
You didn't tell him.

914
01:31:08,554 --> 01:31:11,765
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the Black Pearl.

915
01:31:12,558 --> 01:31:15,435
What else have you not told me?

916
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:20,232
There is an issue far more troublesome.

917
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:25,154
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

918
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:29,492
Not a person.

919
01:31:30,244 --> 01:31:31,285
A heathen god.

920
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:34,914
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams,

921
01:31:34,957 --> 01:31:38,292
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

922
01:31:38,377 --> 01:31:41,504
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

923
01:31:42,422 --> 01:31:45,007
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

924
01:31:45,801 --> 01:31:47,593
No! They cannot!

925
01:31:47,678 --> 01:31:50,638
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

926
01:31:50,722 --> 01:31:53,683
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

927
01:31:56,228 --> 01:32:00,231
I showed them how to bind her.

928
01:32:00,274 --> 01:32:02,275
She could not be trusted.

929
01:32:02,317 --> 01:32:04,151
She gave me no choice.

930
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:07,656
We must act before they release her.

931
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:09,491
You loved her.

932
01:32:10,743 --> 01:32:12,703
She's the one.

933
01:32:12,787 --> 01:32:14,788
And then you betrayed her.

934
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:18,625
She pretended to love me.

935
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:22,462
She betrayed me.

936
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:28,844
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.

937
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,808
Do not test me.

938
01:32:34,893 --> 01:32:36,643
I hadn't finished that.

939
01:32:38,646 --> 01:32:40,772
You will free my father.

940
01:32:41,482 --> 01:32:43,942
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

941
01:32:43,985 --> 01:32:45,611
Along with my own.

942
01:32:45,653 --> 01:32:48,239
Your terms are steep, Mr Turner.

943
01:32:48,324 --> 01:32:51,075
We will expect fair value in return.

944
01:32:51,493 --> 01:32:55,455
There is only one price I will accept:

945
01:32:55,497 --> 01:32:58,583
Calypso murdered.

946
01:33:00,502 --> 01:33:02,837
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.

947
01:33:04,882 --> 01:33:08,259
Jack has sailed
the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.

948
01:33:09,303 --> 01:33:14,515
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?

949
01:33:26,362 --> 01:33:28,947
What is it you want most?

950
01:34:00,897 --> 01:34:02,439
Look at them all.

951
01:34:02,524 --> 01:34:06,610
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

952
01:34:07,404 --> 01:34:09,405
And I owe them all money.

953
01:34:14,829 --> 01:34:17,288
As he who issued summons,

954
01:34:17,373 --> 01:34:21,918
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

955
01:34:26,007 --> 01:34:29,467
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

956
01:34:29,593 --> 01:34:34,305
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

957
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:45,650
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces ofjunk.

958
01:34:45,735 --> 01:34:49,446
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

959
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:53,867
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

960
01:34:54,578 --> 01:34:55,619
So change the name.

961
01:34:56,830 --> 01:35:01,042
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

962
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,461
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

963
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:09,592
Master Ragetti, if you will.

964
01:35:10,385 --> 01:35:13,387
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

965
01:35:13,472 --> 01:35:16,557
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.

966
01:35:19,436 --> 01:35:20,519
Sparrow.

967
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:30,279
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

968
01:35:30,322 --> 01:35:34,325
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

969
01:35:34,367 --> 01:35:35,993
Sao Feng is dead.

970
01:35:38,122 --> 01:35:40,207
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.

971
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:41,583
The plagued ship.

972
01:35:42,835 --> 01:35:46,213
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

973
01:35:46,756 --> 01:35:49,257
Listen. Listen to me.

974
01:35:49,342 --> 01:35:51,551
Our location has been betrayed.

975
01:35:51,636 --> 01:35:55,263
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

976
01:35:55,348 --> 01:35:59,017
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

977
01:35:59,393 --> 01:36:01,436
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

978
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:04,231
It matters not how they found us.
The question is:

979
01:36:04,315 --> 01:36:06,817
What will we do now that they have?

980
01:36:06,859 --> 01:36:08,360
We fight.

981
01:36:12,448 --> 01:36:15,867
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

982
01:36:15,952 --> 01:36:18,746
A well supplied fortress.

983
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:23,167
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

984
01:36:23,919 --> 01:36:27,296
There be a third course.

985
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:30,967
In another age, at this very spot,

986
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:36,556
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

987
01:36:39,268 --> 01:36:40,726
That was a mistake.

988
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,480
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

989
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,568
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

990
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:52,989
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

991
01:36:53,073 --> 01:36:56,909
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

992
01:36:56,952 --> 01:37:01,331
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.

993
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:03,250
You all know this to be true.

994
01:37:04,085 --> 01:37:05,419
Gentlemen.

995
01:37:06,546 --> 01:37:07,713
Ladies.

996
01:37:12,343 --> 01:37:15,345
We must free Calypso.

997
01:37:24,355 --> 01:37:26,773
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

998
01:37:26,858 --> 01:37:30,777
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

999
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:33,363
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

1000
01:37:33,448 --> 01:37:36,325
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

1001
01:37:36,409 --> 01:37:38,327
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

1002
01:37:38,411 --> 01:37:42,247
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

1003
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:44,500
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.

1004
01:37:57,473 --> 01:38:00,642
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

1005
01:38:00,726 --> 01:38:03,311
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

1006
01:38:03,395 --> 01:38:05,980
If they not be here already.

1007
01:38:42,143 --> 01:38:44,520
My sweet.

1008
01:38:44,813 --> 01:38:46,939
You come for me.

1009
01:38:47,899 --> 01:38:52,861
- You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.

1010
01:38:52,946 --> 01:38:57,199
Trapped in this single form.

1011
01:38:57,701 --> 01:39:00,077
Cut off from the sea.

1012
01:39:00,537 --> 01:39:03,163
From all that I love.

1013
01:39:04,416 --> 01:39:05,833
From you.

1014
01:39:06,543 --> 01:39:11,047
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.

1015
01:39:12,425 --> 01:39:17,846
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

1016
01:39:18,514 --> 01:39:23,059
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

1017
01:39:24,854 --> 01:39:28,023
...you weren't there.

1018
01:39:29,066 --> 01:39:31,651
Why weren't you there?

1019
01:39:35,072 --> 01:39:36,698
It's my nature.

1020
01:39:37,908 --> 01:39:42,495
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

1021
01:39:43,664 --> 01:39:47,459
I do not love you.

1022
01:39:49,963 --> 01:39:53,674
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

1023
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,886
But never cruel.

1024
01:39:57,721 --> 01:40:00,681
You have corrupted your purpose...

1025
01:40:02,059 --> 01:40:04,643
...and so your self.

1026
01:40:05,729 --> 01:40:10,608
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

1027
01:40:30,462 --> 01:40:33,548
Calypso.

1028
01:40:36,594 --> 01:40:38,470
I will be free.

1029
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:44,101
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.

1030
01:40:44,852 --> 01:40:47,854
And we would be together always.

1031
01:40:48,481 --> 01:40:51,858
If only you had a heart to give.

1032
01:40:56,656 --> 01:40:58,156
Why did you come?

1033
01:41:16,009 --> 01:41:21,180
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

1034
01:41:21,557 --> 01:41:23,558
The Brethren Court?

1035
01:41:25,519 --> 01:41:30,356
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...

1036
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:33,109
...is how cruel I can be.

1037
01:41:37,698 --> 01:41:42,160
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

1038
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:47,123
My heart will always belong to you.

1039
01:42:00,513 --> 01:42:04,308
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

1040
01:42:04,392 --> 01:42:06,685
We should be the ones to set her free.

1041
01:42:06,728 --> 01:42:11,064
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

1042
01:42:11,149 --> 01:42:13,650
Whose boons? Your boons?

1043
01:42:13,735 --> 01:42:16,695
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

1044
01:42:16,738 --> 01:42:21,158
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

1045
01:42:22,410 --> 01:42:23,452
Cuttlefish.

1046
01:42:27,707 --> 01:42:30,334
Let us not, dear friends,

1047
01:42:30,418 --> 01:42:33,420
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

1048
01:42:33,922 --> 01:42:36,131
Flipping glorious little sausages.

1049
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:40,178
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

1050
01:42:40,262 --> 01:42:41,513
Human nature, isn't it?

1051
01:42:41,597 --> 01:42:43,598
Or fish nature.

1052
01:42:43,682 --> 01:42:47,435
So, yes. We could hole up here
well provisioned and well armed.

1053
01:42:47,478 --> 01:42:49,646
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

1054
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:53,650
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

1055
01:42:58,614 --> 01:43:04,369
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

1056
01:43:04,453 --> 01:43:08,456
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

1057
01:43:09,959 --> 01:43:11,209
I rather doubt it.

1058
01:43:12,002 --> 01:43:16,005
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

1059
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:18,967
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

1060
01:43:23,473 --> 01:43:26,225
We are left with but one option.

1061
01:43:26,309 --> 01:43:30,145
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

1062
01:43:32,482 --> 01:43:34,900
...Captain Swann. We must fight.

1063
01:43:35,485 --> 01:43:38,696
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

1064
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:39,822
- Have so.
- Have not.

1065
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:41,031
- Have so.
- Have not!

1066
01:43:41,157 --> 01:43:44,326
- You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

1067
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:48,706
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1068
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:53,002
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

1069
01:43:53,044 --> 01:43:54,461
We must fight...

1070
01:43:55,213 --> 01:43:56,714
...to run away.

1071
01:43:56,798 --> 01:43:57,840
Aye!

1072
01:44:00,885 --> 01:44:05,348
As per the Code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

1073
01:44:05,391 --> 01:44:08,143
can only be declared by the pirate king.

1074
01:44:08,352 --> 01:44:10,937
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?

1075
01:44:11,022 --> 01:44:15,525
I call on Cap'n Teague.
Keeper of the Code.

1076
01:44:16,527 --> 01:44:19,988
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

1077
01:44:21,616 --> 01:44:24,117
Hang the Code. Who cares a...

1078
01:44:32,126 --> 01:44:33,960
Code is the law.

1079
01:44:45,974 --> 01:44:47,975
You're in my way, boy.

1080
01:44:57,194 --> 01:44:59,820
- The Code.
- The Code.

1081
01:44:59,905 --> 01:45:02,156
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

1082
01:45:20,175 --> 01:45:24,136
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

1083
01:45:27,016 --> 01:45:28,517
Sea turtles.

1084
01:45:44,242 --> 01:45:45,951
Barbossa is right.

1085
01:45:46,369 --> 01:45:47,577
Hang on a minute.

1086
01:45:49,038 --> 01:45:50,997
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

1087
01:45:51,082 --> 01:45:54,543
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries... "

1088
01:45:54,627 --> 01:45:55,627
Fancy that.

1089
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:58,130
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

1090
01:45:58,214 --> 01:45:59,881
And that's not likely to change.

1091
01:45:59,966 --> 01:46:01,967
- Not likely.
- Why not?

1092
01:46:02,135 --> 01:46:04,761
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

1093
01:46:04,804 --> 01:46:08,307
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

1094
01:46:08,392 --> 01:46:09,475
I call for a vote.

1095
01:46:14,314 --> 01:46:16,649
I vote for Ammand the Corsair.

1096
01:46:16,734 --> 01:46:19,318
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

1097
01:46:19,653 --> 01:46:22,321
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

1098
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,158
Mistress Ching.

1099
01:46:25,242 --> 01:46:26,659
Gentleman Jocard.

1100
01:46:27,327 --> 01:46:29,912
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.

1101
01:46:29,997 --> 01:46:31,748
Vallenueva!

1102
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:33,916
Elizabeth Swann.

1103
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,878
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

1104
01:46:39,423 --> 01:46:41,048
Vote for me. Vote for me.

1105
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:44,927
What you talking about?

1106
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:49,850
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the Code, then?

1107
01:46:58,693 --> 01:46:59,860
Very well.

1108
01:47:03,239 --> 01:47:08,243
What say you, Captain Swann,
King of the Brethren Court?

1109
01:47:10,205 --> 01:47:12,539
Prepare every vessel that floats.

1110
01:47:13,374 --> 01:47:14,541
At dawn...

1111
01:47:16,127 --> 01:47:17,336
...we're at war.

1112
01:47:21,132 --> 01:47:24,718
And so we shall go to war.

1113
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,400
What?

1114
01:47:40,402 --> 01:47:43,196
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.

1115
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:46,574
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

1116
01:47:47,117 --> 01:47:50,578
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

1117
01:47:54,542 --> 01:47:58,628
The trick is
living with yourself forever.

1118
01:48:02,675 --> 01:48:03,842
How's Mum?

1119
01:48:10,766 --> 01:48:12,308
She looks great.

1120
01:48:33,748 --> 01:48:37,334
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

1121
01:49:00,693 --> 01:49:03,194
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

1122
01:49:12,163 --> 01:49:13,330
Parley?

1123
01:50:10,097 --> 01:50:13,724
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

1124
01:50:13,809 --> 01:50:18,020
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

1125
01:50:18,063 --> 01:50:22,609
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

1126
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:27,739
My hands are clean in this.

1127
01:50:28,741 --> 01:50:29,908
Figuratively.

1128
01:50:30,451 --> 01:50:32,911
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

1129
01:50:32,996 --> 01:50:36,415
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

1130
01:50:36,499 --> 01:50:38,458
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.

1131
01:50:39,419 --> 01:50:42,754
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

1132
01:50:43,589 --> 01:50:47,426
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

1133
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:54,599
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

1134
01:50:55,768 --> 01:51:00,772
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

1135
01:51:01,524 --> 01:51:04,902
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

1136
01:51:04,945 --> 01:51:08,865
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

1137
01:51:08,949 --> 01:51:13,911
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.

1138
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:17,790
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

1139
01:51:17,875 --> 01:51:20,293
- You escaped.
- Technically.

1140
01:51:20,335 --> 01:51:22,420
I propose an exchange.

1141
01:51:24,465 --> 01:51:26,340
Will leaves with us...

1142
01:51:27,092 --> 01:51:28,843
...and you can take Jack.

1143
01:51:30,971 --> 01:51:31,971
Done.

1144
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:34,307
- Undone.
- Done.

1145
01:51:34,391 --> 01:51:37,935
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

1146
01:51:37,978 --> 01:51:39,479
King.

1147
01:51:41,982 --> 01:51:46,028
- As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!

1148
01:51:51,242 --> 01:51:54,953
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1149
01:51:57,624 --> 01:51:59,666
First to the finish, then?

1150
01:52:20,939 --> 01:52:23,524
Do you fear death?

1151
01:52:25,026 --> 01:52:26,820
You've no idea.

1152
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:31,616
Advise your Brethren:

1153
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:34,786
You can fight, and all of you will die.

1154
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:39,374
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.

1155
01:52:39,959 --> 01:52:42,043
You murdered my father.

1156
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:45,421
He chose his own fate.

1157
01:52:46,048 --> 01:52:48,800
And you have chosen yours.

1158
01:52:48,884 --> 01:52:50,927
We will fight.

1159
01:52:51,554 --> 01:52:53,346
And you will die.

1160
01:52:58,144 --> 01:52:59,769
So be it.

1161
01:53:05,776 --> 01:53:07,152
King?

1162
01:53:07,236 --> 01:53:10,072
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

1163
01:53:10,574 --> 01:53:12,908
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.

1164
01:53:19,332 --> 01:53:20,332
Bravo!

1165
01:53:21,376 --> 01:53:25,588
You've successfully arrived aboard
the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.

1166
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:27,381
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

1167
01:53:27,424 --> 01:53:30,509
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1168
01:53:31,761 --> 01:53:32,928
Go away.

1169
01:53:33,013 --> 01:53:36,182
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

1170
01:53:37,017 --> 01:53:38,100
Stab the heart.

1171
01:53:43,982 --> 01:53:49,111
Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.

1172
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:54,534
Then again...

1173
01:53:55,369 --> 01:53:57,078
...if you're in the brig...

1174
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:00,582
...who's to stab the heart?

1175
01:54:03,085 --> 01:54:05,962
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

1176
01:54:07,673 --> 01:54:09,341
Peanut.

1177
01:54:09,467 --> 01:54:12,802
We'll need to use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.

1178
01:54:12,887 --> 01:54:17,057
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.

1179
01:54:17,642 --> 01:54:21,102
Barbossa, you can't release her.

1180
01:54:21,145 --> 01:54:23,063
We need to give Jack a chance.

1181
01:54:23,648 --> 01:54:28,610
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

1182
01:54:31,489 --> 01:54:32,781
No longer.

1183
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:36,494
The enemy...

1184
01:54:37,663 --> 01:54:39,997
...has opted for oblivion.

1185
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:44,752
Ready the fleet.

1186
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:47,088
To your stations.

1187
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:57,348
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

1188
01:54:57,432 --> 01:54:58,683
Aye.

1189
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:02,395
The items brought together, done.

1190
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:04,855
Items to be burned...

1191
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:07,692
...and someone must speak the words:

1192
01:55:07,776 --> 01:55:11,279
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds. "

1193
01:55:11,363 --> 01:55:12,363
Is that it?

1194
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:16,743
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

1195
01:55:22,834 --> 01:55:28,130
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

1196
01:55:37,807 --> 01:55:41,768
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.

1197
01:55:46,733 --> 01:55:47,733
He didn't...

1198
01:55:48,234 --> 01:55:50,068
You have to say it right.

1199
01:55:58,704 --> 01:55:59,704
Calypso...

1200
01:56:05,085 --> 01:56:07,503
...I release you from your human bonds.

1201
01:56:26,106 --> 01:56:27,774
Tia Dalma.

1202
01:56:30,235 --> 01:56:31,569
Calypso.

1203
01:56:34,031 --> 01:56:38,201
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

1204
01:56:40,622 --> 01:56:44,541
- Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.

1205
01:56:45,794 --> 01:56:47,586
Davy Jones.

1206
01:57:01,601 --> 01:57:05,437
This is it! This is it!

1207
01:57:48,065 --> 01:57:49,816
Calypso!

1208
01:57:52,027 --> 01:57:57,157
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

1209
01:57:59,034 --> 01:58:03,914
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favour.

1210
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:09,962
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

1211
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:14,842
...but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

1212
01:58:15,343 --> 01:58:16,510
...or mine.

1213
01:59:14,445 --> 01:59:15,445
Is that it?

1214
01:59:18,449 --> 01:59:20,450
Why, she's no help at all.

1215
01:59:24,121 --> 01:59:25,455
What now?

1216
01:59:26,332 --> 01:59:27,457
Nothing.

1217
01:59:28,418 --> 01:59:31,337
Our final hope has failed us.

1218
01:59:58,824 --> 02:00:01,826
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

1219
02:00:01,868 --> 02:00:05,830
We've an armada against us, and
with the Dutchman, there's no chance.

1220
02:00:05,872 --> 02:00:08,165
There's only a fool's chance.

1221
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:11,003
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

1222
02:00:11,087 --> 02:00:14,339
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

1223
02:00:19,345 --> 02:00:20,846
You're right.

1224
02:00:26,185 --> 02:00:28,186
Then what shall we die for?

1225
02:00:31,858 --> 02:00:33,275
You will listen to me.

1226
02:00:34,027 --> 02:00:35,277
Listen!

1227
02:00:38,197 --> 02:00:43,285
The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.

1228
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:45,287
And what will they see?

1229
02:00:45,788 --> 02:00:49,124
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

1230
02:00:49,208 --> 02:00:53,421
No, they will see free men and freedom!

1231
02:00:53,505 --> 02:00:56,924
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

1232
02:00:57,009 --> 02:01:02,221
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

1233
02:01:04,933 --> 02:01:07,226
By the sweat of our brows,

1234
02:01:07,311 --> 02:01:09,646
and the strength of our backs...

1235
02:01:10,064 --> 02:01:13,066
...and the courage of our hearts.

1236
02:01:15,736 --> 02:01:17,236
Gentlemen...

1237
02:01:19,948 --> 02:01:21,407
...hoist the colours.

1238
02:01:23,452 --> 02:01:24,911
Hoist the colours.

1239
02:01:24,953 --> 02:01:27,246
- Hoist the colours.
- Hoist the colours!

1240
02:01:27,331 --> 02:01:29,415
Aye.

1241
02:01:29,458 --> 02:01:33,127
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!

1242
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:37,216
Hoist the colours!

1243
02:02:28,269 --> 02:02:30,478
We have a favourable wind, sir.

1244
02:02:31,188 --> 02:02:32,397
Oh, so we do.

1245
02:02:33,023 --> 02:02:35,984
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

1246
02:02:37,027 --> 02:02:39,112
That should brighten his day.

1247
02:02:43,033 --> 02:02:46,995
To arms! We give no quarter!

1248
02:02:56,213 --> 02:02:58,007
Calypso.

1249
02:03:24,659 --> 02:03:27,578
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?

1250
02:03:27,662 --> 02:03:28,704
That's a bad sign.

1251
02:03:28,789 --> 02:03:33,667
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.

1252
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:50,185
Maelstrom!

1253
02:03:53,397 --> 02:03:55,398
Captain Barbossa!

1254
02:03:56,359 --> 02:03:58,401
We need you at the helm.

1255
02:04:00,905 --> 02:04:03,240
Aye, that be true.

1256
02:04:05,576 --> 02:04:10,539
Brace up yards,
you cackhanded deck apes.

1257
02:04:10,748 --> 02:04:14,668
Dying is the day worth living for.

1258
02:04:24,972 --> 02:04:26,597
Veer off!

1259
02:04:26,682 --> 02:04:28,933
She'll not harm us.

1260
02:04:29,434 --> 02:04:31,769
Full-bore and into the abyss.

1261
02:04:32,479 --> 02:04:33,855
Are you mad?

1262
02:04:35,065 --> 02:04:36,858
You afraid to get wet?

1263
02:04:46,410 --> 02:04:48,786
She's on our stern and gaining.

1264
02:04:48,829 --> 02:04:54,417
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.

1265
02:05:01,383 --> 02:05:03,801
Bow cannons!

1266
02:05:04,304 --> 02:05:06,763
Blow the cannons!

1267
02:05:17,650 --> 02:05:20,527
Take us out or they'll overbear us.

1268
02:05:20,612 --> 02:05:25,490
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.

1269
02:05:26,701 --> 02:05:28,827
Prepare to broadside.

1270
02:05:39,255 --> 02:05:41,506
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

1271
02:05:41,591 --> 02:05:45,427
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.

1272
02:05:52,603 --> 02:05:56,189
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.

1273
02:05:56,273 --> 02:05:58,483
Hinges. Hinges.

1274
02:05:58,525 --> 02:05:59,859
Think like the whelp.

1275
02:05:59,902 --> 02:06:01,361
Half-barrel hinges.

1276
02:06:01,445 --> 02:06:02,737
Leverage.

1277
02:06:07,701 --> 02:06:09,953
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

1278
02:06:11,413 --> 02:06:14,248
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

1279
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:15,875
Nobody move.

1280
02:06:16,961 --> 02:06:18,711
I dropped me brain.

1281
02:06:28,598 --> 02:06:31,392
Batten down the hatches!

1282
02:06:32,686 --> 02:06:34,728
Stand to your guns.

1283
02:06:35,271 --> 02:06:37,773
Midship cannoneers, sight the masts.

1284
02:06:42,028 --> 02:06:44,446
Main battery at the ready!

1285
02:06:49,035 --> 02:06:53,288
Hold there!
Wait till we're boardandboard.

1286
02:06:57,877 --> 02:06:59,586
Fire!

1287
02:06:59,963 --> 02:07:04,299
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!

1288
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:11,850
Fire!

1289
02:07:21,444 --> 02:07:22,610
Come on, men.

1290
02:07:32,913 --> 02:07:37,542
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

1291
02:07:41,922 --> 02:07:44,132
Halt there or we'll shoot.

1292
02:07:45,634 --> 02:07:46,801
Good one.

1293
02:07:49,263 --> 02:07:51,306
I just come to get me effects.

1294
02:07:52,893 --> 02:07:57,104
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?

1295
02:07:57,147 --> 02:07:59,440
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

1296
02:08:00,901 --> 02:08:05,488
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

1297
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:07,198
I blame the fish people.

1298
02:08:07,282 --> 02:08:11,660
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,

1299
02:08:11,703 --> 02:08:14,955
automatically aren't
as disciplined as nonfish people?

1300
02:08:14,998 --> 02:08:17,374
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.

1301
02:08:17,459 --> 02:08:22,338
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

1302
02:08:22,422 --> 02:08:25,841
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

1303
02:08:33,391 --> 02:08:35,435
Prepare to board!

1304
02:08:37,063 --> 02:08:38,271
Cover!

1305
02:08:54,914 --> 02:08:56,665
No!

1306
02:09:22,609 --> 02:09:27,572
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.

1307
02:09:27,614 --> 02:09:31,534
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

1308
02:09:32,828 --> 02:09:34,579
To my great regret.

1309
02:09:35,914 --> 02:09:37,039
But...

1310
02:09:39,751 --> 02:09:41,752
...never too late to learn, eh?

1311
02:09:58,061 --> 02:10:01,398
The chest, hand it over.

1312
02:10:01,441 --> 02:10:03,275
I can set you free, mate.

1313
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:06,403
My freedom was forfeit long ago.

1314
02:10:53,452 --> 02:10:59,791
Elizabeth.

1315
02:11:00,834 --> 02:11:02,168
Will you marry me?

1316
02:11:04,004 --> 02:11:05,838
I don't think now's the best time.

1317
02:11:09,635 --> 02:11:11,678
Now may be the only time.

1318
02:11:16,892 --> 02:11:18,101
I love you.

1319
02:11:24,025 --> 02:11:26,568
I've made my choice. What's yours?

1320
02:11:27,404 --> 02:11:28,696
Barbossa.

1321
02:11:30,198 --> 02:11:31,615
Marry us.

1322
02:11:32,701 --> 02:11:35,369
I'm a little busy at the moment.

1323
02:11:41,584 --> 02:11:43,585
Barbossa, now.

1324
02:11:45,255 --> 02:11:46,588
Fine, then.

1325
02:11:57,475 --> 02:12:00,602
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...

1326
02:12:01,313 --> 02:12:04,857
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.

1327
02:12:09,697 --> 02:12:12,741
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

1328
02:12:12,825 --> 02:12:14,784
- I do.
- Great.

1329
02:12:21,250 --> 02:12:23,543
Will Turner, do you take me...

1330
02:12:24,795 --> 02:12:26,546
...to be your wife...

1331
02:12:30,926 --> 02:12:32,927
...in sickness and in health...

1332
02:12:33,804 --> 02:12:36,056
...with health being the less likely?

1333
02:12:43,272 --> 02:12:44,481
I do.

1334
02:12:46,776 --> 02:12:49,653
As captain, I now pronounce you...

1335
02:12:52,616 --> 02:13:04,794
You may kiss...

1336
02:13:09,758 --> 02:13:11,425
Just kiss.

1337
02:13:50,133 --> 02:13:51,800
Leave it.

1338
02:14:04,021 --> 02:14:06,690
You can do nothing without the key.

1339
02:14:06,774 --> 02:14:08,233
I already have the key.

1340
02:14:09,527 --> 02:14:10,944
No, you don't.

1341
02:14:12,448 --> 02:14:13,739
Oh, that key.

1342
02:14:49,818 --> 02:14:50,818
No!

1343
02:15:17,889 --> 02:15:20,390
Oi. My pistol.

1344
02:15:48,087 --> 02:15:49,462
Turner.

1345
02:15:54,468 --> 02:15:55,468
Fire!

1346
02:16:01,475 --> 02:16:02,976
Thank you, Jack.

1347
02:16:32,841 --> 02:16:34,341
Stop! It's me.

1348
02:16:36,845 --> 02:16:39,763
It's Will. Your son.

1349
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:42,370
Go!

1350
02:18:00,764 --> 02:18:04,850
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

1351
02:18:04,935 --> 02:18:07,269
That's why I brought this.

1352
02:18:26,666 --> 02:18:29,918
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

1353
02:18:38,511 --> 02:18:39,845
Missed.

1354
02:18:41,055 --> 02:18:45,934
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.

1355
02:19:04,287 --> 02:19:05,787
Love.

1356
02:19:06,164 --> 02:19:09,667
A dreadful bond.

1357
02:19:10,419 --> 02:19:15,423
And yet, so easily severed.

1358
02:19:15,507 --> 02:19:20,678
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

1359
02:19:20,763 --> 02:19:22,180
Do you?

1360
02:19:32,941 --> 02:19:36,652
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

1361
02:19:37,237 --> 02:19:41,657
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

1362
02:19:42,534 --> 02:19:44,952
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

1363
02:19:45,537 --> 02:19:47,079
Is it?

1364
02:20:12,857 --> 02:20:13,982
Will?

1365
02:20:15,568 --> 02:20:18,195
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

1366
02:20:24,077 --> 02:20:25,744
William?

1367
02:20:26,162 --> 02:20:27,871
My son.

1368
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:43,263
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!

1369
02:20:46,934 --> 02:20:50,854
You will not forestall my judgment.

1370
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:08,288
Calypso.

1371
02:21:14,129 --> 02:21:19,633
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!

1372
02:21:50,582 --> 02:21:51,665
No.

1373
02:21:55,755 --> 02:21:57,255
No, no.

1374
02:21:57,340 --> 02:21:59,049
No!

1375
02:22:00,343 --> 02:22:04,638
Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1376
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:08,183
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1377
02:22:08,267 --> 02:22:10,310
Don't leave me.

1378
02:22:11,604 --> 02:22:13,313
Don't. No!

1379
02:22:13,356 --> 02:22:15,231
I won't leave you.

1380
02:22:25,368 --> 02:22:27,535
The Dutchman must have a captain.

1381
02:22:30,873 --> 02:22:31,873
Hold on.

1382
02:23:26,597 --> 02:23:28,265
Thank goodness, Jack.

1383
02:23:28,349 --> 02:23:32,310
The armada's still out there. The
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard,

1384
02:23:32,395 --> 02:23:36,481
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1385
02:23:36,566 --> 02:23:39,192
Never actually been one for tradition.

1386
02:23:44,157 --> 02:23:47,200
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

1387
02:23:47,285 --> 02:23:49,536
Belay that.
Or we'll be a sitting duck.

1388
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:50,954
Belay that "belay that. "

1389
02:23:50,997 --> 02:23:52,789
- But, the arma...
- Belay.

1390
02:23:52,874 --> 02:23:55,125
- The Endeav...
- Stow. Shut it.

1391
02:24:08,223 --> 02:24:10,266
What are they waiting for?

1392
02:24:11,226 --> 02:24:14,187
He expects us to honour our agreement.

1393
02:24:16,356 --> 02:24:19,192
Ready guns and gun ports.

1394
02:24:23,197 --> 02:24:27,825
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

1395
02:24:54,687 --> 02:24:57,189
Ah, she survived.

1396
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:25,718
- Ready on the guns.
- Guns ready.

1397
02:25:26,345 --> 02:25:28,513
Full canvas.

1398
02:25:28,556 --> 02:25:30,932
Aye, full canvas.

1399
02:25:55,457 --> 02:25:56,749
Orders, sir.

1400
02:26:00,254 --> 02:26:01,379
Sir!

1401
02:26:02,006 --> 02:26:03,006
Cap'n.

1402
02:26:03,424 --> 02:26:06,092
- Fire.
- Fire!

1403
02:26:06,135 --> 02:26:08,220
- Fire!
- Fire!

1404
02:26:08,263 --> 02:26:10,264
Fire, all!

1405
02:26:20,817 --> 02:26:23,736
Orders? Orders, sir?

1406
02:26:36,124 --> 02:26:37,583
Sir, what do you command?

1407
02:26:38,210 --> 02:26:39,543
It's just...

1408
02:26:41,630 --> 02:26:43,339
...good business.

1409
02:26:45,050 --> 02:26:46,383
Abandon ship!

1410
02:26:46,468 --> 02:26:50,472
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

1411
02:28:16,227 --> 02:28:18,061
They're turning away!

1412
02:28:30,325 --> 02:28:32,200
Wind in your sails.

1413
02:28:37,415 --> 02:28:39,499
Shiver me timbers.

1414
02:29:00,481 --> 02:29:02,565
Captain Turner!

1415
02:29:17,206 --> 02:29:19,290
- Mr Gibbs.
- Cap'n?

1416
02:29:20,501 --> 02:29:23,503
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

1417
02:29:23,587 --> 02:29:25,296
Hooray!

1418
02:29:27,508 --> 02:29:29,300
Now go and get it.

1419
02:29:47,695 --> 02:29:49,321
Orders, sir?

1420
02:29:53,576 --> 02:29:57,621
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman. You're free.

1421
02:29:57,664 --> 02:29:59,665
Aye.

1422
02:29:59,749 --> 02:30:02,167
That's a fine thing, but...

1423
02:30:03,753 --> 02:30:08,465
...by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

1424
02:30:08,508 --> 02:30:10,134
If you'll have me.

1425
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:16,014
On the wheel, then, Mr Turner.

1426
02:30:17,392 --> 02:30:19,393
Aye, Captain Turner.

1427
02:30:34,368 --> 02:30:37,036
This ship has a purpose again.

1428
02:30:37,079 --> 02:30:39,122
And where we are bound...

1429
02:30:39,790 --> 02:30:42,250
...she cannot come.

1430
02:30:42,334 --> 02:30:44,294
One day ashore.

1431
02:30:44,378 --> 02:30:46,463
Ten years at sea.

1432
02:30:47,423 --> 02:30:50,258
That's a steep price
for what's been done.

1433
02:30:52,428 --> 02:30:54,429
Depends on the one day.

1434
02:30:57,224 --> 02:30:59,767
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

1435
02:31:03,565 --> 02:31:05,566
The oars are inside.

1436
02:31:17,204 --> 02:31:19,163
Mrs. Turner.

1437
02:31:24,085 --> 02:31:25,628
Goodbye, poppet.

1438
02:31:31,426 --> 02:31:32,760
Jack.

1439
02:31:33,970 --> 02:31:36,514
It would never
have worked out between us.

1440
02:31:39,434 --> 02:31:42,311
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

1441
02:31:45,775 --> 02:31:47,609
Once was quite enough.

1442
02:31:50,029 --> 02:31:52,030
Thank you.

1443
02:32:11,342 --> 02:32:13,343
I'm going to need the other one.

1444
02:32:45,335 --> 02:32:47,336
It's nearly sunset.

1445
02:33:06,523 --> 02:33:08,191
It's always belonged to you.

1446
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:15,532
Will you keep it safe?

1447
02:33:17,368 --> 02:33:23,624
Yes.

1448
02:33:43,561 --> 02:33:44,561
Will!

1449
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:02,288
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

1450
02:34:31,151 --> 02:34:33,112
Granted it tends to list to port,

1451
02:34:33,154 --> 02:34:36,782
and has been, on occasion,
known to frighten young women.

1452
02:34:36,825 --> 02:34:41,203
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

1453
02:34:41,913 --> 02:34:43,038
Is that it?

1454
02:34:43,623 --> 02:34:45,165
The Black Pearl?

1455
02:34:45,792 --> 02:34:47,084
It's not very big.

1456
02:34:47,961 --> 02:34:50,379
Love, that is a dinghy.

1457
02:34:50,463 --> 02:34:55,801
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and hugeish and...

1458
02:34:56,302 --> 02:34:59,430
...gone. Why is it gone?

1459
02:35:00,348 --> 02:35:01,974
Is that it there?

1460
02:35:03,143 --> 02:35:04,309
Yes, there it is.

1461
02:35:05,311 --> 02:35:06,520
Why is it there?

1462
02:35:07,897 --> 02:35:09,481
It's much larger up close.

1463
02:35:09,524 --> 02:35:11,900
Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.

1464
02:35:11,985 --> 02:35:15,905
- I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?

1465
02:35:15,990 --> 02:35:18,575
- Not what he said.
- I never!

1466
02:35:20,369 --> 02:35:24,497
Mr Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

1467
02:35:24,582 --> 02:35:27,417
The ship? We're on the ship.

1468
02:35:30,045 --> 02:35:32,922
Jack! The ship's gone!

1469
02:35:33,007 --> 02:35:34,048
Really?

1470
02:35:36,093 --> 02:35:39,345
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

1471
02:35:39,430 --> 02:35:42,807
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.

1472
02:35:42,850 --> 02:35:44,350
No, I don't love you.

1473
02:35:44,435 --> 02:35:47,520
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

1474
02:35:47,605 --> 02:35:50,356
It is pronounced "egregious. "

1475
02:35:50,399 --> 02:35:54,444
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

1476
02:35:54,528 --> 02:35:57,198
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance

1477
02:35:57,282 --> 02:36:01,035
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Savvy?

1478
02:36:13,548 --> 02:36:16,509
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

1479
02:36:20,388 --> 02:36:24,433
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?

1480
02:36:24,518 --> 02:36:25,601
Sea turtles?

1481
02:36:25,894 --> 02:36:28,103
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...

1482
02:36:28,188 --> 02:36:30,856
All men up the ratlines.

1483
02:36:31,233 --> 02:36:34,068
All men up the ratlines!

1484
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,409
Oh, you want a taste of this?

1485
02:36:42,912 --> 02:36:46,122
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.

1486
02:36:46,207 --> 02:36:48,834
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.

1487
02:36:48,918 --> 02:36:49,918
Sir?

1488
02:36:51,254 --> 02:36:53,797
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled

1489
02:36:53,881 --> 02:36:56,383
- about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.

1490
02:36:56,509 --> 02:36:59,427
- Again.
- Is that so?

1491
02:36:59,679 --> 02:37:03,348
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

1492
02:37:03,432 --> 02:37:06,101
if we could see that item
you told us about.

1493
02:37:06,185 --> 02:37:08,353
- On the charts.
- Aye.

1494
02:37:08,437 --> 02:37:09,855
With our own eyes.

1495
02:37:09,939 --> 02:37:13,525
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.

1496
02:37:15,444 --> 02:37:18,113
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

1497
02:37:18,489 --> 02:37:21,033
There's more than one way
to live forever.

1498
02:37:21,118 --> 02:37:24,829
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

1499
02:37:35,632 --> 02:37:37,466
Sparrow.

1500
02:37:37,968 --> 02:37:41,971
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

1501
02:38:08,458 --> 02:38:13,086
We're devils and black sheep
Really bad eggs

1502
02:38:32,190 --> 02:38:34,816
Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

1503
02:47:07,216 --> 02:47:12,430
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

1504
02:47:12,514 --> 02:47:15,266
We pillage, we plunder
We rifle and loot

1505
02:47:15,350 --> 02:47:17,143
Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

1506
02:47:17,227 --> 02:47:19,854
We kidnap and ravage
And don't give a hoot

1507
02:47:19,897 --> 02:47:21,731
Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

1508
02:47:21,815 --> 02:47:27,815
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me
