Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:17,368
Charles, you have
finally lost your senses.

3
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,245
This venture is impossible.

4
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,415
For some. Gentlemen, the only way
to achieve the impossible

5
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,417
is to believe it is possible.

6
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,335
That kind of thinking could ruin you.

7
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,421
I'm willing to take that chance.

8
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:33,092
Imagine trading posts
in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...

9
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,516
The nightmare again?

10
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,148
I won't be long.

11
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,195
I'm falling down a dark hole,

12
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,574
then I see strange creatures.

13
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,118
What kind of creatures?

14
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:05,833
Well, there's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.

15
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,002
I didn't know cats could smile.

16
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,296
(SIGHING) Neither did I.

17
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,549
And there's a blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,302
Blue caterpillar.

19
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,095
Hmm.

20
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,891
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

21
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:31,943
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.

22
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,989
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

23
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,115
(LAUGHING)

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,702
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.

25
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,623
But if you get too frightened,
you can always wake up. Like this.

26
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,916
(LAUGHING) Ow!

27
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,545
(SIGHING)

28
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,854
Must we go?

29
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,899
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.

30
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,693
They will notice.

31
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,155
Where's your corset?

32
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,371
And no stockings.

33
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,706
I'm against them.

34
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,457
But you're not properly dressed.

35
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,043
Who's to say what is proper?

36
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,380
What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?

37
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,549
- Would you wear it?
- Alice.

38
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,343
To me, a corset is like a codfish.

39
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,721
Please, not today.

40
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,848
Father would have laughed.

41
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:50,938
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,441
Did you have bad dreams again?

43
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,984
Only one.

44
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,030
It's always the same,
ever since I can remember.

45
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,657
Do you think that's normal?

46
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,452
Don't most people
have different dreams?

47
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,746
I don't know.

48
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,090
There. You're beautiful.

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,217
Now, can you manage a smile?

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

At last. We thought you'd never arrive.

00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:44,075
Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.

53
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,080
You do realize it's well past 4:00.

54
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,790
Now everything will have
to be rushed through.

55
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,542
- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!

56
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:02,884
Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

57
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,096
If only Charles were here...

58
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,306
My condolences.

59
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:13,103
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.

60
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,316
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.

61
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,861
Of course not. I'm pleased
that you purchased the company.

62
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:27,659
I was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when I had the chance.

63
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,161
Charles thought so, too.

Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?

66
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,103
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

67

No.

70
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,823
I had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers

71
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,034
and the men wearing dresses.

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,953
I think you'll do best
to keep your visions to yourself.

73
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,456

Pardon us, sir.
Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.

Where's your head?

78
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,638
I was wondering
what it would be like to fly.

79
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,765
Why would you spend your time

80
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,017
thinking about
such an impossible thing?

81
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,435
Why wouldn't I?

82
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,772
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

83

(FAITH EXHALING EXCITEDLY)

We have a secret to tell you.

00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,331
If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret.

89
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,917
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.

90
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,085
If we tell her, she won't be surprised.

91
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,088
- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.

92
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,923
But now you've brought it up,
you have to.

93

- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.

I wonder if your mother knows

95
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,890
that you two swim naked
in the Havershims' pond.

96
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:16,351
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.

97
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,521
There's your mother right now.

You've ruined the surprise!

00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,611
I could strangle them!

Everyone went to so much effort
to keep the secret.

Does everyone know?

It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.

Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.
When you say yes...

105

But I don't know
if I want to marry Hamish.

106

Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.

107

You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

You don't want to end up
like Aunt Imogene.

And you don't want to be a burden
on Mother, do you?

No.

111
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,772
So you'll marry Hamish.

112
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,649
You will be as happy
as I am with Lowell,

I'll leave you to it.

117
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,494
Shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden, just you and me?

118

Ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.

- What was I saying?
- Hamish has a blockage.

But, alas, he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne.

Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.

Why do they adore her and not me?

She ain't great big,
this is how she normal is.
