00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,667
Doc!

3
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,689
Doc! Doc! Doc!

4
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,525
Doc! Doc!
What?

5
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,612
Okay, relax, Doc. It's
me. It's me! It's Marty.

6
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,156
No, it can't be. I just
sent you back to the future.

7
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,658
Yeah. No, I know.
You did send me

8
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,535
back to the future,
but I'm back.

9
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,787
I'm back
from the future.

10
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,625
Great Scott!

11
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,429
Hey, kids, what time is it?

12
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,057
Howdy Doody time!

13
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,602
Great Scott!

14
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,147
It's Howdy Doody Time

15
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:20,903
Bob Smith and Howdy Do
Say Howdy Do to you

16
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,738
Howdy Doody time?

17
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:32,498
Date. Sunday, November
13, 1955. 7:01 a. m.

18
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,000
Last night's
time travel experiment

19
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,002
was apparently
a complete success.

20
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,671
Lightning struck the clock
tower at precisely 10:04 p. m.

21
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,590
Sending the necessary 1.21
gigawatts into the time vehicle,

22
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,884
which vanished in a
brilliant flash of light

23
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,345
leaving a pair of
fire trails behind.

24
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,514
I, therefore, assume that
Marty and the time vehicle

25
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,393
were transported forward
through time into the year 1985.

26
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,561
After that...

27
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,605
After that, I can't
recall what happened.

28
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,483
In fact, I don't even
remember how I got home.

29
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,360
Perhaps
the gigawatt discharge

30
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,154
coupled with the temporal
displacement field

31
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,697
generated by
the time vehicle

32
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,657
caused a disruption
of my own brain waves

33
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,702
resulting in a condition
of momentary amnesia.

34
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,078
Indeed, I now recall
that moments

35
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,080
after the time vehicle
disappeared

36
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,206
into the future,

37
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,375
I saw a vision
of Marty saying

38
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,377
he had come back
from the future.

39
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,420
Hey, Doc!

40
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,838
Undoubtedly, this was some
sort of residual image...

41
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:21,964
Doc.

42
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,223
Doc, calm down, okay. Just
calm down. It's me. It's Marty.

43
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,851
No, it can't be you! I
sent you back to the future!

44
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,061
That's right, Doc.
That's right,

45
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,063
but I came back again. I
came back from the future.

46
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,147
Don't you
remember last night?

47
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,398
You fainted.
I brought you home.

48
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,068
This can't be happening!
You can't be here!

49
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,360
It doesn't make sense
for you to be here!

50
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,571
I refuse to even believe
that you are here!

51
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,573
Doc, I am here,
and it does make sense.

52
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,201
Look, I came back to
1955 again with you,

53
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,120
the you from 1985, 'cause we
had to get a book from Biff!

54
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,288
So once I got
the book back,

55
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,082
you, that is the you
from 1985,

56
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,917
were in the DeLorean, and
it got struck by lightning,

57
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,086
and you got
sent back to 1885!

58
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,504
1885?

59
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,717
It's a very interesting
story, future boy,

60
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,512
but there's just one little
thing that doesn't make sense.

61
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,972
If the me of the future
is now in the past,

62
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,433
how could you
possibly know about it?

63
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,935
You sent me a letter.

64
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,187
"Dear Marty, if my
calculations are correct,

65
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,772
"you will receive this
letter immediately after

66
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,525
"you saw the DeLorean
struck by lightning.

67
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,444
"First, let me assure you
that I'm alive and well.

68
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,573
"I've been living happily these
past eight months in the year 1885.

69
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,117
"The lightning bolt
that hit the DeLorean

70
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,451
"caused a gigawatt
overload

71
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,120
"which scrambled
the time circuits,

72
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,788
"activated
the Flux Capacitor,

73
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,791
"and sent me
back to 1885.

74
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,626
"The overload shorted
out the time circuits

75
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,670
"and destroyed
the flying circuits.

76
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,422
"Unfortunately, the car
will never fly again. "

77
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,799
It actually flew?

78
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,551
Yeah, we had
a hover conversion done

79
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,136
in the early
21st century.

80
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,138
Incredible!

81
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,307
"I set myself up as a
blacksmith as a front

82
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,686
"while I attempted to repair
the damage to the time circuits.

83
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,604
"Unfortunately,
this proved impossible,

84
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,231
"because suitable
replacement parts

85
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,568
"will not be
invented until 1947.

86
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,194
"However,
I've gotten quite adept

87
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,614
"at shoeing horses
and fixing wagons. "

88
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,702
1885! Amazing!

89
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,038
I actually end up as a
blacksmith in the Old West.

90
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,832
Pretty heavy, huh?

91
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,835
"I have buried the DeLorean
in the abandoned Delgado Mine

92
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,254
"adjacent to the old
Boot Hill Cemetery

93
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,506
"as shown on
the enclosed map.

94
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,133
"Hopefully, it should
remain undisturbed

95
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,678
"and preserved until
you uncover it in 1955.

96
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,099
"Inside, you will find
repair instructions.

97
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,228
"My 1955 counterpart... "
That's me.

98
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,813
"... should have no
problem repairing it

99
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,482
"so that you can drive it
back to the future.

100
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,528
"Once you have returned to
1985, destroy the time machine. "

101
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,113
Destroy it?

102
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,283
Yeah. Well, it's
a long story, Doc.

103
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,244
"Do not, I repeat,
do not attempt

104
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,371
"to come back here
to get me.

105
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:04,043
"I am perfectly happy living in
the fresh air and wide-open spaces.

106
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,629
"And I fear that
unnecessary time travel

107
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,380
"only risks
further disruption

108
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,424
"of the space-time
continuum.

109
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,969
"And please take care
of Einstein for me. "

110
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,639
Einstein?

111
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:21,143
He's your dog, Doc. Einstein is
what you call your dog in 1985.

112
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,106
"I know you will
give him a good home.

113
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,733
"Remember to
walk him twice a day

114
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,194
"and that he only
likes canned dog food.

115
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,489
"These are my wishes. Please
respect them and follow them.

116
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,952
"And so, Marty, I now say
farewell and wish you Godspeed.

117
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,579
"You've been a good, kind,
and loyal friend to me,

118
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,374
"and you made a real
difference in my life.

119
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,918
"I will always treasure
our relationship

120
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,920
"and think on you
with fond memories,

121
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,173
"warm feelings, and a
special place in my heart.

122
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,679
"Your friend in time,
Doc Emmett L. Brown.

123
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,390
"September 1st, 1885."

124
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,269
I never knew I could
write anything so touching.

125
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,104
I know. I know, Doc.
It's beautiful.

126
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,067
It's all right,
Copernicus.

127
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,360
Everything is
gonna be fine.

128
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,321
I'm sorry, Doc. It's all my
fault you're stuck back there.

129
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,990
I never should've
let Biff get to me.

130
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,951
There are plenty worse places
to be than the Old West.

131
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,619
I could have ended up
in the Dark Ages.

132
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,912
They probably
would have burned me

133
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,456
at the stake as
a heretic or something.

134
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,125
Let's look at the map.

135
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,876
All right, according to
this, the time vehicle

136
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,963
is sealed off
in a side tunnel.

137
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,548
We may have to blast.

138
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,895
Whoa!

139
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,940
I think you woke up
the dead with that blast.

140
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,735
Take this camera. I want
to document everything!

141
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,572
This reminds me
of the time

142
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,991
I attempted to reach
the center of the Earth.

143
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,618
I'd been reading my
favorite author, Jules Verne.

144
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,495
I spent weeks preparing
that expedition.

145
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,247
I didn't even
get this far.

146
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,875
Of course, I was only 12 at the time.

147
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,170
You know, it was the
writings of Jules Verne

148
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,756
that had a profound
effect on my life.

149
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,341
It was when I was 11
that I first read

150
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,593
Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea.

151
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,261
It was then
that I realized

152
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,681
that I must devote
my life to science.

153
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,225
Doc, check it out.
Look at this.

154
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,522
My initials!

155
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,941
Just like in Journey to
the Center of the Earth!

156
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,068
That means
the time machine

157
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,778
must be right
through this wall!

158
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,554
It's been buried in here for 70
years, two months, and 13 days.

159
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,972
Astounding!

160
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,058
"As you see,
the lightning bolt

161
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,186
"shorted out the time
circuit control microchip.

162
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,440
"The attached... "

163
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,566
Schematic.

164
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,737
"Schematic diagram will allow
you to build a replacement unit

165
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,364
"with 1955 components,

166
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,158
"thus restoring the time machine
to perfect working order. "

167
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,619
Unbelievable that this
little piece of junk

168
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,704
could be
such a big problem.

169
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,792
No wonder this
circuit failed.

170
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,210
It says,
"Made in Japan. "

171
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,507
What do you mean, Doc? All the
best stuff is made in Japan.

172
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,969
Unbelievable!

173
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,436
You know,
when I was a kid,

174
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,646
I always wanted
to be a cowboy.

175
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,233
And now, knowing I'm gonna
spend my future in the past,

176
00:12:56,317 --> 00:13:00,154
it sounds like a wonderful way
to spend my retirement years.

177
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,115
It just occurred to me,
Marty, since I end up in 1885,

178
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,284
perhaps I'm now in
the history books.

179
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,244
I wonder.

180
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,079
Could I go to the
library and look myself up

181
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,415
in the old
newspaper archives?

182
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,624
I don't know, Doc.

183
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,876
You're the one that's
always saying, you know,

184
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,961
it's not good to know too
much about your own destiny.

185
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,548
You're right, Marty.
I know too much already.

186
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,966
Better that I not
attempt to uncover

187
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,803
the circumstances
of my own future.

188
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,848
Copernicus.
Come on, boy!

189
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,684
I'll get him, Doc.
Copernicus!

190
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,730
Copernicus, come on.
Let's go home, boy.

191
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,649
What's wrong?

192
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,028
What's wrong,
Copernicus? Come on.

193
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,780
Come on, let's go home.
Come on. Come on.

194
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,579
Doc! Doc!
Come here!

195
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,914
Quick!

196
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,252
What's wrong, Marty? You
look like you've seen a ghost.

197
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,463
You're not
far off, Doc.

198
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,677
Great Scott!

199
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,887
Check this out.

200
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,140
"Died September 7th,
1885."

201
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,934
That's one week after
you wrote the letter!

202
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,646
"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara. "

203
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,523
Who the hell
is Clara?

204
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,399
Marty, please
don't stand there!

205
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,026
Oh! Right. Sorry.

206
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,070
I gotta get
another picture.

207
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,534
"Shot in the back by Buford
Tannen over a matter of $80"?

208
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,328
What kind of a future
do you call that?

209
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,873
"Buford Tannen
was a notorious gunman

210
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,709
"whose short temper
and a tendency to drool

211
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,711
"earned him
the nickname Mad Dog.

212
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,046
"He was quick
on the trigger

213
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,340
"and bragged that
he had killed 12 men

214
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,217
"not including
Indians or Chinamen. "

215
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,010
Does it mention me?
Am I one of the 12?

216
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,136
Just a minute.

217
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,013
"However this claim
cannot be substantiated,

218
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,807
"since precise records
were not kept

219
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,559
"after Tannen shot
a newspaper editor

220
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,478
"who printed an unfavorable
story about him in 1884."

221
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,563
That's why
we can't find anything.

222
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,647
Look.

223
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,110
William McFly and family.
Your relatives?

224
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,737
My great-grandfather's
name was William.

225
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,323
That's him.
Good-looking guy.

226
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,744
McFlys, but no Browns.

227
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,829
Well, maybe it was
a mistake, Doc.

228
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,997
Maybe that grave
wasn't yours.

229
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,374
There could've been another
Emmett Brown back in 1885.

230
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,458
No.
I don't know.

231
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,626
Did you have any
relatives here back then?

232
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,753
The Browns didn't come
to Hill Valley until 1908.

233
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,422
And then they
were the von Brauns.

234
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,049
My father changed our name
during the First World War.

235
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,259
Doc, look.

236
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,556
Great Scott, it's me!

237
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,559
Then it is true,
all of it.

238
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,062
It is me who goes back
there and gets shot.

239
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,565
It's not gonna
happen, Doc.

240
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,233
After you fix
the time circuits

241
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,818
and put new tires
on the DeLorean,

242
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,363
I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

243
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,793
The clothes fit?

244
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,380
Yeah, everything except the
boots, Doc. They're kind of tight.

245
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,799
I don't know. Are you sure
this stuff is authentic?

246
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,219
Of course. Haven't
you ever seen a Western?

247
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,181
Yeah, I have, Doc.

248
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,142
Clint Eastwood never wore
anything like this.

249
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,020
Clint who?

250
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,105
That's right. You
haven't heard of him yet.

251
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,024
Marty, you have
to wear the boots.

252
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,818
You can't wear those
futuristic things back in 1885.

253
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,737
You shouldn't even be
wearing them here in 1955.

254
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,030
All right, Doc. Look,
as soon as I get there,

255
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,323
I'll put them on.
I promise.

256
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,991
Okay. I think
we're about ready.

257
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,409
I put gas in the tank.

258
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,994
Your future clothes
are packed.

259
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,790
Just in case, fresh batteries
for your walkie-talkies.

260
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,751
Oh! What about that
floating device?

261
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,795
Hoverboard.
All right.

262
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,548
You know, Doc, it's gonna
be a hell of a long walk

263
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,342
back to Hill Valley
from here.

264
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,718
It's still
the safest plan.

265
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,513
After all, we can't risk sending
you back into a populated area

266
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,848
or to a spot that's
geographically unknown.

267
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,517
You don't want to
crash into some tree

268
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,310
that once existed
in the past.

269
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,854
This was all
completely open country,

270
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,565
so you'll have plenty of run
out space when you arrive.

271
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,777
Remember, where you're
going, there are no roads.

272
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,028
There's a small cave
over there

273
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,489
which will be a perfect place
to hide the time vehicle.

274
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:16,326
Well, the new time circuit
control tubes are warmed up.

275
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,081
Time circuits on.

276
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,332
I wrote the letter
on September 1st,

277
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,042
so we'll send you back
the very next day,

278
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,127
September 2nd.
That's a Wednesday.

279
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,879
September 2nd,
1885, 8:00 a. m.

280
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,214
I get shot
on Monday the 7th,

281
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,632
so you have five days
to locate me.

282
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,967
According to my letter,
I'm a blacksmith,

283
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,052
so I probably have
a shop somewhere.

284
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,722
All you have to do is
drive the time vehicle

285
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,140
directly toward
that screen,

286
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,350
accelerating to
88 miles an hour.

287
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,437
Wait a minute. Doc, if I drive
straight towards the screen,

288
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,063
I'm gonna crash
into those Indians.

289
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,483
Marty, you're not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

290
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,736
You'll instantly be
transported to 1885,

291
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,946
and those Indians
won't even be there.

292
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,032
Right.
Well.

293
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,412
Good luck for
both of our sakes.

294
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,747
See you in the future.

295
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,915
You mean the past.

296
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Exactly.

297
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,842
Happy trails, Marty!

298
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,849
Ready, Marty?

299
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,018
Ready!

300
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,895
Set!

301
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,188
Hi-ho, Silver.

302
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,268
Indians!

303
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,392
The cave!

304
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,845
Charge!

305
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,058
Shit! The cavalry!

306
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,528
Damn, I ripped
the fuel line.

307
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:09,452
Maggie! Fetch some water!
We got a hurt man here.

308
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,088
Mom! Mom, is that you?

309
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,339
There, there now.

310
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,759
You've been asleep for
nearly six hours now.

311
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,137
I had this
horrible nightmare.

312
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,183
I dreamed... I dreamed
I was in a Western.

313
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:40,233
I was being chased by all
these Indians and a bear.

314
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,776
Well, you're safe
and sound

315
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,611
here now
at the McFly farm.

316
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,197
McFly farm?

317
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,912
Well, you're my...
You're my, my...

318
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,790
Who are you?

319
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,501
The name is McFly.
Maggie McFly.

320
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,130
McFly. Maggie?

321
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,675
And that's Mrs. McFly, and
don't you be forgetting the Mrs.

322
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,052
And what might
your name be, sir?

323
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,970
Well, it's...

324
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,850
Eastwood.

325
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,812
Clint Eastwood.

326
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,065
Well, you hit your head,
Mr. Eastwood.

327
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,775
Not too serious,
but lucky for you,

328
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,902
Seamus found you
when he did.

329
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,737
Seamus.

330
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,280
Me husband.

331
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:33,161
You'll be excusing me, Mr.
Eastwood, while I tend to William.

332
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,245
William.

333
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,123
Oh, that's okay, Will.
It's okay.

334
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,216
That's William?
Aye.

335
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,886
William Sean McFly, the first of
our family to be born in America.

336
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,222
It's okay, Will.

337
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,892
This here is Mr. Clint
Eastwood here visiting.

338
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,019
He surely likes you,
Mr. Eastwood.

339
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,313
Maggie.

340
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,775
I've got supper.

341
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,486
I'm not one to pry into
a man's personal affairs,

342
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,990
but exactly how is it that
you came to be way out here

343
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:15,411
without a horse,
or boots, or a hat?

344
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,705
Well, my car...

345
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,917
Horse broke down,
and a bear ate my boots,

346
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,877
and I guess
I just forgot my hat.

347
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,755
How could you forget
a thing like your hat?

348
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,048
Would you like
some water?

349
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,299
Yeah.

350
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,479
I'll tell you what
I'll do, Mr. Eastwood.

351
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,898
I'll help you find
your blacksmith friend.

352
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,319
You can stay
the night in the barn,

353
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,573
and tomorrow I'll take you
as far as the railroad tracks.

354
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,950
You can follow them
straight on into town.

355
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,621
I'll even
give you a hat.

356
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,334
That's great. Thanks.

357
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,298
Ah...

358
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,424
That's my William.

359
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,096
Oh.

360
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,557
Yes.

361
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,102
I think you'll find
the barn comfortable.

362
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,105
Never had any complaints
about it from the pigs.

363
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,191
Mmm.
Seamus!

364
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,358
A word with you.

365
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,443
Aye.

366
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,532
Will you hold him
for a minute?

367
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,538
Are you sure you're not after
bringing a curse on this house

368
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,832
taking him in
like that?

369
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,334
He's such
a strange young man.

370
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,378
Aye. But I've just got a
feeling about him, Maggie,

371
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,173
that looking after him
is the right thing to do.

372
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,674
That it's important.

373
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,426
Hey, buddy.

374
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,637
Look how the baby
takes to him.

375
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,390
Little Will never
takes to strangers.

376
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,393
It's almost as if
he's connected to us.

377
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,478
Hey, Will.

378
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,773
So you're my
great-grandfather.

379
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,234
The first McFly
born in America.

380
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,783
And you peed on me.

381
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,918
Give us some soap.

382
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,169
Here you go.

383
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,946
Take a look and see what
just breezed in the door.

384
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,368
Why, I didn't know
the circus was in town.

385
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,996
Must have got that
shirt off a dead Chinese.

386
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,685
What will it be,
stranger?

387
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,899
I'll have ice water.

388
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,651
Ice water?

389
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,695
Water?

390
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,864
You want water, you
better go dunk your head

391
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,533
in the horse trough
out there.

392
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,703
In here,
we pour whiskey.

393
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,756
Excuse me.

394
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,049
For what?

395
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,552
I'm trying to
find the blacksmith.

396
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,054
Hey, McFly!

397
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,809
Thought I done told
you never to come in...

398
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,354
You ain't
Seamus McFly.

399
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,733
You look like him,
though,

400
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,401
especially with
that dog-ugly hat.

401
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,073
You kin to
that hay barber?

402
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,950
What's your name,
dude?

403
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,327
Marty...

404
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,746
Eastwood.

405
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,707
Clint Eastwood.

406
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,920
What kind of
stupid name is that?

407
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,088
I'd say he's the runt of the litter.

408
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,799
Hey, now, boys, would you take a
look-see at these pearly whites?

409
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,176
Hell, I ain't seen
teeth look that straight

410
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,302
that weren't
store-bought.

411
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,346
Take a gander at
them moccasins.

412
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,931
What kind of skins
is them?

413
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,098
What's that
writing mean?

414
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,517
"Nike"?
What is that?

415
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,227
Some sort of Injun
talk or something?

416
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,067
Bartender, I'm looking for that
no-good, cheating blacksmith.

417
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,485
You seen him?

418
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,362
No, sir, Mr. Tannen.
I have not.

419
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,198
Tannen.

420
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,450
You're "Mad Dog" Tannen.

421
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,625
"Mad Dog"?

422
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,043
I hate that name.

423
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,672
I hate it, you hear?

424
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,633
Nobody calls me
"Mad Dog"!

425
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,637
Especially not some duded-up,
egg-sucking gutter trash.

426
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,683
Dance!

427
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:34,892
Come on!

428
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:40,022
Come on, runt! You can
dance better than that!

429
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:51,325
Shit.

430
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,744
Whoo!

431
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,765
You better run,
squirrel.

432
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,225
Get him!

433
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,322
Whoa!

434
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,792
We got ourselves
a new courthouse.

435
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,418
High time
we had a hanging!

436
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,190
Look at him swing.

437
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,947
Yeah, haven't had a
hanging in a long time!

438
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,495
It'll shoot the fleas off a
dog's back at 500 yards, Tannen,

439
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,580
and it's pointed
straight at your head!

440
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,551
You owe me money,
blacksmith.

441
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,052
How do you figure?

442
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,762
My horse threw a shoe.

443
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,389
And seeing as you was the
one that done the shoeing,

444
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,849
I say that makes
you responsible.

445
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,894
Well, since you never paid me for
the job, I say that makes us even.

446
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,063
Wrong! See I was
on my horse

447
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,857
when it threw the shoe,
and I got throwed off!

448
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,067
And that caused me
to bust a perfectly

449
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,570
good bottle of
fine Kentucky red eye.

450
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,530
So the way
I figure it, blacksmith,

451
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,490
you owe me $5
for the whiskey

452
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,784
and $75 for the horse!

453
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:40,745
That's the $80.

454
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,289
Look, if your horse
threw a shoe,

455
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,249
bring him back,
and I'll reshoe him.

456
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,959
I done shot that horse!

457
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,253
Well, that's your problem,
Tannen.

458
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,381
Wrong. That's yours.

459
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:56,135
So from now on, you better be
looking behind you when you walk.

460
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,846
Because one day you're gonna
get a bullet in your back.

461
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:09,815
Doc!

462
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,029
Marty, I gave you explicit
instructions not to come here

463
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,281
but to go
directly back to 1985.

464
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,034
I know, Doc,
but I had to come.

465
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,287
But it's good to
see you, Marty.

466
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,502
Marty, you're gonna have to do
something about those clothes.

467
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,961
You walk around town
dressed like that,

468
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,588
you're liable
to get shot.

469
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,631
Or hanged.

470
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,842
What idiot dressed you
in that outfit?

471
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,219
You did.

472
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,307
"Shot in the back
by Buford Tannen

473
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,643
"over a matter of $80,

474
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,978
"September 7"?

475
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,064
That's this Monday!

476
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,650
Now I wish
I'd paid him off.

477
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,485
And who's this
beloved Clara?

478
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,862
I don't know
anyone named Clara.

479
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,740
I don't know, Doc.

480
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,992
I thought maybe she was
a girlfriend of yours.

481
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:07,331
Marty, my involvement in such a
social relationship here in 1885

482
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,335
could result in a disruption
of the space-time continuum.

483
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,464
As a scientist, I can
never take that risk.

484
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,635
Certainly not after what
we've already been through.

485
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,845
Emmett!

486
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,096
Hello, Emmett.

487
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,305
Hubert.

488
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,057
It's the mayor.

489
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,351
Excuse me, Emmett.

490
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,104
Do you remember last week at the
town meeting when you volunteered

491
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,522
to meet the new
schoolteacher

492
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,648
at the station
when she came in?

493
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,691
Oh, yes, quite so.

494
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,235
Well, we just got word
she's coming in tomorrow.

495
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,279
Here are the details
for you.

496
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,822
Thanks for
all your help.

497
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,824
Anytime, Hubert.

498
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,953
Oh! Her name's Miss
Clayton. Clara Clayton.

499
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,632
Well, Doc, now we know who Clara is.

500
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,595
Marty, it's impossible.

501
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,973
The idea that I could fall in love
at first sight is romantic nonsense.

502
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,393
There's no scientific
rationale for that concept.

503
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,478
Aw, come on, Doc.
It's not science.

504
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,064
You meet the right girl, it just
hits you. It's like lightning.

505
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,733
Marty, please
don't say that.

506
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,402
That's the way it was
for me and Jennifer.

507
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,447
I mean, we couldn't keep
our eyes off each other.

508
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,574
God, Jennifer, damn. I
hope she's all right, Doc.

509
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,993
I can't believe we just
left her there on the porch.

510
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,078
Don't worry, Marty.
She'll be fine.

511
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,247
When you burned
the almanac in 1955,

512
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,916
the normal timeline
was restored.

513
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,751
That means once
we're back in 1985,

514
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,836
you just have to go over
to her house to wake her up.

515
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,007
Oh, Marty, turn that valve over there

516
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,133
all the way
to the right.

517
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,093
Yeah, pull it
all the way around.

518
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,678
Okay. Let's go!

519
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,402
Iced tea?

520
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,862
No, thanks.

521
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,323
It's a refrigerator.

522
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,116
Well, I guess
Miss Clayton

523
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,118
will have to find
other transportation.

524
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,203
If I never
meet the woman,

525
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,455
there's no possibility of a
romantic infatuation, right?

526
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,415
You're the doc, Doc.
All right.

527
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,043
We'll get the DeLorean and get
ourselves back to the future.

528
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,461
Oh, listen, Doc,
I tore a hole

529
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,712
in the gas tank
when I was landing,

530
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,382
so we're gonna have to
patch it up and get some gas.

531
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,759
You mean we're
out of gas?

532
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,843
Yeah, it's no big deal.

533
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,553
We've got
Mr. Fusion, right?

534
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,474
Mr. Fusion powers the time
circuits and the Flux Capacitor,

535
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,477
but the internal combustion
engine runs on ordinary gasoline.

536
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,312
It always has.

537
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,356
There's not gonna be
a gas station around here

538
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,067
until sometime in
the next century.

539
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,819
Without gasoline,

540
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,072
we can't get the DeLorean
up to 88 miles per hour.

541
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,034
So what do we do?

542
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,088
Twenty-four!

543
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,715
It's no use, Marty!

544
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,009
Even the fastest
horse in the world

545
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,761
won't run more than 35,
40 miles an hour!

546
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,608
Bartender said that's the
strongest stuff they got.

547
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,235
Try it, Marty.

548
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,290
Give it more gas!

549
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,800
Damn!

550
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,388
It blew the fuel
injection manifold.

551
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,390
Strong stuff,
all right.

552
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:56,393
It will take me a month
to rebuild it.

553
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:57,853
A month?

554
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,980
Doc, you're gonna
get shot on Monday!

555
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,609
I know! I know!
I know! I wish...

556
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:08,405
Wait. I've got it! We can
simply roll it down a steep hill!

557
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,407
Oh! We'd never find
a smooth enough surface.

558
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,492
Unless...

559
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,535
Of course! Ice!

560
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,829
We'll wait until winter
when the lake freezes over.

561
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,664
Winter? Doc, what are you talking about?

562
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,208
Monday!
It's three days away!

563
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,250
All right, all right,
all right.

564
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,587
Just let's think this
thing through logically.

565
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,422
We know it won't run
under its own power.

566
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,382
We know
we can't pull it.

567
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,928
But if we could
figure out a way

568
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,181
to push it up to
88 miles an hour.

569
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,641
Huh?

570
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:44,900
That's it.

571
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,862
How fast can she go? Why,
I've had her up to 55 myself.

572
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,032
I heard that
Fearless Frank Fargo

573
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,450
got one of these
up to near 70

574
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,327
out past
Verde Junction.

575
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,080
Do you think it's possible
to get it up to 90?

576
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,414
Ninety?

577
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,292
Tarnation, son, who'd ever
need to be in such a hurry?

578
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,628
It's just a little bet
he and I have, that's all.

579
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,214
Theoretically speaking,
could it be done?

580
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,133
Well, I suppose,
if you had a straight

581
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,051
stretch of track
with a level grade,

582
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,595
and you weren't hauling
no cars behind you,

583
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,472
and if you could get
the fire hot enough.

584
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:19,518
And I'm talking about hotter than the
blazes of hell and damnation itself.

585
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,812
Then yes, sir, it might be
possible to get her up that fast.

586
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,981
Tell me, when does the next
train come through here?

587
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,482
Monday morning at 8:00.

588
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,152
Here. This spur that
runs off the main line

589
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,736
three miles out
to Clayton Ravine.

590
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,363
It's a long stretch
of level track

591
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,782
that will still
exist in 1985.

592
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:37,327
This is where we'll push the
DeLorean with the locomotive.

593
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,956
Funny. This map calls
Clayton Ravine Shonash Ravine.

594
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,168
That must be the old Indian
name for it. It's perfect.

595
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,044
A nice long run
that goes clear across

596
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,171
the bridge
over the ravine,

597
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,590
you know, over near that
Hilldale housing development.

598
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:54,261
Right, Doc, but according to
this map, there is no bridge.

599
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:58,182
Well, Doc,
we can scratch that idea.

600
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,600
I mean, we can't
wait a year and a half

601
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,726
for this thing
to get finished.

602
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,227
Marty, it's perfect.

603
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,438
You're just not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

604
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,231
Right. Right. I have a
real problem with that.

605
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:10,194
Don't you see? The
bridge will exist in 1985.

606
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,154
It's safe
and still in use.

607
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,032
Therefore, as long as we get the
DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour

608
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,825
before we hit
the edge of the ravine,

609
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,369
we'll instantaneously
arrive at a point in time

610
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,580
where the bridge
is completed.

611
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:27,211
We'll have track under us and
coast safely across the ravine.

612
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,462
What about
the locomotive?

613
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,547
It will be
a spectacular wreck.

614
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,507
Too bad no one will
be around to see it.

615
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,220
Help me! Help!

616
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,679
Great Scott!

617
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,265
Hurry!

618
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:24,685
Jump!

619
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:35,988
Whoa.

620
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:37,990
Whoa.

621
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,408
Oh...

622
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,202
Thank you, sir.
You saved my...

623
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,497
...life.

624
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,296
Emmett Brown at
your service, Miss...

625
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,092
Clayton.

626
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,886
Clara Clayton.

627
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,222
Clara!

628
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,769
What a beautiful name.

629
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,914
May I help you
inside with these?

630
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,709
Oh, no, that won't be
necessary. I can take care of it.

631
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,295
You've done more
than enough already.

632
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,130
But it's really
no trouble.

633
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,591
Doc, she says it's fine,
and we got to get going.

634
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,428
Ma'am, good luck with your
school teaching and everything.

635
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,514
Clara, I'll straighten
everything out

636
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,391
with Mr. Statler for
the buckboard rental.

637
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:47,809
Don't worry about that.

638
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,936
I feel somewhat responsible
for what happened.

639
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,021
Oh.

640
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,692
That would be very gentlemanly
of you, Mr. Brown. Emmett.

641
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,031
You know,
I'm almost glad

642
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,491
that snake
spooked those horses.

643
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,494
Otherwise,
we might never have met.

644
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,079
I suppose
it was destiny.

645
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,793
Well, thank you
for everything.

646
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,087
You're quite welcome.

647
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,050
I will see you again,
won't I?

648
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,385
Of course.
You'll see lots of me.

649
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,928
I'm sure.
I have a shop in town.

650
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,889
I'm the local scientist,
blacksmith.

651
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,309
Science?
What sort of science?

652
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,144
Astronomy?
Chemistry?

653
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,064
Actually, I'm a student
of all sciences.

654
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,192
Hey, Doc,
we got to get going.

655
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,237
Oh, yes.
Well, excuse us, Clara.

656
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,155
We have to get going.

657
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,828
Toodle-oo.

658
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,171
What do you mean, you're gonna
be seeing lots of her, Doc?

659
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,425
Well, I might see her
again just in passing.

660
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,593
Come on, Doc. Did you see the
way she was looking at you?

661
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,682
She did have
quite a scare, right?

662
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,225
After all, Miss Clayton
almost ended up

663
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,227
at the bottom of
Clayton Ravine.

664
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,270
Clayton Ravine.

665
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:18,483
Holy shit. Hey, Doc, Clayton
Ravine was named after a teacher.

666
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,527
They say she fell in
there 100 years ago.

667
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,447
100 years ago!
That's this year!

668
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:24,781
Every kid in school
knows that story,

669
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:25,824
'cause we all
have teachers

670
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,909
we'd like to see
fall into the ravine.

671
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,453
Great Scott!

672
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,040
Then she was supposed
to go over in that wagon.

673
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,086
Now I may have
seriously altered history.

674
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,257
Look, Doc, what's the
worst that can happen, huh?

675
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,718
So they don't name
the ravine after her.

676
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,927
Let's just get
the DeLorean ready

677
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,137
and get the hell
out of here.

678
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,682
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

679
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,769
It's caused
nothing but disaster.

680
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,649
Doc, Doc,
this is Marty.

681
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,817
Do you read me? Over.

682
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:01,943
Check, Marty.

683
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,404
Great, Doc.
These things still work.

684
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:05,906
All right, Marty.

685
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,451
Once more, let's go over
the entire plan and layout.

686
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,536
I apologize for the crudity
of this model, but I just...

687
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,623
Yeah, I know, Doc. It's not
to scale. It's okay, Doc.

688
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:18,168
All right.
Tomorrow night, Sunday,

689
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,129
we'll load the DeLorean onto
the tracks here, on the spur

690
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,507
right by the old
abandoned silver mine.

691
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,426
The switch track is where the
spur runs off the main line

692
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:30,013
three miles out to
Clayton... Shonash Ravine.

693
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,891
The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

694
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,519
We'll stop it here, uncouple
the cars from the tender,

695
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,812
throw the switch track,
and then we'll hijack...

696
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,858
Borrow the locomotive and use
it to push the time machine.

697
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,151
According to
my calculations,

698
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,611
we'll reach
88 miles per hour

699
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,696
just before we hit
the edge of the ravine,

700
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:50,450
at which point we'll be
instantaneously transported back to 1985

701
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,953
and coast safely across
the completed bridge.

702
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,789
What does this mean?
"Point of no return. "

703
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,832
That's our
fail-safe point.

704
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,292
Up until there, we have
still have enough time

705
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,962
to stop the locomotive before
it plunges into the ravine.

706
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,213
But once we
pass this windmill,

707
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,464
it's the future
or bust.

708
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:11,137
Here you go, Marty. Connect
that to the positive terminal.

709
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,181
All right,
Marty, you all set?

710
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,516
Yeah. Yeah. Go!

711
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,644
Train pulling
out of the station!

712
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,896
Coming up to
the switch track!

713
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,566
Stop at
the switch track!

714
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,901
Throw the switch!

715
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,404
Pull up
to the DeLorean!

716
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:31,658
Pushing the DeLorean
up to 88 miles per hour!

717
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,000
It couldn't be simpler.

718
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,508
Emmett?

719
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,176
It's Clara.

720
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,345
Quick,
cover the DeLorean!

721
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,645
Hello.

722
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,938
Why, hello.

723
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:04,149
This is
quite a surprise.

724
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,819
Well, I hope I'm not
disturbing anything.

725
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,448
Oh, no, no, we were just doing
a little model railroading.

726
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,074
Oh.

727
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:17,621
Emmett, when my bags were
thrown from the wagon,

728
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,581
my telescope
was damaged.

729
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:23,209
And since you mentioned
an interest in science,

730
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:26,630
I thought you might be
able to repair it for me.

731
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,673
I would pay you,
of course.

732
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:33,053
Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't
think of charging you for this.

733
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,305
Well, let's have
a look at it.

734
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,641
I think a lens may
be out of alignment,

735
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:41,269
because if you
move it this way,

736
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:44,397
the image turns fuzzy.
See?

737
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:49,569
But if you turn it
the other way then...

738
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,322
Everything becomes...

739
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,576
...clear.

740
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,501
I could repair it right away
and have it for you tonight.

741
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,337
Oh, tonight is
the town festival.

742
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,006
I wouldn't dream of having
you work on my telescope

743
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,841
during such
an important occasion.

744
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:15,095
You are planning on
attending, aren't you?

745
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,014
Well, actually,
ma'am, I don't think...

746
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,684
Yes, of course,
the festival.

747
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,686
Well, in that case,

748
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,314
I'll see you this evening
at the festival, Emmett.

749
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,358
Mr. Eastwood.
Ma'am.

750
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,863
Thank you for taking
care of my telescope.

751
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,824
You're quite welcome.

752
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,206
It's a nice telescope.

753
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,959
Ladies and gentlemen,

754
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:50,422
as mayor of Hill Valley,
it gives me great pleasure

755
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,633
to dedicate this clock to
the people of Hill County!

756
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:58,555
May it stand
for all time!

757
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,931
Tell me when, gentlemen.

758
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:04,978
Three! Two! One!

759
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,147
Now!

760
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,071
Let the festivities
begin!

761
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:23,830
You know, Marty,
in a way, it's fitting

762
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,207
that you and I are
here to witness this.

763
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,960
It's too bad I didn't
bring my camera.

764
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:36,801
Ready, gentlemen?

765
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,598
The only problem is we'll never
be able to show it to anybody.

766
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:42,849
Smile, Doc.

767
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,519
Yee-ha!

768
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,959
What great music!

769
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,754
Yeah, it's got a beat,
and you can dance to it.

770
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,838
Step right up
gentlemen

771
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:15,840
and test your mettle
with the latest products

772
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:19,969
from Colonel Samuel Colt's Patent
Firearms Manufacturing Company

773
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,679
of Hartford,
Connecticut.

774
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,682
Now, take this model,
for example.

775
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:28,436
The new, improved and
refined Colt Peacemaker

776
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:33,733
selling to you tonight for
the low, low price of $12.

777
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,835
Good evening.
Evening.

778
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,505
You look very nice.

779
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,048
Thank you.

780
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,559
Would you like...

781
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,645
Would you care to...

782
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,938
I'd love to.

783
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,250
Young man, how about you?
You want to give it a try?

784
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,545
No, no. No, thanks.
Hey, Doc, this...

785
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,637
Son!

786
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,472
Sonny boy!

787
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,016
The Doc can dance?

788
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,522
Son. Son. Son!

789
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:59,027
Hey, I just told you that even
a baby could handle this weapon.

790
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:02,196
Surely you're not afraid to try
something that a baby could do.

791
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,531
Hey, I'm not afraid
of nothing.

792
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,576
Come on, then. Let's just
step up here like a man.

793
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,080
Now, then what you do is you
just ease that hammer back there

794
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,916
and squeeze off
a round.

795
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,584
No, no, no!

796
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,420
Right on out there
and be real smooth.

797
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,589
That's the way
you do it.

798
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,719
Listen,
can I try that again?

799
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,220
Yeah, go ahead.

800
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:40,151
Hey, just tell me
one thing.

801
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,779
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

802
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,197
7- Eleven.

803
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,411
Buford, you sure
that blacksmith

804
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,288
is gonna be at
this here shindig?

805
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:55,208
Sure he's here.
Everybody's here tonight.

806
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,629
You gentlemen will have
to check your firearms

807
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,965
if you want to join in
on the festivities.

808
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,801
Who's gonna make us,
tenderfoot? You?

809
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,386
I am.

810
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,183
Marshal Strickland. I didn't
know you was back in town.

811
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,893
If you can't
read the sign, Tannen,

812
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,229
I presume
you can read this.

813
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,981
Pretty tough hombre
when you're pointing

814
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,399
a scatter gun
at a man's back.

815
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,610
Just like you, Tannen, I take
every advantage I can get.

816
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:25,363
Now you gonna
check your iron?

817
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,491
I was just joking
with your deputy.

818
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,284
Of course,
I'm gonna check my iron.

819
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,744
We all were.
Weren't we, boys?

820
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,162
Yeah, right.

821
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,290
Tannen.

822
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,252
Your knife, too.

823
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:49,303
Smile, Marshal. After
all, this is a party.

824
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,848
Only party
I'll be smiling at

825
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,600
is the one that sees you
at the end of a rope.

826
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:58,980
Have fun!

827
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:03,985
See, that's how
you handle them, Son.

828
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,111
Never give them
an inch

829
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,530
and maintain discipline
at all times.

830
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,533
Remember that word,
discipline.

831
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,118
I will, Pa.

832
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,371
Swing that partner
With a right big swing

833
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,665
Over to the side
It's the same old thing

834
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,083
Thank you very much.

835
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:23,546
Why, Mr. Eastwood,
nice to see you.

836
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:28,051
I see you got yourself some respectable
clothes, lad, and a fine hat.

837
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,177
Yeah, well,
a couple people

838
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:31,471
didn't like the way the
other one looked on me.

839
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,222
Sure, and that one
suits you, Mr. Eastwood.

840
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,141
It's very becoming.
Oh, thanks.

841
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,270
Hey, "Frisbie. "
Far out.

842
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,357
What was the meaning
of that?

843
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,068
It was right in front of him. Aye.

844
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,320
Swing that partner
halfway round

845
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,697
Sashay back to
the head of the set

846
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:52,742
All the way up to
the head of the set

847
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,578
Now, bow to the partner
You're through

848
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,417
Hey, that's mine!
Not anymore.

849
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:02,794
Give me that.

850
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,337
There he is, Buford.

851
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,173
Where?
There.

852
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,759
Dancing with that
piece of calico.

853
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,011
What are you
gonna do, boss?

854
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,432
I figure if I bury
this muzzle

855
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:19,227
deep enough in his back,
nobody will hear the shot.

856
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,687
Careful, Buford. You ain't
got but one bullet with that.

857
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,564
I only need one.

858
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,203
I told you to watch
your back, smithy.

859
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,497
Tannen, you're early.

860
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,958
It's a Derringer, smithy.
Small but effective.

861
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,752
The last time I used it, fellow
took two whole days to die.

862
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:45,837
Bled to death inside.

863
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,630
It was real,
real painful.

864
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,342
That means you'll be dead
by about supper time Monday.

865
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,804
Excuse me. I don't know who you
think you are, but we're dancing.

866
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,014
Well, look at what
we have here.

867
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:58,641
Ain't you gonna
introduce me to the lady?

868
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,767
I'd like a dance.

869
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,102
I wouldn't give
you the pleasure.

870
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,604
You'll just have to
go ahead and shoot.

871
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:04,689
All right.

872
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:05,940
No, no. Emmett,
I'll dance with him.

873
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,817
Boys, keep the
blacksmith company

874
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,819
while I get acquainted
with the filly!

875
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,453
I don't dance very well when my
partner has a gun in his hand.

876
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,039
You'll learn.
You'll learn.

877
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:25,376
You know, smithy, maybe I'll
just take my $80 worth out of her!

878
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,669
Tannen,
leave her alone!

879
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,797
Whoo!

880
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,885
Yeah, I bet there's something
you can do that's worth $80.

881
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,680
I believe you've
underestimated me, mister.

882
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,223
Have I?

883
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,353
Ow!

884
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,692
Stop it!
Damn you, Tannen!

885
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,195
No, I damn you!

886
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:56,365
I damn you to hell!

887
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:04,165
You.

888
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,833
Hey, lighten up, jerk!

889
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,923
Mighty strong words,
runt!

890
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,466
You man enough
to back them up

891
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,052
with more than
just a pie plate?

892
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,557
Look, just leave
my friends alone.

893
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:24,101
What's wrong, dude?
You yellow?

894
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:34,528
That's what I thought.
A yellow belly.

895
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:43,537
Nobody calls me yellow.

896
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:47,458
Then let's
finish it right now.

897
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,294
Not now, Buford.
Marshal's got our guns.

898
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:52,505
Like I said,
we'll finish this tomorrow!

899
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,883
Tomorrow we're robbing
the Pine City stage.

900
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:58,427
What about Monday?
We doing anything Monday?

901
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,471
No, Monday would be fine.
You can kill him on Monday.

902
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,807
I'll be back
this way on Monday.

903
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,475
We'll settle this then.

904
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,270
Right there
out in the street

905
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,688
in front of
the Palace Saloon.

906
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,400
Yeah, right. When?

907
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,360
High noon?
Noon?

908
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:18,656
I do my killing
before breakfast. 7:00!

909
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,913
8:00. I do my killing
after breakfast.

910
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,373
Marty!

911
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,129
All right, now.
Break it up.

912
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,255
What's all this about?

913
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,049
You causing
trouble here, Tannen?

914
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,843
No trouble, Marshal.

915
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:42,221
Just a little personal matter
between me and Eastwood.

916
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,223
This don't
concern the law.

917
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:47,184
Tonight, everything concerns
the law. Now break it up.

918
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:50,688
Any brawling, it's 15
days in the county jail.

919
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,982
All right, folks.
Come on, this is a party.

920
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,026
Come on!
Let's have some fun!

921
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,491
8:00 Monday, runt.

922
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,993
If you ain't here,

923
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:07,955
I'll hunt you and shoot
you down like a duck.

924
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,208
It's "dog," Buford.
Shoot him down like a dog.

925
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:15,921
Let's go, boys! Let these
sissies have their party!

926
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,174
Marty,
what are you doing,

927
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,633
saying you're
gonna meet Tannen?

928
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,719
Hey, Doc, Doc,
don't worry about it.

929
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,845
Monday morning 8:00 a. m.

930
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,263
We're gonna
be gone, right?

931
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,308
Theoretically, yes, but
what if the train's late?

932
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,809
Late? We'll discuss this later.

933
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,061
No, we'll discuss it now.
Late? What do you mean?

934
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,354
Thank you for your
gallantry, Mr. Eastwood.

935
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,688
Hey, ma'am.

936
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:35,149
Had you not interceded,
Emmett might have been shot.

937
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,985
Marty... Clint, I'm
gonna take Clara home.

938
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,403
Right. Good night,
Doc. Good night, Clara.

939
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,197
You sure set him straight,
Mr. Eastwood.

940
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,365
I'm glad somebody
finally got the gumption

941
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,116
to stand up to
that son of a bitch.

942
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,659
You're all right in
my book, Mr. Eastwood.

943
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:46,952
I'd like to
buy you a drink.

944
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,037
Hey, listen,
I don't want a drink.

945
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,830
You don't have to buy me
anything. Young man. Young man.

946
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,874
It was no big deal. I'd like
for you to have this brand-new

947
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,002
Colt Peacemaker and
gun belt free of charge.

948
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,380
Free?

949
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,881
I want everybody
to know

950
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:02,760
that the gun that shot Buford
Tannen was a Colt Peacemaker!

951
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,638
Hey, no problem.
Thanks a lot.

952
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,139
Of course
you understand

953
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,600
that if you lose,
I'm taking it back.

954
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,313
Thanks again.

955
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:19,235
You had him,
Mr. Eastwood.

956
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,403
You could have
just walked away,

957
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,738
and nobody would have thought
the less of you for it.

958
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:27,034
All it would have been was
words, hot air from a buffoon.

959
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,786
Instead,
you let him rile you.

960
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,915
Rile you into playing his
game, his way, by his rules.

961
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,376
Seamus, relax.
I know what I'm doing.

962
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,460
He reminds me
of poor Martin.

963
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:37,545
Aye.

964
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:38,796
Who?
Me brother.

965
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,922
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

966
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,049
You have a brother
named Martin McFly?

967
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:44,552
Had a brother.

968
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,304
Martin used to let men
provoke him into fighting.

969
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:50,266
He was concerned that people would
think him a coward if he refused.

970
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,726
That's how he got a Bowie
knife shoved through his belly

971
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:55,688
in a saloon
in Virginia City.

972
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,606
Never considered
the future, poor Martin.

973
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,608
God rest his soul.

974
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,947
Sure, and I hope you're considering
the future, Mr. Eastwood.

975
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,703
I think about it
all the time.

976
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,289
And that crater
in the middle north west,

977
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,291
the one that's out there all
by itself like a starburst...

978
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,417
Uh-huh.

979
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,752
...that one's
called Copernicus.

980
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,214
Listen to me. I feel
like I'm teaching school.

981
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,885
Please,
continue the lesson.

982
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,971
I never found lunar
geography so fascinating.

983
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,140
You're quite
knowledgeable.

984
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,975
When I was 11,
I had diphtheria.

985
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,060
I was quarantined
for three months.

986
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,229
So my father
brought this telescope,

987
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,689
and he put it
next to my bed

988
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,317
so I could see
everything out the window.

989
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:45,821
Emmett, do you think we'll ever
be able to travel to the moon

990
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:48,991
the way we travel across
the country on trains?

991
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,495
Definitely. Although not for
84 years and not on trains.

992
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:56,415
We'll have space vehicles,
capsules sent aloft with rockets.

993
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,334
Devices that
create giant explosions.

994
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,836
Explosions so powerful
that they just...

995
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,005
That they break the pull
of the Earth's gravity

996
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,342
and send the projectile
through outer space.

997
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,137
Emmett,
I read that book, too!

998
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,223
You're quoting
Jules Verne

999
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,766
From the Earth
to the Moon.

1000
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,101
You've read Jules Verne?

1001
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,812
I adore Jules Verne.

1002
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,523
So do I.

1003
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,484
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
the Sea. My absolute favorite.

1004
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,486
The first time I read that
when I was a little boy,

1005
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,155
why, I wanted to
meet Captain Nemo.

1006
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,406
Don't tease, Emmett.

1007
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:31,367
You couldn't have read
that when you were a boy.

1008
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,869
It was only first
published 10 years ago.

1009
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,998
Oh, yes. Well, I meant it
made me feel like a boy.

1010
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:44,922
I never met a woman who
liked Jules Verne before.

1011
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:50,386
I never ever met a man
like you before.

1012
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:49,778
Doc?

1013
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,159
Hope you know
what you're doing.

1014
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,215
You talking to me?

1015
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,220
You talking to me,
Tannen?

1016
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:21,644
Well, I'm the
only one here.

1017
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:25,397
Go ahead,
make my day.

1018
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,405
Say good morning,
Mr. Eastwood.

1019
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,782
Morning.

1020
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,492
Have a cigar,
Mr. Eastwood.

1021
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,078
Anything I can do for
you today, Mr. Eastwood?

1022
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,704
No, that's fine.

1023
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,331
Good luck tomorrow,
Mr. Eastwood.

1024
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,999
We'll be praying
for you.

1025
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:45,125
Thanks.

1026
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,504
Good morning,
Mr. Eastwood.

1027
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,589
Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?

1028
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,635
I'm fine. Thanks.

1029
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,856
Doc, what are
you doing?

1030
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,316
Oh, nothing.

1031
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,985
I was just out
enjoying the morning air.

1032
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,405
It's really lovely here in
the morning. Don't you think?

1033
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,531
Yeah, it's lovely, Doc.

1034
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:16,865
So listen, we've got
to load the DeLorean up

1035
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,534
and get ready
to roll, all right?

1036
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:21,120
Hey, look at that,
the tombstone.

1037
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,708
Marty, let me see
that photograph again.

1038
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,295
My name,
it's vanished.

1039
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,756
Hey, that's great, Doc.
Don't you get it?

1040
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:33,924
We're going back to
the future tomorrow,

1041
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,342
so everything's
being erased.

1042
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,219
But only my name
is erased.

1043
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,054
The tombstone itself
and the date still remain.

1044
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:41,056
That doesn't
make sense.

1045
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,726
We know that this photograph
represents what will happen

1046
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,227
if the events
of today continue

1047
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,146
to run their course
into tomorrow.

1048
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,230
Right. So?

1049
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,565
Excuse me,
Mr. Eastwood.

1050
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,066
I just need to take
your measurements.

1051
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:53,193
Oh, look, pal, I don't
want to buy a suit.

1052
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,488
No, this is
for your coffin.

1053
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:57,614
My coffin?

1054
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:00,159
Well, the odds are running
two to one against you.

1055
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,578
Might as well
be prepared.

1056
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,123
So it may not be my name that's
supposed to end up on this tombstone.

1057
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,958
It may be yours.

1058
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,252
Great Scott.

1059
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,295
I know.
This is heavy.

1060
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,338
Marty, why are you
wearing that gun?

1061
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,507
You're not considering going
up against Tannen tomorrow?

1062
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,427
Doc, tomorrow morning I'm going
back to the future with you.

1063
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,262
But if Buford Tannen
comes looking for trouble,

1064
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,930
I'm gonna be
ready for him.

1065
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,391
You heard what that son of
a bitch called me last night.

1066
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:25,726
Marty, you can't go
losing your judgment

1067
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,269
every time someone
calls you a name.

1068
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,353
That's exactly
what causes you

1069
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,690
to get into that accident
in the future.

1070
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:36,779
What?
What about my future?

1071
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,990
I can't tell you. It
might make things worse.

1072
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:43,869
Wait a minute. Doc, what
is wrong with my future?

1073
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,997
Marty, we all have to make decisions

1074
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,458
that affect
the course of our lives.

1075
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,461
You've got to do
what you've got to do,

1076
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,379
and I've got to do
what I've got to do.

1077
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,935
Marty.
Yeah.

1078
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,812
I've made a decision.
Uh-huh.

1079
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:10,938
I'm not going
with you tomorrow.

1080
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,816
I'm staying here.

1081
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:20,030
What are you
talking about, Doc?

1082
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,990
There's no point
in denying it.

1083
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,158
I'm in love with Clara.

1084
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:24,618
Oh, man.

1085
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:28,789
Doc, we don't belong
here. Neither one of us.

1086
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,750
You know, it could still be
you that gets shot tomorrow.

1087
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,378
This tombstone could
still be in your future.

1088
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:37,798
Marty, the future
isn't written.

1089
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,300
It can be changed.
You know that.

1090
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,389
Anyone can make their future
whatever they want it to be.

1091
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,182
I can't let this
one little photograph

1092
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:49,852
determine
my entire destiny.

1093
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,186
I have to
live my life

1094
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:55,107
according to what I believe
is right in my heart.

1095
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,320
Doc, you're a scientist.

1096
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:06,785
So you tell me. What's the
right thing to do up here?

1097
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,009
You're right, Marty.

1098
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,074
Wow, that worked great.

1099
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,077
I've at least got
to tell her goodbye.

1100
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,956
Come on, Doc.
Think about it.

1101
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,416
What are you
gonna say to her?

1102
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,918
"I've got to go
back to the future?"

1103
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,253
I mean, she's not gonna
understand that, Doc.

1104
01:10:58,338 --> 01:10:59,379
Hell, I'm in it
with you,

1105
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:02,007
and I don't
even understand it.

1106
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,554
Doc, listen.

1107
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,432
Maybe we...

1108
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,894
I don't know, maybe we can
just take Clara with us.

1109
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,521
To the future?

1110
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,445
As you reminded me,
Marty, I'm a scientist,

1111
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,198
so I must be
scientific about this.

1112
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,116
I cautioned you about
disrupting the continuum

1113
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,534
for your own
personal benefit.

1114
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,870
Therefore,
I must do no less.

1115
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,080
We shall proceed
as planned,

1116
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:35,123
and as soon as
we return to 1985,

1117
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,710
we'll destroy this
infernal machine.

1118
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,255
Traveling through time has
become much too painful.

1119
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:14,496
It's Emmett, Clara.

1120
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,336
Emmett,
won't you come in?

1121
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,548
No, I better not. I...

1122
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,093
What's wrong?

1123
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,138
I've come
to say goodbye.

1124
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:35,434
Goodbye? Well,
where are you going?

1125
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,020
I'm going away.

1126
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,772
And well, I'm afraid
I'll never see you again.

1127
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:43,608
Emmett!

1128
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:48,905
Clara, I want you to know
that I care about you deeply.

1129
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,616
But I've realized that
I don't belong here,

1130
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:55,370
and I have to go back
where I came from.

1131
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:57,998
And where
might that be?

1132
01:12:58,082 --> 01:12:59,791
I can't tell you.

1133
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:05,881
Well, wherever you're
going, take me with you.

1134
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,468
I can't, Clara.

1135
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:10,886
I wish it didn't
have to be this way,

1136
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,512
but just believe me
when I tell you

1137
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:17,017
that I'll never forget you
and that I love you.

1138
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:21,438
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

1139
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:25,442
Clara, I don't think there's any
way that you can understand it.

1140
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,528
Please, Emmett.
Please, I have to know.

1141
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,238
If you sincerely
do love me,

1142
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,656
then tell me
the truth.

1143
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,410
All right then.

1144
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:37,662
I'm from the future.

1145
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:42,709
I came here in a time
machine that I invented,

1146
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:46,838
and tomorrow I have to
go back to the year 1985.

1147
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:54,513
Yes, Emmett.

1148
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,599
I do understand.

1149
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,521
I understand that
because you know

1150
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,898
I'm partial to the
writings of Jules Verne,

1151
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,399
you concocted
those mendacities

1152
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,527
in order to take
advantage of me.

1153
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:11,947
Oh! I've heard some
whoppers in my day,

1154
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,156
but the fact
that you'd expect me

1155
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,533
to entertain
a notion like that

1156
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,369
is so insulting
and degrading!

1157
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,956
All you had to say is,
"I don't love you,

1158
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,125
"and I don't want
to see you anymore. "

1159
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,669
That, at least, would
have been respectful!

1160
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,754
But that's
not the truth.

1161
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,296
Good to
see you, too.

1162
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:14,134
Emmett. What can I get you? The usual?

1163
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,802
No, Chester, I'm gonna need something

1164
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:18,013
a lot stronger
than that tonight.

1165
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,514
Sarsaparilla.

1166
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:20,974
Whiskey, Chester.

1167
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,269
Whiskey?
Emmett, are you sure?

1168
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,688
You know what happened to
you on the Fourth of July.

1169
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:27,981
Whiskey.

1170
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,569
Okay, I ain't your papa.

1171
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,906
Just don't want to see
you do the wrong thing.

1172
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,284
You can leave
the bottle.

1173
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,954
It's a woman, right?

1174
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,875
I knew it. I have seen
that look on a man's face

1175
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,836
a thousand times
all across the country.

1176
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:52,255
All I can tell you, friend,
is you'll get over her.

1177
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,800
Oh... Clara was
one in a million.

1178
01:15:56,844 --> 01:16:01,097
One in a billion.
One in a googolplex.

1179
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:04,809
The woman of my dreams, and
I've lost her for all time.

1180
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:09,564
I can assure you, sir,
there are other women.

1181
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:12,275
Why, peddling this barbed
wire all across the country

1182
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,694
has taught me
one thing for certain,

1183
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:17,739
is that you never know
what the future might bring.

1184
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:21,701
The future. Oh, I can
tell you about the future.

1185
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,130
Oh, man, did I sleep.

1186
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,010
What time is it, Doc?

1187
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,182
Doc?

1188
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:56,778
Wake up!

1189
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:00,448
Get up! Let's go!

1190
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:03,702
I got me
a runt to kill.

1191
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:06,746
It's still early, boss.
What's your hurry?

1192
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,082
I'm hungry.

1193
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,919
And in the future,
we don't need horses.

1194
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,049
We have motorized carriages
called automobiles.

1195
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:22,595
If everybody's got one
of these auto whatsits,

1196
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,098
does anybody walk
or run anymore?

1197
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:29,686
Of course we run, but
for recreation, for fun.

1198
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:33,440
Run for fun? What the
hell kind of fun is that?

1199
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,910
Doc! Doc!

1200
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,544
How much
has he had?

1201
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,338
None.
That's the first one,

1202
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:57,922
and he hasn't
touched it yet.

1203
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:00,342
He just likes
to hold it.

1204
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:06,848
Doc! Doc!
What are you doing?

1205
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:11,144
I've lost her, Marty. There's
nothing left for me here.

1206
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,146
All right, that's why you
gotta come back with me.

1207
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,189
Where?

1208
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,482
Back to the future!

1209
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:21,696
Right!
Let's get going!

1210
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:22,864
Great.

1211
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:26,117
Gentlemen, excuse me, but my
friend and I have to catch a train.

1212
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,911
Here's to you,
blacksmith.

1213
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,287
And to the future.

1214
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,413
Amen.

1215
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,457
Amen.
Emmett, no!

1216
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,593
Doc! Doc! Doc!

1217
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:47,555
Come on, Doc.
Wake up. Wake up, Doc!

1218
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:49,557
How many did he have?

1219
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,767
Just the one.

1220
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:52,977
Just the one?
Come on, Doc.

1221
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,313
There's a fellow that
can't hold his liquor.

1222
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,065
Get me some coffee.
Black!

1223
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:58,274
Joey, coffee!

1224
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,412
Ma'am?

1225
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,414
How far does
the 8:00 train go?

1226
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,833
San Francisco is
the end of the line.

1227
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,670
I'll take
a one-way ticket.

1228
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,048
You want to sober him
up in a hurry, son,

1229
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:24,092
you're gonna have to use something
a lot stronger than coffee.

1230
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:26,803
Yeah,
what do you suggest?

1231
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:30,265
Joey, let's make
some wake-up juice.

1232
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,851
Come on, Doc, swallow.
Here we go.

1233
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,941
In about 10 minutes,

1234
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:43,027
he's gonna be as sober
as a priest on Sunday.

1235
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:45,238
Ten minutes!

1236
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:47,782
Why do we have to cut
these things so damn close?

1237
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:50,577
Here, stick this
clothespin on his nose.

1238
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:54,539
When he opens up
his mouth,

1239
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,084
go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.

1240
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,878
Oh, and stand back.

1241
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:19,355
He's still out!

1242
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,649
Oh, that? That was
just a reflex action.

1243
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,151
It's gonna take
a few more minutes

1244
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,069
for the stuff to really
clear up his head.

1245
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,362
Perfect.

1246
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,761
Come on, Doc.
Come on, wake up, buddy.

1247
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,722
Wake up, Doc!
Come on. Come on.

1248
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:55,391
Seamus, wouldn't expect to
see you here this morning.

1249
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:59,437
Aye. Something inside me
told me I should be here

1250
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:03,608
as if my future had
something to do with it.

1251
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,737
He'll come around
in a minute. Come on.

1252
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,781
Come on, Doc.
Let's go, Doc!

1253
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,783
Let's wake up now, buddy.
Come on.

1254
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:21,125
Are you in there,
Eastwood?

1255
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:26,130
It's 8:00,
and I'm calling you out.

1256
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:32,762
It's not 8:00 yet!

1257
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,139
It is by my watch!

1258
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:38,142
Let's settle this
once and for all, runt!

1259
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,105
Or ain't you
got the gumption?

1260
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:52,824
Listen.

1261
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,162
I'm not really feeling up to this today.

1262
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,374
So I'm gonna
have to forfeit.

1263
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,335
Forfeit?

1264
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,713
What's that mean?

1265
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,091
It means that you win
without a fight.

1266
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:11,968
Without shooting?
He can't do that.

1267
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:14,178
Hey, you can't do that!

1268
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,763
You know what I think?

1269
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:19,183
I think you ain't nothing
but a gutless, yellow turd!

1270
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,728
And I'm giving you
to the count of 10

1271
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:23,938
to come out here
and prove I'm wrong!

1272
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,149
One!

1273
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:28,818
Doc, come on, sober up,
buddy. Let's go. Come on.

1274
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:29,944
Two!

1275
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,279
You better get
out there, son.

1276
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,490
I got $20 gold bet on
you, so don't let me down.

1277
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:35,783
Three!

1278
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:40,079
I got $30 gold bet against
you, so don't let me down.

1279
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,164
Four!

1280
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,207
You better face
up to it, son,

1281
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,710
because if you
don't go out there...

1282
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,253
What?
Five!

1283
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:50,340
What if I don't
go out there?

1284
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:51,674
You're a coward.

1285
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:52,842
Six!

1286
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:56,095
And you'll be branded a coward
for the rest of your days!

1287
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:00,308
Everybody everywhere
will say Clint Eastwood

1288
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:03,102
is the biggest yellow belly in the West!

1289
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,275
Seven!

1290
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,444
Here!

1291
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,741
Eight!

1292
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:26,793
I already got a gun.

1293
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,129
Nine!

1294
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:36,010
Ten!

1295
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,809
Do you hear me, runt?

1296
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:47,105
I said that's 10, you
gutless, yellow pie-slinger!

1297
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:53,027
He's an asshole!

1298
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:55,071
I don't care
what Tannen says!

1299
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:58,116
And I don't care what
anybody else says either.

1300
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,576
Doc! Doc, you okay?

1301
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:01,703
I think so.

1302
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:04,414
What a headache!

1303
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:06,249
Listen, you got a back
door to this place?

1304
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,375
Yeah, it's in the back.

1305
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,501
Let's go, Doc.

1306
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:12,130
Are you coming out here, or
do I have to come in after you?

1307
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,967
The thing I really
miss here is Tylenol.

1308
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:17,969
Hey!

1309
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:25,518
Reach, blacksmith!

1310
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,204
Yes, sir, that poor fellow last night

1311
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:49,250
had the worst case of broken
heart I have ever seen.

1312
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,585
When he said
he didn't know

1313
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,378
how he could live
the rest of his life

1314
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:55,256
knowing how much hurt he'd
caused that little girl.

1315
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,385
Well, I really felt for
him. I did. Right here.

1316
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:05,933
Listen up, Eastwood!

1317
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,560
I aim to shoot
somebody today,

1318
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,437
and I prefer
it'd be you.

1319
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,064
But if you're
just too damn yellow,

1320
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,609
I guess it'll just have to
be your blacksmith friend.

1321
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:17,111
Forget about me, Marty,
and save yourself!

1322
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,285
You got one minute
to decide.

1323
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,704
You hear me, runt?
One minute!

1324
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,919
I've never seen a man so
broken up over a woman.

1325
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:35,630
What did he say her
name was? Cara? Sara?

1326
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:37,256
Clara.
Clara.

1327
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,303
Excuse me.
Ma'am?

1328
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:46,808
But was this man tall with
great big, brown puppy-dog eyes

1329
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,393
and long silvery,
flowing hair?

1330
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:50,686
You know him.

1331
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:54,649
Emmett!

1332
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,374
Time's up, runt!

1333
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,299
Prepare to meet
your maker, blacksmith.

1334
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:22,176
Right here, Tannen!

1335
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,007
Draw!

1336
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:05,469
No!

1337
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,613
I thought we could
settle this like men.

1338
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,158
You thought wrong, dude.

1339
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:50,806
Thank you.

1340
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:56,122
That was good.

1341
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,876
You know what I think? No.

1342
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,169
I think Buford's
going to jail.

1343
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:03,379
Yeah.

1344
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:11,137
Get him out
of that shit.

1345
01:29:11,221 --> 01:29:12,763
Get them!

1346
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,353
Buford Tannen,
you're under arrest

1347
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:21,397
for robbing
the Pine City stage.

1348
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,607
You got anything to say?

1349
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,573
I hate manure.

1350
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:31,699
Look!

1351
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,704
Yes!

1352
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:39,165
The train!

1353
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:40,458
Can we make it?

1354
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,460
We'll have to cut them
off at Coyote Pass.

1355
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,757
Hey! Hey, mister.
Mr. Eastwood.

1356
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,050
Here's your gun, mister.

1357
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,301
Thanks, kid.

1358
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,349
Seamus!

1359
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:00,436
It's worth $12.
Never been used.

1360
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:03,939
Maybe I'll trade it
for a new hat.

1361
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:06,358
Right, and take care of that baby!

1362
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:08,819
I will!

1363
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:23,125
Emmett!

1364
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:29,673
"Time machine. "

1365
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:14,135
Come on, Marty!

1366
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:18,889
Go, Doc.

1367
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:20,724
Come on.
Give me your hand!

1368
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,636
Come on, Marty.

1369
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:03,601
Come on. Let's go!

1370
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,611
Masks on.

1371
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,002
Reach!

1372
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:31,253
Is this a holdup?

1373
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,674
It's a science experiment.

1374
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:38,594
Stop the train just before you
hit the switch track up ahead.

1375
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:55,444
Doc!

1376
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:57,529
Uncouple the cars
from the tender!

1377
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:26,892
I've wanted to
do that all my life.

1378
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:01,593
What are these things,
anyway?

1379
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:03,512
My own version
of Pres-to-Logs.

1380
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,972
Compressed wood
with anthracite dust

1381
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,308
chemically treated to
burn hotter and longer.

1382
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,810
I use them in my forge
so I don't have to stoke it.

1383
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,895
These three in the furnace
will ignite sequentially,

1384
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,397
make the fire
burn hotter,

1385
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,648
kick up
the boiler pressure,

1386
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:16,108
and make the train
go faster.

1387
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:29,830
Ready to roll!

1388
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:02,780
Emmett!

1389
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:09,912
Marty, are the
time circuits on?

1390
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,122
Check, Doc!

1391
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:14,875
Input the destination time.

1392
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:18,670
October 27, 1985,
11:00 a. m.

1393
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:24,426
Check. Okay, we're cruising at
a steady 25 miles an hour, Doc.

1394
01:35:24,511 --> 01:35:26,303
I'm throwing in
the Pres-to-Logs.

1395
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:37,773
Marty, the new gauge
on the dashboard

1396
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:39,441
will tell us
the boiler temperature.

1397
01:35:39,526 --> 01:35:42,903
It's color-coded to indicate
when each log will fire.

1398
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,488
Green, yellow and red.

1399
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:46,907
Each detonation
will be accompanied

1400
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,826
by a sudden burst
of acceleration.

1401
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,913
Hopefully, we'll hit
88 miles per hour

1402
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:55,874
before the needle
gets much past 2,000.

1403
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:58,669
Why? What happens
after it hits 2,000?

1404
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,546
The whole boiler
explodes!

1405
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,589
Perfect!

1406
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:20,441
Hey, Doc!
We just hit 35!

1407
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,401
Okay, Marty.
I'm coming aboard!

1408
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:36,957
Emmett!

1409
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:40,711
Come on. Come on.

1410
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:51,680
You better hold
onto something, Doc!

1411
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,265
The yellow log
is about to blow!

1412
01:36:58,521 --> 01:36:59,563
Golly.

1413
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,902
We just passed 40, Doc!

1414
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:39,186
Emmett!

1415
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:44,274
We just passed 45, Doc!
Go for it!

1416
01:37:54,661 --> 01:37:55,661
Fifty.

1417
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:07,839
Emmett!

1418
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:08,924
Clara!

1419
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:11,343
I love you!

1420
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,764
Doc! Doc!
What's happening?

1421
01:38:15,848 --> 01:38:19,017
It's Clara!
She's on the train!

1422
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:21,019
Clara? Perfect.

1423
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:25,232
She's in the cab!
I'm going back for her!

1424
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:26,400
The windmill!

1425
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:30,404
Doc! The windmill! We're going
past 50! You'll never make it!

1426
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:34,283
Then we'll have to
take her back with us!

1427
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:36,868
Keep calling out
the speed!

1428
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:40,330
Clara,
climb out here to me!

1429
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:41,707
I don't know if I can!

1430
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,250
You can do it!

1431
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:45,460
Just don't look down!

1432
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,173
That's it!

1433
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:06,023
Sixty miles
an hour, Doc!

1434
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:12,321
You're doing fine!
Nice and steady!

1435
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,200
Come on!

1436
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,995
Just a little further!

1437
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:22,039
I can't, Emmett!
I'm scared!

1438
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:25,542
Seventy!

1439
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:28,295
Keep coming, Clara!

1440
01:39:29,631 --> 01:39:32,674
Come on! Come on!
You're doing fine!

1441
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:37,596
Come on!
Nice and easy!

1442
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:41,683
Don't look down! That's
it! You're doing fine!

1443
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:48,732
Doc! The red log
is about to blow!

1444
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:57,407
Clara!

1445
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,912
Emmett!

1446
01:40:11,798 --> 01:40:13,465
I'm trying
to reach you!

1447
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:14,800
Clara, hold on!

1448
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,093
I can't!

1449
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:25,185
Oh!

1450
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:28,146
Doc, I'm gonna slip you
the Hoverboard!

1451
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:37,447
Marty, watch out!

1452
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:47,457
Emmett, help!

1453
01:40:50,128 --> 01:40:51,712
Hold on, Clara!

1454
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,633
Doc, ready, Doc?

1455
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:58,927
Catch it!

1456
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,930
Yes! Yes!

1457
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:13,859
Emmett!

1458
01:41:13,943 --> 01:41:15,318
Hold on!

1459
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:19,990
Yes!

1460
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:01,818
Well, Doc,

1461
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:05,280
it's destroyed.

1462
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:09,492
Just like you wanted.

1463
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:29,512
Hey, butthead,
get away...

1464
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:30,597
Watch it, Biff!

1465
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:32,599
Marty, I didn't mean
to scare you.

1466
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:33,934
I didn't recognize you
in those clothes.

1467
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:35,435
What the hell
are you doing?

1468
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:38,271
Just putting on
the second coat now.

1469
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:40,774
You going cowboy, huh?

1470
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:43,568
Come on, guys. We're
gonna be late for brunch.

1471
01:44:43,653 --> 01:44:44,653
Coming, Dave.

1472
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:46,029
Come on, Dad,
we're not gonna hold

1473
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:47,614
your reservations
all day.

1474
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:49,115
I can't
find my glasses.

1475
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,492
Lorraine, have you seen my glasses?

1476
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:52,619
They're in your
suede jacket, honey.

1477
01:44:52,703 --> 01:44:55,372
Marty, what's wrong? We
thought you went to the lake.

1478
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:56,623
You wore that
to the lake?

1479
01:44:56,707 --> 01:44:58,625
Thank God you guys
are all back to normal.

1480
01:44:58,709 --> 01:45:00,710
Marty, who are you supposed
to be? Clint Eastwood?

1481
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,589
Right.
I gotta go get Jennifer.

1482
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:10,387
I really like
that hat, Marty.

1483
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:12,013
Thanks, Biff.

1484
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:27,737
Jennifer.

1485
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:31,032
Jen.

1486
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:36,579
Jennifer.

1487
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:03,732
Marty.

1488
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:07,152
I had the worst
nightmare.

1489
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:17,078
Marty, that dream
I had is so real.

1490
01:46:17,163 --> 01:46:19,622
It was about
the future.

1491
01:46:19,707 --> 01:46:21,708
About us.

1492
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:24,044
And you got fired.

1493
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:26,463
Wait a minute. What do
you mean I got fired?

1494
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:28,590
"Hilldale. "

1495
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:33,219
Hilldale!
This is where we live.

1496
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:36,306
I mean, this is where
we're going to live.

1497
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:38,850
Someday.

1498
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:45,315
Marty, it was a dream,
wasn't it?

1499
01:46:49,195 --> 01:46:50,528
Hey.

1500
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:52,739
The big M.

1501
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:54,824
How's it hanging, McFly?

1502
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:56,159
Hey, Needles.

1503
01:46:56,243 --> 01:47:00,371
Nice set of wheels.
Let's see what she can do.

1504
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:01,539
Next green light.

1505
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:02,665
No, thanks.

1506
01:47:04,001 --> 01:47:06,544
What's the matter?
Chicken?

1507
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:08,588
Chicken McFly.

1508
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:09,798
Whoo!

1509
01:47:11,217 --> 01:47:12,675
Marty, don't.

1510
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,177
Grab hold of something.

1511
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:16,888
Come on!
Get on!

1512
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:20,517
Yeah, go! Go, go, go!

1513
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:44,499
Did you
do that on purpose?

1514
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:47,043
Yeah, you think I'm stupid
enough to race that asshole?

1515
01:47:53,259 --> 01:47:56,261
Jeez! I would have
hit that Rolls-Royce.

1516
01:48:06,105 --> 01:48:07,897
It erased.

1517
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:23,830
You're right. There's not much left.

1518
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:28,459
Doc's never
coming back.

1519
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:44,559
I'm sure gonna
miss him, Jen.

1520
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:58,323
What the hell?

1521
01:49:15,758 --> 01:49:16,883
Doc!

1522
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:18,468
Marty!

1523
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,720
Doc! Doc!

1524
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,681
Marty,
it runs on steam!

1525
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:32,482
Meet the family.
Clara, you know.

1526
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:33,733
Hi, Marty!

1527
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:34,901
Ma'am!

1528
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:38,112
These are our boys.

1529
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:42,700
Jules and Verne.

1530
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:48,665
Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.

1531
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:53,628
Doc, I thought I'd
never see you again.

1532
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:55,922
You can't keep
a good scientist down.

1533
01:49:56,006 --> 01:49:58,132
After all, I had to
come back for Einstein,

1534
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:01,511
and, well, I didn't want
you to be worried about me.

1535
01:50:02,137 --> 01:50:03,137
Oh!

1536
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:06,057
I brought you
a little souvenir.

1537
01:50:22,741 --> 01:50:25,910
It's great, Doc.
Thanks.

1538
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:32,125
Dr. Brown, I brought this
note back from the future,

1539
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:34,460
and now it's erased.

1540
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,504
Of course
it's erased.

1541
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:39,757
But what does
that mean?

1542
01:50:39,842 --> 01:50:43,720
It means your future
hasn't been written yet.

1543
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:45,555
No one's has.

1544
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:48,057
Your future is
whatever you make it.

1545
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,685
So make it a good one,
both of you.

1546
01:50:53,814 --> 01:50:55,023
We will, Doc!

1547
01:50:55,107 --> 01:50:56,649
Stand back!

1548
01:50:57,151 --> 01:50:59,235
All right, boys,
buckle up!

1549
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:09,412
Hey, Doc, where are you
going now? Back to the future?

1550
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:13,249
No, already been there.
