1
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,885
-Son of a bitch.
-What are yoo doing?

2
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,512
There's a goddamn racooon
in the middle of the road.

3
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,224
Jesus.

4
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,019
Well, better to kill us than get
a little road kill on the oar, huh?

5
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,188
Well, we're still alive.

6
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,691
l can tell by the pissy look
that you're giving me.

7
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,470
-This isn't the interstate.
-There was a wreck.

8
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,098
lt was all backed op.
l took a shortcut.

9
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,058
To where?

10
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,354
-Can you hear that?
-Hear what?

11
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,982
l think the engine just made a noise.

12
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,401
Well, it's kind of late
for a breakdown.

13
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,861
Should've stopped somewhere
earlier.

14
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,780
l popped some of those trocker pills.

15
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,199
l thought I coold make it
the whole way.

16
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,412
Where are we?

17
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,210
You were really dreaming
over there earlier.

18
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,212
You were mumbling
and jerking around.

19
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,923
l dreamt you were trying to kill me.

20
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,510
We were at my parents'
anniversary party...

21
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,096
...and my mother
wooldn't stop talking.

22
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,267
You started screaming you couldn't
take it and then tried to strangle me.

23
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,270
At least you were
dreaming about me, right?

24
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,105
That's kind of an improvement.

25
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,275
-Shit.
-Jesus.

26
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,736
You okay?

27
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,406
l keep telling you
how stupid that is to do that.

28
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,368
You ought to just kind of bite into
the apple like the rest of the world.

29
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,246
-It hurts my teeth.
-As bad as ootting your finger off?

30
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,123
lt's not anything.

31
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,878
-You want me to drive for a while?
-No. I don't.

32
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,006
Why don't you just go ahead
and go back to sleep?

33
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,788
Remember how Charlie used to dance
when there was no music playing--?

34
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,998
l'm tired, David.

35
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,605
See, I think that should be us
just about there.

36
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,984
Why didn't yoo jost
stay on the interstate?

37
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,949
l don't know.

38
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,869
Guess l just wanted to make this
as miserable as possible, you know?

39
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,206
See just how big a bitch
you'd be about it.

40
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,299
l just thought it would be faster,
you know?

41
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,726
Shit.

42
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,981
ls that something?

43
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,126
Do you think they're closed?

44
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,253
Since 1957.

45
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:47,090
That's too bad,
because they got good gas prices.

46
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,891
-Look, if yoo're too tired, I'll drive.
-I told you, I'm fine.

47
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,899
Okay. See, that town there, Elida.

48
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,777
You were asleep, but we went
through there about three hours ago.

49
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,113
Well, that should put os
down here somewhere.

50
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,867
l mean, that's a town. Downey. I mean,
they would have a real gas station.

51
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,619
lf that's really where we are.

52
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:19,623
l think that we're headed south.
l mean, eventually, we've got to hit a--

53
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,627
-Oh, my God.
-Sorry.

54
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,047
-It's okay.
-You got to me before l headed out.

55
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,007
-I'm sorry.
-I gotta warn yoo, though.

56
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,135
The gas price is a little steeper
than the sign says.

57
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,722
Actually, we're just--
We're having some engine problems.

58
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,099
Yeah, he dodged a squirrel
a few miles back.

59
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,477
-It's a raccoon, yeah.
-And we're lost.

60
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,647
Well, she's lost.
l actually know exactly where we are.

61
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,482
We're on our way to Downey.

62
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,532
He's trying to tell you
it's the other way, David.

63
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,992
-Yeah. Sorry, man.
-It's okay.

64
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,496
lt's really easy to get turned around
out here without a map.

65
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,920
-Downey's, like, 30 miles back, man.
-Really?

66
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,339
Look, l'll tell you what. Pop the hood.

67
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,217
l'll cheok the engine
and make sure you can get that far.

68
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,555
-Really? Thanks. Okay, great.
-Great. Thank you so much.

69
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:26,356
Yeah, l went off the road there
when I missed the raccoon.

70
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,984
l think I hit a low spot.

71
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,928
Yeah. Thanks, man.

72
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,810
ls he gonna fix it?

73
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,819
-What do you think?
-Well, the fan blade's bent.

74
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,654
Rock must have hit it.

75
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,992
Yeah, she'll drive fine, just noisy,
that's all.

76
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,746
You wanna have someone take a look
when you get where you're going.

77
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,540
l'll do that. Thanks.
So now, what do l owe you?

78
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,209
Oh, no, nothing. No, we're good.

79
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:32,255
Hell, l shoold pay you
for finally giving me something to do.

80
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,592
Do you need help
getting to Downey?

81
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,093
-Yes.
-Well, actoally...

82
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,597
...if you coold just point us
towards the interstate, that'd be great.

83
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,477
-Well, you don't want Downey, then.
-Okay.

84
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,813
l'll tell you what you do.
You take this road here, right?

85
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,817
And yoo follow it down until you hit
a grove of trees on your right.

86
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,154
You take that.
Keep going until you hit Westcliff.

87
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,156
-It'll be a four-lane there.
-Westcliff.

88
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,910
Make a left on that and that'll
take you where you need to be.

89
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,788
-Okay. Thank you.
-Perfect. Thanks a lot.

90
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,583
And yoo know what? Man, I'd feel
a lot better if you just took this.

91
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,878
Thanks for staying out so late
and helping us.

92
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:18,301
Well, you just bought yourself
a $20 sparkly, then.

93
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,637
Because every day's
4th of July's at Small's.

94
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,474
Owner makes me say that.

95
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,062
-Here you go.
-Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

96
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,606
-And drive careful.
-Okay, thanks.

97
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,172
Guess l ought to buy you
a box of those sparklers, huh?

98
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,893
So how far did he say
this Westcliff place is?

99
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,313
He didn't. And l can't even find it
on the fucking map.

100
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,191
-David.
-What, did we hit something?

101
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,528
-That's fucking....
-Yeah, probably another squirrel.

102
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,157
-You know, it was a focking raccoon.
-Whatever.

103
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,868
l mean, Jesus Christ,
why do yoo have--

104
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,705
Oh, what the hell?

105
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:44,512
Son of a bitch.

106
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,015
So much for being able to
drive it the whole way.

107
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,226
God. Perfect. No signal.

108
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,644
Damn it.

109
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,607
-Can't a oar run without a fan?
-Evidently not.

110
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,925
Okay, give it a try for me, all right?

111
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,551
lt's not gonna work.

112
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,220
Jesus Christ.

113
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,848
Would you just give it a try for me,
please, honey?

114
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,691
Goddamn it.

115
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,073
So how far back was the gas station?

116
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,283
l don't know. About a mile?

117
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,285
A long walk
in the middle of the night.

118
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,454
Yeah. l guess we could
just sit here...

119
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,208
...and hope some idiots like os
come along and give us a hand, huh?

120
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,918
l didn't get us lost.

121
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:02,090
No. You slept for 300 miles,
thanks to your Zoloft-Prozac cocktail.

122
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,813
Fuck!

123
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,071
Well...

124
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,491
...at least we know there's
someplace back there.

125
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,952
Oh, yeah, the guy that helped us
so much before.

126
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,455
Well, you know,
you coold get another sparkler, Amy.

127
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,458
-Asshole.
-Whatever you say.

128
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,502
Grow a penis.

129
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:14,329
Never see stars anymore.
At least not in L.A.

130
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,998
Kind of nice out here, really.

131
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,500
l bet Charlie would have liked it.

132
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,378
We should've brought him
sometime.

133
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,214
We never went anywhere.
The job was always too important.

134
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,883
-Why do you do that?
-What?

135
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,552
Every time l mention his name,
you take a shot at me.

136
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,888
-Stop mentioning his name.
-I'm not like you.

137
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,682
l'd rather just remember him
and deal with the pain.

138
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,518
Okay, you know what, David?
Do what you want.

139
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,873
He said he was getting ready
to close, remember?

140
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,834
Shit.

141
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,003
Look, let's jost go back to the car.

142
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,966
You can sleep on the hood and
stare up at the stars you love so much.

143
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,260
Maybe they'll know
where we can find the guy.

144
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,931
Oh, God.

145
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,295
You've got to be kidding me.

146
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,635
What is that?

147
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,388
-I want to go.
-No.

148
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,307
lt's okay.

149
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,312
Let's go to the car.
What are you doing?

150
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,690
Don't ring the bell.

151
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,161
Sorry.

152
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,496
-Hey, folks.
-Hi.

153
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,415
How can l help you?

154
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,084
Everything okay back there?

155
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,341
-Can we just--? Can we just go?
-It's okay.

156
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,011
Sorry.

157
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,847
Things get a little boring
around here late nights.

158
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,474
l believe that.

159
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,018
Say, there's a mechanic
at the garage over there.

160
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,520
He helped us with oor car earlier.
You know him?

161
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,523
l think he's gone home for the night.

162
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,692
He'll probably be back
tomorrow morning.

163
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,236
l was wondering
if yoo could get in touch with him.

164
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,906
The car actually broke down
two miles back there.

165
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,365
We just walked up here.

166
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,702
l sure can't. I sore can't. I'm sorry.

167
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,622
Do you know another garage?

168
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,086
There's Clark's...

169
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,130
-...about 20 miles east.
-Okay.

170
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,050
May l borrow yoor phone?
l'd like to give them a call...

171
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,677
...see if they can maybe
come and give us a hand.

172
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,721
All I got's a pay phone,
right out there.

173
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,557
-That's great.
-Works on dimes...

174
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,893
-...if you need them.
-Okay, l do.

175
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,694
lt's real.

176
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,998
No, it doesn't have to be
exact change.

177
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,146
Thank you.

178
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,525
Trouble is...

179
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,154
...Clark's won't be open either.

180
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,864
Not this late.

181
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,907
So I goess I don't need these, huh?

182
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,326
Not if you need a garage.

183
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,037
Yeah. We do.

184
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,708
But like l said, guy over there
will be back around 8...

185
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,209
...if you can wait that long.

186
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,086
l'm sure he can get you ronning.

187
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,714
Meanwhile, I'm wide open here.

188
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,549
Shocking.

189
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,135
Okay. Thanks.

190
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,806
Well, we can either stay here...

191
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,892
...or we walk all the way
back to the oar.

192
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,145
David, this is a fuoking nightmare.
l don't know.

193
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,772
Yeah, we'll go ahead and stay here.
Thanks.

194
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,484
l'll give yoo two the honeymoon suite
for $5 extra.

195
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,486
lt's got a few perks the others don't.

196
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,488
A regular room will be fine.
Thank you.

197
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,490
l'll give it to you for the same rate.

198
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,784
Well, whatever works.
Whatever's fastest.

199
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,914
All right, I'll give you my card.

200
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,499
We're not set up for plastic here,
friend. Cash only.

201
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,086
Okay. I got cash.

202
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,881
l guess you don't take dimes,
thoogh, do you?

203
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,845
Just kidding around.

204
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,098
l'm gonna need to see ID
on one of you.

205
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,184
Sort of a deposit
on the room's contents--

206
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,812
Look, sir, we're-- You can trost us.
We're not gonna steal anything.

207
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,940
l'm not lugging
a bonch of dirty towels...

208
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,025
...baok to the car
in the morning, so....

209
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,780
l'm-- I'm-- I'm sore you won't,
but rules are rules.

210
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,366
l don't make them.
l'm just a manager.

211
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,951
Of course. Here you go.

212
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,873
lt's right on the corner, Nomber 4.

213
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,209
Might have to jiggle the handle
to open her.

214
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,044
She's as sticky as an old whore.

215
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,546
-Right.
-Excuse my language, ma'am.

216
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,715
Y'all have a great night.

217
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,009
See yoo later. Thank you.

218
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,185
Oh, this is great.

219
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,281
Good thing we upgraded.

220
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,446
We've had oor tetanus shots, right?

221
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,074
Oh, hey, if you wanna know
what's on March of '97...

222
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,201
...I got the answer.

223
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,005
l'm sleeping in my clothes.

224
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,841
l'm gonna sleep in my shoes.

225
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,931
l guess it could be worse, you know.

226
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,642
We coold be in that twin bed
at your folks' hoose...

227
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,311
...trying to pretend like
we're a happy couple.

228
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,610
God, l shoold have
told my mom about us.

229
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,821
Why ruin their party, though?

230
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:32,326
l think the thing to do is just tell them
after we've signed the papers.

231
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,790
lt felt really strange
to be at that party.

232
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:43,504
Watching them all celebrate
being together all those years.

233
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,967
How did it make you feel?

234
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,054
l don't know.

235
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,599
Tired.

236
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,398
Yeah.

237
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,157
l'm sorry.

238
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,420
Never should've gotten off
the interstate, either.

239
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:30,634
And miss our one last great
adventure together?

240
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,846
Yeah.

241
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,236
David.

242
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,614
Sorry.

243
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,576
Concierge.

244
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,163
Hello?

245
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,624
Hello.

246
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,169
There's no one there.

247
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,129
Jesus Christ.

248
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,217
What the hell is that?

249
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,192
Hello?

250
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,575
You heard that, right?

251
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,621
Don't touch that.

252
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,835
Who is it?

253
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,258
-Stay there.
-David, wait.

254
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,846
Yeah?

255
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,315
David, don't.

256
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,776
lt's coming from
the room next door, Amy.

257
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,653
l know. Don't open it.

258
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,879
Yeah, what do you need?

259
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,844
Hello?

260
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,058
When we walked over here,
were there any oars in the parking lot?

261
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,727
Just check.

262
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,859
There's a truok.

263
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,903
lt's probably the manager guy's.

264
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,915
l don't know what the deal is,
but it's a little late for this shit, okay?

265
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,250
So--

266
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,920
Close the door, David.

267
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,427
Close the door.

268
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,431
-Damn it. Why mess with them?
-I'm not messing with them.

269
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,351
l'm just trying to figore out
what they're doing.

270
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,270
Just wait there.

271
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,154
Who is it?

272
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,469
l don't know what your problem is,
asshole.

273
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,391
How long can they focking
go on with this? Goddamn it.

274
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,894
Oh, David, don't.

275
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,314
l'm gonna call the manager
and tell him someone's bothering us.

276
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,496
Why don't you open the door?

277
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,668
Play some games?
l'll play some fucking games with you.

278
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,968
That's real funny, jerk-off.

279
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,721
-Lock the door.
-Where are you going?

280
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,098
l'm gonna go take oare of this prick.

281
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,712
Everything all right, Mr. Fox?

282
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,673
No, because the asshole
in the room right beside us...

283
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,050
...keeps banging on the walls
and he won't stop.

284
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,635
You got any ideas?

285
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,847
-The room beside you?
-Yeah, Room 3.

286
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,516
l go over to talk to the guy
to get him to stop...

287
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,351
...but he just keeps doing it.

288
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,980
So I gotta say,
l don't know what his problem is.

289
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,984
Now, that is very strange
seeing as you folks...

290
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,361
...are the only guests
l got in here tonight.

291
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,157
Well, somebody's in there, okay?
And l gotta say, l'm pretty exhausted.

292
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,618
You sure it's Room 3?

293
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,078
Yeah, we're in the corner, right?
Number 4?

294
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,832
Well, it's the room right beside us,
with the big rusty 3 on it, okay?

295
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,127
-So l'm pretty sore.
-Okay, okay.

296
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,507
Every once in a blue moon,
a college kid or drifter...

297
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,593
...will sneak in through the window
for a good night's sleep.

298
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,722
The cleaning lady will find trash
on the floor or shit in the toilet.

299
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,600
Usually they don't cause much
of a distorbance, so....

300
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,436
-Well, this one is, okay?
-Let me go check it out for you.

301
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,523
And if those work,
l'd think about bringing one.

302
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,611
-I am ass-tired of shooting at orows.
-Give me a hand.

303
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,132
Fuck it.

304
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,760
lt's okay.

305
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,808
So, what happened?
What did he say?

306
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,687
He just thinks it's some drunk.
He's gonna take care of it.

307
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,939
-Did you hear anything else?
-No.

308
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,525
l was hoping l would
and I'd know what they were.

309
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:06,530
l'm sure they just saw me walk
over there and then they took off.

310
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:11,159
Now we get to enjoy this luxury resort
in peace and quiet.

311
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,287
David, maybe we should just leave.

312
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,415
Just go back to the car.

313
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,668
l'm not gonna walk anymore tonight,
okay?

314
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,129
Let's just gut it out here
for a few hours.

315
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,507
We'll get the car fixed and we can
just get the hell out of here.

316
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,925
-Okay?
-Okay.

317
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,510
Okay.

318
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,184
You're not watching that right now?

319
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,853
Well, why?

320
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,522
Look, l'm just gonna unwind
a little bit.

321
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,526
And make sure the guy
from next door is gone.

322
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,864
You gotta take advantage of the perks.
lt's worth the extra 5 bucks.

323
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,201
Or is it?

324
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,163
-God.
-Shit.

325
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,706
What is it?

326
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:01,543
-This bathroom's disgusting.
-Yeah?

327
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,503
-David?
-Yes?

328
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,715
That manager guy's definitely
gone over there?

329
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,051
Yeah, with a six-shooter.

330
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,346
He's gonna take care of it,
so just relax.

331
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,724
Gotta make sure his only two guests
are happy.

332
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,895
This looks like a real library
of classics.

333
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,822
Come on. One more.

334
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,366
Jesus.

335
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,494
Bet this really gets the
honeymooners in the mood.

336
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,458
Can you turn that off?
lt's the last thing l need right now.

337
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,378
Well, the least they could do
is give us a little porn.

338
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,388
Can't you just mute it or something,
so I don't have to hear it?

339
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,438
You get the fuck out of here.

340
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,116
Susan!

341
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,549
What...?

342
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,307
l told yoo to turn it off.

343
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,852
Just get away from us!

344
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,609
What is it?

345
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,281
David?

346
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,163
Do you see that room?
From the movie?

347
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,582
What about it?

348
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,349
-What movie is that?
-I don't fucking know.

349
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,455
Fuck me.

350
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,749
David, is that this room?

351
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,586
lt sure looks like it.

352
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,508
This has to be
some kind of joke, right?

353
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,056
l mean, it oan't be real.

354
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,643
That oan't be real.

355
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,566
Steven.

356
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,987
No, get back here. Oh, God.

357
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,913
No! No!

358
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,414
Oh, my God.

359
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,628
What happened?

360
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,174
-It's okay.
-Oh, my God.

361
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,385
lt's okay.

362
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,571
Help!

363
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,332
l'm calling the police.

364
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,464
-Shit.
-We gotta get out of here, all right?

365
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,634
All right, let's go. Wait, hold on.

366
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,137
Whoever was outside,
they heard the TV, right?

367
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,722
So they know we watched it.

368
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,807
That asshole put os in here
to watch it.

369
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,143
He was never gonna help.
He was part of it.

370
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,938
So they know we fucking watched it.
They know we're gonna try to run.

371
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,150
-Maybe they don't know we caught on.
-No, wait a second.

372
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,905
-He knows, okay? He knows.
-So, what now?

373
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,660
We'll climb out this way. Come on.

374
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,581
lt's fucking nailed shut.

375
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,835
They'll hear you.
Let's just sneak out the door.

376
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,047
They're notjust gonna let us
stroll out there and call the cops.

377
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,174
They're not gonna let us
sit here, either.

378
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,426
Fuck.

379
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,183
-David.
-What?

380
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,018
Did you bring this?

381
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,271
No.

382
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,191
-I didn't bring it.
-Didn't you bring that from the car?

383
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,860
No, l bled all over it.
l wouldn't have brought it.

384
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,528
l left it in the oar.

385
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,659
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

386
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,387
Well, how'd it get in here?

387
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,138
l don't know.

388
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,057
Dim the lights.

389
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,142
What are we doing?

390
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,395
We're leaving.

391
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:02,320
Okay, when we get outside,
we're gonna go to the trees, okay?

392
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,698
Where they oan't see os.

393
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,703
We gotta move fast, Amy. Okay?

394
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,684
Okay. Okay, we're gonna run
right over there, all right?

395
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,103
Just stay with me.

396
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,908
-Oh, my God.
-Come on.

397
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,539
-Fock.
-Oh, God.

398
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,087
Come on.

399
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,324
-Get the bathroom window open.
-But it's nailed shot.

400
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,658
Just try, okay?

401
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:32,994
Turn off the light.

402
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,098
David!

403
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,559
They're out there, at the window.

404
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,061
l've got a gun. Get away...

405
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,523
...or l swear to God,
l'm gonna fucking ose it.

406
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,869
Oh, God, leave us alone.

407
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,977
l don't see anybody.

408
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,647
-Well, they wouldn'tjust leave.
-No, they wouldn't.

409
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,320
David, don't. They were in there.

410
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,245
Okay. If they wanna come in here,
they're gonna come in.

411
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,582
lt doesn't matter. We gotta find
another way out of here right now.

412
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,086
Fuck.

413
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,138
-I need to get to that phone.
-No, you're not going out there.

414
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,765
Listen, Amy. It's a real phone, okay?
lt will help.

415
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,602
They're not gonna let you get to it.
Don't go out there.

416
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:24,022
Look, look. If we stay here...

417
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,399
...we're gonna wind up
like all of them.

418
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,527
Please.

419
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,948
Now, we know that they were outside,
watching that window.

420
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:38,244
lf we can keep their attention on that,
it'll give me time to get to the phone.

421
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,538
Well, how can we do that?

422
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,833
Fuck.

423
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,673
Please hurry.

424
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,312
Come on, come on.

425
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,317
-911 Emergency.
-Yeah, hello.

426
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,820
We need help.
Some people are trying to kill os.

427
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,363
Where are you located, sir?

428
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,408
Me and my wife are at this motel.
The Pinewood Motel.

429
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,578
lt's near the mountains.
They've got us trapped.

430
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,454
Who has you trapped, sir?

431
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:07,667
l don't know. We just need help.
The Pinewood Motel.

432
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,086
Yes, sir. Do you have an address?

433
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,423
No, l don't. lt's near some side road.
Jesus Christ, look it up.

434
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,550
You're going to need to settle down,
sir.

435
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,053
You'll never survive
if you lose control, Mr. Fox.

436
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,142
And you shouldn't be wandering
around in the dark by yourself.

437
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,755
-Did you get anyone on the phone?
-No.

438
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,890
-Why the fuck are they doing this?
-Listen.

439
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,435
lt's getting light.
They're gonna want this over soon.

440
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,521
We need something.
What about the knife from your apple?

441
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,106
lt's in the car.

442
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,410
Nothing in here.

443
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,636
This will have to do.

444
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,597
You're bleeding.

445
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,655
What do you think they're doing?

446
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,785
l think they're enjoying themselves.

447
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,043
You let me fall asleep.

448
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,839
-It was just because of your pills.
-I have to be awake.

449
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,884
No. Honey, I need yoo to stay there.

450
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,804
-What?
-They're watohing yoo.

451
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,139
And they're listening.

452
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,810
l didn't want them to watch what l was
doing, but they need to see you.

453
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,897
So they don't think
we're trying to get out.

454
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,398
Okay?

455
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,570
-Wait, what are you doing?
-Going through the tapes.

456
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:26,073
They have cameras everywhere,
even outside. They edit them together.

457
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:30,244
Remember the screaming from the TV
the guy was watching in the office?

458
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,913
l'm sure it was one of these.

459
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,834
lt's not enough they rob and kill
these people, they wanna watch it too.

460
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,753
Why are you watching them?

461
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,380
l'm looking for mistakes.

462
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:46,385
These people, they weren't smart.

463
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,931
They thought the room
woold protect them and it won't.

464
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,225
They can come in
anytime they want.

465
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,269
They just watch until they get bored.

466
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,605
See? Right there.

467
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,982
lt happens
in almost every one of these.

468
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,568
He just shows op.

469
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,031
Well, how'd he get inside?
He wasn't in here before.

470
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,034
He didn't come through the door.

471
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,539
l can't tell from the others,
but with this angle...

472
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,542
...right there.

473
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,378
lt's the bathroom.

474
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,799
And that's where your apple
came from.

475
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,469
Just stay here.

476
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,692
David.

477
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,780
l saw lights. Someone's here.

478
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,498
-Come on.
-Wait.

479
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,333
We don't know who he is.

480
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,669
He's a ride out of this place.

481
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,422
Yeah, unless he's one of them.
What the fuck's he doing here so late?

482
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:35,179
Maybe he's lost. That could happen.

483
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,933
He looks like he's been driving
a long time. He's not one of them.

484
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,686
He could help us. Come on.

485
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,397
Wait. You oan't go out there.

486
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,733
Help!

487
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,113
-Over here, sir!
-Help!

488
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,074
Hey, come here!

489
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,635
-He's coming.
-No, they won't let him.

490
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:18,222
He needs to get in the truck.
The trock. l'm gonna tell him.

491
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,810
-David.
-What?

492
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,937
-Fock, no.
-No!

493
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,650
Turn around. Torn around!

494
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,489
Turn around. They're behind yoo!

495
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,950
Turn around!

496
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,202
Hey!

497
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,498
-Wasn't sore you were gonna make it.
-You got them?

498
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,791
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

499
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,253
That's the good stuff.

500
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,924
-Oh, my God.
-Okay, oome on. Come on.

501
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,804
-Okay, go.
-What's in there?

502
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,556
Go. Come on.

503
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,741
We can't go in that.
We don't know what's in there.

504
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,495
We don't have any choice.
Amy, we have to do this, okay?

505
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,914
Come on.

506
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,541
Just follow me.
l'll lead us out of here.

507
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:32,713
lt's gonna be okay.
This is gonna lead us oot of here.

508
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:25,099
-I can't. l have to go back.
-We can't, they're gonna be waiting.

509
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,727
-I can't breathe.
-Yes, you can, all right?

510
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,189
Just close your eyes, grab hold
of my leg. I'm gonna lead us.

511
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,108
lt's not much further.

512
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,026
Come on.

513
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,239
lt's okay.

514
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:47,496
-David, please. lt's gonna fall.
-No, it's not. Come on. Come on.

515
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,961
Shit. Oh, fuck.

516
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,255
What? What's the matter?

517
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,049
-You can't scream, Amy.
-What?

518
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,051
They're gonna hear you
if yoo scream.

519
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,971
Okay? Just keep moving.
We're almost there.

520
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,433
What's that?

521
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:15,816
Oh, God.

522
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,776
Shit.

523
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,959
l see something.

524
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,378
-What is it?
-Door, maybe.

525
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,517
Where are we?

526
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,859
This is what you get.

527
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,362
Where are we?

528
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,749
We haven't done anything to you.

529
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:18,629
Please, you could be my son.
You could be my son. Please.

530
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,888
Please, please, don't do it.
Please, don't. You can't.

531
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,433
Who are you guys?

532
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,647
You can have anything. Anything.

533
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,860
Please, don't kill me.

534
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,617
Help me.

535
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,412
Please don't. I'm begging you.

536
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,914
You can have money.

537
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,916
Let me get the door.

538
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,636
Please, no. Please!

539
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,451
Oh, God.

540
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,583
We're no better off than we were.

541
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,835
No, look, we're still alive.

542
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,130
Okay, there has to be something
in here we oan use.

543
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,151
-911 Emergency.
-Yeah, they're trying to kill us.

544
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,112
I need your name and location.

545
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,669
Okay.

546
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,132
-Well, they're out there somewhere.
-Ma'am?

547
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,636
Hello? I need your name
and location, ma'am.

548
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,554
Ma'am?

549
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,182
-Hello?
-Fock!

550
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,601
Fuck! Fuck!

551
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,111
Get down there after them.

552
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,495
Bitch!

553
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,552
They're under us!

554
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,825
They'll find us in here.

555
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,495
Well, we can't try to run. Not yet.

556
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,665
We have to let them think
we got away, let them go after us.

557
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,333
Then we can try to run.

558
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,670
-What if they look in here first?
-Jesus, Amy. I don't know.

559
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,673
l'm doing the best I can over here.

560
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,187
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

561
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,650
-No, I'm sorry.
-No, there's nothing to be sorry for.

562
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,861
-I'm the one that got off the interstate.
-No, I....

563
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,365
l mean for everything else.

564
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,200
l'm sorry about us.

565
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,787
And aboot Charlie.

566
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,456
l should've made sure
the gate was up.

567
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,542
l shouldn't have let him
near the stairs.

568
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,128
lt's not your fault, okay?
None of it was.

569
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,796
lt was an accident.

570
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:59,094
Please. You have to stop
blaming yourself, all right?

571
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,138
No one else does.

572
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,557
lt's okay. lt's okay.

573
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,982
Listen.

574
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,067
We just have to make it oot of this.

575
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,570
All right?

576
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:21,158
Everything starts over
once we make it out of this.

577
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,910
All right?

578
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,621
Promise.

579
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,427
-It's the 91 1.
-Hold on. Hold on.

580
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,430
lt could be one of them,
like the truck driver.

581
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,517
When you called 91 1,
you didn't tell them where we were.

582
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,936
Why would they be here now?

583
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,272
Well, maybe they traced the call.

584
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:57,277
Gosh. You sure it came from here?
lt's jost me tonight.

585
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,113
-And you run the place?
-Oh, yeah.

586
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:03,075
Then I won't disturb anybody
if l take a look around?

587
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,743
No.

588
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,412
No, no.

589
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,540
Haven't had a guest here
in three nights.

590
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,091
Slow season, huh?

591
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:22,678
Yeah, well, all four of them.

592
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,646
That happen tonight?

593
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,692
These goddamn kids.

594
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,487
Come around and vandalize stuff.

595
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,615
l just haven't gotten around
to cleaning that up.

596
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,452
-Been too busy with all the goests.
-That's right.

597
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,791
l probably should
look in these rooms.

598
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,053
Wrong keys.

599
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,889
Let me head back to the office.
l'll be right back.

600
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,615
-They're looking for us.
-Maybe he's here to help us.

601
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:29,202
No. He isn't. He wouldn'tjust
let him walk around like that.

602
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,825
Hello?

603
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,599
When I called 91 1...

604
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,644
...it was the guy from the office
that answered the phone.

605
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,578
He looks scared.

606
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,913
l think he has one of the tapes.

607
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,459
He's gonna leave, David.

608
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,757
He's leaving.

609
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,596
Help os!

610
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,181
No, wait, wait, wait.

611
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,978
Get in the car.

612
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,692
-Go.
-How many are there?

613
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,527
Three, I think. Come on, let's go.

614
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,195
What's the matter?

615
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,824
They're trying to make sure
we can't leave.

616
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:16,036
Well, I'm not gonna give them
a choice. Stay here.

617
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,301
Shit.

618
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,519
Get out.

619
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,815
Had to drag him into this,
didn't you?

620
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,986
You might as well have stuck
that knife into his back yourself.

621
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,408
Oh, my God, they killed him.
David, they killed him.

622
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,206
David, we're not gonna
fit through there.

623
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,676
Okay, they're going
around the other side.

624
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,846
lf I can get in the office,
they keep some guns there.

625
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,077
-Okay, this is gonna work.
-What?

626
