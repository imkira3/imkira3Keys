LANFORD ON SPEAKERS:
The countless lives

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,511
that we lost
in the war of '96...

22

did not perish in vain.

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,552
They inspired us
to rise from the ashes...

as one people of one world.

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,112
For 20 years, the world
has seen no armed conflict.

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,278
Nations have put
their petty differences aside.

United,
we rebuilt our families,

our cities and our lives.

29
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,634
The fusion of human and alien
technology...

30
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,189
not only enabled us
to defy gravity

31
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,914
and travel
with unimaginable speed...

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,237
it also made our planet,
finally, safe again.

It's an honor,

There's worse things
that you could be doing...

than towing a half

01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,755
Correct. My species shed
our biological existence...

1465
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,150
for a virtual one
thousands of years ago.

1466
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,520
Far out.

1467
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,999
Why are you here?

1468
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,958
When I intercepted
their distress call...

1469
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,839
I knew they would come
to exterminate you.

1470
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,834
I came to evacuate
as many of you as possible.

1471
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,194
But you attacked me

1472
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,993
with the same weapons
they used on us.

1473
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,349
They attacked you?

1474
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,669
Correct.

1475
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,354
A Harvester Ship
conquered our planet...

1476
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,988
and extracted
its molten core.

1477
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,594
They use them
to refuel their ships...

1478
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,439
and grow their technology.

1479
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,160
They have done this
to countless civilizations.

1480
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,519
We fought them
for thousands of years...

1481
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,955
but they destroyed
all of our ships.

1482
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,635
I am the sole survivor.

1483
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,712
BRAKISH: I am so sorry
to hear that.

1484
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,109
Do you have a plan?

1485
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,873
My system holds the key
to superior technology.

1486
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,399
And there is
a hidden planet...

1487
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,552
where I teach refugees
from other fallen worlds...

1488
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,518
how to build weapons that will
defeat them...

1489
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,079
once and for all.

1490
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,016
CATHERINE: That's why
they're afraid of you.

1491
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,191
You're the only ones
who threaten their existence.

1492
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
Correct.

1493
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,630
But now that I am activated...

1494
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,513
the queen will detect
my signature...

1495
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,914
and hunt me down.

1496
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,399
It's too late.

1497
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,311
She's already on her way.

1498
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,833
Yeah.

1499
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,149
She's coming.

1500
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,032
Hey, what would happen...

1501
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,751
if we were able to kill her?

1502
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,595
No one has ever killed
a Harvester queen.

1503
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,068
That's encouraging.

1504
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,280
But as a hive...

1505
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,839
her fighters will fall,

1506
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,831
and her ship
will leave your planet.

1507
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,673
Recalled by
other Harvester queens.

1508
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,353
But it's too late now.

1509
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,748
You must terminate me...

1510
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,672
or she will get
the coordinates

1511
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,273
to the refugee planet.

1512
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,078
And that will be the end.

1513
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,355
Wait, wait a second.

1514
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,795
If we're so sure that she's
coming here to get you...

1515
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,671
maybe we can bait her...

1516
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,276
like she baited us.

1517
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,953
Mr. President,
Dr. Okun thinks...

1518
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,709
that we can replicate

1519
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,096
the Sphere's
RF radiation signal...

1520
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,189
David, English,
please.

1521
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,476
Every computer has a
radioactive signature...

1522
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,393
whether it's your laptop,
your phone, even your watch.

1523
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,391
But the Sphere
has an RFR

1524
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,760
that's completely
off the charts.

1525
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,309
So, if we hide
the real Sphere...

1526
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,311
inside the isolation
chamber...

1527
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,776
and pack
this decoy transmitter,

1528
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,800
so to speak...

1529
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,474
onto a tug filled with
cold fusion bombs...

1530
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,596
and lure her
out to the salt flats...

1531
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,116
We can fly it right up her
royal ass and bon voyage!

1532
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,392
You set off
cold fusion bombs...

1533
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,154
you're gonna kill everyone
from here to Houston.

1534
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,992
Not if we use
the shield generators

1535
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,480
from this base
to contain the blast.

1536
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,072
Without our shields,
you better put

1537
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,673
a blaster in every
able bodied hand...

1538
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,115
and get them ready
to shoot some aliens.

1540
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,591
Now, we just need a way
to see her coming.

1541
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,838
Follow me.

1542
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,160
Do your thing.

1543
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,918

in the hold.

1568
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,839
DAVID: So, the idea...

1569
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,468
is to get her
to follow this tug...

1570

into the salt flats...

1571

on board.

And once
she's taken the bait...

01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,671
our cold fusion bombs
can go to town.

As you know, they took out
all of our satellites...

1578
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,032

fly it in manually.

2108
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,160
Well done.

2109
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:17,234
Thank you,
Mr. President.

2110
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:19,229
Good job.

2111
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:20,400
Catherine...

2112
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,560
Um...

2113
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:24,234
Don't say anything.
You'll just ruin it.

2114
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:27,509
Who are you?

2115
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,319
David never mentioned a
beautiful woman in his life.

2116
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:31,555
Dad!

2117
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,517
I'm Julius.
I'm his father.

2118
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:36,109
Enchantée.
I'm Catherine Marceaux.

2119
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,514
Could you give us
a second?

2120
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,749
I was never here.

2121
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:43,598
Listen, maybe you guys should
stay with me for a while...

2122
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:45,872
I think that
we'd really like that.

2123
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,629
Yeah, so would I.

2124
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,034
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

2125
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,193
Are you okay?

2126
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:54,715
SPHERE: I am. Thanks to you.

2127
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,956
This wasn't all for nothing.

2128
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:00,270
You are a remarkable species.

2129
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,476
Not so primitive
after all, huh?

2130
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,240
You think they'll let me
keep this thing?

2131
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,316
You have the heart
of a warrior.

2132
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:14,158
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

2133
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:24,077
Hell of a job.

2134
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,235

2143
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:10,195

could survive another attack.

2145
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,072
Excuse me,
Director Levinson...

2146
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:14,958
you won't believe...

2147
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,439
the weapons
and the technology...

2148
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,797
this thing has on its
proverbial hard drive.

2149
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:22,474
It wants us
to lead their resistance!

2150
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:23,640
What do you mean?

2151
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:24,760
Two words...

2152
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,151
interstellar travel.

2153
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,149
Take the fight to them.

2154
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:30,673
When do we leave?

2155
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:35,512
We are gonna kick
some serious alien ass.
