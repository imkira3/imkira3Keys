...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,640
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

23

Thank you for joining us this morning.

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,640
-Not at all.
-So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,520
Well, the premise is quite simple.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,080
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,520
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,320
-We're talking about a virus?
-Yes.

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,320
ln this case, the measles virus...

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,640
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,120
Um, l'm not-- l find the best way
to describe it is...

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,760
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,840
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,480
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,000
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,480
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,280
Well, we've had 1 0,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,160
-And how many are cancer-free?
-Ten thousand and nine.

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,480
So you have actually cured cancer?

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,320
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

What are you guys doing here so early?

150
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,760
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

151
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,920
l'll see you guys inside.

152
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,480
What's happening, buddy?

153
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,240
Yes.

154
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,440
Good morning, Hank.
l'm midway through the G's.

155
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,480
Hey, who's the girl in...?

156
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,040
Never mind.
Hey, l'll see you in the morning.

157
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,600
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

158
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,960
''Hello.

159
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,680
Wanna see some infected rats?''

160
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,680
Okay, tomorrow.
l'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

161
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,600
Psst.

162
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,760
Come here. Hey. Hey.

163
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,000
Good job. You did so good.

164
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes. Yes.

165
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,360
Ah.

166
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,680
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

167
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,080
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

168
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,240
You'll get some of that later.

169
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,960
Let's go.

170
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,320
Wait.

171
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,120
My name is Robert Neville.

172
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,960
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

173

<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

174

<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport

<i>...when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

176
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,520
<i>If you are out there....</i>

177
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
<i>If anyone is out there....</i>

<i>I can provide shelter.</i>

<i>...anybody....</i>

183
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,520
<i>Please.</i>

184
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,440
<i>You are not alone.</i>

185
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,800
Fore!

186
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,360
Yeah.

187
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,880
Keep your eye on this one for me.

188
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,400
Ooh.

189
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,000
l'm getting good.

190
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,040
Ss-ss.

191
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,440
Sam! No, no, no!

192
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,960
No! No! Sam!

193
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
No! No!

194
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,400
Sam? Sam? Sam?

195
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,160
Sam? Sam?

196
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,520
Sam? Sam?

197
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Hello, Sam?

198
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
Sam?

199
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,480
Sam?

200
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,320
Come on. Sam.

201
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,760
l gotta go, Sam.

202
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,080
l gotta go. l gotta go.

203
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,640
Sam?

204
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,200
Sam? Sam?

205
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,880
Sam? Sam?

206
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,960
Sam. Sam.

207
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,760
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.

208
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,320
What are you doing?

209
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,680
Sam, we gotta go!

210
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,440
Sam, go! Go!

211
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,920
Sam, get out! Get out!

212
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,760
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

213
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,560
Listen, uh...

214
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,640
...l want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

215
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,800
Because you can still get infected.

216
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,400
And l can't.

217
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,400
So, look, if l'm not back by dark...

218
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,480
...just go.

219
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:39,040
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 1 8 to 20 years of age.

220
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,520
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.

221
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,560
Core temperature, 1 06 Fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.

222
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,880
Respiration elevated.

223
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,920
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.

224
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,720
Pupils fully dilated.

225
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,200
Nonreactive to light.

226
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,600
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

227
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:42,440
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.

228
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,440
Vaccine test.

229
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,880
GA series, serum 391 , Compound 6.

230
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,200
Commencing human trials.

231
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,120
Respiration slowing.

232
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,320
Pulse, 1 90. Core temperature...

233
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,040
...1 05...

234
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,680
...1 04 and decreasing.

235
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,760
We may have something here.

236
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,400
GA series, serum 391 , Compound 6
ineffective on humans.

237
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,720
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

238
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
Still no cure.

239
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,280
<i>ROBERT:
Day 1 001.</i>

240
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,600
<i>We came in close contact
with a hive today.</i>

241
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,520
<i>Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...</i>

242
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,440
...and contact strains.

243
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,480
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

244
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,840
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

245
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,640
Vaccine trials continue.

246
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,840
l'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

247
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,320
The Krippin Virus is...

248
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,480
...elegant.

249
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,640
<i>Just fishing in the dark, son.</i>

250
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,520
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

251
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,000
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

252
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,000
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

253
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,280
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

254
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,360
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

255
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,760
Social de-evolution appears complete.

256
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,200
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

257
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,560
Why are we stopping?

258
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,080
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

259

00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,920
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

311
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,120
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

312
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,120
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

313
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,600
Sam, you protect Daddy.

314
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,720
-No, baby, l can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
MAN 7: Sir, we gotta go!

315
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,840
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

316
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,760
It's a butterfly.

317
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,320
All right, come on, let's go!

318
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,200
How'd you sleep?

319
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,520
<i>Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...</i>

320
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,600
<i>...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.</i>

321
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,880
<i>So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...</i>

322
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,880
<i>...have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.</i>

323
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,880
<i>Twenty-five patients have already died.</i>

324
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,240
<i>Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...</i>

325
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,360
<i>...and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.</i>

326
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,080
lt's my birthday.

327
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,600
<i>We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these--</i>

328
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,480
You gonna sing?

329
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,840
My name is Robert Neville.

330
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,600
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

331
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,320
<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

332
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,600
<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...</i>

333
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,600
<i>...when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

334
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,840
<i>If you are out there,
if anyone is out there....</i>

335
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,200
<i>I can provide food. I can provide shelter.</i>

336
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,120
<i>I can provide security.</i>

337

<i>If there's anybody out there, anybody....</i>

338

<i>Please.</i>

339
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
<i>You are not alone.</i>

340
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,120
Listen, uh...

341
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,680
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

342
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,720
Okay? Because you know
l don't like surprises.

343
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,520
And l swear l'll act surprised. Okay?

344
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,280
Hey! Hey!

345

How did you get out here?!

351
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,520
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

352

lf you're real,

You're okay.

00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,600
Don't worry

380
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,920
<i>About a thing</i>

<i>Don't worry

383
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,520
<i>Rise up this morning</i>

384
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,720
<i>Smiled with the rising sun</i>

385
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,080
<i>Three little birds</i>

386
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,720
l promised my friend...

387
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:07,520
...that l would say hello to you today.

388
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,960
Hello.

389
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,400
Hello.

00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,680
Please say hello to me.

391
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,320
Please say hello to me.

392
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,360
Die!

393
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,760
Die!

394
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,520
Die!

395
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,920
Come on! Stay with me!

396
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,000
Where do you live?

397
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,720
Hey.

398
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,720
Hey!

399
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,000
Stay with me.

400
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,200
Where do you live?

401
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,680
Where do you live?

402
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,680
ROBERT:
Uh....

403
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:36,080
1 1 Washington Square.

404
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,360
They don't know where l live.

405
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,720
Don't-- Don't let them track us.

406
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,680
You gotta stay out till dawn.

407
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,560
No!

408
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,040
Donkey?

409
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,120
<i>What are you doing?</i>

410
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,640
<i>I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</i>

411
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:05,560
<i>Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</i>

412
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,720
<i>DONKEY: It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.</i>

413
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,440
<i>SHREK: Oh, your half? Hm.
DONKEY: Yes, my half.</i>

414
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,240
<i>I helped rescue the princess. I did
half the work. I get half the booty.</i>

415
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,760
<i>Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.</i>

416
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,080
<i>SHREK: Back off!
DONKEY: No, you back off.</i>

417
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,320
<i>SHREK: This is my swamp!
DONKEY: Our swamp.</i>

418
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,960
<i>-Smelly ogre.
SHREK: Fine!</i>

419
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,400
<i>DONKEY: Come back,
I'm not through with you!</i>

420
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,040
<i>SHREK:
Well, I'm through with you.</i>

421
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,320
<i>DONKEY: You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me. "</i>

422
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:42,560
<i>Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!</i>

423
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,920
<i>You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.</i>

424
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,480
<i>You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.</i>

425
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,000
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?</i>

426
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,360
<i>DONKEY: Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!</i>

427
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,400
<i>SHREK:
Oh, yeah.</i>

428
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,920
<i>You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...</i>

429
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,560
<i>...for stabbing me in the back!</i>

430
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,400
<i>DONKEY: You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.</i>

431
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,760
<i>SHREK: Go away.
DONKEY: See?</i>

432
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,040
<i>Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...</i>

433
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,440
<i>...and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.</i>

434
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,080
<i>SHREK: Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.</i>

435
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,880
<i>I heard the two of you talking.</i>

436
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:27,880
<i>DONKEY: She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.</i>

437
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,400
l'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

438
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,600
Obviously you know that.

439
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,640
They're yours.

440
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:48,840
But l did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

441
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,800
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

442
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,320
l put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

443
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,720
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

444
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,800
ROBERT:
Who are you?

445
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,840
ANNA:
l'm Anna and that's Ethan.

446
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,040
Don't let it get cold.

447
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,760
lt's okay. Go on.

448
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,000
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

449
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,760
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

450
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,200
We're going to Vermont.

451
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,560
To the survivors' colony.

452
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,720
What?

453
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,280
ln Bethel. lt's a safe zone.

454
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,920
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

455
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,960
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

456
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,200
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

457
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,960
ln the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

458
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,680
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony--

459
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,080
ROBERT:
Shut up! Shut up!

460
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,680
Everybody's dead.

461
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,960
Everybody is dead.

462
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,000
l just need--
l need a minute. Okay?

463
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,160
<i>Just....</i>

464
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,960
l just-- l was saving that bacon.

465
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,840
l was saving it.

466
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,160
<i>l'm just-- l'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just--</i>

467
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,320
l'm gonna go.

468
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,080
Ethan, put the knife down.

469
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:11,040
SHREK: Aye.

470
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,360
<i>MAN:
By the order of Lord Farquaad...</i>

471
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,920
<i>...I am authorized

<i>Oh, really? You and what army?</i>

474
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,400
Can l say something to you?

475
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,560
You was really, really something
back there. lncredible.

476
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,920
Are you talking to...

477
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,080
...me?

478
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,760
Yes, l was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

479
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,160
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and bam!

480
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,600
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

481
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,800
That really made me
feel good to see that.

482
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,200
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

483
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,480
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

484
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,160
Hm?

485
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,760
But, uh...

486
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,560
...l don't have any friends.

487
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,200
And l'm not going out there by myself.

488
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,000
Wait a minute. l got a great idea.
l'll stick with you!

out of my nose. Just like the time....</i>

496
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,040
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

497
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,040
Thank you for my leg.

498
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,320
Okay.

499
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,920
Where have you been?

500
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,720
l was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of SÃ¤o Paulo.

501
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,000
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

502
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,720
No, they weren't.

503
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,880
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

504
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,840
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

505
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,640
You said five?

506
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,720
The Darkseekers got them.

507
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,720
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

508
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,920
lt's too late today.

509
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,200
lf we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

510
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,840
-So if you had--
-l'm not leaving.

511
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,040
This is ground zero.

512
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,640
This is my site.

513
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,800
l'm not gonna let this happen.

514
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,280
l can still fix this.

515
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,040
What happened to your leg?

516
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,640
That's my snare.
These are my materials.

517
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,840
The infected didn't do this. They can't.

518
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,680
-How do you know?
-They have no higher brain function.

519
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:26,120
They don't plan or hate.
They don't love. They can't.

520
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,320
ANNA:
Could they be evolving?

521
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,600
ANNA:
Ethan.

522
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,320
Hey, Ethan.

523
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,840
lt's cold.

524
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,680
We gotta go.

525
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,360
ROBERT: l've been cooking the compounds.
ANNA: What?

526
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,960
ROBERT:
lce. l need ice.

527
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,120
ROBERT: Whoa. You scared me.
-Sorry.

528
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,640
l called down twice.

529
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,440
Oh. Oh, thank you.

530
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,720
lt's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

531
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,640
l've never seen one so still.

532
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,920
They're always biting.

533
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,280
You think that can cure her?

534
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,400
Um.... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...

535
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,800
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

536
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,960
...l can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

537
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,520
Did all of them die?

538
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,320
Yes.

539
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,400
ANNA:
My God.

540
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,000
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

541
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,640
Where can Ethan sleep?

542
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,200
He's heavy.

543
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,520
Can you get that?

544
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,600
ANNA:
She's beautiful.

545
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,000
What's her name?

546
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,600
Marley.

547
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,440
-Her name was Marley.
-lt's a beautiful name.

548
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,360
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

549
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,880
-Who?
-Uh, the singer.

550
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,640
Damian?

551
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,920
Uh, his father.

552
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,480
His father.

553
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,680
Nope.

554
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,960
I shot the sheriff

555
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,240
<i>But I didn't shoot the deputy</i>

556
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,760
-Oh, that is unacceptable.
-What?

557
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,920
Best album ever made.

558
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,880
[BOB MARLEY'S ''STlR lT UP''
PLAYS ON STEREO]

559
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,320
-You don't recognize that?
-Mm-mm.

560
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,880
Wow.

561
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:01,600
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

562
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,400
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

563
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:12,720
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

564
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:17,440
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

565
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,560
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

566
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,720
Two days later...

567
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,000
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

568
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,200
Somebody asked him why.

569
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,480
He said, ''The people...

570
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:42,720
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

571
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,880
How can l?''

572
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,800
Light up the darkness.

573
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,040
Come with us, Neville.

574
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,640
To the colony.

575
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,800
There's no colony, Anna.

576
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,640
Everything just fell apart.

577
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,480
-There was no evacuation plan--
-You're wrong. There is a colony.

578
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,080
l know, okay?

579
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,760
How do you know, Anna?

580
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,360
l just know.

581
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,760
How? l said, how do you know?
How could you know?

582
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,800
God told me.

583
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,280
He has a plan.

584
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,640
-God told you?
-Yes.

585
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,520
-The God?
-Yes.

586
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,520
-l know how this sounds.
-lt sounds crazy.

587
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,520
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

588
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,320
Something told me to come here.

589
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,280
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

590
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,480
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

591
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:26,640
Anna.

592
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,000
l got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

593
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,800
<i>-Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
-He must have sent me here for a reason.</i>

594
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,000
Neville, the world is quieter now.

595
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,240
You just have to listen.

596
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,560
lf we listen...

597
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,200
...we can hear God's plan.

598
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,440
-God's plan?
-Yeah.

599
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,160
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.

600
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,240
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.

601
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,000
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

602
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,640
...people dead.

603
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,640
Crashed and bled out, dead.

604
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,680
Less than 1 percent immunity.

605
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,640
That left 1 2 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

606
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,960
The other 588 million...

607
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,120
...turned into your Darkseekers.

608
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,000
And then they got hungry.

609
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:22,560
And they killed and fed on everybody.

610
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,840
Everybody!

611
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,520
Every single person
that you or l has ever known...

612
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,600
...is dead!

613
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,840
Dead!

614
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,920
There is no God. There is no God.

615
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,080
What is that?

616
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,720
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

617
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,000
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

618
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,320
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

619
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,040
They followed us home.

620
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,840
Ethan.

621
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,680
Shit.

622
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,040
Anna.

623
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,400
Anna.

624
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,800
