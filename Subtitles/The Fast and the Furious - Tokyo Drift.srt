2
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:09,355
Nice ride.

3
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,993
It does the job.

4
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,889
What job, delivering pizzas?

5
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:19,296
Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.

6
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:25,106
What the hell was that?

7
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,233
What?

8
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:28,843
Hey! You talking to my girl?

9
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,174
Oh, shit. Here we go. Yeah.

10
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:34,274
She was just admiring my ride.

11
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:35,576
"My ride."

12
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,244
My grandma's Buick could smoke ...

13
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,254
that piece of shit, trailer trash.

14
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:42,051
Well, what about your daddy's Viper?

15
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:44,926
This beast's got 500 horsepower ...

16
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,121
and a Borla exhaust system.

17
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,061
It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds ...

18
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,099
That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.

19
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,498
Wow. You can read the brochure.

20
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,792
What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.

21
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:20,953
What's he gonna do?

22
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,965
- Let's make it happen.
- Bring it.

23
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,907
I got your ...
I got your back.

24
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:40,476
Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?

25
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:44,478
I only race for pink slips.

26
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:47,285
This car goes for 80 grand.

27
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:50,451
What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?

28
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:56,421
How about me?

29
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:03,532
Winner gets me.

30
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:13,377
Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!

31
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:29,995
Blast-off, baby!

32
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:34,761
First one out the other side ...

33
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:37,963
It's time. Let's go!

34
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,441
Ready, boys?
Make it interesting, Clay.

35
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,613
Shit!

36
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,293
Yeah!

37
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:49,898
I thought you loved me.

38
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:59,409
Oh, well.

39
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,649
What the hell?

40
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,836
Guess I got a new date for prom.

41
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,911
Clay, stop the car! Shut up!

42
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:45,883
Clay, stop the car!

43
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:46,986
Shut up!

44
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,291
Stop it!

45
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,930
Clay, please stop! Please stop!

46
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:08,100
Can I get a copy of that?

47
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:12,409
You think this is a joke, huh?

48
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,679
You see Ken and Barbie over there?

49
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:18,619
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

50
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:21,122
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.

51
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:26,156
But I like screw-ups like you.

52
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:27,662
You know why?

53
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,528
'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.

54
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,630
- Where's my car?
- I crushed it.

55
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:33,828
You did what?

56
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:35,063
- Sit down! You're done.
- Easy, easy.

57
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:36,537
You're done.
You understand me? You're done.

58
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:39,439
And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.

59
00:10:41,678 --> 00:10:42,804
Sean.

60
00:10:44,147 --> 00:10:46,411
What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?

61
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,343
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

62
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,685
It's, uh, it's Miss.

63
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:59,690
Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?

64
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:09,329
It's a tough state.

65
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,565
And it's a pretty clear-cut case.

66
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:15,438
He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.

67
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:20,315
This is our third town
in two years.

68
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,510
Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,

69
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:25,577
wilful destruction of property.

70
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:27,623
This makes it strike three.

71
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,318
They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.

72
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:33,226
Well, there's
just got to be another way.

73
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:44,472
So, where are we moving this time?

74
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,136
We are not moving anywhere.

75
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,452
Sean.

76
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:48,386
I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.

77
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,091
Today is the 7th.

78
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,025
Well, look,
just hold on one second.

79
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:21,728
Come on in.

80
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,134
This is it.

81
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,872
You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.

82
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,006
But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,

83
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,711
and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.

84
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:48,918
Well, you're here now,
and that's good.

85
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,620
So, how is your mom?

86
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:56,291
Where do I sleep?

87
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:59,329
Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.

88
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:02,132
I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,

89
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,970
I mean, you just
can't keep moving away ...

90
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,009
every time you get into trouble.

91
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:09,000
Worked for you.

92
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:14,813
Look, neither of us asked for this.

93
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:18,353
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

94
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:21,814
So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,

95
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:23,825
and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

96
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,454
Rules?

97
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:28,122
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

98
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:30,131
You go to school,

99
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,860
you come back here right after.

100
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:33,795
And I don't want to see or hear

101
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,734
about you anywhere near a car.

102
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:40,270
Here, the bedroom is yours.

103
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:48,107
Make yourself comfortable.

104
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:52,213
Lights out in 10.

105
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:53,773
You got to be kiddin'.

106
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,573
Wrong train.

107
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,542
I'm new here.

108
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:01,345
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

109
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:04,409
Japanese food is like the Army.

110
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,912
Don't ask, don't tell.

111
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:09,482
Name's Twinkie.

112
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,576
Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.

113
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:14,615
Yeah?

114
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:17,354
I'll hook you up. Half price.

115
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:19,892
No, I'm cool.

116
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,452
60% off. Hmm?

117
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,589
Since we're both army
brats and everything.

118
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,191
I ain't got no cash, man.

119
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,099
And I ain't an army brat.

120
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,535
All right, all right.

121
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:31,197
Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?

122
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:34,369
Everybody needs a cell phone.

123
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:36,008
No offense,

124
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,607
but I'm probably
not gonna be here ...

125
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,511
long enough to remember your name.

126
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:43,618
Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.

127
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:45,153
You like Michael Jordan?

128
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:46,754
I love Michael Jordan.

129
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,547
Check this out.

130
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:52,383
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.

131
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:55,692
LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.

132
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:59,891
You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?

133
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:02,403
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.

134
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:05,003
Man, I even paid
retail for it.

135
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:06,900
What you drive?

136
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:08,637
- My ride?
- Yeah.

137
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:10,338
My ride's one of a kind.

138
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:11,572
Show me.

139
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:14,739
Thought you
weren't stickin' around.

140
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:16,778
All right.

141
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,835
Slamming, huh? Look at that car.

142
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:15,607
At least let me drive.

143
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:18,144
Y'all better have some
real cars around here.

144
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:20,272
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?

145
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,907
Well, all right.

146
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:23,918
I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.

147
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,011
You look a little nervous.

148
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:28,079
What up, Tosh?

149
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:04,956
For when you
blow your wad, man.

150
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:03,677
Hear that?

151
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:05,583
It's still not right
for the way I drive.

152
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:10,858
I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.

153
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:13,326
Okay. Then we're done here.

154
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:18,796
You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.

155
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:20,898
Boys.

156
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:24,302
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

157
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,070
I'm a guy. It's in my DNA.

158
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:30,240
So y'all race with these things,
huh?

159
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:32,676
Cute little toys.

160
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:37,047
You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.

161
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,019
Don't you mean Uwabaki?

162
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:41,689
Neela, right?

163
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,358
You're a quick learner.

164
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:48,858
So, where you from, anyway?

165
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:50,057
Here.

166
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,193
No, I mean, not where you live.

167
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:53,894
Where'd you come from?

168
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:56,062
Does it really matter
where I'm from?

169
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,540
Who's the tourist?

170
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,482
What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?

171
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:12,042
You're moving up in the world.

172
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,781
You gotta elevate your company.

173
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:15,517
Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.

174
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:17,058
God. Girl.

175
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,059
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?

176
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:24,723
All right, beautiful. Hold up.

177
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,789
Hey!

178
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:28,468
He was just leaving.

179
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,475
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

180
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:41,983
Understand that? Gaijin?

181
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,278
Takashi.

182
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,377
We were just talking.

183
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:47,319
This isn't your scene.

184
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,286
That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,

185
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:55,022
what does that mean exactly?

186
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:58,458
Means, turn around,

187
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:00,762
keep walking.

188
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:02,167
That's exactly what we gonna do.

189
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:03,329
Come on, man, let's roll.

190
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:04,872
Yo, look, man, he's Yakuza.

191
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,909
Now, see, that's funny,

192
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:11,036
'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country

193
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,815
where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.

194
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,820
You know who I am, boy?

195
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:24,353
Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?

196
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:31,358
Leave.

197
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:34,661
Damn, man.
You know Yakuza? The Mafia?

198
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:38,429
Look, sorry, DK - san.

199
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:40,475
Monkey didn't have
his banana today.

200
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,338
Hey, D, let's go.

201
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:43,776
It's time to race.

202
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:49,781
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.

203
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,319
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

204
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,892
Then let's race.

205
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:12,731
With what, huh? Your skateboard?

206
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:17,775
Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.

207
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:19,778
Take mine.

208
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:25,250
Let's race.

209
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,885
What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.

210
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,157
Can he drive?

211
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,736
Can he drive?

212
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,867
You know what DK stands for?

213
00:26:47,843 --> 00:26:49,242
Donkey Kong?

214
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,043
Drift King.

215
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,841
Drift?

216
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:56,784
What do you mean, drift?

217
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:10,988
Still need a dictionary?

218
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,560
You know that
real famous painting?

219
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:16,035
The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?

220
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:17,093
The Mona Lisa.

221
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:18,298
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.

222
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:19,965
Well, look, man,
this car right here's ...

223
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,669
like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.

224
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:24,573
Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.

225
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:26,113
We talking forged pistons,

226
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:29,446
bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.

227
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:33,484
Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

228
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,788
Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift ...

229
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:40,350
All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

230
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:41,521
Hand braking is the easiest,

231
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:42,654
so the first thing
I want you to do,

232
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:43,959
I want you to rip that e-brake.

233
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,158
All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

234
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:47,030
then I want you to power over.

235
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:50,031
You know what?

236
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:51,629
Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

237
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:53,438
All right.

238
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:48,555
Ready.

239
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:51,056
Set.

240
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:54,993
Go!

241
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:37,142
I told you.

242
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:19,212
Damn it!

243
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:07,161
Damn it!

244
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:50,430
Don't leave town.

245
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:08,281
Do you know what time it is?

246
00:33:08,423 --> 00:33:10,618
I thought it was around 7:00.

247
00:33:11,326 --> 00:33:13,988
You know,
US is a few hours behind.

248
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:19,833
Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

249
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:24,797
Have you been racing, Sean?

250
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:30,606
You're out of here.

251
00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:35,377
Go ahead.

252
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:38,680
You don't get it, do you?

253
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:40,880
You have nowhere else to go.

254
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:42,620
If it doesn't work out here,

255
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,715
you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

256
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:49,663
This isn't a game.

257
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:52,360
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

258
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:54,095
if you're gonna
live under my roof,

259
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:57,070
you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

260
00:33:57,872 --> 00:33:59,237
Understand?

261
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:01,966
Understand?

262
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:04,139
Yes, sir.

263
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:56,024
Get in.

264
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:58,632
I'll get you your money.

265
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,863
Why you talking
like you have a choice?

266
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:17,109
There's a guy in there
with a paw ...

267
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:18,982
that owes me some money.

268
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:20,213
A paw?

269
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:23,519
Go get me my money.

270
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:27,692
Okay.

271
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:23,848
Han said,

272
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,987
okane.

273
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:37,587
Han said, okane.

274
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:07,824
Let's go.

275
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:18,863
You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

276
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,534
I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

277
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:23,167
I don't care
if you're sick as a dog ...

278
00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:24,939
or in bed with Beyoncé.

279
00:37:25,013 --> 00:37:26,640
I call, you show.

280
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,580
Only if you teach me
how to drift.

281
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:31,582
This ain't a negotiation.

282
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:33,783
I wasn't negotiating.

283
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:24,067
What's he doing here?

284
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:26,163
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can ...

285
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,105
sitting in my garage.

286
00:38:28,176 --> 00:38:30,041
Hope he's not driving.

287
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:34,341
Gaijin.

288
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,244
When is your next race?

289
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:39,046
I'd really like to be there.

290
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:42,054
Why not be in it?

291
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:48,695
You heard me.

292
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,928
Ready to lose another car, Han?

293
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,530
I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

294
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:58,769
All right.

295
00:38:59,107 --> 00:39:01,007
Put up the '72 Skyline.

296
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:03,235
Done.

297
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:07,406
What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

298
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:12,615
Get him out of here.

299
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,548
We have business to discuss.

300
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,431
Your shipment's late.

301
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:30,630
Since when are you
so worried about the details?

302
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:34,998
When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

303
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:39,105
Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

304
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:02,763
Hey, Dad, it's me.

305
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,230
Uh, I had to stay after school ...

306
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:06,170
for some extracurricular activities.

307
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:09,171
So I'll be home a little later.

308
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:12,937
Sir.

309
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:18,251
You really need to stop
following me around.

310
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:20,320
What are you doing here?

311
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,522
I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend ...

312
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,080
for some drifting lessons.

313
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:26,386
Trust me.

314
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:28,258
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

315
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,659
It's good enough for you.

316
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,722
You don't know anything about me.

317
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,098
Well, why don't you think I know?

318
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:37,569
'Cause I'm a gaijin? An outsider?

319
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:40,674
Let me guess.

320
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:43,871
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

321
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:46,436
Your mama and daddy
was never home.

322
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:49,483
So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

323
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,883
And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

324
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:58,388
Zero for one, cowboy.

325
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:12,163
Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

326
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,901
like the rest of
the white guys around here?

327
00:41:19,881 --> 00:41:22,145
Is everything okay back there?

328
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,509
I can handle DK.

329
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:27,351
I thought he's Yakuza.

330
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:29,751
His uncle's Yakuza.

331
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:34,227
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

332
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:38,656
But I need him.

333
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,597
He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

334
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:44,765
What do you mean?

335
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:47,707
Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action ...

336
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:49,402
from everyone on his turf.

337
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:51,138
We're on his turf.

338
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,041
50% of something is better than

339
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:55,776
100% of nothing.

340
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,950
So have you raced DK?

341
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,815
Why not? Is he that good?

342
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:05,417
What's the point of a race?

343
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,928
To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

344
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:11,021
Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

345
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:12,565
If I were to race,
it would have to be ...

346
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:14,533
for something important.

347
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:16,593
Or why else do it at all?

348
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:20,874
Why are you letting me race?

349
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:23,172
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.

350
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,476
And you owe me a car.

351
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,262
Oh, shit.

352
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:58,972
What the ...

353
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:01,640
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

354
00:43:01,716 --> 00:43:03,206
You can do better than 180k,

355
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:05,582
they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

356
00:43:08,356 --> 00:43:09,880
You know what?

357
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:11,822
I'm beginning to like
this country already.

358
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:28,968
Danny!

359
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,673
You're looking good.

360
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,009
Disco.

361
00:43:42,923 --> 00:43:44,185
We gotta catch up.

362
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,748
Get you a drink on me, huh?

363
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:47,088
Let's go.

364
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:03,343
Aha. Easy now, ladies.

365
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:07,541
Come on.

366
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,684
What's up? How you doing?

367
00:44:13,754 --> 00:44:15,085
Hey, baby.

368
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:35,302
Keep your hands off the kid, girls.

369
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:36,866
He's underage.

370
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:40,844
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

371
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:42,910
Disneyland for grownups, huh?

372
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:44,416
All these girls, man,
they look like ...

373
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:45,884
What, models?

374
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:47,011
Check it out.

375
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,851
See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital ...

376
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:50,288
on this side of the planet,
all right?

377
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:51,790
Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

378
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,258
I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

379
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:54,919
Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

380
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:56,485
you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't ...

381
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:58,555
'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

382
00:44:58,632 --> 00:45:00,065
And most of
the guys around here are ...

383
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:01,863
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

384
00:45:01,936 --> 00:45:03,597
So what do you do?

385
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:07,702
Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

386
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:08,867
Yeah.

387
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:11,904
Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

388
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:13,503
I tear it up.

389
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:15,173
That's my thing.

390
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:16,305
Yo.

391
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,482
Sean!

392
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:11,232
The red Evo's yours.

393
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,877
What do you mean?

394
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:27,313
You're representing me now.

395
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:29,913
What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

396
00:46:56,217 --> 00:46:57,445
Oh, man.

397
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:03,979
Damn it.

398
00:47:09,597 --> 00:47:11,656
My mother,
she's blind in one eye ...

399
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:13,563
and she can drift
better than that.

400
00:47:16,203 --> 00:47:18,296
Han, where did you find this guy?

401
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,236
Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

402
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:47,457
Is that yours?

403
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:49,731
Sure is.

404
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,573
What happened?

405
00:47:59,847 --> 00:48:03,248
I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

406
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:08,721
It's got potential.

407
00:48:13,627 --> 00:48:15,959
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

408
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:23,567
You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

409
00:48:26,707 --> 00:48:29,175
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered."

410
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:35,010
You're gonna be late.

411
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:47,787
Sean!

412
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:11,680
Come on, man, you broke it.

413
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,982
Hey, whoa, whoa.

414
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:21,187
There must be a misunderstanding.

415
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:25,025
Out of my way, or you're next.

416
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,157
Take it easy.

417
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:28,030
Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

418
00:49:28,102 --> 00:49:30,400
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

419
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:32,137
Touch me again ...

420
00:49:35,843 --> 00:49:36,935
Here.

421
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:40,070
Try not to break this one.

422
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:55,450
Say, man!

423
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:57,087
What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

424
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,997
Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

425
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,159
Damn!

426
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:16,079
Not easy saving the day, is it?

427
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,751
Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

428
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,481
You're doing all right.

429
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:23,783
Thanks.

430
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:28,352
Hey.

431
00:50:29,563 --> 00:50:30,655
Yeah?

432
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:33,825
Sorry about the other night.

433
00:50:34,435 --> 00:50:36,767
Your life isn't any of my business.

434
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:39,737
It's okay.

435
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,154
Foul!

436
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,861
- Ain't no damn foul.
- That was a foul.

437
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:07,332
- Yo, you in my face.
- That was a foul.

438
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,926
Hey, Han, sort this wanker out.

439
00:51:10,003 --> 00:51:11,231
A wanker?

440
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:13,533
What do I look like, a zebra?

441
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:22,807
So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

442
00:51:23,951 --> 00:51:26,351
Well, you know
those old Westerns ...

443
00:51:27,054 --> 00:51:29,955
where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

444
00:51:32,626 --> 00:51:34,321
This is my Mexico.

445
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:40,556
Why'd you let me
race with your car?

446
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:42,931
You knew I was gonna wreck it.

447
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:44,765
Why not?

448
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:48,099
'Cause it's a lot of money.

449
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,675
I have money.

450
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:53,877
It's trust and character
I need around me.

451
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:57,608
You know, who you
choose to be around you ...

452
00:51:57,684 --> 00:51:59,709
lets you know who you are.

453
00:52:01,755 --> 00:52:03,416
And one car in exchange
for knowing ...

454
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,219
what a man's made of,

455
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:07,957
that's a price I can live with.

456
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:14,726
Look at all those
people down there.

457
00:52:15,402 --> 00:52:17,734
They follow the rules, for what?

458
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:21,304
They're letting fear lead them.

459
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:25,336
What happens if they don't?

460
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,172
Life's simple.

461
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:30,779
You make choices
and you don't look back.

462
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:47,026
So, if you don't drift to win,

463
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,068
what do you drift for?

464
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:50,764
You really want to know?

465
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:52,166
Yeah.

466
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,530
Okay. Let's go.

467
00:54:11,952 --> 00:54:14,477
There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.

468
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:16,320
Learn by doin' it.

469
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:18,781
The first drifters
invented drifting ...

470
00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:20,622
out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

471
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:23,127
So feel it.

472
00:54:35,676 --> 00:54:36,836
Again!

473
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:40,406
What's in this bag?

474
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:42,039
You'll see.

475
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:43,982
How much you got?

476
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:45,484
Keep going, keep going.

477
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:54,218
I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

478
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:00,188
Again.

479
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:23,516
Again.

480
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:35,799
Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

481
00:55:41,108 --> 00:55:43,508
Go, go, go, go!

482
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:56,755
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

483
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:51,844
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

484
00:58:06,686 --> 00:58:08,381
Pleasure doing business.

485
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:15,217
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

486
00:58:54,901 --> 00:58:56,801
It's actually not bad.

487
00:58:56,937 --> 00:58:58,837
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

488
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:02,033
See, I'm not a total gaijin.

489
00:59:03,843 --> 00:59:05,333
I hate that word.

490
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:07,838
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

491
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:11,544
I thought you were born here.

492
00:59:11,618 --> 00:59:14,712
Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

493
00:59:20,026 --> 00:59:22,051
My mom died when I was 10.

494
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,057
She came out here
from Australia ...

495
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:26,792
when she finished high school.

496
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,331
And all I know
about her is that ...

497
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:31,097
she went to work in a hostess bar.

498
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,367
DK's grandmother took me in.

499
00:59:39,512 --> 00:59:42,413
Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

500
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:45,380
Me and Mom moved around a lot.

501
00:59:46,186 --> 00:59:47,949
Mostly 'cause of me.

502
00:59:48,955 --> 00:59:51,287
Well, it was all 'cause of me.

503
00:59:53,226 --> 00:59:55,694
Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

504
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,227
without even thinking about it.

505
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,493
But I realize now,

506
01:00:01,568 --> 01:00:03,968
outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

507
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:08,232
All that matters is knowing
what you really want

508
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:10,938
and going after it.

509
01:00:31,064 --> 01:00:33,862
We used to come up here
when we were kids.

510
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:37,667
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

511
01:00:37,737 --> 01:00:40,297
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

512
01:00:47,013 --> 01:00:49,038
Things were different back then.

513
01:00:53,086 --> 01:00:55,919
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

514
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:59,083
Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

515
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:00,521
You know, we just made do.

516
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,922
No one bothered us.

517
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:04,887
The day I got my license ...

518
01:01:04,964 --> 01:01:07,455
is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

519
01:01:07,534 --> 01:01:09,934
The day after that,
I won my first race.

520
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:12,997
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

521
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:16,737
I gotta admit, it felt good.

522
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:19,842
It felt like ...

523
01:01:20,113 --> 01:01:22,343
Like everything else
just disappears.

524
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:25,840
No past and no future.

525
01:01:26,386 --> 01:01:27,910
No problems.

526
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:31,481
Just the moment.

527
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:56,641
Boy needs to chill.

528
01:01:59,152 --> 01:02:01,347
Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

529
01:02:01,421 --> 01:02:03,685
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

530
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:06,551
No. Look, that was
your third set today.

531
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:08,651
I mean, them tires ain't cheap.

532
01:02:18,505 --> 01:02:20,200
DK, grab a chair.

533
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,069
We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

534
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:24,838
Yo, come on, man, look ...

535
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,919
Stay away from her,

536
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:42,424
or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

537
01:02:48,468 --> 01:02:50,265
Find yourself a new driver.

538
01:03:03,082 --> 01:03:04,208
I'm all right.

539
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:05,811
What'd you expect?

540
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,684
You didn't just play with fire,

541
01:03:07,754 --> 01:03:09,517
you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

542
01:03:33,379 --> 01:03:34,710
It's over.

543
01:03:55,468 --> 01:03:57,060
All this over a gaijin?

544
01:03:57,203 --> 01:03:58,795
I am a gaijin.

545
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:03,437
You've changed, DK.

546
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:10,612
You say I've changed.

547
01:04:12,952 --> 01:04:15,580
But we're not so different,
you and I.

548
01:04:16,856 --> 01:04:19,689
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

549
01:04:25,698 --> 01:04:28,963
They say your mom
was the best trick ...

550
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:31,560
in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

551
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:33,732
Leave my mother out of this.

552
01:04:33,806 --> 01:04:37,207
If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

553
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:40,136
doing anything for a buck.

554
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:43,010
Think anyone would take
a second look at you ...

555
01:04:43,082 --> 01:04:44,549
if it wasn't for your uncle?

556
01:04:58,865 --> 01:05:00,730
We're the same, Neela.

557
01:05:04,637 --> 01:05:07,800
Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

558
01:05:13,713 --> 01:05:15,681
Do you know who you are?

559
01:05:18,518 --> 01:05:22,010
Do you know where you belong?

560
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:42,332
Hey.

561
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,608
Come on.

562
01:09:33,573 --> 01:09:34,835
Hey, brother.

563
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:37,138
I vouched for you!

564
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,178
Put my reputation
on the line for you!

565
01:09:39,278 --> 01:09:40,643
We were partners!

566
01:09:41,047 --> 01:09:43,914
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

567
01:09:43,983 --> 01:09:46,884
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

568
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,846
This is what we do.

569
01:09:48,988 --> 01:09:50,148
Takashi!

570
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:59,457
What about now? Hmm?

571
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,729
Is this what we do?

572
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,897
Man, you need me.

573
01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:07,969
You'd still be
shaking down teahouses ...

574
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,530
for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

575
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:20,578
Get in!

576
01:10:20,653 --> 01:10:21,984
Go! Go! Go!

577
01:10:26,058 --> 01:10:27,286
Come on.

578
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:50,326
Sean. Sean!

579
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:37,050
Takashi.

580
01:16:46,405 --> 01:16:48,566
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

581
01:16:58,984 --> 01:17:00,076
Okay.

582
01:17:01,286 --> 01:17:02,685
I'll go with you.

583
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:04,348
Neela.

584
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:17,733
See you when Daddy's not around.

585
01:17:41,226 --> 01:17:42,454
I'm putting you on a plane tonight.

586
01:17:42,528 --> 01:17:43,586
Dad ...

587
01:17:43,662 --> 01:17:45,095
Sean, don't argue with me.

588
01:17:45,164 --> 01:17:47,962
I did this. I can't run away.

589
01:17:49,134 --> 01:17:50,158
I can't.

590
01:17:50,235 --> 01:17:51,862
Sean, I'm your father.

591
01:17:51,937 --> 01:17:53,871
I'm responsible
for your well-being.

592
01:17:54,473 --> 01:17:56,498
And I'm responsible
for my mess.

593
01:17:59,645 --> 01:18:01,442
I gotta do this.

594
01:18:03,649 --> 01:18:05,617
Can you understand that?

595
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:24,397
At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

596
01:18:53,132 --> 01:18:54,861
You all right, man?

597
01:18:58,771 --> 01:19:00,363
We're leaving town.

598
01:19:01,073 --> 01:19:02,665
Look, I know some people ...

599
01:19:04,176 --> 01:19:05,973
I can't do it, Twink.

600
01:19:06,912 --> 01:19:10,006
Look, DK wants your head.

601
01:19:10,883 --> 01:19:12,214
All right?

602
01:19:12,651 --> 01:19:14,710
And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

603
01:19:15,921 --> 01:19:17,980
You're done here, bro.

604
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:21,118
Maybe I should talk to Kamata.

605
01:19:22,361 --> 01:19:23,988
What?

606
01:19:24,463 --> 01:19:26,124
DK answers to him.

607
01:19:28,901 --> 01:19:31,199
I know I just didn't hear that.

608
01:19:33,205 --> 01:19:36,606
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

609
01:19:36,675 --> 01:19:38,666
What, are you crazy, huh?

610
01:19:38,877 --> 01:19:40,469
Han is dead, all right!

611
01:19:40,546 --> 01:19:43,538
Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

612
01:19:46,685 --> 01:19:48,209
It's all I got.

613
01:19:54,793 --> 01:19:57,990
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

614
01:20:12,578 --> 01:20:13,977
What's this?

615
01:20:15,247 --> 01:20:16,805
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it ...

616
01:20:16,949 --> 01:20:19,110
out of Kamata's place alive.

617
01:20:23,121 --> 01:20:24,782
Don't you need it?

618
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:29,983
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

619
01:21:39,898 --> 01:21:40,990
Sean.

620
01:21:45,704 --> 01:21:47,365
You need to leave.

621
01:21:47,706 --> 01:21:49,833
You came to the wrong place.

622
01:21:50,008 --> 01:21:52,238
I didn't come here to see you.

623
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:53,872
Takashi.

624
01:22:22,507 --> 01:22:23,769
You think ...

625
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:29,371
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

626
01:22:31,516 --> 01:22:33,416
I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you ...

627
01:22:33,485 --> 01:22:35,453
in the first place, sir.

628
01:22:37,055 --> 01:22:39,250
But that's not why I really came.

629
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:41,949
I came here to apologize.

630
01:22:44,196 --> 01:22:47,825
I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

631
01:22:59,811 --> 01:23:03,577
Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

632
01:23:06,218 --> 01:23:08,686
How do you plan
to accomplish that?

633
01:23:10,122 --> 01:23:11,282
A race.

634
01:23:16,528 --> 01:23:19,429
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

635
01:23:19,631 --> 01:23:21,098
for us.

636
01:23:22,401 --> 01:23:24,699
And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

637
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:26,795
once and for all.

638
01:23:28,206 --> 01:23:29,400
We race ...

639
01:23:31,176 --> 01:23:33,269
and the loser leaves town
for good.

640
01:23:33,345 --> 01:23:36,178
I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

641
01:23:36,348 --> 01:23:37,440
Good.

642
01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:40,851
Then it should be easy.

643
01:24:19,091 --> 01:24:21,184
The cops took all the cars.

644
01:24:21,693 --> 01:24:22,751
Hey!

645
01:25:39,571 --> 01:25:41,266
That's why she's spitting.

646
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:06,124
We almost there, Twink.

647
01:26:06,264 --> 01:26:07,959
Couple more tweaks.

648
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:11,867
It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

649
01:26:13,271 --> 01:26:15,239
DK picked this road
for a reason.

650
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,335
This is his mountain.

651
01:26:19,277 --> 01:26:22,371
He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

652
01:30:16,347 --> 01:30:17,507
Yeah!

653
01:30:24,422 --> 01:30:25,514
Yeah!

654
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:26,682
Yes!

655
01:31:24,916 --> 01:31:25,940
Come on.

656
01:31:37,161 --> 01:31:38,423
Yeah! Come on!

657
01:31:38,496 --> 01:31:39,724
Come on, Sean.

658
01:31:39,864 --> 01:31:41,126
Let's go! Let's go!

659
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:43,099
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

660
01:32:11,262 --> 01:32:13,526
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

661
01:34:23,594 --> 01:34:24,583
Yeah, baby!

662
01:34:24,662 --> 01:34:25,822
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

663
01:34:25,897 --> 01:34:27,262
I told you!

664
01:35:31,863 --> 01:35:33,956
Hey, yo, Sean! Yo, Sean!

665
01:35:34,665 --> 01:35:36,360
Hey, check this out, man.

666
01:35:36,667 --> 01:35:39,500
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

667
01:35:40,471 --> 01:35:43,304
Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

668
01:35:43,374 --> 01:35:45,205
Not tonight, Twinkie.

669
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:50,306
Said he knew Han.

670
01:35:56,921 --> 01:35:58,684
Said Han was family.

671
01:36:12,703 --> 01:36:14,034
All right.

672
01:36:14,438 --> 01:36:15,530
Let's race.

673
01:36:42,767 --> 01:36:44,098
Nice ride.

674
01:36:44,569 --> 01:36:47,561
I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

675
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:52,336
I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

676
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:54,901
He was when
he was rolling with me.

677
01:36:57,515 --> 01:36:59,983
You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

678
01:37:00,451 --> 01:37:02,351
I got nothing but time.

679
01:37:05,957 --> 01:37:07,481
You ready, kid?

680
01:37:18,369 --> 01:37:20,030
Come on, Sean! Come on!

681
01:37:22,073 --> 01:37:23,233
Ready!

682
01:37:26,344 --> 01:37:27,402
Set!

683
01:37:31,716 --> 01:37:32,876
Go!
