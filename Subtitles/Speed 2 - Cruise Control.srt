1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,519
He's on the way, Mack.

3
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,599
I'm droppin' him right in your lap.

4
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,159
Copy that. We're all set up.

5
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,559
Now, listen, Alex,
everything by the book.

6
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,440
No stunts and no wrecks
today, all right?

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,763
Oh, shit.

8
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,319
It's the little things, you know,
that I'm still trying to get used to.

9
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,599
Like, if I drop my napkin... Ow.
...in a restaurant,

10
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,919
Alex gives me his.

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,039
Car door needs
opening, he opens it.

12
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,679
My neighbors, abusive?
He yells at them.

13
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,725
The other night, we were watching
a video, he let me pick it out.

14
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,639
Do you want to slowly merge into...

15
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,247
Signal first!

16
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,209
Too late. Okay.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,319
- Oh. That's good. Oh, boy.
- All right.

18
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,399
My last boyfriend, Jack, wasn't
exactly the romantic type.

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,199
Two years ago, for my birthday...

20
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,719
He gives me pepper Spray.

21
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,079
I think it's perfume.

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,559
I end up in the emergency room.

23
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,999
- Uh-huh.
- I'm telling you,

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,919
relationships based on
extreme circumstances

25
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,919
- never work out.
- Right.

26
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,526
- Right?
- No!

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,803
Watch the glass!

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,439
Your boyfriend drive like this?

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,559
Oh, Alex? No. No, no, no.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,599
Alex is so completely different.

31
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,759
<i>He is. I mean,
he works beach patrol.</i>

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,162
<i>He spends all day on
a bicycle in Venice.</i>

33
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,646
Shit.

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,439
<i>I'm sure he's on the
beach right now.</i>

35
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,519
That's how we met, by the way.
I was, uh, jaywalking.

36
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,959
- Jaywalking, huh?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,199
Well, you know,
jaywalking is a crime.

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,999
Yeah, but I needed to get across

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,439
and at the point where they...

40
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,330
Dip!

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,401
- Ow.
- Another dip!

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,124
Oh! Aah...

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,079
Two dips.

44
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,199
- It's our anniversary tonight.
- Yeah?

45
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,839
Seven months.

46
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,319
Neither one of us has
ever dated longer.

47
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,759
That's why we're celebrating...

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,399
Look, why don't you slow down

49
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,879
and tell me your
problem, huh? Good.

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,964
Uh, make a left here.

51
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,683
I said... Oh! Easy!

52
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,926
Slow down!

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,805
Slow down!

54
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,601
Shit!

55
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,166
Miss, pull over to
the side, please.

56
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,039
Miss, pull over to
the side, please!

57
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,079
Side.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,925
I can't! There's a cliff!

59
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,639
On my command!

60
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,371
Shit!

61
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,159
Hold your fire,
gentlemen, he's too far!

62
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,130
All right, everybody
in the car! Let's go!

63
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,519
You're under arrest.

64
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,890
You have the right to
remain silent. Ow.

65
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,250
That hurt.

66
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,479
Pull over to the side, please.

67
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,559
Pull over here.

68
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,769
- I can't pull over.
- Stop right here.

69
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
This is absolutely not
my fault, Mr. Kenter.

70
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,359
Oh, I need my license back.

71
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,959
Oh, my God.

72
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,319
What? What?

73
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,404
Stop! Stop!

74
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,282
You'll never drive
in this town again.

75
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,719
Alex?

76
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
Annie.

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,122
What... What happened? What...

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,725
How'd the driving test go?

79
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,929
Oh, it, uh...

80
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,719
Not good. Not good.

81
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,919
Um, why aren't you...

82
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,970
Why... Why aren't you at the beach?

83
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,199
You know, it's funny.
There's this...

84
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,799
Perfectly...

85
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
reasonable explanation...

86
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,839
You're a madman, Shaw!

87
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,759
Nice working with you, as always.

88
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,399
So far, they've recovered
some of the stolen computers

89
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,319
and apprehended one of the suspects

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,079
thanks mainly to SWAT
team member Alex Shaw

91
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,199
who was the officer injured
in today's high-speed chase.

92
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,359
You lied to me.

93
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,599
Annie, I didn't lie about...

94
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,839
You never said that you were
on the suicide squad, ever.

95
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,519
You knew that I was a cop.
I said that I was...

96
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,160
Wait.

97
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,839
Oh, Come on. Ow.

98
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,999
Let me ask you.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,719
When I had conversations with
you and I told you about Jack

100
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,679
and how he was always getting hurt

101
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,279
that I thought that he
was out of his mind

102
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,959
and that I would never date
anybody like that again,

103
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,679
a little bell didn't go off
in your head and say,

104
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,679
"Well, maybe I should tell her
now what I do for a living?"

105
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,128
Exactly. And blow it?

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,799
Well, when did you plan
on telling me this?

107
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,799
- Well, today.
- Oh, today?

108
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,399
Yeah, which is good you're here.

109
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,999
Today was the day...
Mr. Spontaneity.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,719
You know what I pictured
you doing in Venice?

111
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,959
I pictured you...

112
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,879
I don't know, just busting
teenage pickpockets and stuff,

113
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,439
walking old women across the
street, drinking lemonade.

114
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,799
I do fill in for a friend down
at the beach occasionally.

115
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,159
And I often, often enjoy
a nice glass of lemonade.

116
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,679
You know what?
I don't even know you.

117
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,239
I feel I don't even know you.

118
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,599
I don't even know who
you are anymore.

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,729
I don't understand.

120
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,439
We got to spend some time together,
then we'll get to know each other.

121
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,079
Let's go away together.

122
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,919
Okay, where?

123
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,079
The Caribbean.

124
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,199
Oh, The Caribbean.
Do you have a concussion?

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,879
We work 6 days a week, Alex.

126
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,601
We've never even been
away for a weekend.

127
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,170
I was going to surprise
you tonight, but, uh...

128
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,210
It's a cruise.

129
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,839
This is so unfair, Alex.

130
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,319
You can't just pull out
tickets to some exotic island

131
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,359
and think that's going
to make everything okay.

132
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,959
I don't expect that
I can make it all right,

133
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,239
but, uh, you know, maybe
I thought we could.

134
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,599
No. Don't do that.

135
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,079
I want to be depressed right now.

136
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,759
I don't want you to, like, do that.

137
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,799
Don't.

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,770
All right, all right.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,721
- Don't.
- I won't.

140
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,319
Welcome to the <i>Seabourn Legend.</i>

141
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,079
Thank you. Welcome.

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,079
Oh, now, this is a cute couple.

143
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,159
How about a picture?

144
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,079
Don't move! Pictures don't move.

145
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,159
What are your names?

146
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,359
I'm Annie. This is Alex.

147
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,759
Adorable. My name's Dante.

148
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,439
How about a big smile
for the newlyweds?

149
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,999
Oh, actually, we're not newlyweds.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,119
It's only 34.50 for a
double set of mugs

151
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,359
and if you don't like the pictures,

152
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,879
return them for photo
credit on a future cruise.

153
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,011
Welcome to paradise,
and the name's Dante!

154
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,199
This ship has 5 passenger
decks, A, B, C, D, E.

155
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,719
You'll be staying on deck C.

156
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,119
There's a swimming pool, a health
spa, a beauty salon, a casino...

157
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,639
Hey. Excuse me.

158
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,839
Sir?

159
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,599
I'm starting to get a little upset.

160
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,359
My golf clubs...
Have you found them?

161
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,039
Yes. There's absolutely
no reason to be upset.

162
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,719
They're downstairs in storage,
and I'll bring them up

163
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,359
just as soon as I get this
lovely couple to their cabin.

164
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,359
We'll see you later.

165
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,888
- Hi.
- Hi.

166
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,886
These are the coordinates
for the first leg, Captain.

167
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,639
Thank you.

168
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,759
Thruster is in.

169
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,083
All engines on standby.

170
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,759
Well, let's take her out, then.

171
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,483
Welcome to your suite.

172
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,399
Believe me, in 7 days you'll
be sorry to leave room 6088,

173
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,719
your happy and humble home.

174
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,519
Now, if you two need anything
else, anything at all,

175
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,799
you just call Ashton.

176
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,439
And let me thank you both in
advance for the generous gratuity,

177
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,999
I know you'll be leaving me
at the end of this cruise.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,607
- Just kidding.
- But not really.

179
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,329
Oh. And, you two

180
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,047
have a nice honeymoon.

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,479
Oh, we're... We're not...

182
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,484
Not married.

183
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,090
Nope.

184
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,881
Hyah!

185
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,523
Thank you.

186
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,519
- Thank you.
- Big enough for you?

187
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,079
Well, size doesn't matter.
You know that.

188
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,561
Yes!

189
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,959
Why? I mean, all of the sudden,
I have Love Boat fever.

190
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,479
It feels really good.

191
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,039
I'm really, truly excited
about being on a cruise ship.

192
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,879
I don't know why.

193
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,119
Maybe they, like, pump drugs

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,279
through, like, the air conditioning
system or something like that.

195
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,319
What do you think?

196
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,439
Yeah, you know what I need?

197
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,319
I need lots of those
yummy little drinks

198
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,959
with those highly little
impractical umbrellas in them.

199
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,044
That is what I need.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,368
Yeah, you're looking good.

201
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,323
So who's ready to party on
the big boat besides me?

202
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,359
What's the matter?
You look a little tense.

203
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,479
- Tense?
- Yes.

204
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,559
- No.
- No?

205
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,639
We're here to relax.

206
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,679
- Let's get a drink.
- Okay.

207
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,759
- All right.
- Let's go.

208
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,999
We're going to have
a really good time.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,561
Yeah? You think so?

210
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,921
Yeah!

211
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,761
Yeah!

212
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,359
Love it!

213
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,159
Thank you.

214
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,324
See you later. Bye.

215
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,919
So, what do you want to do?

216
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,847
Do you want to shuffleboard
and then room or...

217
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,450
Or room, then shuffleboard?

218
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,010
Room, room.

219
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,759
Uh-huh. Okay.

220
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,239
I mean, of course,
if it's all right

221
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,926
with your new boyfriend
over there...

222
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,879
Romeo.

223
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,719
- Actually, his name's Geiger.
- Oh?

224
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,119
Yes. Yes, we talked.

225
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,719
Doesn't seem very
interested in golf

226
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,599
for someone who had a fit
about his clubs, though.

227
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,479
No? Really? Why do you say that?

228
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,039
Well...

229
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,239
The tournament's on
right behind him.

230
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,529
He hasn't even glanced at the TV.

231
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,839
You're absolutely right.

232
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,399
Honey, I think we need
to go arrest him.

233
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,962
- Excuse me! Excuse...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

234
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,119
Aw, honey, you just wanted a hug.

235
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,919
I just want to give you a hug.

236
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,924
You're so sweet.

237
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,679
Baby, I got to ask you
to do me a favor,

238
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,119
something I've never really
asked you to do before.

239
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,919
What's that?

240
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,999
I need for you to boogie with me.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,559
Oh, no, no, I don't, uh, boogie.

242
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,839
Oh, yes, yes. Just run in place.

243
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,919
Run in place.

244
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,439
Do you feel it? Do you feel it?

245
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,519
Yeah, I think so.

246
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,921
Come on, baby.

247
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,801
Wake up, boys.

248
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,719
See, the misconception
is that fat is bad...

249
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,959
in order to lose fat,
you shouldn't eat fat.

250
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,839
Well, guess what, guys.

251
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,639
False. Your body's
just a giant computer.

252
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,799
Mmm. See, if you don't eat fat,

253
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,199
your body's central
mainframe goes... Whoa!

254
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,279
Whoa!

255
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,959
Better keep whatever fat I've got.

256
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,119
So you see, we at Fatbusters...
Well, we say fat is your friend.

257
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,399
Oh, yeah, a good friend, yeah.

258
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,679
I could use a good friend.

259
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,599
Yeah? Here, meet this guy.

260
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,079
Good.

261
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,164
There you go.

262
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,962
<i>Take my whole life, too</i>

263
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,641
<i>I can't help</i>

264
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,239
<i>Falling in love</i>

265
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,999
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a question.

266
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,119
Who here would like a peek

267
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,081
at a multimillion-dollar
jewelry collection?

268
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,279
Okay. Well, on board

269
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,279
we have the Diamond Jewelers
of America with us tonight.

270
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,599
And they would like to
show you something.

271
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,999
Maybe we should get you
a little something.

272
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,119
I'll take a Camel unfiltered.

273
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,119
Honey, aren't you wearing
that nicotine patch?

274
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,119
The only way that patch is gonna
help me is if I roll it and smoke it.

275
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,851
Good evening.

276
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,442
Diamonds.

277
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,569
Don't bunny-hop.

278
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,079
That's impressive.

279
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,959
I want to learn another language.

280
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,010
Her name is Drew.

281
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,248
She wants to know if
you're my sister.

282
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,161
Oh.

283
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,649
Let her down easy.

284
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,125
She says you're very
beautiful, and...

285
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,851
Our kids will be very beautiful.

286
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,531
Thank you.

287
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,279
Uh, can you picture me as a mom?

288
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,364
I think you're gonna
make a beautiful mother.

289
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,402
Just, uh, don't drive the carpool.

290
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,284
Jeez. Kids... I don't know.

291
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,559
What, kids aren't on the menu?

292
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,079
Kids are on the menu.

293
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,482
It just depends on who's ordering.

294
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,799
- I love it. It's beautiful.
- You're beautiful.

295
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,239
Oh, that'll make a
great picture. Hold on.

296
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,130
Let me get this one.

297
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,842
- Look.
- Look.

298
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,768
So, can I order a la carte?

299
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,599
I don't know if you're sittin'
in my section or not.

300
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,002
I requested this table.

301
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,879
Are you a good tipper?

302
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,439
Hmm. Depends on the service.

303
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,279
Well, it's always service
with a smile for you.

304
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,728
How about at every meal?

305
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,959
Are you being serious right now?

306
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,124
Well...

307
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,684
- Yeah, I...
- Wow.

308
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,439
I mean...

309
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,159
Wow.

310
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,719
I just, you know, the other day...

311
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,319
I just found out that, you know,
I'm dating a daredevil,

312
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,529
so this is like, you know...

313
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,159
Oh, you're not serious.

314
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,040
You're not.

315
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,639
- Hello?
- Annie...

316
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,399
What?

317
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,371
- I'm, uh... I'm a little seasick.
- Huh?

318
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,319
Okay.

319
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,370
Let's go.

320
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,402
- I'll get the main valve!
- Aah!

321
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,409
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

322
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,439
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
You can't be here right now.

323
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,959
- Huh?
- Sir...

324
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
I must be lost.

325
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,679
I saw the lights, thought
this was the casino.

326
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,519
Sir...

327
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,241
Please don't touch those!

328
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,801
Sure could use a drink.

329
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,239
Any of you gambling men?

330
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,079
Sir!

331
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,561
Help the gentleman up, please.

332
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,999
Okay, sir, come on.
Let's get him up.

333
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,279
Sir, may we perhaps assist
you to help find your cabin?

334
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,919
Oh, no. I know where it is.

335
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,719
I... I know when I'm not wanted.

336
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,559
You guys just...

337
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,246
watch where you're going.

338
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,210
We'll do just that.

339
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,279
Good night, sir.

340
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,728
Listen, let's get you
back to your room.

341
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,966
Good night.

342
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,439
<i>Satellite looks good, sir.</i>

343
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,446
We should have smooth sailing
for the rest of the night.

344
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
Okay, switch us back to autopilot.

345
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,239
<i>Switching over now, sir.</i>

346
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,119
That's right. Switch us over.

347
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,045
<i>You never let me have any fun.</i>

348
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,359
<i>No fun? You have all
the fun in the world.</i>

349
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,279
<i>We have fun together, don't we?</i>

350
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,359
<i>Whenever you want something,
I buy it for you automatically.</i>

351
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,799
<i>I take you to concerts,
to museums, to movies.</i>

352
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,999
<i>I do all the housework.</i>

353
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,999
<i>Who does the tidying up? I do.</i>

354
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,004
<i>Who does the cooking? I do.</i>

355
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,479
<i>You and I, we have lots of fun.</i>

356
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,484
<i>Don't we, Lolita?</i>

357
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,490
<i>Come here.</i>

358
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,648
Time for group therapy, boys.

359
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,169
I wouldn't trade you for all
the doctors in the world.

360
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,241
Mmm...

361
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,048
You take care of me,

362
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,888
I'll take care of the ship.

363
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,887
Mmm...

364
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,924
Alex?

365
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,809
Annie, Annie.

366
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,559
Hey, I've been looking all
over the ship for you.

367
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,043
Well, maybe you should have
looked in bed, where you left me.

368
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,959
Well, you looked so
beautiful, I didn't, uh...

369
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,079
Want to wake you up.

370
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,239
Yeah, beautiful woman
in bed, naked...

371
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,999
You had to leave. I get that.

372
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,401
So where were you?

373
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,919
- Skeet shooting.
- Skeet shooting?

374
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,239
You went skeet shooting,
but you couldn't...

375
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,319
Ah. Is that our song?

376
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,919
take one day not to go shooting...

377
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,639
- I wish they'd play that over and over again.
- One day?

378
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,839
I need a little fresh air.

379
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,279
After an evening which is tied

380
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,879
as one of the most
embarrassing of my adult life.

381
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,159
If you want me to be honest,

382
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,722
I kind of like the fact
that you got sick.

383
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,479
Well...

384
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,559
Don't quite know how
to respond to that.

385
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,359
Well, all I'm saying
is that I just like

386
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,569
taking care of you, that's all.

387
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,759
And what I said...

388
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,919
When you were joking
about that kid thing...

389
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,439
'Cause for a second, I had thought
you were completely serious.

390
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,605
I thought you were actually
gonna ask, you know...

391
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,999
And last night, when you
were basically blacked out,

392
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,479
I was like, he's a cop, and...

393
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,559
You don't even know his cop number.

394
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,928
My badge number?

395
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,439
Badge number, see? Badge number.

396
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,799
I don't even know what it's called.

397
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,079
Well, what does my badge number
have to do with anything?

398
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,559
Well, the point is is
that if you look at it...

399
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,039
I mean, we basically don't
even know each other.

400
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,204
And...

401
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,041
Um...

402
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,802
To get that serious and...

403
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,331
To make that kind of
commitment, I mean...

404
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,399
It's probably the last thing that
we both need right now, right?

405
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,325
Yeah.

406
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,279
<i>Attention.</i>

407
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,079
<i>If you would like to
reserve water skis,</i>

408
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,679
<i>paddle boats, jet skis,
or wave runners for use</i>

409
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,879
<i>while we're docked at one
of our upcoming ports...</i>

410
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,284
Did you get the feeling that we were
really underdressed last night?

411
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,119
What's this?

412
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,119
Excuse me.

413
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,239
I do believe I had the "do not
disturb" sign on the door.

414
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,359
No, actually, it was
"Make up room, please."

415
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,879
Maybe you flipped the card.

416
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,567
Maybe I flipped the card.

417
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,479
Let's not split hairs.

418
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,799
Captain on the bridge.

419
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,439
What's wrong, Merced?

420
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,119
I'm late for my guests.

421
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,999
Uh, yeah, I can't explain it, sir.

422
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,279
We're 4 degrees off course.

423
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,159
Well, switch us back
to manual, then.

424
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,370
We tried, sir. The
autopilot won't go down.

425
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,359
Well, try again.

426
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,159
I did. I sent an engineer
to check the mainframe.

427
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,359
It's all normal.

428
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,759
I did. I sent Eric to run
a mainframe diagnostic.

429
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,999
<i>Everything seems normal.</i>

430
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,399
Human error.

431
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,484
Must be human error.

432
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,879
Keep an eye on it.

433
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,566
Yes, sir.

434
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,839
<i>Every move you make...</i>

435
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,439
<i>Every vow you break</i>

436
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,799
<i>Every step you take</i>

437
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,727
<i>I'll be watching you</i>

438
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,039
They were out of size 10s.

439
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,199
You know, I told them size
didn't matter, but, uh...

440
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,125
They wouldn't give them to me.

441
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,999
One more thing.

442
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,640
What?

443
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,961
I'd like to boogie with you.

444
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,879
We're still 4 degrees off course.

445
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,362
Did you check the mainframe, Eric?

446
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,879
Captain Pollard, good evening.

447
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,399
How can you be running the ship
if you're not on the bridge?

448
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,723
Who is running the ship?

449
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,319
Oh, yeah. I am.

450
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,199
What is this? Who are you?

451
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,399
I spent a great many years developing
computer systems for these cruise lines,

452
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,719
including this baby.

453
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,849
And then I got pushed away!

454
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,799
What are you talking about?

455
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,199
That's what really infuriates me.

456
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,119
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

457
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,799
How dare you!

458
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,439
Traditionally speaking,

459
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,650
isn't it true that the captain
goes down with the ship?

460
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,479
I got one more.
Here, stand right here.

461
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,559
Oh, okay.

462
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,959
- This is good.
- Okay.

463
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,759
Captain, sweetheart,
would you mind taking a picture

464
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,679
with my sister and me?

465
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,719
No. Not at all.

466
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,999
Get in the middle.

467
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,686
Right here. Okay.

468
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,679
Say Dallas.

469
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,119
Dallas. Ooh!

470
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,879
Nice tropical shower.

471
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,409
Weather's gonna be
beautiful tonight, ladies.

472
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,003
Good evening.

473
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,639
No, I'm sorry.

474
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,479
Without a jacket, that
dress is not appropriate.

475
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,879
Daddy's right.

476
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,679
I like this dress and it's fine.

477
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,923
No, no, no.

478
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,399
You look like a clown.

479
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,245
No, I don't.

480
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,839
Well, she's fine.

481
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,765
Let her go.

482
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,603
She'll be back.

483
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,326
Ready...

484
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,721
Now.

485
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,365
What the hell is going on?

486
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,770
I don't know, sir.

487
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,651
Where's the chief engineer?

488
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,651
<i>Let me take you, yeah</i>

489
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,279
<i>To that place</i>

490
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,719
<i>You never been before</i>

491
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,759
<i>Open the door to a dream</i>

492
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,766
This almost seems too
perfect, doesn't it?

493
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,799
Want me to step on your feet?

494
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,679
- You already did.
- Oh.

495
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,730
I meant again.

496
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,450
Jesus Christ.

497
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,799
<i>Make it</i>

498
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,319
<i>So beautiful</i>

499
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,319
<i>Hold me close</i>

500
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,719
<i>And don't let go</i>

501
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,559
You know, I left you alone
this morning because

502
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,479
I needed to be alone to think.

503
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,839
Yeah.

504
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,319
See, the one thing that's got me
through everything in my life,

505
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,562
the one thing I could always
trust has been my instinct,

506
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,687
which has never been more
certain than it is right now.

507
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,799
Really?

508
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,725
Yeah.

509
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,079
What are you saying?

510
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,324
What I'm saying is, uh...

511
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,479
I think that we should...

512
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,399
Oh, man, no. No, no, no, no.

513
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,121
Come on, keep dancing.
Keep dancing. Come on.

514
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,723
Hold up. Hold on.

515
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,446
Jesus Christ!
The main pumps are off!

516
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,451
- I'm trying to raise it!
- She ain't pumping out!

517
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,519
Shut down engines 3 and 4!

518
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,285
Get out of here!

519
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,279
Sir!

520
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,719
Look, I'm telling you,
they're not gonna hold.

521
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,839
Sir.

522
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,925
- Find the captain, will you?
- Yes, sir.

523
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,159
Harvey, it's an earthquake!

524
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,244
It can't be! We're at sea!

525
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,839
I don't believe this.

526
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,279
Watch out!

527
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,170
- Watch it!
- Look out!

528
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,239
No!

529
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,159
This is my vacation! Damn it!

530
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,919
I had nothing to do with this.

531
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,799
Shut down engine 3A!

532
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,406
It's not working!

533
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,639
It's all right, it's all right.

534
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,879
It's over. It's over.

535
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,959
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Liza, your cruise director.

536
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,399
Uh, this is only a minor incident.

537
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,439
Everything will be back to
normal in a few moments.

538
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,319
Why do I really not
believe her right now?

539
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,159
Turbine malfunction,
structural trauma...

540
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,759
Take a look at these monitors.

541
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,561
We're losing power
all over the ship.

542
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,079
I want all emergency
teams in position.

543
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,679
Get the coast guard on the line.

544
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,279
I don't care!

545
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,439
Where the hell is engine control?

546
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,719
It's dead.

547
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,759
- Try the low frequencies.
- The signal's gone.

548
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,519
We've got nothing.

549
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,479
Engine 3A is down, sir.
Can we do anything?

550
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,359
Yeah, look, try and run a
link to the engine room.

551
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,399
Joe, issue hand-held
radios to all the crew.

552
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,999
And please, somebody
find the captain!

553
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,679
- Keep trying.
- The system's not responding.

554
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,759
Yes?

555
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,571
<i>Mr. Juliano.</i>

556
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,003
It looks like the <i>Seabourn
Legend</i> isn't faring too well.

557
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,039
I advise you to start the
evacuation procedure.

558
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,726
Who is this?

559
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,239
Someone you should
start listening to.

560
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,519
I want you to sound the
alarm immediately.

561
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,759
Time is running out.

562
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,359
I can't authorize an evacuation.

563
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,719
The captain is the only
one who can do that.

564
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,726
The captain is dead, Mr. Juliano...

565
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,807
<i>which means you are now responsible
for the people on this ship.</i>

566
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,119
<i>Don't waste time trying to radio the
coast guard or code in an S.O.S.</i>

567
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,039
<i>I've cut off all
outside communication.</i>

568
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,079
You don't understand, maritime
regulations state that in the event...

569
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,079
<i>Mr. Juliano, you are in
command of this vessel.</i>

570
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,719
<i>The authority is yours.</i>

571
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,726
I'll make it easy on
you, Mr. Juliano.

572
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,050
I'd like you to look at the
emergency fire display.

573
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,919
<i>Look at the port side,</i>

574
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,529
<i>"C" deck, section 686
on your display.</i>

575
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,609
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

576
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,491
My God.

577
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,525
Oops.

578
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,639
See what you made me do?

579
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,879
Okay, just wait a minute.
Just wait one minute. Please.

580
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,599
<i>And now the forward
section on the "A" deck</i>

581
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,970
<i>of both sides of the bow thrusters.</i>

582
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,439
<i>Also look at "D" deck
sections 187 and 188.</i>

583
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,559
Sir?

584
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,719
<i>All the fires are contained by
fire doors, which I control</i>

585
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,119
and will open if necessary.

586
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,239
I've positioned charges
throughout the ship

587
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,799
and will set them off
without hesitation.

588
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,443
Sir, I think you should
push the button.

589
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,279
Look, how am I supposed to abandon
the ship while it's moving?

590
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,999
<i>The ship will stop in
exactly 3 minutes.</i>

591
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,324
I give you 15 minutes to evacuate.

592
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,448
Now sound the alarm...

593
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,410
Or I'll burn her down.

594
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,849
Sir, I really think you
should push the button.

595
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,919
<i>Attention. Attention, please.</i>

596
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,199
<i>This is the first officer.</i>

597
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,959
<i>All passengers and crew
proceed to the master deck.</i>

598
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,479
<i>The Seabourn Legend is to
be immediately evacuated.</i>

599
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,199
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

600
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,999
<i>I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

601
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,759
Abandon ship for this?

602
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,279
Does that make any sense?
That doesn't make any sense.

603
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,159
Let's go. Come on.

604
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,999
Everybody through the rear door!

605
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,959
- We've got to find Drew.
- We'll find her, sweetheart.

606
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,601
- She can't hear this!
- I know. We'll find her.

607
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,559
No. No, Frank.

608
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,959
No, I have a feeling about this.

609
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,039
Come on.

610
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,399
<i>Outside to the master deck.</i>

611
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,919
Let's go. Follow me.

612
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,129
Yes, please keep moving.

613
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,119
- Sulfur.
- What?

614
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,239
You smell that? Sulfur.

615
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,319
What do you mean there's sulfur?

616
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,599
Sulfur out of that vent.

617
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,002
I swear I am never
leaving the house again.

618
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,171
<i>Calmly go immediately to
the lifeboat stations.</i>

619
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,920
<i>All hands evacuate.</i>

620
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,079
<i>Engineers and electricians,
abandon your posts</i>

621
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,086
<i>and assist passengers at
your lifeboat assignment.</i>

622
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,999
This way, ladies and gentlemen!

623
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,687
Please hurry! Please hurry!

624
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,399
Everybody, hang on!

625
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,211
Go!

626
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,319
Hey, no!

627
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,519
- No! The doors!
- Let me out!

628
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,127
- This door won't open!
- Let me in there!

629
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,051
Come on.

630
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,439
This way. Quickly.

631
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,639
Ask him, Rupert, ask him!

632
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,439
Look, I've got to speak
to someone in charge!

633
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,759
He's loading the lifeboats.

634
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,919
You're gonna miss them
if we don't hurry.

635
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,088
Mom!

636
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,926
Ugh! Oh!

637
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,479
Oh, God.

638
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,879
Push away from the ship!

639
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,959
You know what? I wanna
chase something down.

640
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,279
What are you doing?

641
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,919
- It seems odd.
- Yes, it is odd.

642
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,799
They're abandoning ship
in the middle of night.

643
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,359
I'll be right back. I promise you.
Go. Follow the crew.

644
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,719
No. Alex!

645
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,283
- Follow the crew. I'll be right back.
- No! Jeez.

646
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,239
Watch your step, ma'am.

647
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,608
Please, please stay seated.

648
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,251
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

649
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,279
Huh?

650
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,523
Christ. He's locked us out.

651
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,879
Sir, get yourself to a lifeboat!

652
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,039
Take it easy, man. I'm L.A.P.D.

653
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,719
What? You're what?

654
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,519
What is that?

655
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,321
Have any of these fires
at all been confirmed?

656
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,039
We're loading the lifeboats, sir.

657
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,399
Do you need more
confirmation than that?

658
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,086
Yeah.

659
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,039
Last boat! Everybody
goes right now!

660
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,799
Everybody, into the boat!

661
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,279
That way, folks! Quickly!

662
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,648
- Come on, come on.
- Drew.

663
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,679
Help us, somebody!

664
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,119
Drew wasn't in the room.

665
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,719
Celeste, we have looked everywhere!

666
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,519
You guys, she's probably
on another lifeboat.

667
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,919
But we can't leave without her!

668
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,039
Come on.

669
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,159
I'm sure she's fine.

670
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,279
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

671
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,559
Celeste, there isn't time.

672
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,999
Drew's gotten on another boat.

673
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,606
Now, please...

674
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,919
Who's the officer?

675
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,759
I wanna see my sister!

676
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,286
Go, go, go, go!

677
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,959
Alex, come on! It's the last boat!

678
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,559
Come on, sir, we gotta move!

679
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,359
Move it! Quickly!

680
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,799
Did you find Drew?

681
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,959
She's not on the boat.

682
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,119
Did someone run a count?

683
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,239
She's probably on
another boat, sir.

684
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,519
Now, just get on, okay?

685
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,519
Look, about these fires.
Something's strange.

686
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,959
Your board's all lit up,

687
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,159
this is definitely a sulfur-based
smoke, which makes no sense.

688
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,439
Alex, come on.

689
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,159
I can only lower the boat
when the ship isn't moving.

690
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,359
Now, look, I've got no time left,

691
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,001
and I don't know what
this guy is capable of!

692
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,927
What guy?

693
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,690
We're on our way.

694
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,645
Oh, my God! The boat is moving!

695
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,129
What is happening?

696
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,279
Annie, jump!

697
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,399
We have to bring it back up!

698
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,926
Hold on to the rails!

699
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,879
Ensign, what's going on?

700
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,930
The winch must be jammed!

701
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,719
You gotta stop the ship!

702
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,090
I don't have any control!
Now get out of the way!

703
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,159
What... What...

704
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,639
What... What are you doing?

705
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,079
That cable will never hold,
and we've got to get them out.

706
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,881
What do you mean "we," Alex?

707
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,650
You got it?

708
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,005
Be careful.

709
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,006
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

710
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,401
Oh...

711
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,399
What the hell is he doing?

712
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,007
He said he'd be right back!

713
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,919
We better get that end back up!

714
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,005
If it hits the water on
that angle, it'll collapse!

715
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,719
Don't move!

716
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,999
Please!

717
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,039
Please pull us up!

718
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,479
We're trying.

719
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,839
Just stay calm and keep
the weight balanced.

720
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,368
We'll bring you up one by one.

721
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,879
She's still there!

722
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,999
I know she's still on the ship!

723
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,639
Celeste, where are you going?

724
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,359
No, no, no! Don't climb out!

725
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,519
Don't move!

726
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,285
It'll fall!

727
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,921
Oh!

728
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,079
Throw me a rope!
I need to attach a line!

729
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,369
Sweetheart, it's not your fault.

730
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,079
Okay.

731
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,759
Here. Okay.

732
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,479
Watch out!

733
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,679
Now, get the rope! Grab the rope!

734
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,439
I'll get it!

735
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,205
Careful!

736
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,159
I got the rope!

737
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,239
Tie it up to the hull!

738
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,239
Pull the slack!

739
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,519
Be careful!

740
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,251
Okay!

741
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,444
Hold on! Pull them up!

742
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,439
Help!

743
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,889
Alex! Alex! Dante!

744
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,520
Help! Help!

745
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,326
Help! Help!

746
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,122
Help! Help!

747
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,319
Come on.

748
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,559
- Pull me up, please! Pull!
- Alex!

749
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,319
God. Yes, you are nuts.

750
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,639
Come on. Pull me up.

751
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,168
- I got you.
- Please pull!

752
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,239
Get another line! Quickly!
Get another line!

753
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,931
There has to be something else!

754
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,411
The gangplank! Get the gangplank!

755
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,439
Alex. Alex.

756
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,683
Alex.

757
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,246
Hi, uh, get everybody
on here if you can.

758
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,600
Okay.

759
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,439
Okay. Thanks, man.

760
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,479
Thank you.

761
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,799
Okay, thanks.

762
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,406
Okay.

763
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,279
Thank you.

764
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,250
That's the last one, sir.

765
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,399
Sir, it's Merced.

766
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,799
Yes?

767
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,679
<i>We have a situation on the bridge.</i>

768
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,003
I bet we do!

769
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,639
Keep everybody together, Rudy.

770
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,159
I'll be on the bridge.

771
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,608
Stay with the passengers.

772
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,919
It's the radar.

773
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,810
At first I thought this was a heavy
fog bank, but it's not moving.

774
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,929
Saint Martin.

775
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,439
Well, there is a harbor
on Saint Martin.

776
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,399
He must be stopping
us on the island.

777
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,040
What's the heading?

778
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,319
It is full at southeast 165.

779
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,999
You think that's where
he's taking us?

780
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,084
You think that's the harbor?

781
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,329
He's taking us to the cliffs
right next to the harbor.

782
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,879
He's gonna slam us into a wall.

783
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,359
How long before we hit?

784
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,079
Sir, get back with the
other passengers.

785
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,479
How much time do we got?

786
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,919
I'm the first officer on this
ship, okay, and you're...

787
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,279
Now, look, you've lost
control of autopilot,

788
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,799
so there's got to be a hardwire
link to the engine control.

789
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,919
Yes, that's exactly right, sir.

790
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,559
But he's running the whole thing by
remote and there's nothing you can do.

791
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,199
There's gotta be a transmitter.

792
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,039
We gotta find the transmitter.

793
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,279
A transmitter? So how's he
transmitting the fires?

794
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,599
The fires don't exist.
They're not real.

795
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,559
Smoke canisters. Stun grenades.

796
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,159
Probably put them in the air ducts.

797
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,479
They're small.

798
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,199
They roll...

799
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,599
Like...

800
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,331
These.

801
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,519
Golf balls.

802
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,763
Golf balls, golf balls.

803
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,799
Geiger. Let's go get him right now.

804
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,439
Get his cabin number.
We'll get him. I'll get him.

805
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,479
We're locked out.

806
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,599
Where are the skeet guns?

807
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,525
Right here.

808
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,811
Why's everyone trying to kill me?

809
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,359
- What happened? Are you okay?
- Ow. Ow.

810
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,250
Stay down, stay down. You're okay.

811
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,725
I can't override it. He's
changed all the access codes.

812
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,439
We have a very sick boy.

813
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,519
<i>Exactly.</i>

814
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,561
<i>Do you think I'd be doing this
if I still had my health?</i>

815
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,679
It ends now.

816
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,411
I know who you are.

817
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,359
I know you, too.

818
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,359
You look a little wet.

819
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,199
You see, Alex...

820
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,319
I designed this whole
autopilot system.

821
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,879
My company sold it off to almost
every shipping line in the world,

822
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,009
but when I got sick, they fired me.

823
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,079
I had no defense. They
just threw me away.

824
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,559
But now, I have a more
aggressive defense system.

825
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,849
Tell me, Alex,

826
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,202
did you ever have a false
sense of security?

827
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,559
Everybody, to the deck!

828
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,291
Go! Go! Go!

829
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,439
Nothing's secure, Alex.

830
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,759
That was odd.

831
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,559
What, you call that odd?
What kind of cop are you?

832
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,919
You're gonna get us all killed!

833
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,049
No, that's his plan.

834
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,799
Where's engine control?

835
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,319
What? Engine control?

836
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,919
We're gonna stop the ship,
then we're gonna get him.

837
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,519
I want you on the upper deck
with the other passengers!

838
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,799
Fine! I'll find it on my own!

839
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,919
Merced, go with him!

840
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,439
Sir, he's highly irrational.

841
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,919
You're an officer on this ship.

842
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,846
Now, make sure he
doesn't touch a thing!

843
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,959
Ashton, you okay? Come on, get up.

844
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,159
- Keep it moving.
- Annie.

845
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,439
- Yeah?
- They won't organize a search,

846
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,239
but I know Drew didn't get away.

847
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,679
- They'll find her.
- She's got to be here somewhere!

848
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,799
- They'll find her.
- Just keep it moving.

849
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,079
This way!

850
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,403
Hello, miss. This way.

851
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,919
Dante, stop it. Do you hear that?

852
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,039
- Listen.
- Yeah,

853
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,159
I hear something coming
from down there.

854
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,369
Where? Show me. Come on.

855
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,159
Harder!

856
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,801
Can anybody hear? Hello!

857
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,599
Alejandro, I don't like this.
I really don't like this.

858
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,048
It's coming from
down here somewhere.

859
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,726
Anyone!

860
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,131
Hello!

861
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,959
Is anybody in there?

862
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,519
Yes!

863
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,331
Yes, we're trapped!

864
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,845
Get us the hell out of here!

865
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,919
We're trying! Is there a
little girl in there? Drew?

866
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,359
No, there is no little girl inside!
Just big women!

867
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,639
Excuse me!

868
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,479
I mean, normal-sized women!
Come on, get us out of here, will ya?

869
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,879
Oh, my God, there's smoke
coming out of the vent!

870
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,359
Everybody get back!

871
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,319
It's coming out everywhere!

872
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,399
Ow! We're trying.

873
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,359
Try to block the vent!

874
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,921
Don't worry. We'll get you out!

875
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,799
What the hell are you doing?

876
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,039
They told us to block the vents.

877
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,519
She's right.

878
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,879
I'll help you, lady.

879
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,999
This smoke's gonna kill us all.

880
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,879
Everybody just hang on!
We'll get you out in a second!

881
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,439
Help me, Harvey!

882
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,559
I'm trying to save your life!

883
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,039
Just hang on!

884
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,930
Okay. What is this?

885
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,599
Try that.

886
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,879
This won't work.

887
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,487
Just try it anyway.
I'll find something else.

888
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,759
I told you this won't work!

889
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,679
Oh, my God. It's coming out everywhere.
Harv, give me your pants!

890
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,039
My pants? No one else is
taking off their pants.

891
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,279
I took off mine.

892
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,319
I wanna know why she hasn't
taken anything off yet!

893
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,610
'Cause I'm not wearing
any underwear, Harvey.

894
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,599
Oh.

895
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,879
I can't breathe.

896
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,719
Come on, hurry up!

897
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,565
Come on!

898
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,445
What do we have?

899
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,481
Yeah, this'll do.

900
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,330
This will do.

901
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,279
Did you try to close the fuel
tanks manually, cut the power?

902
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,127
Yeah, but he's sealed off all
access to engine room 4.

903
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,039
Which of these controls
the autopilot?

904
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,559
I don't know.

905
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,039
Look, I'm the navigator. I'm not
familiar with this equipment.

906
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,519
Oh, you're not familiar?

907
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,206
I see.

908
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,759
Are you...

909
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,605
Familiar with this?

910
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,959
Sir, this is Merced
in engine control!

911
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,759
He's smashing up all the equipment!
Do you copy?

912
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,599
Which of these is not
hooked up to the computer?

913
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,119
Look, there's plenty not
hooked up to the computer

914
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,839
but nothing that
overrides his program.

915
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,119
Then we have to fool his program.

916
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,479
We cannot stop the ship.

917
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,279
I wanna slow it down.

918
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,759
What you gonna do?

919
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,279
You gonna let the air
out of our tires?

920
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,479
What are these buttons?
What are these switches?

921
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,599
Don't you touch them!

922
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,079
They open the ballast doors!

923
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,005
You wanna flood the ship?

924
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,159
Sir, this is Merced!
Does anybody copy?

925
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,039
Hello? Somebody answer me!

926
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,479
We're gonna flood the
ship just like you said.

927
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,399
What are you talking about?

928
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,999
Might slow her down.

929
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,919
Right, now, you shut up!
You shut your mouth!

930
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,399
I never said that!

931
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,531
If we take on too much
water, we'll all go down.

932
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,446
Sir! Somebody answer me! Lis...

933
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,611
Flood it.

934
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,599
It's not working!

935
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,081
Will you hurry up?

936
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,519
Wait. Dante, I think
I've got something.

937
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,679
Whoa!

938
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,319
Everybody, back off!

939
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,959
Hurry up! Hurry up!

940
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,239
Yeah, we found the key.

941
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,766
- What?
- What?

942
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,799
All right. Okay, okay.

943
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,999
Kick. Can you kick it?

944
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,639
Look out!

945
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,090
Can you get out?

946
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,359
Can you guys get out?

947
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,999
If you'll back off with the saw.

948
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,079
What?

949
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,599
If you'll back off with the
saw, we'll give it a try!

950
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,759
Oh, sorry!

951
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,003
Sorry. Sorry.

952
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,519
How much longer?

953
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,439
Look, I've never let a million
gallons of water into a ship before.

954
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,285
Give me a second.

955
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,163
I've got 3 watertight
doors to close,

956
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,684
and I've got to shut off
these sensors as well.

957
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,759
Where's this?

958
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,959
That's the ballast room.

959
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,759
That's right underneath us.

960
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,446
That's what we're flooding.

961
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,519
All right, watertight
doors are closed.

962
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,729
Ballast doors should
open any minute.

963
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,879
Shit!

964
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,519
Close it! Close it! Close it!

965
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,366
You just told me to open them!

966
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,365
Follow me.

967
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,844
I can't close it just like that.

968
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,720
Don't let go of me!

969
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,363
Hold on!

970
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,806
I'll hold on.

971
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,159
You okay?

972
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,925
You're gonna be fine.

973
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,641
Huh?

974
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,279
In case anything happens...

975
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,799
to us,

976
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,248
you want me to know that...

977
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,639
You... You...

978
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,644
Love me...

979
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,249
And that you're gonna
be 15 next month.

980
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,409
Relationships based on extreme
circumstances, they rarely work out.

981
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,239
This way, everybody!

982
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,239
What's going on? Why has
the evacuation stopped?

983
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,119
Stopped? When did it start?

984
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,519
Are we sinking?
Are we gonna die here?

985
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,479
The important thing is for
everybody just to stay calm.

986
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,639
You don't even work on this ship!

987
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,039
I've been in worse
situations than this,

988
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,559
and panicking does
not help. Trust me.

989
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,279
We have our life vests.
We can jump off the ship.

990
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,719
You'd get sucked into the propellers.
I wouldn't recommend it.

991
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,805
Oh, God, that would suck.

992
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,639
Alex.

993
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,439
Oh, my God. Drew.

994
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,921
Where you been, huh?

995
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,639
Is she okay?

996
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,479
We'll find your mom.

997
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,769
- She all right?
- Yeah.

998
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,759
Come on, sweetheart.

999
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,839
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1000
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,159
What's happening?

1001
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,839
Why did the ship start up again?

1002
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,163
Why... Why... Why did
you leave me upstairs?

1003
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,839
We have a situation.

1004
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,119
I know we have a situation.
What? What?

1005
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,959
Geiger's taken over the ship.

1006
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,879
Geiger. I'm-not-looking-
at-my-golf-game Geiger?

1007
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,679
No, Geiger... "I'm a
computer psycho..."

1008
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,479
Geiger... "I designed
all the software..."

1009
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,039
And Geiger... "I can
blow up everything."

1010
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,999
Why would he do that? I don't know.

1011
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,086
- Where is he?
- He's everywhere. Come up here.

1012
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,959
That's him.

1013
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,359
What?

1014
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,799
Look, you go up to the
top deck with everyone.

1015
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,359
You stay. You stay, and you wait.

1016
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,445
Hey, you don't have
to save this ship.

1017
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,041
Oh...

1018
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,359
Freeze!

1019
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,519
Drop the weapon.

1020
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,519
Don't shoot.

1021
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,279
It's not a gun,
it's just a computer.

1022
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,759
Drop it, asshole.

1023
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,719
Where's your friend Annie?

1024
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,239
She's cute.

1025
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,120
It would be a shame if
anything happened to her.

1026
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,645
Hit the floor now!

1027
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,168
I was just trying to
make conversation.

1028
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,201
I'm putting it down now,

1029
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,886
real slow.

1030
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,639
<i>The irony of my situation, Alex</i>

1031
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,879
<i>is that dedication to job and
devotion to the company...</i>

1032
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,647
<i>was repaid with a terminal illness.</i>

1033
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,879
<i>You see, computers generate
electromagnetic fields, which over time</i>

1034
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,090
<i>can cause severe copper poisoning.</i>

1035
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,519
<i>I'm a smart guy, Alex and
even I didn't know that.</i>

1036
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,839
<i>I would have really appreciated
some understanding</i>

1037
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,719
<i>from upper management,
if you know what I mean.</i>

1038
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,279
Okay, is everybody okay?

1039
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,519
We're fine.

1040
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,490
<i>But, no. They dropped me.</i>

1041
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,443
<i>They treated me like
I never existed.</i>

1042
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,079
- Where are you going?
- I'll go find him.

1043
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,639
Hang on. Wait!

1044
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,771
<i>Now, I'm just gonna
do whatever I can...</i>

1045
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,559
<i>To get whatever I can get.</i>

1046
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,999
<i>You're not gonna stop me.</i>

1047
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,529
<i>This time it's good-bye
for good, Alex.</i>

1048
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,651
How you gonna stop
me now, my friend?

1049
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,650
Damn it.

1050
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,490
Shit.

1051
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,127
<i>I feel the earth move</i>

1052
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,439
Oh, wait a minute.

1053
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,599
Wait a minute.

1054
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,399
I've heard that music before.

1055
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,399
Yeah, it's the music they
pipe in all over the ship.

1056
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,799
No, no, no. I've heard
this music before.

1057
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,487
Uh, ship-shopping music.
He's in the mall.

1058
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,479
There's a fire in there.

1059
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,519
Well, don't worry.

1060
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,729
The flames won't get
past the fire doors.

1061
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,599
Alex.

1062
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,679
Alex, Alex.

1063
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,208
- Don't touch that!
- Okay.

1064
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,719
I need a... I need a...

1065
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,079
I need my saw. I need my saw.

1066
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,719
Shit! Alex!

1067
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,159
Alex! Oh, God.

1068
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,719
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch anything!

1069
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,159
I know where to release
the fire doors.

1070
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,999
Don't open the door.
Don't. It's a trap.

1071
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,279
There's something in the door.

1072
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,479
Baby, we can't get in to you.
There's something in the door.

1073
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,399
Calm down. What does it look like?

1074
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,999
Wait. What does it look like?

1075
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,519
Okay, it's green...

1076
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,519
Like a spray deodorant can.

1077
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,639
I don't know. Can't think.

1078
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,679
Okay. It's a grenade.

1079
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,799
What?

1080
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,879
There's a number on it. There
should be a number on it.

1081
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,119
Uh, okay, yeah.

1082
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,839
It's L-1619...

1083
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,039
Magnum.

1084
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,679
- Is the pin out?
- What?

1085
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,359
- Is the pin out?
- No, the pin's still in,

1086
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,199
- but it's attached to a wire.
- Yeah.

1087
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,719
You're gonna have to tie
the spoon to the grenade.

1088
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,199
- Spoon? What?
- With a string.

1089
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,479
Oh, baby, don't say grenade.

1090
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,881
Okay. A string.

1091
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,679
Your shoelace!

1092
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,319
Come on.

1093
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,759
I got it.

1094
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,879
That's it.

1095
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,039
Okay, all right.

1096
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,079
Okay.

1097
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,881
Okay, be real careful.

1098
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,839
All right. Here it goes. Uh...

1099
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,359
You gotta hurry up.

1100
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,807
Okay, Okay.

1101
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,519
Got it. Got it.

1102
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,079
Got it. What now?

1103
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,643
Pull the pin out and
remove the grenade.

1104
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,291
Uh... Uh...

1105
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,999
You pull out the pin, and
I will pull out the grenade.

1106
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,164
- Okay.
- On the count of three. One...

1107
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,199
Two...

1108
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,726
Three.

1109
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,759
Where is it? Where is it?

1110
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,879
Where is it?

1111
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,359
It's in your hand.

1112
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,639
Where? Take it out. Take it out!

1113
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,159
Take it out. Take it out.
Got it? Take it.

1114
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,479
- I got it.
- Okay, got it?

1115
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,042
- Yeah.
- Alex!

1116
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,319
You can open the door now.

1117
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,768
Okay.

1118
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,565
No.

1119
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,639
Here's some more dry towels.

1120
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,565
Thank you.

1121
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,199
I am so sorry I yelled at you.

1122
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,919
That's Okay, Dad.

1123
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,163
I'm okay.

1124
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,130
Okay.

1125
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,159
Where's Alex?

1126
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,085
"Where's Alex?"

1127
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,410
Come over here.

1128
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,279
- Just sit down. Don't talk. Don't move.
- I'm okay.

1129
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,679
You're not okay. Stop saying that.

1130
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,366
All right?

1131
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,610
Are you okay?

1132
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,359
I don't think so.

1133
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,285
What?

1134
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,079
He's adjusting starboard.

1135
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,439
What does that mean?

1136
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,039
Does that mean right, left, around the
island, what? What does that mean?

1137
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,919
No. Right into the island.

1138
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,399
We're moving again.

1139
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,879
He's turning us 1/2
a degree starboard.

1140
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,559
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, guys.

1141
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,246
We're getting closer.

1142
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,799
Okay. I'm cutting the
serial port connection.

1143
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,123
- Anything?
- Uh...

1144
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,010
No, we're still locked out.

1145
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,084
Come on.

1146
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,559
Hey, we're moving.

1147
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,079
We have control again.

1148
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,399
No, we're still dead here.

1149
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,239
Are you sure, sir,
because we're turning.

1150
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,279
It's him.

1151
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,959
It's him, it's him, it's him.

1152
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,399
He's on board.
Geiger's still on board.

1153
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,802
Hey, guys. Guys, maybe
these people can help.

1154
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,719
Hand me those.

1155
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,088
Right there.

1156
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,968
He's taking us right
into an oil tanker.

1157
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,879
What?

1158
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,199
You're right.

1159
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:13,399
She's anchored 16 miles out,
and we are doing 17.8 knots.

1160
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,919
Well, how long till they move?

1161
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,439
From starting their
engines, 30 minutes.

1162
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,839
There's no chance they're gonna
get out of our way in time.

1163
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,164
So, what... What...
What does that mean?

1164
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,970
Oh, man!

1165
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,808
Uh, he's turning us another 1/4.

1166
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,011
Ah! Damn it.

1167
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,159
Can we turn the ship
without the rudder?

1168
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,239
The bow thrusters would do it.

1169
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,719
We can't get there now.
You guys flooded the access.

1170
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,199
Yeah, well, we also messed
up his program, sir.

1171
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,559
No, you almost sunk us.

1172
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,439
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1173
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,799
Let's take a wrench and
dump it into the engine

1174
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,959
and bust the transmission like
a car 'cause I've done that.

1175
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,319
With all due respect,
this is not your car.

1176
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,199
- This is a cruise liner.
- She's right. It's a propeller.

1177
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,639
We got to stop the propeller.

1178
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,159
You could wedge something
into it underneath the ship,

1179
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,479
like a steel cable.

1180
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,159
This is not my
suggestion, obviously.

1181
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,039
Great idea. I'll go under the ship.

1182
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,159
No, you won't.

1183
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,399
No, you won't. That's
not what I meant.

1184
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,479
That's a stupid idea.

1185
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,679
- No, it's a great idea.
- No.

1186
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,439
It's suicide. These blades
are 12 feet across.

1187
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,490
They'll suck you in and kill you.

1188
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,239
Hey. Hey, Dino, I got one for you.

1189
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,159
Okay, who played the German
captain in <i>The Enemy Below?</i>

1190
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,164
Curt Jurgens.

1191
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,359
Down the next stairwell
on the left,

1192
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,959
straight to the bowels of the ship.

1193
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,488
Bowels. That doesn't
sound very good.

1194
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,559
How much time left?

1195
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,803
Not very much. We better hurry.

1196
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,679
Mayday, Mayday.

1197
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,239
This is <i>Seabourn Legend</i> bearing
80 degrees east-northeast.

1198
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,959
Engine and steering
control nonfunctional.

1199
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,805
I repeat. Nonfunctional.

1200
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,999
Where are we going?

1201
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,199
<i>Eindhoven Lion.</i>

1202
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,279
<i>Eindhoven Lion</i>, come in.

1203
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,759
This is <i>Seabourn Legend.</i>

1204
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,959
<i>Eindhoven Lion</i>, come in.

1205
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,759
<i>Eindhoven Lion</i>, this
is <i>Seabourn Legend.</i>

1206
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,481
Come in, <i>Eindhoven Lion.</i>

1207
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,769
This is the only way out.

1208
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,482
- This all the diving gear?
- Yeah.

1209
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,724
Okay, here it goes.

1210
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,608
Huh?

1211
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,523
- You think that ship's gonna rescue us?
- What else could it be?

1212
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,559
Alex, maybe this isn't
such a hot idea.

1213
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,239
Maybe you should just leave
the propeller alone, huh?

1214
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,130
We have to stop the ship.

1215
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,891
There's not much time left.

1216
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,879
Are you sure this is gonna hold?

1217
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,279
Yeah. We use those lines
all over the ship.

1218
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,519
Yeah? Well, guess what?

1219
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,119
He's not going all over the ship.

1220
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,002
- He's going under the ship, all right?
- Annie, Annie. It's okay. It'll hold.

1221
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,319
Hold on. Let me lock it.

1222
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,051
All right.

1223
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,769
Hey.

1224
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,679
Annie.

1225
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,559
What?

1226
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,159
4296...

1227
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,679
589J.

1228
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,879
I don't know what that is.
What is that?

1229
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,399
It's my badge number.

1230
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,929
It's 4296589J.

1231
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,319
Thank you.

1232
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,768
I'll be right back.

1233
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,799
Here's the guideline.

1234
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,567
Feed it into the propeller, and
it will pull the heavy cable in.

1235
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,481
- Not too much slack.
- Okay, okay, okay. I've got him.

1236
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,239
He's getting too close.

1237
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,450
Okay, Okay, he's close enough.
Stop it now.

1238
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,359
Come on, baby. Let it go.

1239
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,966
Let it go.

1240
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,599
It's taking the cable.
It's working. It's working!

1241
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,959
Well, then let's get
him up then, huh?

1242
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,328
- Come on.
- Pull him back up.

1243
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,439
It's stuck. It's snagged.

1244
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,679
The lines are crossed.
We have to bring him up.

1245
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,079
Come on. Now. Do something!

1246
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,727
- it's sucking him in.
- We gotta get him out of there!

1247
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,006
18.

1248
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,959
Come on, baby.

1249
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,279
17.5.

1250
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,799
They're doing it.

1251
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,770
They're slowing us down.

1252
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,968
Oh, no, you don't.

1253
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,519
We gotta get him up.

1254
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,571
Come on, come on. Keep pulling.

1255
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,765
Pull.

1256
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,039
Pull him up.

1257
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,090
Keep pulling.

1258
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,679
What the hell's happening?
It's stuck again!

1259
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,639
Get him up! Get him up!

1260
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,405
It's not gonna hold.

1261
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,599
Won't go any faster.

1262
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,002
Won't go any faster!

1263
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,605
Watch out!

1264
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,207
Get back!

1265
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,719
Think I broke my arm.

1266
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,999
Alex! Alex!

1267
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,359
Alex.

1268
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,399
Come on. Hold on. Come on. Hold on.

1269
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,559
We've got him now.

1270
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,999
Are you all right?

1271
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,399
What happened?

1272
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,039
I don't know, something just...

1273
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,079
Let him go.

1274
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,719
You slowed her down, but
you're not gonna stop her.

1275
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:10,919
Annie, I don't think your boyfriend
appreciates the logistics involved

1276
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,519
in ramming the most
automated ship in the world

1277
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,519
into a loaded fuel tanker
with no set anchor path.

1278
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,039
Let her go.

1279
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,239
Maybe you can spend the rest of your
days in some nice mental hospital

1280
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,483
sticking leeches to your ass.

1281
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,359
So you met my nurses.

1282
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,319
They clean the copper
out of my blood.

1283
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,802
Doctors gave me a couple
of years to live!

1284
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,799
Those bloodsuckers might
give me a few more.

1285
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:38,479
You walk away now, and there's
a chance I might not kill you.

1286
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,479
Listen to you.

1287
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,199
Let him go.

1288
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,559
Now!

1289
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,689
Go ahead.

1290
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,839
Now!

1291
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,685
Go ahead.

1292
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,839
Mr. Juliano, we'll be getting off.

1293
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,119
I hope you don't mind but
I'll be taking Annie with me

1294
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,409
as a little extra insurance.

1295
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,359
You know the one-armed
freestyle, don't you?

1296
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,559
Hey! Come on, or you'll join them!

1297
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,121
This way.

1298
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,926
Hold on, hold on.

1299
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,079
I can't believe they can't see us.

1300
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,244
How can they miss us?

1301
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,319
I can't get her on the radio!

1302
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,559
She's not responding.

1303
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,839
She's closing in at 14
knots, bearing 166.4.

1304
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,679
She's heading straight into us.

1305
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,359
Get the anchors up now!

1306
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,489
Yes, sir!

1307
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,559
Which way did they go?

1308
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:24,122
The marina.
He's going to jump ship.

1309
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,122
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

1310
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,449
Hurry up!

1311
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,604
Get moving!

1312
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,039
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1313
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,283
Very physical, aren't we?

1314
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,879
Okay...

1315
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,599
That way.

1316
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,128
Down the stairs. Hold it!

1317
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,919
We're going for a little ride.

1318
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,399
Come on.

1319
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,599
Can't let you go now.
You're my little hostage.

1320
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,679
Come on!

1321
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,159
Don't touch me!

1322
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,079
Get down.

1323
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,481
Get down!

1324
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,279
All right.

1325
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,284
That's it.

1326
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,763
So...

1327
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,799
How do you like your
vacation so far?

1328
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,362
- Sit down!
- Ow.

1329
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,088
You better hang on.

1330
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,959
Annie!

1331
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,679
Alex?

1332
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,286
Alex!

1333
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,359
Need a hand?

1334
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,046
Hold on. I got you.

1335
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:20,044
I don't think you want to
be on that ship now, Annie.

1336
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,123
- You know your way around the ship?
- Yeah.

1337
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,119
You're okay?

1338
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,124
What happened?

1339
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,162
Alex, can you hear me?

1340
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:53,999
I don't like this at all.

1341
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,199
- Oh, my God.
- Jeez, we're coming in too fast!

1342
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,046
How could this happen
on our honeymoon?

1343
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:05,999
Wait a minute.

1344
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,319
Oh, my God. Why don't we stop?

1345
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,839
Why don't we stop?

1346
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,519
Okay, everyone, move
away from the windows!

1347
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,921
Away from the windows!

1348
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,444
Brace yourself for the crash.

1349
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,319
How long before we have power?

1350
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,279
Seven or eight minutes, sir.

1351
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,759
In 8 minutes we'll be blown out
of the water! Now move it!

1352
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,919
Speed the engines full power.

1353
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,971
Prepare for hard forward turn.

1354
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,370
Alex, if you can hear me,
use the ship's intercom.

1355
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,719
Left, Alex, go to the left.

1356
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,199
<i>Alex, can you hear me?</i>

1357
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,329
<i>If you can hear me,
use the ship's intercom.</i>

1358
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,999
I can hear you.

1359
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,999
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

1360
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,162
All right, look.

1361
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,919
Which way to the bow thrusters?

1362
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,799
You flooded it. There's
no way to get there.

1363
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,359
I can get there.

1364
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,679
Just talk me through it.

1365
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,599
Okay. The bow thrusters
are 2 large wheels

1366
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,079
connected by a small shaft.

1367
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,079
Now, you can find them
at the end of the shaft

1368
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,519
<i>that runs below the
bilge pump room.</i>

1369
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,599
The bilge pump room.

1370
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:17,679
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1371
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,399
Yeah, copy that.

1372
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,879
Look, stay with us.

1373
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,799
You talk us through it,
following your voice.

1374
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,959
<i>Okay, you're in section BT-1.</i>

1375
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,439
<i>Now, at the end of the
hallway, you'll find a hatch.</i>

1376
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,839
<i>Now, that'll bring you
into the bilge pump room.</i>

1377
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,159
Hatch. Hatch.

1378
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,119
<i>Now, it's at the same
level as where you are,</i>

1379
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,639
<i>so there must be some air.</i>

1380
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,041
<i>Have you got it?</i>

1381
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,479
You're going to have
to lose the vest.

1382
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,319
What do you mean, lose my vest?

1383
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,370
We're going under.

1384
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,170
Damn, man.

1385
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,079
Let's get the hell out of here!

1386
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,559
Move away from the railing!

1387
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,999
Harvey, wait for me!

1388
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,719
Come on, over against the wall!

1389
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,919
What's going on?

1390
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,839
<i>At the far side,
there's a short slide.</i>

1391
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,159
<i>Now, that will lead right
into the bow thruster room.</i>

1392
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,679
<i>Alex, can you hear me?</i>

1393
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,242
<i>You're getting very close.</i>

1394
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,599
<i>The bow thrusters,
they're 2 large wheels</i>

1395
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,843
<i>connected to a shaft that
will turn the propeller.</i>

1396
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:06,159
<i>Now, when you find the wheel,
turn it as fast you can.</i>

1397
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,839
<i>Hold on, hold on.</i>

1398
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,919
<i>You only turn one wheel at a time.</i>

1399
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,279
If you turn them both,
you're canceling yourself out.

1400
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,879
Make sure you turn the
starboard wheel only.

1401
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,999
Okay, look.

1402
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,679
We have to play tag.

1403
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,039
I'll go down first.

1404
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,559
You follow me in 15 seconds.

1405
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,530
All right.

1406
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,411
They're turning us. Sir,
they're turning us.

1407
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,160
Yes. Yes, it's working.

1408
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,048
No, no, no, no.

1409
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,207
Make it stop.

1410
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,006
Oh, my God! Everybody down!

1411
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,923
We're going to crash!

1412
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:32,247
Oh, God!

1413
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,079
I think we did it!

1414
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,130
We turned it!

1415
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,405
Get down!

1416
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,291
Whoo!

1417
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,199
I do believe we have a miss!

1418
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,479
Impossible!

1419
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,803
No! No!

1420
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,490
They did it.

1421
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,519
We made it.

1422
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,843
Oh, Jack.

1423
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,524
Yes. Yes.

1424
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,762
- I hope somebody got that on tape.
- Yeah.

1425
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,525
Oh, shit.

1426
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,760
Oh, shit!

1427
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,804
Oh, shit.

1428
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,479
Aw, shit.

1429
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,120
Mom.

1430
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,721
Hey!

1431
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,484
Hey!

1432
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,039
We got to get out of here.

1433
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,479
Yeah, no kidding. Come on.

1434
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,325
Come on!

1435
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,559
Come on, hurry up!
They're coming right at us!

1436
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:09,122
Come on! Faster than that!

1437
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:10,839
Hey, we have the right of way here!

1438
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,559
Sorry! Excuse us!

1439
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,246
No way!

1440
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,409
That was close!

1441
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,525
To the bridge!

1442
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,639
Where's anchor control?

1443
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:27,679
We got to stop her.

1444
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:28,879
What? Anchor control?

1445
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,199
We can't drop it.
The ship's moving too fast.

1446
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,119
- Did you see Annie?
- No.

1447
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,599
I got it! I got it.

1448
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,446
No. No anchor can
stop a moving ship.

1449
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,726
It's moving. It's going down.

1450
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,959
I can feel it. We're slowing down.

1451
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:06,249
No. Too fast...
It's not going to hold.

1452
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,079
Harvey!

1453
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,519
Get in the corner!
Brace yourselves!

1454
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,809
Oh, my God! We're doomed!

1455
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,119
We're not going to stop!
We're not going to stop!

1456
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,039
Drop the other one.

1457
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,966
I'm telling you.
We're still too fast.

1458
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,604
It's stuck.

1459
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:44,279
God, no. No.

1460
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,079
Where's the horn? Where's the horn?

1461
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,199
How can there not be a horn?

1462
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,921
Wait a minute. There's got to be
a horn around here somewhere.

1463
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,726
Where's he going?

1464
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,241
Oh, shit!

1465
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,159
What are you doing with the wheel?

1466
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,559
Huh?

1467
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,559
It doesn't work!

1468
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:15,799
What?

1469
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,328
Jan, hold this for a sec.

1470
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,211
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1471
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,159
I can't believe it.

1472
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,279
This is slowing us down...

1473
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,799
Nine knots.

1474
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,519
Jeez!

1475
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,159
Oh, man! Move us out!

1476
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,561
Huh?

1477
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:49,849
This isn't happening.

1478
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,759
Oh, no. No more. Not again.

1479
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:57,839
I found it! I found it! I found it!

1480
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,519
Everybody get out of the way!

1481
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,839
There's a big boat coming!

1482
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:02,919
<i>Please!</i>

1483
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,199
<i>Now! Run!</i>

1484
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,199
<i>Jump! Swim!</i>

1485
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,519
Come on, people,
move out of the way!

1486
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,524
We don't have brakes!

1487
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,401
<i>This is not a dream! Jump!</i>

1488
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,923
<i>Abandon your ship!</i>

1489
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:27,081
Oh, my God. We're mowing them down!

1490
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,719
Stop!

1491
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,919
It... It's helping.

1492
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:35,129
Seven knots.

1493
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,125
Turn right! Turn right!

1494
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,290
Look out!

1495
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,079
Whoa!

1496
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,005
Oh, shit!

1497
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,926
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

1498
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,879
Two bedrooms...

1499
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,839
Dining room, kitchen, nook.

1500
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,129
Mommy, there's a big boat.

1501
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,479
I know. There are a lot
of big boats here, honey.

1502
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,839
What a cute boy...

1503
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,319
And very smart of you
to notice all the ships.

1504
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,849
The walls are a soft
European eggshell...

1505
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,690
My God, it'll take
forever to stop us.

1506
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,051
Harvey?

1507
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,131
Quick!

1508
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,771
We're not going to fit!
It's too tight!

1509
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,401
Get down!

1510
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,163
Six knots!

1511
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,803
What? What? I can't hear you.

1512
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,530
It's coming.

1513
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,244
Five knots!

1514
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,731
Four...

1515
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,126
Stop!

1516
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,049
Here it comes now!

1517
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:11,639
It's really big, Mom.

1518
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,690
Oh, my God!

1519
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,365
Oh, my God!

1520
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,881
Get down!

1521
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,639
Two knots!

1522
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,690
Almost stopped!

1523
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,491
Oh, no!

1524
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,330
Get down!

1525
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:33,681
Zero.

1526
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,802
My car!

1527
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,642
I got to find Annie.

1528
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,403
Shit! She's going over!

1529
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,324
We're tipping! We're tipping!

1530
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,161
Ow.

1531
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,689
We're docked.

1532
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:11,279
We're docked!

1533
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,879
I can't believe it!

1534
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,850
We're safe.

1535
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,245
Zero.

1536
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:39,639
Say what?

1537
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:42,039
Bad luck to run ship over town.

1538
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,719
No shit, bad luck, man.

1539
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:46,479
I just bought a condo here.

1540
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,167
My God.

1541
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:50,839
You all right?

1542
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,686
Yeah. I think I broke my other arm.

1543
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,846
The ship's parked in
the middle of town...

1544
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,879
But, hey, it could've been worse.

1545
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,879
I'm not sure how, exactly,
but it could've been worse.

1546
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:04,965
I got to get my girl. Thank you.

1547
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:09,281
Sorry.

1548
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,650
Be careful.

1549
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,369
I'll go check on the others.

1550
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,719
Looks like your vacation
is almost over.

1551
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,039
Just stay away from me,
or you're going to get hurt.

1552
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,199
I swear to God.

1553
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:34,879
What are you going to do, Annie?

1554
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,442
Splash water on me?

1555
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:47,879
I'm driving now.

1556
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,442
Hey, Annie! Hey!

1557
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,879
Annie!

1558
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,119
Come back! You stay with me!

1559
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:57,124
You're my hostage!

1560
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,041
I need a boat!

1561
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:03,439
Can I help you?

1562
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,839
I'm a cop.

1563
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:05,919
I need to borrow your boat.

1564
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,079
What?

1565
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:08,199
You've got to be kidding me.

1566
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:09,799
This is a joke, right?

1567
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:10,999
You're messing with my head.

1568
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,323
Come on, man, you've
got to be kidding me!

1569
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,439
Can't you see I'm on a date?

1570
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,239
My name is Alex Shaw, L.A.P.D.

1571
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,959
This is a matter of life
and death. Start the boat.

1572
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,279
L.A.P.D.? I'm in the
Caribbean, man.

1573
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,806
What are you doing here?

1574
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,039
Stop him, Maurice.

1575
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,599
Do you know how many hours of therapy
I've had because of you guys?

1576
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,639
And that shit's expensive!

1577
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:28,759
You drive.

1578
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,239
Hey, hey, where are you going?

1579
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:32,802
No!

1580
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,844
Hey! Annie!

1581
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,319
Okay, Okay, take it easy, man!

1582
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,929
- This boat cost me $150,000.
- Whoo!

1583
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,439
That way.

1584
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,799
Okay. That's it!

1585
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,759
That's it! I want a
promissory note right now!

1586
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,319
Give it!

1587
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:35,039
Let go of me! Ow!

1588
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,159
Do we have a fiery temper?

1589
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,839
You have no idea!

1590
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,919
There she is.

1591
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:43,243
Look! Fireworks!

1592
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,199
It's her.

1593
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,639
- What?
- That way, fast.

1594
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:48,919
Nah, I can't drive that fast!

1595
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,243
There's shallow reefs
around here! Shit!

1596
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,039
Get as close to that
plane as you can.

1597
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,319
Give me one good reason.

1598
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,679
If you don't, I'll throw you over.

1599
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:19,919
Okay.

1600
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,731
That's a good reason.

1601
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,959
Almost at speed!

1602
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,759
Don't! Don't you...

1603
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,399
Ow! Let me go!

1604
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,802
I think you better stay with me.

1605
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:43,409
- Get closer!
- What?

1606
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,239
Let me go!

1607
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,119
You want to go? I'll let you go...

1608
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,439
At about 10,000 feet!

1609
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:02,683
Get me closer!

1610
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,719
Huh?

1611
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:07,645
He's going to shoot the plane!

1612
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:12,449
Nice shot.

1613
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,451
Let's see if he can hold on now!

1614
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,483
- Follow me!
- Huh?

1615
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,359
Let go!

1616
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,919
He was supposed to let go.

1617
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,810
Let go!

1618
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,959
No, no, he's reeling himself in!

1619
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,840
Follow him! Follow him!

1620
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:45,439
Oh, you little shit.

1621
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,684
Here we go!

1622
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,919
No!

1623
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,639
No, don't!

1624
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,201
No!

1625
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:57,363
Come here!

1626
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:00,163
Oh, God.

1627
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:21,119
Alex! Alex!

1628
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:22,885
Annie!

1629
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,080
Annie!

1630
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:40,919
- Hi.
- Hi.

1631
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,559
Hi.

1632
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,564
Come on.

1633
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,960
Hold on!

1634
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,081
Aah!

1635
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:03,885
What's he riding that banana
peel for? What's he doing?

1636
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,361
Aah!

1637
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:40,399
<i>Abandon ship.</i>

1638
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:44,279
<i>All the crew members,
abandon ship immediately.</i>

1639
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:46,439
It's gonna blow, it's gonna blow!

1640
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,763
Jump, fool! Get off that thing!

1641
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,806
Jump!

1642
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:23,439
I hope they can hold their
breath a long time.

1643
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,959
Come on, don't run out of air.

1644
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:28,599
Me not see 'em. Me think
they dead. They gone.

1645
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:30,365
They're not gone.

1646
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,719
There they are! There they are!

1647
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:56,885
Hey, over here! Hey, this way!

1648
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,839
Here, come on. I got you. Come on.

1649
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:15,999
Come on, hurry up.

1650
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,479
Hurry up, come on. It's gonna blow.

1651
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:19,882
Hurry up, hurry up.
Come on, it's gonna blow.

1652
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,839
Untie 'em, untie 'em.

1653
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,810
You're all right.

1654
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:52,279
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1655
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,439
You all right?

1656
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:55,919
I was just so scared.
I was so scared.

1657
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,971
I didn't think I was gonna
make it there for a second.

1658
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,971
Thank you.

1659
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:12,399
Look what I found in
international waters.

1660
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,801
Whoo!

1661
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,802
This really is paradise.

1662
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,886
I got something for you.

1663
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:29,079
Wow.

1664
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:31,244
You want to wear this for a while?

1665
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,090
How long were you thinking?

1666
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,919
50 years.

1667
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,446
Yeah?

1668
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,726
Yeah.

1669
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:56,079
Can I make all the travel
plans from now on?

1670
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,891
Deal.

1671
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,079
Hello.

1672
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:48,239
Mr. Kenter.

1673
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,721
Oh, Annie.

1674
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:52,719
- Oh, you're back again.
- Yeah.

1675
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:53,999
Hope you don't mind.

1676
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,519
I kind of requested you.

1677
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:58,959
I wanted to make up for last week.

1678
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,199
Why would I mind?

1679
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:03,439
Gosh, uh, I'm sure it'll
go much better today.

1680
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:04,719
Oh, yeah, it will.

1681
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:05,799
Had some problems...

1682
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:07,239
A little nervous,
yeah, a little bit.

1683
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,722
Okay, Mr. Kenter, here we go.

1684
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,839
Sorry, Mr. Kenter, but that
bus was going way too fast.

1685
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,799
I noticed that.
Uh, make a left here.

1686
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,159
Got it. Excuse me.

1687
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:33,450
Thank you, thank you.

1688
01:58:34,305 --> 01:59:34,487
