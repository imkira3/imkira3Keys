1
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,372
Help here! Lend a hand here! Anyone!

2
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,792
Constable Crane?

3
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,711
Ichabod Crane, is that you?

4
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,129
None other.

5
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,131
Not only me.

6
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,135
I have found something,
which was lately a man.

7
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,350
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,437
Just a moment, if I may.
We do not yet know the cause of death.

9
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,024
When you find them in the river,
cause of death is drowning.

10
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,734
Possibly so,
if there is water in the lungs,

11
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,946
but by pathology we might be able to
determine whether or not he was dead

12
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,238
before he went into the river.

13
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,366
I will need to examine the body.

14
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,369
Cut him up. Are we heathens?

15
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,288
What happened to him?

16
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,624
Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary.

17
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,758
Good work.

18
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,095
The millennium is almost upon us.

19
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,015
In a few months,
we will be living in the 19th century,

20
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,560
yet our courts continue
to rely on medieval devices of torture.

21
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,728
Stand down!

22
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,898
I stand up for sense and justice.

23
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,192
Our jails overflow with men and women

24
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,361
convicted on confessions
worth no more than this one.

25
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,779
Constable Crane!

26
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,742
This is a song that we have heard
from you more than once.

27
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,579
Now, there are two courses open to me.

28
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,583
First, I can let you cool your heels
in the cells

29
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,753
until you learn respect
for the dignity of my office.

30
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,380
I beg pardon.

31
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:43,050
But why am I the only one
who sees that, to solve crimes,

32
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,429
to detect the guilty,
we must use our brains

33
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:51,100
to recognize vital clues,
using up-to-date scientific techniques?

34
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,311
Which brings me to the second course.

35
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,025
There is a town upstate,
two days' journey to the north

36
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,027
in the Hudson Highlands.

37
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,864
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.

38
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,283
Have you heard of it?

39
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,784
I have not.

40
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,538
An isolated farming community,
mainly Dutch.

41
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,084
Three persons have been
murdered there, all within a fortnight.

42
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,964
Each one found
with the head lopped off.

43
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,466
Lopped off?

44
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,510
Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

45
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,765
You will take
these experimentations of yours

46
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,641
to Sleepy Hollow

47
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,437
and there you will detect the murderer.

48
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,316
Bring him here to face our good justice.

49
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,069
Will you do this?

50
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,613
I shall.

51
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,658
Remember, it is you,

52
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,244
Ichabod Crane,

53
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,581
who is now put to the test.

54
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,763
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

55
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,848
"Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?

56
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,267
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

57
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,145
"Who's got a kiss
for the Pickety Witch?"

58
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,649
Is it Theodore?

59
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,818
No, pardon, miss. I am only a stranger.

60
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,694
Then have a kiss on account.

61
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,497
I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

62
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,250
I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.

63
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,919
And who are you, friend?
We have not heard your name yet.

64
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,422
I've not said it. Excuse me.

65
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,174
- You need some manners.
- Brom.

66
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,468
Come, come.
We'll have no raised voices.

67
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,346
It is only to raise spirits
during this dark time

68
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,517
that I and my dear wife
are giving this little party.

69
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,521
Young sir, you are most welcome,
even if you are selling something.

70
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,189
Thank you, sir.

71
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,609
I am Constable Ichabod Crane,
sent to you from New York

72
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,570
to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow.

73
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,198
Then Sleepy Hollow
is grateful to you, Constable Crane.

74
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,326
And we hope you will honor us
by remaining in this house.

75
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,911
Well spoke, dear.

76
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,123
Come, sir, we'll get you settled. Play on!

77
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,548
Excuse me, please.

78
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,221
Thank you.

79
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,183
Please tell Mr. Van Tassel
I will be down in a moment.

80
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,476
I will, sir.

81
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,898
Thank God you're here.

82
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,996
Excellent. Come in. Leave us, my dear.

83
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,253
We are joined by
Dr. Thomas Lancaster,

84
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,922
Reverend Steenwyck,

85
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,716
our able Magistrate Samuel Philipse,

86
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,884
and lastly,

87
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:08,222
this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook,
our notary.

88
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,098
And you, sir?

89
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,310
A simple farmer who has prospered.

90
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,772
The town looks to me
as friend and counsel.

91
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,775
And landlord and banker.
Can we proceed?

92
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,943
Thank you.

93
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,363
So...

94
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,825
Three persons murdered.

95
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,330
First, Peter Van Garrett

96
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,959
and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.

97
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,256
Both of them strong, capable men,

98
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,633
found together

99
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,177
decapitated.

100
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,391
One week later, the Widow Winship.

101
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,853
Also decapitated.

102
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,485
Now, I will need to ask you
many questions.

103
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,990
But first, let me ask,
is anyone suspected?

104
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,622
How much have your superiors
explained to you, Constable?

105
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:21,044
Only that the three
were slain in open ground,

106
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,173
their heads found severed
from their bodies.

107
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,010
Their heads were not found severed.

108
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,220
Their heads were not found at all.

109
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,310
The heads are gone?

110
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,561
Taken.

111
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,564
Taken by the Headless Horseman.

112
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,524
Taken back to hell.

113
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,527
Pardon, I don't...

114
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,196
Perhaps you had better sit down.

115
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,867
Yes.

116
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,999
The horseman was
a Hessian mercenary

117
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,793
sent to these shores by German princes

118
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,796
to keep Americans
under the yoke of England.

119
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,925
But unlike his compatriots,
who came for money,

120
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,679
the horseman came for love of carnage.

121
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,516
When battle was joined,
there you'd find him.

122
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,814
He rode a giant black steed
named Daredevil.

123
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,904
He was infamous
for riding his horse hard into battle,

124
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,531
chopping off heads at full gallop.

125
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,202
He had filed his teeth
down to sharp points

126
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,913
to add to the ferocity of his appearance.

127
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,966
This butcher didn't finally reach his end

128
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,594
until the winter of '79

129
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,766
not far from here in our Western Woods.

130
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,573
They chopped off his head
with his own sword.

131
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,701
Even today,
the Western Woods is a haunted place

132
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,995
where brave men will not venture.

133
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,916
For what was planted
in the ground that day

134
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,961
was a seed of evil.

135
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,508
And so it has been for 20 years.

136
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,094
But now the Hessian wakes.

137
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,140
He's on the rampage,
cutting off heads where he finds them.

138
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,314
Are you saying...

139
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,150
Is that what you believe?

140
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,945
Seeing is believing.

141
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:40,368
They tell me that you've brought books
and trappings of scientific investigation.

142
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,956
This is the only book
I recommend you read.

143
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,216
I see.

144
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,886
Reverend Steenwyck.

145
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,721
Gentlemen.

146
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,643
Murder needs no ghosts
to come from the grave.

147
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:09,022
We have murders in New York
without benefit of ghouls and goblins.

148
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,566
You're a long way
from New York, Constable.

149
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,362
The assassin is
a man of flesh and blood

150
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,239
and I will discover him.

151
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,656
Come out, devil.

152
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,668
His name's Gunpowder.

153
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,838
He should do just fine, Mr. Killian.

154
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,632
Thank you.

155
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,134
Good luck, sir.
If you need help, you call my name.

156
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,636
Much appreciated.

157
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,597
Now, don't you worry about a thing.

158
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,807
Everything's going to be just fine.

159
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,437
Thomas! Inside!

160
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,024
Run along for your breakfast.

161
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,318
Kiss your mother
once for you and twice for me.

162
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,363
Murder! The horseman's killed again!

163
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,909
All right, Gunpowder, we're off.
Come on.

164
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,953
No, no. Come on, the other way.

165
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,537
No, no. Turn around.

166
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,503
Good horsy.

167
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:52,018
- Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin cart.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,396
The rest of you keep a sharp lookout.

169
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,358
It's all right. I'm here now.

170
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,927
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

171
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,598
I see.

172
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,643
And the head?

173
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,523
Taken.

174
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,527
Interesting. Very interesting.

175
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,653
What is?

176
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,532
In headless-corpse cases of this sort,
the head is removed

177
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,409
to prevent identification of the body.

178
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,495
But we know
this was Jonathan Masbath.

179
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,956
Precisely. So why was
the head removed?

180
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,207
- Why?
- Right.

181
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,546
- You have moved the body?
- I did.

182
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,424
- You must never move the body!
- Why not?

183
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,842
Because.

184
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,817
The stride is gigantic.

185
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,572
The attacker rode Masbath down,

186
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,283
turned his horse,

187
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,411
came back.

188
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,413
Came back to claim the head.

189
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,432
Yes.

190
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,477
There's a chemical reaction.

191
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,897
It shows there was a powerful,
singular thrust to the neck.

192
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,510
- Interesting.
- What is it?

193
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,597
The wound was cauterized
in the very instant,

194
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,560
as though the blade itself were red hot.

195
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,063
And yet, no blistering,
no scorched flesh.

196
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,775
The Devil's fire.

197
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,119
"Be vigilant,"
as it sayeth in the Book of Peter,

198
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,454
chapter five, verse eight.

199
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,082
"Because your adversary the devil,

200
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,377
"as a roaring lion, walketh about,

201
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,505
"seeking whom he may devour."

202
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,634
God rest Jonathan Masbath.

203
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,637
Amen.

204
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,121
Mr. Constable, sir.

205
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,042
You're young Masbath.

206
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,795
I was young Masbath,
but now the only one.

207
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,881
Masbath, at your service.

208
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,300
In honor bound to avenge my father.

209
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,596
Well, one and only Masbath,
I thank you very much,

210
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,515
but your mother will need you
more than I.

211
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,143
My mother is in heaven, sir.

212
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,438
She has my father now to care for her.

213
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,901
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.

214
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,655
Yes, and a brave one, too. But I cannot
be the one to look after you.

215
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,534
I'm sorry for your loss,
young Mr. Masbath.

216
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,424
- Constable Crane.
- Mr. Philipse?

217
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,218
Something you should know.

218
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,554
Jonathan Masbath
was not the fourth victim,

219
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,933
- but the fifth.
- The fifth?

220
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,142
Aye.

221
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,563
Five victims in four graves.

222
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,535
Young Masbath.

223
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,288
Find a place
in the Van Tassel's servants' quarters.

224
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,872
Wake me before dawn.

225
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,250
I hope you have a strong stomach.

226
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,254
Peter Van Garrett.

227
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,798
Dirk Van Garrett.

228
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,092
Jonathan Masbath.

229
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,680
There are five victims, four graves.

230
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,238
The Widow Winship.

231
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,348
Bring the Widow in.

232
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,935
This is most irregular, Constable.

233
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,813
I should hope so, Doctor,
but in this case, necessary.

234
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,482
We need to operate immediately.

235
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,401
Operate? She's dead.

236
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,445
When we say "operate,"

237
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,406
we mean, of course,
I will need the operating table.

238
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:27,372
Once more, the neck wound cauterized.

239
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,169
The sword thrust to the stomach,
the same.

240
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,962
But to what purpose?

241
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,423
To what is your purpose
is the question.

242
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:41,135
What manner of instruments are these?

243
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,804
Some of my own design.

244
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,100
All right, then.
Step outside, young Masbath.

245
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,185
Thank you very, very much
for your help, Mr. Killian.

246
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,562
And if you don't mind, Doctor,

247
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,941
my concentration suffers greatly
when I'm observed.

248
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,232
I am finished.

249
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,193
What in the name of God
have you done to her?

250
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,737
We are dealing with a madman.

251
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,198
What did you find out, Constable?

252
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,659
The Widow Winship was with child.

253
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,558
Ichabod.

254
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:15,104
Ichabod. Ichabod.

255
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,565
Ichabod.

256
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:33,915
Who's there?

257
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:47,488
Ichabod.

258
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,489
Oh, pardon my intrusion. I saw a light.

259
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,992
It is no intrusion.
I come here to read when I am wakeful.

260
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,084
To read books which you must hide?

261
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,920
They were my mother's books.
My father believes

262
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,756
tales of romance caused the brain fever
that killed my mother.

263
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,092
She died two years ago
come midwinter.

264
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,969
The nurse who cared for her
during her sickness

265
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,680
is now Lady Van Tassel.

266
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,933
There was something else, too.

267
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,143
Why did no one think to mention that

268
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,230
the Van Garretts are kith and kin
to the Van Tassels?

269
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,816
Why, because there is hardly
a household in Sleepy Hollow

270
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,111
that is not connected
to every other by blood or marriage.

271
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,445
I see.

272
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,161
This land we're looking at
was Van Garrett land,

273
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,997
given to my father
when I was in swaddling clothes.

274
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,583
The Van Garretts were
the richest family around these parts.

275
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,752
When my father brought us
to Sleepy Hollow,

276
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,714
Van Garrett set him up with an acre
and a broken-down cottage.

277
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:13,884
My father worked hard for his family,
and prospered and built this house.

278
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,970
And I owe my happiness to him.

279
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,432
I remember living poor in the cottage.

280
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,143
Should I show you?

281
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:23,978
Yes.

282
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,151
Take this. It is my gift for you.

283
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,695
No, I have no use for it.

284
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,864
Are you so certain of everything?

285
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,669
It was your mother's.

286
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:52,298
Keep it close to your heart.
It is sure protection against harm.

287
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,513
Are you so certain of everything?

288
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,407
These are strange.
These markings, what are they?

289
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,659
I've had them since I can remember.

290
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,006
I used to play by this hearth as a child.

291
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,095
It was my first drawing school,

292
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,056
and my mother was my teacher.

293
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,727
Oh, look. See?

294
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,522
Carved into the fire back? The archer.

295
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,024
I'd forgotten it.

296
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,237
This was from long before
we lived here.

297
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,034
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

298
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,914
A cardinal. My favorite.

299
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,293
I'd love to have a tame one, but
I wouldn't have the heart to cage him.

300
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,297
Well, then I have something for you.

301
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,387
Cardinal on one side. An empty cage.

302
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:23,639
And now...

303
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,353
You can do magic. Teach me.

304
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,941
It is no magic. It is what we call optics.

305
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:37,319
Separate pictures
which become one in the spinning.

306
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:41,031
It is truth,
but truth is not always appearance.

307
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,334
What are you running from,
Magistrate Philipse?

308
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,501
Damn you, Crane.

309
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,670
- You had a mind to help me?
- Yes,

310
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,506
- and it's put me in mortal dread of...
- Of what?

311
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,301
Of powers against which
there is no defense. Come.

312
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,511
How did you know the Widow Winship
was expecting a child?

313
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,804
She told me.

314
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,308
- Then I deduce you are the father.
- I'm not the father.

315
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,518
Did she tell you
the name of the child's father?

316
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,604
Yes, she did.

317
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,273
She came to me for advice
as town magistrate

318
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,484
to protect the rights of her child.

319
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,362
I was bound by my oath of office
to keep the secret, but...

320
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,905
Do you believe the father killed her?

321
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,491
The Horseman killed her.

322
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,743
How often do I have to tell you?
There is no Horseman.

323
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,871
Never was a Horseman,
and never will be a Horseman.

324
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,706
What is that thing?

325
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,292
My talisman.
It protects me from the Horseman.

326
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,504
You, a magistrate,
and your head full of such nonsense.

327
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,381
Now, tell me the name of...

328
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,194
Oh, my God.

329
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,118
Constable Crane? Constable Crane?

330
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,537
Has he not come out at all?

331
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,879
- It was a headless horseman.
- You must not excite yourself.

332
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,088
But it was a headless horseman!

333
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,049
Of course it was.
That's why you're here.

334
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,761
No, you must believe me. It was
a horseman, a dead one. Headless.

335
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,928
I know. I know.

336
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,599
You don't know because
you were not there! It's all true.

337
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,602
Of course it is. I told you.
Everyone told you.

338
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,147
I saw him.

339
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,988
I suppose it's back to the city, then.

340
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,741
All right, this time
I'll go to New York myself.

341
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,494
I won't be fobbed off
with an amateur deductor.

342
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,884
This time, it's a magistrate
that's dead and...

343
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,177
Gentlemen.

344
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,930
I need able men to go with me
into the Western Woods.

345
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,309
You? We thought you'd shot your bolt.

346
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,477
I have faced my fears,
and come out determined

347
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,146
to locate the Horseman's grave.

348
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,816
In short, to pit myself
against a murdering ghost.

349
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,403
Who's with me?

350
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,616
Me.

351
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,995
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship,

352
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,790
your father, Jonathan Masbath,
and now Philipse.

353
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,168
Something must connect them.

354
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,338
Did your father
have dealings with the Van Garretts?

355
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,132
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach house.

356
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,010
It's nothing.

357
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,057
But there was something that happened
one night, a week before the murder.

358
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:43,268
An argument upstairs
between father and son.

359
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,271
And my father was later sent for
by Mr. Van Garrett.

360
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,817
An argument between father and son.

361
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:55,155
After which the elder Van Garrett sent
for his servant Masbath.

362
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:56,949
Listen.

363
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,327
- I hear nothing.
- Nor I.

364
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,832
No birds. No crickets.
It's all gone so quiet.

365
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:15,926
Quicken pace.

366
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,060
Pardon our intrusion,

367
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:11,231
- but perhaps you could help us?
- You're from the Hollow.

368
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,484
Yes. In a way, yes.

369
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:22,075
I should like to say that I make
no assumptions about your occupation.

370
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:25,829
Nor your ways, which, which, which are

371
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,914
nothing to me, whatever you are.

372
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,250
Each to his own.

373
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,088
Oh.

374
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:45,057
Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am?
The Hessian?

375
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,853
That'll be him, ma'am.

376
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,023
You, come with me.

377
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,610
Go out, child. Keep away.

378
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,945
Whatever you hear, keep away.

379
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,372
What might he hear
that he must keep away from?

380
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,090
He rides. To the Hollow and back.

381
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:22,719
- I hear him. I smell the blood on him.
- Do you?

382
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:29,184
Well, I'm here to find him
and make him stop.

383
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,151
You seek knowledge
of the netherworld?

384
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,444
I can show you.

385
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:52,165
- What are you doing?
- Do not move or speak.

386
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,751
When the other comes, I will hold him.

387
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,004
- The other?
- Silence. He comes now.

388
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,224
Madam?

389
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,687
Madam, do you hear me?

390
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:30,203
You seek the warrior bathed in blood,
the Headless Horseman.

391
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:34,040
Follow the Indian trail
to where the sun dies.

392
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,126
Follow it to the Tree of the Dead.

393
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,880
Climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

394
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,388
We're leaving.

395
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,557
- What happened?
- We're leaving now.

396
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,145
We take the Indian trail
to the Tree of the Dead.

397
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,398
- How will we recognize it?
- Without difficulty, I rather fear.

398
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:00,859
We climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

399
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,903
- His camp?
- His grave.

400
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,749
Stay here.

401
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,539
Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed.

402
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,084
Katrina?

403
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,670
I might have killed you.
Why have you come?

404
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,005
Because no one else would go with you.

405
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,217
Well, then I am now twice the man.

406
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,345
It is your white magic.

407
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,934
Pardon my intrusion.

408
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:18,728
I think you'd better come
and look at this.

409
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,523
The Tree of the Dead.

410
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,958
Blood.

411
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:27,839
Stay where you are.

412
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:11,841
- What is it?
- Just stay where you are. Don't move.

413
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:31,611
This tree is a gateway.
A gateway between two worlds.

414
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:48,294
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose.

415
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,296
Bring the shovel.

416
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:12,402
The skull is gone. Taken.

417
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,655
That is why
the Horseman returns from the grave.

418
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,993
To take heads
till his own is restored to him.

419
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,846
Ichabod?

420
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,564
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

421
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:54,087
Don't pick your teeth,
you'll teach Thomas bad habits.

422
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:58,508
- I am a bad habit. There's nothing for it.
- Oh, isn't there?

423
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:21,614
- Come on, let's get ready for bed.
- Yes.

424
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,722
Beth, run!

425
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,286
Stay quiet.

426
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,788
- Wait! He's not after you.
- I'll get him.

427
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,684
We cannot win this.

428
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,745
Remarkable.
A wound like this should've killed him.

429
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,082
But it needs no stitch,
and there's hardly a loss of blood.

430
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,212
You must be still. The fever is on you.

431
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,299
Katrina.

432
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:35,219
Nostradamus mediamus, milk of mercy,

433
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:38,598
in media nos laudamas.

434
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:59,160
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom, but...

435
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:02,788
Drink this down. It'll make you sleep.

436
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:08,419
The Horseman was not set to kill Brom
or me. Had Brom not attacked him...

437
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,129
Later. Rest now.

438
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:14,008
I've discovered something.
The Horseman does not kill at random.

439
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:17,220
His victims are chosen
by someone who controls him.

440
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,139
By that very person who took his skull.

441
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,725
Someone who knew where to dig.

442
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,103
Someone of flesh and blood,
as I've always said.

443
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,732
- These are ravings.
- Drink.

444
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:20,741
Ichabod.

445
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,431
- You were dreaming.
- Yes.

446
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,018
Things I had forgotten.

447
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:54,317
- And would not like to remember.
- Tell me what you dreamt.

448
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:58,362
My mother was an innocent.
A child of nature.

449
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,575
Condemned.

450
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,078
Murdered. By my father.

451
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,749
- Murdered by...
- Murdered to save her soul

452
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:15,087
by a Bible-black tyrant
behind a mask of righteousness.

453
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:19,800
I was seven when I lost my faith.

454
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,888
What do you believe in?

455
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:27,933
Sense and reason.
Cause and consequence.

456
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,105
I should not have come to this place,

457
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,942
where my rational mind has been
so controverted by the spirit world.

458
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,611
Will you take nothing
from Sleepy Hollow

459
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,654
that was worth the coming here?

460
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,951
No. No, not nothing.

461
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,123
A kiss from a lovely young woman,

462
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,418
before she saw my face
or knew my name.

463
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,922
Yes, without sense or reason.

464
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,221
Forgive me, I speak of kisses

465
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,641
and you've lost your brave man, Brom.

466
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:14,480
I have shed my tears for Brom,
and yet my heart is not broken.

467
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,444
- Do you think me wicked?
- No.

468
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:25,241
But perhaps there is a bit
of a witch in you, Katrina.

469
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:30,204
- Why do you say that?
- Because you have bewitched me.

470
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,677
Oh.

471
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:49,014
- You slept like the dead.
- You're too kind to me.

472
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:51,892
I do not look to be served
by the lady of the house.

473
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:56,480
Nor would you be,
but that the servant girl has vanished.

474
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:00,484
- Sarah?
- Run away like so many others.

475
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,028
They're all leaving in fear.

476
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,490
Where is Katrina?

477
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,287
She watched over you till dawn.
Now it is her turn to sleep.

478
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:20,212
Well, I'm fit for another day, I think.

479
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,092
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.

480
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,473
Doctor Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck,

481
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,522
Notary Hardenbrook,
and Magistrate Philipse.

482
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,027
Who tried to cut and run,
and lost his head.

483
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:46,906
All frightened men,
arguing together on the very night

484
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,325
Magistrate Philipse was killed.

485
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,579
There is conspiracy here.

486
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:01,212
The doctor, the reverend, the notary

487
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,547
and the magistrate.

488
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:08,052
What is this secret that unites them?

489
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,642
Magistrate Philipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

490
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,479
He knew the Widow was pregnant.

491
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,982
He would not tell me
the name of the father.

492
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,152
What does this point to?

493
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,371
We must proceed
by a process of elimination.

494
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,832
I shall make a list of
every man and woman in Sleepy Hollow,

495
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:42,378
starting with its chief citizen,
Baltus Van Tassel.

496
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,383
I feel we're getting very close.

497
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:51,095
Yes, I suppose
Baltus is the chief citizen,

498
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,222
now that old Van Garrett is dead.

499
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:58,227
Yes, the Van Garretts.
I'd almost forgotten them.

500
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:11,657
Come with me.

501
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:14,076
- Where?
- To Notary Hardenbrook's.

502
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,998
- Have you thought of something?
- Yes. I have.

503
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:35,848
Hopeless.

504
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:49,028
My father's satchel. Why is it here?

505
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,367
- Leave me alone.
- Notary Hardenbrook.

506
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,369
Leave me alone!

507
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,788
Just as soon as you show me
the last will and testament

508
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,540
of old man Van Garrett.

509
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,543
The will leaves everything to his son.

510
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:08,881
Who died with him.
So the estate passes to the next of kin.

511
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:13,093
- Naturally. All legal and above board.
- Sir.

512
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,265
I'm a dead man. No.

513
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,728
Van Garrett's seal. Broken.

514
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,317
Seems Van Garrett
made a new will just before he died.

515
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,738
Naming Widow Winship?

516
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:36,241
And here, look. A marriage certificate.

517
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,246
Old Van Garrett
secretly married the Widow.

518
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:44,291
Left everything to her
and her unborn child.

519
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:48,462
So the new will
stood between the Van Garrett fortune

520
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:51,590
and the person who would have
otherwise inherited everything.

521
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:56,428
It's true. But we four were drawn in
against our will.

522
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,181
- Your will?
- He means...

523
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,060
Of course. The four town elders.

524
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,438
Now I see what parts you had to play.

525
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:11,110
Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret
because he performed the marriage.

526
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,946
Dr. Lancaster attended
the pregnant woman.

527
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:17,199
Magistrate Philipse
gave protection of the law.

528
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,119
And Notary Hardenbrook
concealed the documents,

529
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:23,872
which had been entrusted
by Van Garrett to his faithful servant.

530
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,792
The four conspirators
drawn into the plot.

531
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,295
We did not know
it was a murdering plot.

532
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,381
But I have not finished, sir.

533
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,968
First, the Van Garretts, father and son,
slain by a horseman

534
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,011
raised from the grave to chop heads.

535
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:41,974
Now, up pops a widow with a claim
on a fortune. Off with her head!

536
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:44,810
But murder begets murder.

537
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:48,647
It was the servant, Jonathan Masbath.

538
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:52,317
The night father and son
quarreled over the new will,

539
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,571
Jonathan Masbath was summoned
upstairs to bear witness.

540
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,157
Here is his signature.

541
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,993
I'm afraid it was his death warrant,
young Masbath.

542
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,412
The Horseman came for him.

543
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:08,542
Came for him at the bidding of
someone who had power over him.

544
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:12,129
Someone who dug in the earth in
the Western Woods and stole the skull.

545
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:14,757
The missing head, which must
be restored to the Horseman

546
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,759
before he will return to Hell.

547
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,803
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune.

548
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:25,267
None other than Van Garrett's
next of kin, Baltus Van Tassel!

549
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:36,361
- Katrina? Why are you in my room?
- Because it is yours.

550
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:44,036
- Was it wicked of me?
- No. No, not at all.

551
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,081
I missed you. Where did you go?

552
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,168
To the notary.
I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

553
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,921
And did you learn anything of interest?

554
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:57,549
Perhaps.

555
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,385
- My father...
- Your father?

556
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:04,556
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

557
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,893
Really? Why is that?

558
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,229
I don't know.

559
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,982
Perhaps he looked in your ledger
and did not like what he saw.

560
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:23,575
- What have you there?
- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you...

561
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,911
Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.

562
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:44,888
- It's just a spider.
- Kill it! Kill it! No, no, stomp it!

563
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,768
- There's something under here.
- What is it?

564
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,731
- Help me move the bed.
- No, no, I mustn't. You do it.

565
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:06,368
The evil eye. It is someone
casting spells against you.

566
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,955
The evil eye?

567
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,633
Wait here.

568
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:22,421
Katrina, you took the evidence

569
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:23,547
and burned it.

570
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,091
So you would not have it
to accuse my father.

571
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,926
I accuse no one.

572
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,886
But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it,

573
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,471
no matter how much it grieves me.

574
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:34,099
And no spells of yours
can alter it, either.

575
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:35,642
Your father has the motive.

576
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:37,936
It is he who stands to profit
from these murders.

577
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:41,606
If you knew him, you would not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

578
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,900
No, nor if you felt anything for me.

579
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:45,736
I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning.

580
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,030
Why else did his four friends
conspire to conceal...

581
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,948
You are the constable, not I.

582
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:52,617
So find another chain of reasoning
and let me be.

583
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:57,581
I cannot, not the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.

584
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:02,627
I think you have no heart.
And I had a mind once to give you mine.

585
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:07,257
Yes, I think you loved me that day
when you followed me

586
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,302
into the Western Woods
to have braved such peril.

587
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,678
What peril was there for me,

588
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:15,140
if it was my own father who controlled
the Headless Horseman?

589
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:21,521
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane.

590
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:24,274
I curse the day
you came to Sleepy Hollow.

591
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:33,784
- She will not see you.
- Did she say anything?

592
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:38,538
Only that she will not come down.

593
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,750
I see. Thank you.

594
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,835
Constable?

595
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:49,007
You have not asked me how
I have hurt my hand since yesterday,

596
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,843
which would have been polite.

597
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:55,847
In fact, you have been as careful

598
01:13:56,224 --> 01:14:00,102
not to look at it as not to mention it.

599
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:04,231
Yes, I'm sorry. How did you...

600
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:07,692
- I know you saw me.
- What?

601
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,154
I know you followed last night.

602
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:14,741
And you must promise
not to tell my husband what you saw.

603
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,535
Promise me!

604
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,371
The town is in ferment.

605
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,666
Horror piled on tragedy.
Hardenbrook is dead.

606
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:26,503
- Oh, no! That harmless old man?
- Hanged himself in the night.

607
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:27,712
Hanged himself?

608
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:30,507
Reverend Steenwyck's
called a meeting in the church tonight.

609
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:34,136
Every man, woman, and child
is going to speak out against you.

610
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,055
If you are wise, you will leave this place.

611
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:42,561
- What is that?
- I was careless with the kitchen knife.

612
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:44,354
The wound looks angry.

613
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,899
I will bind it later
with wild arrowroot flowers.

614
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,776
I know where some grow.

615
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:03,290
Come on, hurry up.
The meeting bell started tolling.

616
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,107
The Horseman!

617
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,027
- Katrina!
- Father?

618
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,446
The Horseman! Save me!

619
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,618
He killed her.
The Horseman killed your stepmother.

620
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,295
Oh, God!

621
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,808
Fire!

622
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:24,287
You'll kill us all!
You're the one the Horseman wants.

623
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,643
He cannot enter.

624
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:48,311
Over here!

625
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,529
The Horseman cannot enter.

626
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:58,989
Why should we die for you?

627
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,366
The Horseman cannot enter.
He cannot cross the gate.

628
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,702
We have to save ourselves.

629
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:08,081
The next person that lays a hand on me
will get a bullet!

630
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:12,043
He's coming back!

631
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:22,304
Enough have died already.
It's time to confess our sins.

632
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:25,765
- What is it that you know?
- Your four friends played you false.

633
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,310
We were devilishly possessed
by one who...

634
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:40,905
Get out of my way!
Stand back! Stay back!

635
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,169
Back! Stand back!

636
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,469
There is a conspiracy here,
and I will shake it out.

637
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,547
It was an evil spirit possessed you.

638
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:24,717
I pray God it is satisfied now,
and that you find peace.

639
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,678
The evil eye's done its work.

640
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:31,808
My life is over, spared for
a lifetime of horrors in my sleep,

641
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,853
waking each day to grief.

642
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,861
Goodbye, Katrina.

643
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:25,236
- You think it was Katrina, don't you?
- That can never be uttered.

644
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,740
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and loving heart.

645
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,326
- How can you think so?
- I have good reason.

646
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:34,704
- Then you are bewitched by reason.
- I am beaten down by it!

647
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,753
It is a hard lesson for a hard world,

648
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,963
and you had better learn it,
young Masbath.

649
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:45,924
Villainy wears many masks.

650
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:49,052
None so dangerous
as the mask of virtue.

651
01:20:57,144 --> 01:20:58,603
Farewell.

652
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:30,153
- Van Ripper, turn the coach.
- What?

653
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,738
Turn around now!

654
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,878
Pardon my intrusion.

655
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:01,392
No blood flow, no clotting, no healing.

656
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:08,066
When this cut was made,
this woman was already dead.

657
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,328
Dear stepdaughter,

658
01:23:22,623 --> 01:23:24,791
you look as if you'd seen a ghost.

659
01:23:56,407 --> 01:24:00,118
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.

660
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:05,289
One more night of beheading.
Rise up with your sword.

661
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:09,293
A head for a head.

662
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,380
My unholy horseman, rise!

663
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:17,385
Come now for Katrina!

664
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:32,650
Awake at last.

665
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,571
Did you think it was all a nasty dream?

666
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,740
Father saw the Horseman kill you.

667
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:42,994
He saw the Horseman come
towards me with his sword unsheathed,

668
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:46,831
but it is I who govern the Horseman,
my dear.

669
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,667
And Baltus did not stay to watch.

670
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:57,675
- But there was a body.
- The servant girl, Sarah.

671
01:24:57,718 --> 01:25:00,094
And I always thought she was useless.

672
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:06,392
But it seems
she had a purpose after all.

673
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,399
Who are you?

674
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:18,905
- My family name was Archer.
- The archer.

675
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:30,041
I lived with my father and mother
and sister in a cottage not far from here.

676
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,959
Until one day my father died,

677
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:35,213
and the landlord, who had received
many years of loyal service

678
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,340
from my parents, evicted us.

679
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,551
No one in this God-fearing town
would take us in

680
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,471
because my mother
was suspected of witchcraft.

681
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:46,098
But she schooled her daughters well,

682
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:49,352
while we lived as outcasts
in the Western Woods.

683
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:52,688
She died within a year.

684
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:02,448
My sister and I remained in our refuge,
seeing not a soul.

685
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:07,119
Until one day, whilst gathering firewood,

686
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:09,789
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

687
01:26:15,546 --> 01:26:17,380
I saw his death.

688
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,843
At that moment,
I offered my soul to Satan,

689
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:26,430
if he would raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

690
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:33,771
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett.

691
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:37,191
The landlord who showed us no mercy
and left us to starve,

692
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:41,112
whilst Baltus Van Tassel
and his simpering wife and girl child

693
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:42,613
stole our home.

694
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:45,908
I swore I would make myself
mistress of all he had.

695
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:48,244
The easiest part was the first.

696
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:50,997
To enter your house
as your mother's sick nurse,

697
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:55,293
and put her body into the grave
and my own into the marriage bed.

698
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,963
Not quite so easy
was to secure my legacy.

699
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,133
The Widow had to go, of course.

700
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,677
And the servant, Masbath.

701
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:08,306
And then, just the other day,
that silly midwife Killian

702
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,767
told me the Widow had told her
a big secret.

703
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,979
And she told me this
right in front of her husband.

704
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,480
What a goose!

705
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,234
So, another little job for the Horseman.

706
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:28,367
But lust delivered
the Reverend Steenwyck into my power.

707
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,705
Fear did the same
for the notary, Hardenbrook,

708
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,498
and the drunkard Philipse.

709
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:37,627
And the doctor's silence I exchanged

710
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:42,673
for my complicity in his fornications
with the servant girl, Sarah.

711
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:46,928
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No.

712
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:50,973
You have, my dear, by your father's will.

713
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,644
I get everything
in the event of your death.

714
01:27:56,438 --> 01:28:00,608
My sister, by the way,
sadly passed away.

715
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,029
Quite recently.

716
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:09,408
You killed your own sister?

717
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:14,038
She brought it on herself
by helping you and your master.

718
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:19,210
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

719
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:23,881
The Horseman comes!
And tonight, he comes for you!

720
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,347
Katrina!

721
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,021
Thank God.

722
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:49,907
Watch your head.

723
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:07,425
To the roof! I have an idea.

724
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,320
Jump for the sails.

725
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:25,920
Jump!

726
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:32,718
Hurry!

727
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,449
- Is he dead?
- That's the problem.

728
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,243
He was dead to begin with.

729
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,393
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

730
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:37,741
Here, take the reins.

731
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,722
Ichabod!

732
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:56,820
My bag!

733
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:15,589
Jump!

734
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,946
- Still alive?
- Run, Katrina.

735
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:26,076
Yes, do run, and jump, and skip.

736
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:29,747
No!

737
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:41,425
Here! Take her!

738
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:44,261
She's yours!

739
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:49,683
Sir, you're not dead.

740
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,559
Horseman!

741
01:39:05,231 --> 01:39:07,524
Just in time for a new century.

742
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:22,539
You'll soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

743
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:24,958
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,

744
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:28,043
and home is this way.
