1
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:06,466
Ninety-one, 92...

2
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:09,139
- It's down there.
- Where? If they catch us...

3
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,308
There's a million bottles
of booze in there.

4
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:12,999
You think they're gonna miss one?

5
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,352
Weather is with us, sir.

6
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:33,925
We arrive in port in a couple of hours.

7
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:35,690
Very good.

8
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,663
You're welcome, sir.

9
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,670
Man, I never smelt anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

10
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,109
Oh, what, your shit smells like roses?

11
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:51,611
Hey, look.

12
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,581
I'll give you a hand.

13
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:04,283
- Thought you said it was booze.
- That's what the papers said.

14
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,462
Captain, we have a breach
in lower level. Look.

15
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,227
- Which section?
- 101.

16
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:15,402
Fuck. Take the wheel.

17
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:17,005
- Yes, sir.
- Fuck.

18
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:21,272
Close the door! Get the masks.

19
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:29,645
Holy shit.

20
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,312
Take care of them.

21
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,496
- Morning.
- Passport, please.

22
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,165
Rough seas?

23
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:30,042
The sea was smooth. The party was
a bit rough, if you know what I mean.

24
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:31,772
- Ibiza.
- Yeah.

25
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:33,416
Thanks.

26
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:46,826
When I was a kid,
my father used to take me fishing.

27
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,262
Never could figure out how he knew
where the fish were.

28
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:54,838
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

29
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:20,995
Security check.

30
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,991
Do I look like a security risk?

31
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:26,327
Please step out of the car and bring
your documents to the office.

32
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:28,763
My documents are right here, sir.

33
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:31,100
The computer is in the office.

34
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:33,837
Her too.

35
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:35,706
She's sleeping.

36
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:38,677
- With her documents.
- Okay, sure.

37
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:54,724
You're gonna lose it.

38
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,932
Close, inspector, you're close.

39
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,744
That's a big one. Go left, go left.

40
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:12,111
Don't let him get away.

41
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:18,049
You're close.

42
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:24,917
Go left, go left! Go right!

43
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,827
Must be Moby Dick you hooked.
Need some help?

44
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:32,093
No, thank you, Frank.

45
00:06:33,437 --> 00:06:36,668
I have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.

46
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:45,447
You were close, inspector.
You were close.

47
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,683
Good thing that we French have such
a highly developed sense of humor.

48
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:56,425
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

49
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:59,755
- Jerry Lewis is a genius.
- Dean was the genius.

50
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:03,024
No, Dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.

51
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:06,203
My point exactly.
Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

52
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:09,635
How many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?

53
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:24,382
I am afraid our day of leisure
is cut short.

54
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:26,055
There is a mess in Marseilles.

55
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:29,124
Some madman driving an Audi
at impossible speeds.

56
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:33,596
Don't look at me.

57
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:36,665
That is the first place
the chief told me to look.

58
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:41,031
But I will tell him
you have the perfect alibi.

59
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,438
As usual.

60
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:51,342
Tarconi!

61
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:54,150
- Please!
- I am sorry, Frank.

62
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:57,446
- It's our first bite!
- Yeah, yeah.

63
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,054
- Please.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:01,724
Stop the boat. Come on.

65
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,656
- No. No, Frank.
- Come on, please.

66
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:48,463
Purpose of your visit, Mr. Johnson?

67
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,229
Business.

68
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:52,036
What kind of business?

69
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:54,440
Environmental protection.

70
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:02,444
Thank you.

71
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:08,122
Mr. Minister, you're giving the opening
address at an EU conference...

72
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:11,055
...on environmental impact of industry
in Odessa tomorrow.

73
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:13,992
- What is top on your list of priorities?
- It's a short list.

74
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:16,928
There's one item: the environment
and how to protect it.

75
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,931
In the face of increasing pressure...

76
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:22,071
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...

77
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:25,606
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.

78
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,779
Well, not as harsh as
a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

79
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,674
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now...

80
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:34,078
...I have trees to save
and industrialists to disappoint.

81
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,983
- Your speech for tomorrow.
- Any good?

82
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:44,392
- It's going to piss off a lot of people.
- Excellent.

83
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:08,507
Hello?

84
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,483
Mr. Minister?

85
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:13,512
Who is this?

86
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:16,222
My name is not important.

87
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:18,657
I've been put in charge of
the negotiations...

88
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:21,263
...you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

89
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:24,730
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the Ukraine.

90
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,403
You must be misinformed,
Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is.

91
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,664
I've terminated negotiations
permanently.

92
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:32,274
I think you will reconsider
that position...

93
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:35,877
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.

94
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:52,762
I'll be in touch.

95
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,369
Yeah, there's been an accident.

96
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,073
Send an ambulance,
8 Route de la Falaise.

97
00:11:58,529 --> 00:11:59,894
Malcolm.

98
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:01,758
Malcolm. Malcolm.

99
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:10,339
I asked you for your price.
What is this?

100
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:14,602
A man who might be interested
in taking the job. This man will.

101
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:16,976
My boss said you're the man
for the job.

102
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:18,842
Your boss got his facts wrong.

103
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,242
Two things you should know
about my boss:

104
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:26,685
He never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.

105
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,915
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

106
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:40,628
Well, not this time.

107
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:48,936
You don't wanna do this.

108
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:53,082
I don't think you're in a position to
tell me what I do and don't wanna do.

109
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:56,252
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

110
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:04,025
I'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

111
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,014
Malcolm. Malcolm.

112
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,212
You hear me?

113
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:12,225
Mal, I said drop in anytime,
but I didn't mean...

114
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:15,292
- Nowhere else to go.
- Just take it easy, okay?

115
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,228
Don't move me from the car.

116
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:22,394
- It's just till the ambulance arrives.
- No ambulance.

117
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:26,208
You need a doctor, you've been shot.
I can't take care of this.

118
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:30,580
Not far from car.

119
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:33,140
Relax.

120
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:38,147
Just try to stay calm.
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

121
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,191
He's inside. Quick, it's serious.

122
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:56,762
Sir?

123
00:14:56,974 --> 00:15:00,171
- You wanna be careful moving him.
- We know our job, okay?

124
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,868
Sir, can you hear me?

125
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,604
This car... No...

126
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,339
If you hear me, press my hand.

127
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:08,081
The car...

128
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:00,236
Am I in heaven?

129
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:02,905
Actually, you're in a bit of the shit.

130
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,065
You'll help me out of it?

131
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,506
That depends on
how deep you're in.

132
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,007
- Don't trust anyone.
- Couldn't agree with you more.

133
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:15,809
- Come on.
- No! Don't leave the car!

134
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,182
- What's so special about the car?
- Not the car.

135
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,165
Wait!

136
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:02,954
I told you.

137
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:09,868
<i>Don't trust anyone.</i>

138
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:12,965
<i>I told you.</i>

139
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,622
I took the liberty
of bringing your suit.

140
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,992
It's what you wear when
you're working, correct?

141
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,862
Correct. But I'm not working.

142
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:16,497
- You see, boss? I told you.
- Please, Joseph.

143
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:21,166
Your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.

144
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:22,936
Thank you.

145
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:24,602
As I was saying...

146
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:27,943
...we came to you in good faith.
You said you were unavailable.

147
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:30,585
We contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.

148
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:32,311
He proved to be ineffective.

149
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:35,787
And now I am left
with unfinished business.

150
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:38,291
The way I see it, you're responsible.

151
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:40,820
I understand your point of view.

152
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:42,225
But I'm still unavailable.

153
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,701
Boss, can I say something?

154
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:50,768
Anyone else wanna say something?

155
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,434
Good.

156
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:57,737
Find me a smarter one.

157
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,108
You have three seconds
to change your mind...

158
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,083
...or you're gonna
be permanently unavailable.

159
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:07,280
One.

160
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,548
Two.

161
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:14,856
One condition.

162
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,491
I'm listening.

163
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:22,398
I drive my own car.

164
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:25,174
Deal.

165
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:31,879
In anticipation of your answer, we took
the liberty of bringing your car.

166
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:36,018
Changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.

167
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:39,746
Left the switch-over license plates.
Love that.

168
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:42,220
Replaced the GPS
with one of our own.

169
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:44,291
Preprogrammed.
More efficient that way.

170
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:48,721
Why I was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?

171
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:53,902
We're playing
in a much larger game here.

172
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:58,768
Don't think of this as just another job.
Think of it as a mission.

173
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:03,644
I'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.

174
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:05,906
I make a deal, that's the deal.
Just like you.

175
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:08,846
You don't like names. Neither do I.
We're both precise.

176
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:12,146
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...

177
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:16,314
...beyond what we are paid to do.
Those are your rules, right?

178
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:26,128
You forgot one.

179
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:29,637
- I work alone.
- I thought you might like the company.

180
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:32,405
Thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.

181
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:36,441
You're right. I do.

182
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:40,410
Wait.

183
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,253
What, you wanna change the rules?

184
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:48,620
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

185
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,022
You're the boss.

186
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,790
Anything else?

187
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,265
The jewelry.
Anything I should know?

188
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,568
You remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...

189
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:09,609
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?

190
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:11,713
Same principle, just refined.

191
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:13,610
Twenty-five feet from the car...

192
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:17,218
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.

193
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,217
Fifty feet, orange.

194
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:21,752
Second liquid
flows into the chamber.

195
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,927
Seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.

196
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,930
Time to go.

197
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:36,132
This phone is programmed
to call only one number, mine.

198
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:41,075
When you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?

199
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,148
Money for gas and food.

200
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:46,542
Any other questions?

201
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:20,342
Would you mind
buckling your seat belt?

202
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:34,424
Don't suppose you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

203
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:42,137
Great.

204
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:00,414
Ocean Pearl
requesting cargo clearance.

205
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,616
The papers are with
the environmental agency.

206
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,928
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

207
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,758
- We'll inform you when they're signed.
- Okay.

208
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:21,037
I know what happened to you.

209
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:23,474
But what happened to Frank?

210
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:33,315
Colonel Medved over at Intelligence
has been given all the information.

211
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,321
He knows it's top priority.

212
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:38,085
He wants you to know
he has his best men on it.

213
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:40,456
He'll keep it out of official channels.

214
00:23:40,664 --> 00:23:44,327
He suggests you buy
as much time as you can.

215
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:44,488
Look, I don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. And I don't really care.

216
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:46,992
You were here first,
you know more than I do...

217
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:48,892
...download me on what you know.

218
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:50,657
I know nothing.

219
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:53,062
How did you know Malcolm?

220
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:54,492
I didn't.

221
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:57,938
You just happened to end up in a car
with a man you don't know?

222
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,203
I'm now in a car
with man I don't know.

223
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,708
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

224
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:14,556
<i>Nice to hear from you.</i>

225
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:17,818
You can skip the pleasantries.
Just give me the code.

226
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:19,788
<i>1- 1- 2-6.</i>

227
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,433
<i>Call me when you arrive.</i>

228
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:30,604
What's in Budapest?

229
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:33,071
Goulash. Beer.

230
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,311
All right.

231
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:44,316
Let's rewind here,
start with the proper introductions.

232
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:47,479
What happened
to the rule of no names?

233
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,750
I'm suspending that rule
for the moment.

234
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,025
I'm Frank Martin.

235
00:25:58,334 --> 00:25:59,767
And your name is?

236
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:05,338
What matters, my name?

237
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:08,843
Well, we're in this situation together.

238
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:10,936
No.

239
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:17,347
We're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.

240
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:20,455
I'd call that being
in the same situation.

241
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:23,484
It's not. They are going to kill you.

242
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:27,486
I'm aware of that.

243
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:31,457
In all probability, after they kill me,
you're next on the list.

244
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:35,195
Now, if I'm gonna keep that from
happening, I'm gonna need a little help.

245
00:26:35,405 --> 00:26:38,033
From the top. We have this problem.

246
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:40,209
You think I don't know
it's a problem?

247
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:42,542
I look stupid to you?

248
00:26:43,246 --> 00:26:45,737
I didn't say you were stupid.

249
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:48,849
But we have a problem...

250
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:52,715
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.

251
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,654
I don't want to talk anymore.

252
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:05,295
Fine.

253
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:20,410
What did you say your name was?

254
00:27:21,384 --> 00:27:24,353
Frank. Frank Martin.

255
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:27,482
Frank Martin.

256
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:29,882
Valentina.

257
00:27:32,962 --> 00:27:35,453
Pleased to meet you.

258
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:33,615
<i>The gentlemen
from Ecocorp are here.</i>

259
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:36,251
Show them in.

260
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,056
Gentlemen.

261
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:49,862
Mr. Minister.

262
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:52,940
We'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...

263
00:28:53,142 --> 00:28:56,077
...on such short notice.
- You make it very hard not to.

264
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,908
Well, yes. We do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.

265
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,317
Here are the contracts.

266
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:05,245
All in order.

267
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:08,114
We were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...

268
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:10,315
...unless you personally
signed off on them.

269
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:11,857
Ships?

270
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:13,861
I thought there was only one.

271
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:16,531
Oh, well, here's the thing.

272
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:19,463
In order to make the venture
more profitable...

273
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:22,638
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.

274
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,466
How many ships
are we talking about?

275
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:28,440
Plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.

276
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:30,272
Eight.

277
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:31,807
This year.

278
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:36,108
Protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.

279
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,310
You've said so yourself, haven't you?

280
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:41,046
And I will do again tomorrow
in Odessa...

281
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:44,124
...where I will sign these.

282
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:47,858
We were really hoping to
settle this today.

283
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:52,433
I want to review them, now that
there are some addendums.

284
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:54,796
Twenty-four hours
doesn't make a difference...

285
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:57,370
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?

286
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,837
No, of course not.

287
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:05,037
Then I will see you tomorrow
in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

288
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,319
<i>Yes.</i>

289
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:14,251
Okay, I'll stay.

290
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:16,084
- But the material is leaking.
- And?

291
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:18,852
- We won't be able to hide it.
- I'll take care of it.

292
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:20,359
If ever they check...

293
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:22,861
<i>Easy. The deal will be closed
very soon.</i>

294
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,693
Twenty-four hours. No more.

295
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,576
- Yes?
- I've bought you another 24 hours.

296
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,078
You have until tomorrow, 9 a.m.

297
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:42,114
That should be
more than enough time.

298
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,550
<i>Do you have a lead?</i>

299
00:30:44,754 --> 00:30:46,551
Better than a lead.

300
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,379
A location.

301
00:31:26,963 --> 00:31:28,931
I'm hungry.

302
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,457
We're 100 kilometers
from beer and sausage.

303
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:36,336
I don't like sausage.

304
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:41,076
What would you like?

305
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:46,875
Veal.

306
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,017
Roast, with carrots...

307
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:50,617
...and beets.

308
00:31:52,221 --> 00:31:55,247
In gravy, with Madeira in stock.

309
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,720
Nothing to start?

310
00:32:00,296 --> 00:32:02,264
A salad.

311
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:06,130
Greens tossed with balsamic.

312
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:08,098
From Modena.

313
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:09,703
Aged?

314
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,874
Of course, aged.

315
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:16,902
And for dessert?

316
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:19,773
Sachertorte.

317
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:22,807
With whipped cream or without?

318
00:32:24,187 --> 00:32:25,518
With.

319
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:28,153
To drink?

320
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:31,286
Wine.

321
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:33,291
Tokaj, perhaps?

322
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,888
Ice wine.

323
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:37,862
Of course.

324
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:52,577
- What are you doing?
- Seeing a man about some jewelry.

325
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:05,817
He's gone off the reservation.

326
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:11,496
Send someone to get him back on.

327
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:14,068
Don't kill him.

328
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,424
Frank. It's so good to see you,
'mein Freund'.

329
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:46,031
Good to see you too, Otto.

330
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:48,893
You didn't mention
you bring company.

331
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:50,564
It's not really company.

332
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:52,734
It's...

333
00:33:53,943 --> 00:33:55,035
...complicated.

334
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:58,213
With you, it's always complicated.
You can tell me about it...

335
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:02,145
...over a nice schnitzel
with 'Kartoffelsalat' I have prepared.

336
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:04,946
Hey, Otto, you know
I love your schnitzel...

337
00:34:05,154 --> 00:34:07,588
...but we need to get rid of this first.

338
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:13,584
Binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.

339
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:15,290
English, please, Otto.

340
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,757
There's a program the
Pentagon has funded...

341
00:34:18,968 --> 00:34:22,062
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...

342
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:25,604
...that's been experimenting with
this new kind of weaponry...

343
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:28,436
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

344
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:30,669
Very hush-hush stuff.

345
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:35,249
I didn't realize you were in the loop
on the Pentagon hush-hush.

346
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:37,476
You wouldn't believe
what you can discover...

347
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:39,848
...walking through the Internet.

348
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:42,286
You wanna see the
invasion plans for Iran?

349
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:44,487
Maybe some other time.

350
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:48,130
Right now we need to get this thing off
without blowing myself to Iran.

351
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:50,765
I don't wanna bother you
with the details...

352
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:55,495
...but usually there's
a transmitter plate close by.

353
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:03,178
You should not be doing this.

354
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:05,370
First you don't talk,
now you offer advice.

355
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:08,049
Not advice. A warning.

356
00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:10,375
Well, a little late for warnings,
don't you think?

357
00:35:17,226 --> 00:35:18,352
I agree with you.

358
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,523
You're off course.

359
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:33,267
- Should I?
- Yeah, you should.

360
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:40,839
Look, fellas...

361
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:44,585
...some things in the car
were a bit off, needed checking.

362
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:48,320
In my profession,
a man is only as good as the car.

363
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:51,721
You take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.

364
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:56,228
The boss says, "Back on the road."

365
00:35:56,732 --> 00:35:58,063
Frank?

366
00:35:58,868 --> 00:35:59,857
Keep at it.

367
00:36:02,638 --> 00:36:03,730
Back in the car, Frank.

368
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,634
No.

369
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:19,105
- Find it?
- Not yet.

370
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,450
You're the smart one?

371
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,254
No. I'm the big one.

372
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:33,745
Not so big anymore, are you?

373
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:58,169
Found it.

374
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:04,902
- The transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

375
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:08,405
It's wired.

376
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,748
If I do:

377
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:10,736
You fight good.

378
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:15,875
But you tie bad.

379
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:22,512
Where are you going?

380
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:24,821
Tired.

381
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:28,223
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

382
00:41:29,098 --> 00:41:30,759
That makes two of us.

383
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,269
What do you want me to do
when they...? When they wake up?

384
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,530
Probably best to take
the rest of the day off.

385
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:57,017
I'm not amused.

386
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:59,091
You'd be less amused
if you ended up dead.

387
00:41:59,294 --> 00:42:01,694
<i>If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
You need me.</i>

388
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:04,695
You want me to complete the job,
I need some clarification.

389
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:07,427
I'm listening.

390
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:09,029
In person.

391
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:10,671
We've already done in person.

392
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:12,966
<i>Well, not to my satisfaction,
apparently.</i>

393
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:16,610
Right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.

394
00:42:17,713 --> 00:42:20,238
Same place. One hour.
Wait for my call.

395
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,197
Hello?

396
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:20,341
You've disappointed me.

397
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:23,602
You won't be the first
and you won't be the last.

398
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:28,579
- I told you I wanted to do this in person.
- That won't be necessary. You see...

399
00:43:28,784 --> 00:43:30,843
...since our little chat
at the beginning...

400
00:43:31,053 --> 00:43:34,545
...I've been thinking I don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.

401
00:43:34,756 --> 00:43:36,917
Any idiot with
a driver's license will do.

402
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:40,151
So in the words of the
great American, Donald Trump:

403
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:43,695
I'm sorry, but you're fired.

404
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,069
Who are you?

405
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,074
- Your new chauffeur.
- I want the old one back.

406
00:44:34,283 --> 00:44:36,615
He's about to go to pieces.

407
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,418
You're fired.

408
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:51,282
How was your nap?

409
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,060
Restful. How was your phone call?

410
00:45:54,262 --> 00:45:56,730
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

411
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:09,633
Tarconi.

412
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:10,869
It's me.

413
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:13,776
I was wondering
when you would call.

414
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,176
I've been busy.

415
00:46:15,384 --> 00:46:18,012
Let me guess. In Budapest?

416
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:20,618
You've been busy too.

417
00:46:21,123 --> 00:46:23,956
Never a problem keeping that way
with a friend like you.

418
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,992
So I don't have to be redundant,
tell me what you know.

419
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:29,629
There is a black Mercedes
also in Budapest.

420
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:31,890
<i>Probably not occupied
by friends of yours.</i>

421
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,728
That is what I know.
Now tell me what you know.

422
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:38,870
I have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.

423
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:40,974
Russian, I think.

424
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:43,370
I don't know what she
has to do with anything.

425
00:46:43,578 --> 00:46:45,546
Have you tried asking her?

426
00:46:45,747 --> 00:46:47,806
Now, why didn't I think of that?

427
00:46:47,816 --> 00:46:49,711
Sorry. Of course you've asked.
And she says?

428
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:51,649
I'm going to die.

429
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:54,151
Typical. Russians.

430
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:56,551
They are so dark.

431
00:46:56,758 --> 00:47:00,250
I remember, in school,
reading Dostoyevsky and thinking...

432
00:47:00,462 --> 00:47:03,124
...when do these people laugh?

433
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:04,992
One page after the other...

434
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,169
...misery and suffering
like you wouldn't believe, Frank.

435
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,771
Inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? I'm blinking here.

436
00:47:11,973 --> 00:47:13,167
Is that code?

437
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:17,545
No, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.

438
00:47:17,746 --> 00:47:19,976
Wired to explode
if we get too far from the car.

439
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:21,171
<i>They?</i>

440
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:22,907
Some American.

441
00:47:23,151 --> 00:47:25,984
<i>Can you be more specific?
A name? A number?</i>

442
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:27,212
Nothing.

443
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:29,617
Why do you always
make it so easy, Frank?

444
00:47:29,825 --> 00:47:31,520
It's my nature.

445
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:33,558
<i>Where are you? I will come there.</i>

446
00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:36,230
That's not a good idea.
They have me on a short leash.

447
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:39,264
I can't be of much help
if you do not give me something.

448
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:43,029
How close are you to a computer?

449
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:47,967
Yes, Frank?

450
00:47:48,176 --> 00:47:50,940
<i>That wasn't very nice,
back there in the market.</i>

451
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:53,979
You were the one
who broke the rules, not me.

452
00:47:54,182 --> 00:47:56,241
<i>Point well taken.</i>

453
00:47:56,518 --> 00:48:00,045
That makes us even. What say
we start with a clean slate?

454
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,383
So this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?

455
00:48:04,025 --> 00:48:05,083
<i>More or less.</i>

456
00:48:05,293 --> 00:48:08,194
You have what I need
to get the bracelet off...

457
00:48:08,396 --> 00:48:11,229
...I have the packages
you need delivered.

458
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,792
Here are the new coordinates,
then: 2-6-12.

459
00:48:15,203 --> 00:48:16,670
<i>That'll take you to the place...</i>

460
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:19,170
<i>...where we can have a
conclusion to this business.</i>

461
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:21,103
I look forward to it.

462
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:28,412
Frank.

463
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:29,811
<i>Did you get it?</i>

464
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:36,757
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

465
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:39,188
<i>...and we should have his number
and location.</i>

466
00:48:40,562 --> 00:48:42,291
Your new phone, sir.

467
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,139
- Anything else?
- No.

468
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:58,340
<i>Frank, do you know where
the signal is taking you?</i>

469
00:49:08,723 --> 00:49:12,853
I know restaurant there.
Fish like you never had.

470
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:16,224
Roasted with small carrots
and black pepper.

471
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:18,991
Romanian wine, not so good.

472
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:23,435
But for the last meal,
could be worse.

473
00:49:25,941 --> 00:49:29,206
You really should begin
to think more positive.

474
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:31,777
I'm realist.

475
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:36,377
My friend was right when he said
you were doom and gloom.

476
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:39,452
What means "doom and gloom"?

477
00:49:39,654 --> 00:49:42,589
You know, you only see
the horrible and the terrible.

478
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:45,760
Your friend, where does he get this?
He doesn't know me.

479
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:49,259
He was talking about you in general.
Russians, as a people.

480
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:51,591
I'm not Russian. I'm Ukrainian.

481
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,358
Excuse me.

482
00:49:53,568 --> 00:49:57,629
Not excused. We're different people.
We're different here...

483
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:58,999
...and here.

484
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:08,672
Me, personally, I think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.

485
00:50:10,252 --> 00:50:12,652
How you can make such a statement?
You don't know me.

486
00:50:14,656 --> 00:50:16,988
Well, I see
you're putting makeup on.

487
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:20,684
If you were so convinced
we was gonna die, why bother?

488
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:26,667
What does looking good
have to do with dying?

489
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,534
Hello.

490
00:50:36,544 --> 00:50:37,704
What's that?

491
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,381
Souvenirs from Ibiza.
Do you want one?

492
00:50:40,682 --> 00:50:43,708
No, thank you. And neither do you.
We need to stay sharp.

493
00:50:45,787 --> 00:50:47,482
Okay.

494
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:54,084
You stay sharp.

495
00:50:54,296 --> 00:50:57,163
I stay, how you say? Optimist?

496
00:50:57,632 --> 00:51:00,999
Give me that.
Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

497
00:51:04,306 --> 00:51:05,568
Give me that...

498
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:12,806
Jesus.

499
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:16,910
Great.

500
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,285
- Just great.
- Come on, Frank Martin, lighten up.

501
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,355
I should?
How about when those pills hit?

502
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,187
You're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

503
00:51:27,395 --> 00:51:28,453
That would be nice.

504
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,498
Boring. Boring. Boring?

505
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,634
Oh, yeah.

506
00:52:11,906 --> 00:52:13,669
You should stay in the car.

507
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:16,341
You want me to pee in car?

508
00:52:21,649 --> 00:52:23,810
Okay. Go on.

509
00:52:27,722 --> 00:52:29,087
You remember.

510
00:52:55,316 --> 00:52:57,113
Don't.

511
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,864
Don't.

512
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:22,298
<i>Don't.</i>

513
00:53:42,997 --> 00:53:43,986
Oh, no.

514
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:25,695
- Stop, all right?
- Why? I don't drive.

515
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:27,130
I want to have fun.

516
00:54:27,342 --> 00:54:30,675
I want to be happy. You should
try happy instead of so serious.

517
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:34,038
It's important to stay positive,
like you say, yeah?

518
00:54:34,249 --> 00:54:37,446
- Drink with me, Frankie.
- I don't want a drink.

519
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:42,712
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

520
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:44,858
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

521
00:54:45,894 --> 00:54:48,021
Come on, get in the car.

522
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,189
I am free, like a bird.

523
00:54:59,207 --> 00:55:00,970
The girl! Come on! Faster!

524
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:12,345
- I have lost my friend!
- I'll buy you a new one.

525
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:28,725
Have any idea
why we have a car on our ass?

526
00:55:30,071 --> 00:55:31,436
I don't know. I don't care.

527
00:55:33,775 --> 00:55:36,175
- You mind?
- First you say I'm doom and gloom...

528
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:39,210
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? Make up your mind.

529
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,364
- Yes, Frank?
- I thought we had an agreement.

530
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:32,794
We do.

531
00:56:33,034 --> 00:56:34,899
It had nothing to do
with a car on my ass.

532
00:56:36,537 --> 00:56:40,974
I don't have anything to do with that.
Someone else has issues with you?

533
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:42,972
Likely.

534
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:49,080
What I think is that there are
other forces at work here.

535
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:51,684
Let me check into it,
see what I can find out.

536
00:56:51,886 --> 00:56:53,478
What do I do in the meantime?

537
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:55,849
Drive faster.

538
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,622
What the hell is he doing?

539
00:58:34,655 --> 00:58:36,418
There!

540
00:58:36,624 --> 00:58:38,023
He's down there!

541
00:58:43,598 --> 00:58:44,895
I'm hungry.

542
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:47,260
Should have thought
about a sandwich, not vodka.

543
00:58:49,537 --> 00:58:50,561
Look!

544
00:58:56,978 --> 00:58:59,105
I wasn't hungry then, I was thirsty.

545
00:58:59,313 --> 00:59:00,974
Why you are so mean to me?

546
00:59:02,316 --> 00:59:05,479
- I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.
- What means "preoccupied"?

547
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:12,717
That means preoccupied.

548
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:26,440
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

549
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:30,836
- Get down!
- Shoot him!

550
00:59:41,556 --> 00:59:42,853
Bloody hell!

551
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,128
Faster!

552
01:00:00,575 --> 01:00:02,202
Stop the car!

553
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:04,305
Oh, shit!

554
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:10,709
What are you doing?

555
01:01:10,945 --> 01:01:12,378
You're so tense.

556
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,805
You don't say.

557
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:21,048
I make you relax, okay?

558
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:25,223
- Yeah.
- I'm good at this.

559
01:01:25,693 --> 01:01:27,923
Making tense go away.

560
01:01:36,938 --> 01:01:38,098
What are you doing?

561
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:43,073
I want to feel sex
one more time before I die.

562
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:44,744
Don't you?

563
01:01:47,014 --> 01:01:49,448
What is it with you and dying?

564
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:53,547
There is something wrong with me?

565
01:01:54,155 --> 01:01:55,417
Am I not sexy?

566
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:57,917
Yeah, you're sexy.

567
01:02:03,965 --> 01:02:04,954
You're the gay.

568
01:02:06,267 --> 01:02:09,498
Nope, I am not the gay.

569
01:02:09,704 --> 01:02:11,604
I don't mind.

570
01:02:13,741 --> 01:02:15,140
I'm not, okay?

571
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:20,240
Then what's the problem?

572
01:02:22,383 --> 01:02:26,149
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I'm not in the mood?

573
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:46,998
- I thought rule is don't open package.
- It is.

574
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:48,903
Why you have rules
if you break them?

575
01:02:50,177 --> 01:02:51,872
I keep asking myself the same thing.

576
01:02:53,347 --> 01:02:55,338
Phone books.

577
01:03:03,758 --> 01:03:06,158
- You're the package.
- Yes.

578
01:03:07,194 --> 01:03:08,559
Could have said something.

579
01:03:09,096 --> 01:03:11,690
- Would it make a difference?
- Yes.

580
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:15,133
Now what are you doing?

581
01:03:15,336 --> 01:03:17,770
You know, back in garage...

582
01:03:17,972 --> 01:03:22,841
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.

583
01:03:23,044 --> 01:03:25,706
I was trying to keep five cretins
from caving my head in.

584
01:03:25,913 --> 01:03:27,346
I don't see the turn-on in that.

585
01:03:27,548 --> 01:03:32,611
You think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?

586
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,845
I don't like where this
is going, Valentina.

587
01:03:35,056 --> 01:03:38,025
Would you striptease for me again?

588
01:03:38,726 --> 01:03:41,354
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

589
01:03:41,562 --> 01:03:42,688
You want keys?

590
01:03:47,234 --> 01:03:49,532
I want you to stop playing around,
is what I want.

591
01:03:49,737 --> 01:03:53,002
Maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.

592
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:55,698
This is not the time
or the place for playing.

593
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:59,971
Why do I get feeling with you
it's never time or place?

594
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:02,479
If I wanna get analyzed,
I'll see a psychiatrist.

595
01:04:02,683 --> 01:04:04,913
Now, give me the keys.

596
01:04:05,453 --> 01:04:07,785
Come on, Frank Martin.

597
01:04:07,988 --> 01:04:10,218
Make playtime for me.

598
01:04:30,277 --> 01:04:32,768
All right? That enough?

599
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,744
Not enough.
That is not a striptease, Frank.

600
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:39,442
Striptease is sexy.
You know, move your ass a little.

601
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,811
Come on, Frank Martin.

602
01:04:42,123 --> 01:04:44,023
You want keys?

603
01:04:44,425 --> 01:04:47,223
I want strip.

604
01:04:53,434 --> 01:04:56,028
You know what I'm gonna do to you
for making me do this?

605
01:04:56,237 --> 01:04:57,670
Spank me?

606
01:04:58,239 --> 01:04:59,467
For starters.

607
01:04:59,673 --> 01:05:02,267
- Tie me up?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

608
01:05:03,744 --> 01:05:06,338
I like the rough stuff.

609
01:05:09,717 --> 01:05:11,708
Really?

610
01:05:16,023 --> 01:05:18,787
Oh, but not too rough.

611
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:22,160
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

612
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:25,821
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

613
01:05:33,474 --> 01:05:34,873
Like you mean it.

614
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:44,244
Do you ever kiss
like you mean it, Frank?

615
01:05:45,386 --> 01:05:47,752
I'm thinking maybe not.

616
01:05:47,955 --> 01:05:50,219
I'm thinking you live alone.

617
01:05:51,225 --> 01:05:53,159
Inside and outside.

618
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:56,930
Thinking it is not dying
you're afraid of.

619
01:05:57,131 --> 01:05:58,996
It's living.

620
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:00,790
Live with me.

621
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:02,764
Just this once.

622
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:06,428
Just this moment. Live with me.

623
01:06:48,749 --> 01:06:50,683
- What's his position?
- We lost him.

624
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:56,745
He headed into the mountains.
We can't get reception up there.

625
01:06:56,957 --> 01:06:59,357
Hack into one of the
military satellites.

626
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:07,659
Yes.

627
01:07:07,868 --> 01:07:10,132
You think we're playing games here,
Mr. Minister?

628
01:07:10,337 --> 01:07:12,134
I don't know what
you're talking about.

629
01:07:12,339 --> 01:07:15,672
I'm talking about a black car full of
your incompetent operatives.

630
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:18,936
<i>One more move like that and you will
never see your daughter again.</i>

631
01:07:19,146 --> 01:07:20,545
I want to hear her voice.

632
01:07:20,748 --> 01:07:23,376
When the contract
is signed and delivered.

633
01:07:23,584 --> 01:07:25,984
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

634
01:07:26,186 --> 01:07:28,780
You are in no position
to play hardball, Mr. Minister.

635
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:31,617
Well, neither are you, Mr. Johnson.

636
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,489
<i>Yes, I know who you are.</i>

637
01:07:34,828 --> 01:07:37,888
And I can assure you, if anything
happens to my daughter...

638
01:07:38,098 --> 01:07:39,963
...I will use all the power I have.

639
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:45,605
I will hunt you down and make you pay
in a most hideous way for this.

640
01:07:49,009 --> 01:07:50,237
We have to move now.

641
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:58,112
Pick up, Frank. Pick up.

642
01:08:15,135 --> 01:08:17,797
I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

643
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:25,374
<i>Someone hands me
glass of champagne.</i>

644
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:27,376
<i>I drink.</i>

645
01:08:28,115 --> 01:08:30,583
<i>Then I don't feel so good.</i>

646
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:46,658
<i>I go to bathroom, and next thing,
I'm awake in the car.</i>

647
01:08:47,868 --> 01:08:51,668
I ask him, "Where is this?"
He tells me he's just a transporter.

648
01:08:55,542 --> 01:08:57,908
He's pretty good driver.

649
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:01,007
Not like you good.

650
01:09:02,082 --> 01:09:07,918
I tell him, "Please.
My father a really powerful man.

651
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:12,491
Big influence. Knows a lot of people.
Let me call him."

652
01:09:12,893 --> 01:09:15,225
<i>He's afraid.
He's never done this before.</i>

653
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:20,592
It's supposed to be simple.
Pick up, drop off. Easy money.

654
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:24,134
He's been told no calls,
never leave car.

655
01:09:24,772 --> 01:09:26,501
But I convince him.

656
01:09:28,409 --> 01:09:30,036
<i>I call.</i>

657
01:09:30,711 --> 01:09:32,941
<i>But before I say to my father
where we are...</i>

658
01:09:33,147 --> 01:09:34,444
Inside the car. Come on!

659
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:42,782
<i>We get away, but...</i>

660
01:09:45,959 --> 01:09:48,587
There's people shooting at us. Why?

661
01:09:48,796 --> 01:09:50,957
Why they shooting at us?

662
01:09:51,165 --> 01:09:56,068
He says they shoot because
we didn't go according to plan.

663
01:09:56,437 --> 01:10:00,897
I said, "Okay, that's the old plan.
What's new plan?"

664
01:10:01,108 --> 01:10:03,406
He says he has a friend.

665
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:14,617
And then I met you.

666
01:10:17,424 --> 01:10:20,086
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

667
01:10:24,698 --> 01:10:26,928
You didn't even know me.

668
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:29,067
Of course I don't know you.

669
01:10:29,269 --> 01:10:32,761
I talk about feelings, not knowing.

670
01:10:34,908 --> 01:10:39,242
Well, if you was feeling that way, you
sure had a funny way of showing it.

671
01:10:40,013 --> 01:10:43,608
Better for a woman
to have a little mystery to her.

672
01:10:43,817 --> 01:10:45,284
No?

673
01:10:46,854 --> 01:10:48,344
No.

674
01:10:48,856 --> 01:10:52,155
Yes. Just a little.

675
01:11:18,585 --> 01:11:20,746
He's back on the radar, sir.

676
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:27,692
- Yeah.
- Where the hell are you?

677
01:11:27,895 --> 01:11:29,089
On the way to Bucharest.

678
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:30,828
Not any longer.

679
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:36,495
New coordinates: 3-7-13.

680
01:12:14,441 --> 01:12:16,204
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

681
01:12:16,877 --> 01:12:19,038
Sorry, just a minute.

682
01:12:19,246 --> 01:12:21,339
Inspector Tarconi, from Marseilles.

683
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:25,214
Well, not exactly Marseilles...

684
01:12:25,419 --> 01:12:28,354
...but a small town to the east...
- What do you want, inspector?

685
01:12:28,555 --> 01:12:30,216
- A word with you.
- I have no time.

686
01:12:31,225 --> 01:12:32,692
It's about your daughter.

687
01:12:40,968 --> 01:12:44,563
Odessa, Frank. My country.

688
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:48,333
You take me home. Thank you.

689
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:52,310
What happened to Bucharest?

690
01:12:53,914 --> 01:12:58,749
- Change of plans.
- It's a good change. I prefer Odessa.

691
01:12:59,419 --> 01:13:01,011
Yeah.

692
01:13:01,955 --> 01:13:05,083
I was looking forward to that fish
with the carrots myself.

693
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:07,283
Oh, it's much better here.

694
01:13:07,494 --> 01:13:10,588
- You know chicken Kiev?
- I do.

695
01:13:10,797 --> 01:13:12,992
I know restaurant here.

696
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,531
Best in the world.

697
01:13:14,735 --> 01:13:19,069
The chicken's so fresh.
And the butter, when it's coming out...

698
01:13:19,273 --> 01:13:21,400
Like you cannot believe, it's so nice.

699
01:13:27,114 --> 01:13:29,548
You know what I feel like now?

700
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:33,880
Hungry.

701
01:13:37,024 --> 01:13:38,753
Safe.

702
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,235
It's going to end up like the movies,
this happily ever after?

703
01:13:54,908 --> 01:13:57,536
By tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.

704
01:13:58,011 --> 01:14:02,004
It's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken Kiev.

705
01:14:04,284 --> 01:14:05,649
Liar.

706
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:25,863
<i>Mr. Minister, an update, please.</i>

707
01:14:27,574 --> 01:14:32,011
I am ready to sign the contract
once I speak to my daughter.

708
01:14:33,847 --> 01:14:36,714
Hello? Hello?

709
01:14:37,284 --> 01:14:39,912
Have that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

710
01:14:48,562 --> 01:14:50,723
We are closing the noose, Frank.

711
01:14:51,331 --> 01:14:54,664
Well, when it closes, make sure
no one tries to drag me out of the car.

712
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:56,392
You know what this is about yet?

713
01:14:57,637 --> 01:15:00,128
The girl. Her father.

714
01:15:00,474 --> 01:15:02,999
Large amounts of toxic waste.

715
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,542
It is a trade.
His signature for her life.

716
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,340
I have a reputation
to uphold here, inspector.

717
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:13,781
One hundred percent
successful delivery rate.

718
01:15:13,987 --> 01:15:17,445
Am I detecting a little attachment?

719
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:23,225
That is not the Frank I know. With his
rules, no names, no attachment.

720
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:25,625
Why is everyone so concerned
about my rules?

721
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:31,930
Frank, I always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.

722
01:15:33,907 --> 01:15:34,896
Anything else?

723
01:15:36,109 --> 01:15:37,770
<i>Where is the rendezvous?</i>

724
01:15:37,978 --> 01:15:39,912
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

725
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:47,279
- Yeah.
- We're almost at the end, Frank.

726
01:15:47,487 --> 01:15:50,047
- Just give me the coordinates.
- No more coordinates.

727
01:15:50,757 --> 01:15:52,748
The road you're on.

728
01:15:53,093 --> 01:15:54,424
Make your first left.

729
01:15:55,228 --> 01:15:56,718
I'd like to know where I'm going.

730
01:16:01,501 --> 01:16:03,969
You'll know when you get there.

731
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,264
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

732
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,178
My compliments, Frank.

733
01:16:45,378 --> 01:16:49,007
Our trust in your abilities
was well deserved.

734
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:51,346
<i>If you could please
send the girl out.</i>

735
01:16:53,053 --> 01:16:54,543
She's coming.

736
01:16:54,921 --> 01:16:57,014
I'm not coming.

737
01:16:57,724 --> 01:16:59,851
They need you. They won't kill you.

738
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,392
But they will kill you.

739
01:17:02,896 --> 01:17:06,161
Do I look like a man who came halfway
across Europe to die on a bridge?

740
01:17:08,401 --> 01:17:09,390
Do I?

741
01:17:18,678 --> 01:17:21,146
We don't have all day, Frank.

742
01:17:24,985 --> 01:17:26,543
Look how many of them.

743
01:17:26,753 --> 01:17:28,687
They have all the guns.

744
01:17:28,889 --> 01:17:30,049
How it's gonna be okay?

745
01:17:34,227 --> 01:17:35,524
Tell you over dinner.

746
01:17:37,197 --> 01:17:38,391
Now, go.

747
01:17:39,366 --> 01:17:40,594
Go.

748
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,529
Kiss me.

749
01:17:59,419 --> 01:18:00,909
Go.

750
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:08,352
You're gonna get me killed. Now, go.

751
01:18:33,053 --> 01:18:35,248
Get to her, you bastard.

752
01:19:00,614 --> 01:19:02,673
Better now, darling?

753
01:19:21,134 --> 01:19:22,624
Finish him.

754
01:19:42,155 --> 01:19:44,453
No! Frank!

755
01:19:55,735 --> 01:19:58,226
His beloved car will be his grave.

756
01:19:58,438 --> 01:20:01,305
Leaves it, he blows. Stays, he drowns.
Let's get out of here.

757
01:20:12,552 --> 01:20:14,543
- Tarconi.
- They have the girl.

758
01:20:15,822 --> 01:20:19,258
Frank, we are trying to track him
through the phone signal.

759
01:20:19,459 --> 01:20:21,689
- Where are you?
- In a lake.

760
01:20:22,929 --> 01:20:24,556
A lake?

761
01:20:25,065 --> 01:20:26,930
Can you be more specific?

762
01:20:27,133 --> 01:20:28,395
There's a dam.

763
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:32,004
- A dam?
- I know the place, sir.

764
01:20:32,205 --> 01:20:34,002
- How far?
- Ten minutes at least.

765
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,071
Frank, we'll be there in 10 minutes.

766
01:20:36,276 --> 01:20:37,573
Can you make it any faster?

767
01:20:38,044 --> 01:20:40,342
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you.

768
01:22:38,798 --> 01:22:40,288
Buy tickets for all of us.

769
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,299
Where to?

770
01:22:42,502 --> 01:22:46,438
Anywhere this train is going. We need
to keep moving for half an hour.

771
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,573
Why don't we just keep
driving around?

772
01:22:54,214 --> 01:22:55,613
Another day.

773
01:23:10,129 --> 01:23:12,620
Sir! There!

774
01:23:29,849 --> 01:23:33,979
- Out. Out!
- Everybody out!

775
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,619
- Come on.
- Move!

776
01:23:36,389 --> 01:23:37,913
Move, quick!

777
01:23:55,909 --> 01:23:57,570
- Mr. Minister?
- Yes.

778
01:23:58,211 --> 01:23:59,906
Someone wants to talk to you.

779
01:24:01,247 --> 01:24:03,909
- Papa.
- Are you all right?

780
01:24:08,488 --> 01:24:10,149
Don't sign.

781
01:24:10,857 --> 01:24:13,917
What you have is 15 minutes.

782
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,896
- You ever find out what this is about?
- Garbage.

783
01:24:24,103 --> 01:24:25,627
How much garbage are we talking?

784
01:24:26,572 --> 01:24:30,133
Enough to pollute half the country
for a hundred years.

785
01:24:30,343 --> 01:24:31,332
Try it again.

786
01:24:52,065 --> 01:24:55,398
For a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.

787
01:24:55,668 --> 01:24:57,329
This is the new world.

788
01:24:58,504 --> 01:25:00,768
There are no more countries.
That's old think.

789
01:25:01,207 --> 01:25:04,574
There are just economic realities.
Profit and loss.

790
01:25:04,777 --> 01:25:07,507
Efficiency and waste.

791
01:25:07,714 --> 01:25:09,705
Think global, not local.

792
01:25:10,516 --> 01:25:12,450
Think this.

793
01:25:27,266 --> 01:25:29,234
- Yes?
- Where are we?

794
01:25:36,843 --> 01:25:38,333
We're almost there.

795
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,345
Where?

796
01:25:42,548 --> 01:25:44,573
Here. He is on a train.

797
01:25:45,218 --> 01:25:47,550
- And where are we?
- Here.

798
01:25:47,754 --> 01:25:49,949
We can get units there.

799
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:53,421
That's a good idea. Do that.

800
01:25:57,397 --> 01:26:00,230
Oh, Frank, come on.

801
01:26:32,131 --> 01:26:34,691
Mr. Minister, I assure you,
everything is in order.

802
01:26:34,901 --> 01:26:36,766
I'm sure it is.

803
01:26:37,203 --> 01:26:41,037
- If there are any problems...
- I know you will solve them.

804
01:26:41,974 --> 01:26:43,874
Now, if you don't mind...

805
01:27:14,273 --> 01:27:17,800
You might not believe this,
but I am, at heart, a pacifist.

806
01:27:19,078 --> 01:27:21,137
I hate violence.

807
01:27:23,149 --> 01:27:25,947
It creates more problems
than it solves.

808
01:27:27,587 --> 01:27:30,420
You know, I never wanted
to do any of this.

809
01:27:31,924 --> 01:27:34,984
A client asked me to obtain a result...

810
01:27:35,461 --> 01:27:37,554
...so I went about creating
an environment...

811
01:27:37,763 --> 01:27:39,526
...with the least amount
of bloodshed.

812
01:27:39,732 --> 01:27:42,462
No one wanted to cooperate.
Not you, not the first driver...

813
01:27:42,668 --> 01:27:46,434
...not your father, not the
recently deceased Frank Martin.

814
01:27:47,573 --> 01:27:50,133
Everyone wanted to fight.

815
01:28:05,525 --> 01:28:06,719
What's so funny?

816
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,451
Hearing a dead man talking.

817
01:30:23,329 --> 01:30:25,263
One more step, Frank.

818
01:30:25,698 --> 01:30:27,222
Come on. One more.

819
01:31:10,843 --> 01:31:12,276
Look.

820
01:31:12,645 --> 01:31:13,669
It's over.

821
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:16,241
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

822
01:31:20,052 --> 01:31:22,145
Oh, my God.

823
01:31:27,426 --> 01:31:28,859
No, Frank. No, no.

824
01:32:09,869 --> 01:32:12,303
It's over, Frank. It's over.

825
01:32:13,572 --> 01:32:16,040
Mission accomplished.
You and the girl are free to go.

826
01:32:17,643 --> 01:32:19,975
Matter of fact,
I'm so impressed by your talent...

827
01:32:20,179 --> 01:32:21,840
...I'd like to offer you a position.

828
01:32:22,047 --> 01:32:25,346
I'd like to offer you one.
Permanently disabled.

829
01:32:44,637 --> 01:32:45,968
I hate to waste talent.

830
01:32:46,172 --> 01:32:48,470
But I really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.

831
01:32:48,674 --> 01:32:50,164
That's right.

832
01:33:13,966 --> 01:33:15,058
No!

833
01:33:19,004 --> 01:33:22,167
We wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.

834
01:33:26,745 --> 01:33:28,007
No, no.

835
01:33:39,325 --> 01:33:40,349
No!

836
01:33:41,994 --> 01:33:43,222
No!

837
01:33:58,944 --> 01:34:00,809
You're doing the right thing.

838
01:34:20,666 --> 01:34:22,395
Valentina.

839
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,768
Valentina.

840
01:34:39,084 --> 01:34:41,211
Am I in heaven?

841
01:34:44,356 --> 01:34:46,620
Looks more like we're in hell.

842
01:34:47,126 --> 01:34:48,923
I don't care.

843
01:34:49,261 --> 01:34:50,922
As long as we're there together.

844
01:35:03,275 --> 01:35:04,333
Yes?

845
01:35:04,543 --> 01:35:07,706
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

846
01:35:09,214 --> 01:35:10,806
Thank you.

847
01:35:25,331 --> 01:35:27,731
- What are you doing?
- What you said, the right thing.

848
01:35:27,933 --> 01:35:31,164
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a conference to address...

849
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:34,305
...on the dangers of doing business
with people like you.

850
01:35:34,506 --> 01:35:35,495
Thank you very much.

851
01:35:54,693 --> 01:35:55,717
Is the launch ready?

852
01:35:55,928 --> 01:35:58,260
- It's on the water, sir, waiting.
- Time to leave.

853
01:35:58,998 --> 01:36:00,329
- Grab the log.
- Okay.

854
01:36:19,451 --> 01:36:22,318
I just don't understand it.

855
01:36:22,521 --> 01:36:24,489
When I was a boy, my father and I...

856
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:28,023
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.

857
01:36:28,227 --> 01:36:29,854
Times change, inspector.

858
01:36:30,462 --> 01:36:32,191
As do people.

859
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,134
You referring to me?

860
01:36:38,704 --> 01:36:40,797
I don't think that's
a very accurate statement.

861
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:43,970
I drive the same car,
live in the same house.

862
01:36:44,176 --> 01:36:48,306
Oh, I was not referring
to your car or your house.

863
01:36:51,183 --> 01:36:53,549
The sea is so restful.

864
01:36:53,752 --> 01:36:54,912
Is lunch ready yet?

865
01:36:56,188 --> 01:36:59,487
Mademoiselle, there is
a certain progression to things.

866
01:36:59,692 --> 01:37:03,025
In order to eat the lunch,
you first have to catch the lunch.

867
01:37:03,228 --> 01:37:05,458
And if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...

868
01:37:05,664 --> 01:37:06,995
...we're gonna catch nothing.

869
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:10,930
I have better idea. Why we
don't skip catching of lunch...

870
01:37:11,136 --> 01:37:13,070
...and go right to eating of lunch?

871
01:37:13,272 --> 01:37:16,435
I know wonderful place
just up coast from here...

872
01:37:16,642 --> 01:37:19,543
...where they make fish stew.
Incredible.

873
01:37:19,745 --> 01:37:25,513
They use tomatoes and onions,
and little amount of wild lavender.

874
01:37:26,218 --> 01:37:28,118
What kind of wine?

875
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,049
Pink. From south.

876
01:37:31,356 --> 01:37:33,187
A Chteauneuf, perhaps.

877
01:37:33,659 --> 01:37:36,093
- Chilled.
- Of course, chilled.

878
01:37:36,295 --> 01:37:38,229
And for dessert?
