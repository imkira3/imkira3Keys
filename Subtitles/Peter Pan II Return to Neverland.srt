PETER: Goodbye, Wendy!

7
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,609
And then Wendy shouts back to him...

00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,445
I'll always believe in you, Peter Pan!

9
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,199
And Wendy did believe always,

even as she left childhood behind

Peter and the Lost Boys

105
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,421
captured Hook's ship
right from under his nose?

DANNY: Ooh! That's a good one!

107
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,676
WENDY: It was late one misty evening

108
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,263
and Hook was sure once again
that he'd found Peter's hideout.

109
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,266
Hook and his bloodthirsty crew
went ashore

00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,935
leaving the Jolly Roger unguarded.

He and the boys slipped aboard

WENDY: Peter told the Lost Boys
they'd hide it

117

and Hook would have to
hunt them down to get it back.

It was all a great game for Peter.

And then, from out of the mist,
he was there,

the evil Captain Hook!

121

That was fun, huh? Lost Boys, fall in!

331
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,443
LOST BOYS: Whoo!

332
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,405
Oh, careful! You're going to fall!

333
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,871
Sound off!

334
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,039
- Slightly!
- Nibs!

335
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,666
BOTH: The twins!

336
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,251
Ow!

337
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,754
- Cubby.
- And that's Toodles!

338
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,090
Oh!

(SPITTING)

340
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,803
Ew.

341
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,555
Boys, this is Jane.

342
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,015
She's gonna stay here
and be our new mother

343
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,226
- and tell us stories.
- What do you mean by...

344
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,730
- Yay! Stories!
- Tell us a story, Jane. Come on!

345
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,983
Um...

346
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,070
Actually, I'm afraid I'm not
very good at telling stories.

347
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,030
Ah, that's okay.

348
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,033
We're not very good
at listening to stories.

349
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,244
- Ooh!
- (LAUGHING)

350
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,454
I know. Let's play a game instead.

00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,582
Red rover! Red rover!

352
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,417
Nah. Something else.

353
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:30,546
Let's play the "no more hitting
Cubby on the head" game.

354
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,674
- Hey, how about a treasure hunt?
- Good idea!

355
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,759
Yeah! A treasure hunt!

356
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,511
I hid it really good this time.

357
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,764
- You guys will never find it.
- Sure we will!

358
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,977
- Diamonds and rubies!
- Treasure! Treasure!

359
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,105
- Diamonds...
- Yeah, come on!

360
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,192
- Let's go! Let's go!
- No!

361
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,614
No, no, no, and no!

362
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,912
You remind me of someone I know.

363
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,874
Oh.

364
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,255
I have to go home.

365
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,639
What's the matter with her?

366
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,392
I don't know. She acts kind of like a...

Grown-up.

Oh, dear, dear, dear, Captain.

376
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,607
A nice massage
is just the ticket for you.

377
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,027
Now, you just forget
about old Peter Pan.

Ah, the past.

- Likes when he stole your treasure.
- Ooh.

384
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,629
My treasure?

385
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,090
And then laughed in your face.

386
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,592
Laughed in my face.

387
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,637
Or today, for example,
tricking that there sea monster

388
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,098
- into pulling down your pants.
- Aah!

389
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,309
Right in front of the crew, too.

390
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,896
Right in front of the crew!

of that cursed crocodile

398
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,337
and now this!

- (SOBBING)
- Oh, there, there.

400
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,509
He's just a playful little sea urchin is all.

401
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,722
I swear, Smee,
this is propelling me to delirium.

402
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,016
I detest cephalopods.

403
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,395

Oh, you big brute, you! Off with you.

407
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,744
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
And take your arms with you.

408
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,538
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

409

At least the crocodile had manners.

Blast that scurvy boy!

This is all his fault.

Mr Smee, pipe up the crew.

413
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,477
We're going ashore to find Peter Pan!

PETER: Tink, what is she doing?

415
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,276
It looks like she's leaving.

Shh!

417
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,841
Half-dozen bananas. Check.

418
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,469
Ten coconuts. Check.

- Two oars...
- Hey, Jane.

How come you want to go home
so bad?

421
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,518
I have to get back to my family.

422
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,602
Why?

423
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,274
Well, um, I don't want to talk about it.

424
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,526
Why not?

425
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,654
If you must know, we had a fight.

426
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,573
- Why?
- Oh.

427
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,659
I told my little brother you weren't real.

428
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,827
What? Why?

429
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,247
(SIGHS) Well, oh, I don't know.

430
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,833
But I have to get back
and set things right.

431
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,626
- Why?
- Because!

432
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,336
That's why!

433
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,603
Well, you know,

434
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,187
you can't get home that way.

435
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,150
I've got to try.

436
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,863
Well,

437
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,323
goodbye.

438
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,202
It was nice meeting you, Peter Pan.

439
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,289
Duty calls.

440
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,175
Oh!

Oh, dear! Oh, no!

Whoa!

443
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,026
You okay?

444
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,737
I just want to go home.

445
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,825
Well, you know, the only way
out of here is to fly.

446
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,035
Come on, I'll show you how.

447
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,762
Step softly, you worthless dogs!

448
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,056
Set your sights for Peter Pan!

449
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,724
Oh, goodness.

450
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,520
Haven't we searched the island
a thousand times before?

451
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,107
I beg your pardon, Mr Smee?

452
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:10,278
Uh, I said that, uh,
searching for Pan is, um, uh...

Fun galore. (NERVOUS LAUGHTER)

JANE: Oh, no, Peter.

458
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,591
I really don't think this will...

459
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,513
This is ridiculous. I can't fly!

460
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,849
Well, of course you can't, but I can!

461
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,059
I guess I'm just smarter than you.

462
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,478
I highly doubt that.

463
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,231
- Braver.
- Right.

464
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,524
Stronger!

465
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,276
Oh, yeah, that's it.

466
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,862
Well, then it must be my good looks.

467
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,823
Or maybe you're full of hot air.

468

Hey! Look, anybody can do it.

469
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,453
Tink?

470
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,873
Yeah! All it takes is faith...

471
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,915
Trust.

472
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,586
And, uh, something else.

Ow!

476
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,843
Okay, Tink, let her have it.

477
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,721
Tink.

478
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,643
Gosh, Tink, if she can't fly home,

479
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,562
I guess she'll have to move in with us.

480
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,199

No, you imbecile.

We'll get me treasure and the boy.

to make you mad.

Oh, grow up. You did so.

and home to my dear, sweet mother.

But blast it all! Peter stole my treasure

564
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:06,004
and my men would mutiny if I so much
as tried to leave without it.

recover my treasure.

The treasure's useless to Peter.

He's not sensible like you and I.

And, really,
what other choice do you have?

It's not as though you could fly home.

00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:53,130
Aw. You can fly now. You can go home.

824
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,259
- I can go home.
- But...

825
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,429
- But...
- But...

826
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,180
(SNIFFLING) But...

827
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:08,312
- We'll miss you.
- Yeah. A lot.

828
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,398
And I'll miss you. All of you.

829
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:16,612
But there's someone back home
who needs me.

830
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:20,157
And besides, now I've got
great stories to tell him

831
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:23,869
and they'll all be about
Peter Pan and the Lost Boys.

832
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,912
Yeah! All right!

833
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,707
Hey, in that case...

834
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,961
Mademoiselle, it would be my pleasure
to escort you back to London.

835
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,298
The pleasure will be all mine, good sir.

836
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:37,549
Whoa!

837
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,176
Hey!

838
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,430
Well, it's a long way home.

839
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,432
Give me your best shot, Tink.

840
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,479
(ALL LAUGHING)

841
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:55,067
Whoa! Whoa!

842
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,733
(CLOCK CHIMES)

843
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,869
Oh, my gosh!

844
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,913
Mother. Mother!

845
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,498
Darling, what's wrong?

846
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,625
- Mommy!
- What is it? Oh!

847
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:59,089
Oh, you were right.
He is most remarkable.

848
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:02,718
- Who, dear?
- Oh, Mother, I'm so sorry.

849
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,595
Oh, if only I'd listened to you.

850
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,600
I had a bad dream.

851
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,730
Did you, now? Was it Hook again?

852
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:18,483
Were those pirates up
to their old tricks again?

853
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,902
Whoa! Hey! What's going on?

854
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:25,490
I know how to take care
of that old codfish.

855
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,409
- We can do it together, Danny.
- We can?

856
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,827
- The two of us.
- Really?

857
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,122
I saw him, you know.
Captain Hook kidnapped me.

858
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:35,041
Stuffed me into an old dirty bag, he did.

859
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:39,254
He took me off to Never Land
and tried to feed me to a giant octopus.

860
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,840
- Wow!
- JANE: There were pirates everywhere.

861
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:46,136
And, oh, Tinker Bell was so beautiful.

862
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,180
DANNY: You saw Tinker Bell?
JANE: Uh-huh.

863
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:52,517
But her light almost went out.
You have to be very careful.

864
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,412
- Shh!
- Huh?

865
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,544
Wendy?

866
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,547
Hello, Peter.

867
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,261
You changed.

868
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,180
Not really.

869
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,848
Not ever. (GASPS)

870
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,102
Hello, Tinker Bell.

871
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,070
Oh, Tink.

872
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,739
(GIGGLING)

873
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,246
Madam.

874
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,085
Goodbye, Wendy.

875
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,754
Goodbye, Peter.

876
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,758
Wow, look at him! It's Peter Pan!

877
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,429
(SIGHS) I'll always
believe in you, Peter Pan.

878
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,224
(TRUCK ENGINE)

879
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,311
- MAN: Here we go, then.
- Thanks, mate. I appreciate it.

880
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,396
JANE: Daddy?

881
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,523
- Daddy!
- Edward!

882
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,108
Daddy's home!

883
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:27,779
- (INDISTINCT TALKING)
- (NANATWO BARKING)

884
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,575
Come on, Tink. Let's go home.

885
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,314
(MUSIC PLAYING)

886

(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

887

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
