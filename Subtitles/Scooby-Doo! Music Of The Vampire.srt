Well, hello there. Come on.
Come, come, come. Have you a seat.

15
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,303
Kick them shoes off you.

16
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,425
Shh. But not too loud, now.

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,607
You see, me, I'm fixing to have me
some gumbo tonight.

18
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,979
And them catfish
can get mighty skittish, yeah.

00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,065
Whoa. Whoa.

20
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,614
What...? Oh, no, you don't.
You get back, you!

21
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,363
Get back, y'all loony lizards!

22
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:31,490
I'm going to have y'all for my gumbo.

23
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,623
Oh, what...?

24
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,711
Oh, that's a leech.

25
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:50,183
Oh, you cute little critter.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

26
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:57,398
You know what that was?

27
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,727
Me neither. Hoo-hoo!

28
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:03,191
But it could be one of them vampires.

29
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:05,360
They all around these parts, yeah.

30
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,533
Look here.

31
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,542
That's the jewels
of a vampire bride, y'all.

32
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:13,369
I found them down the bayou.

33
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,206
They're some kind of pretty, eh?

34
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:19,046
But let me tell y'all, she didn't
wanna get married to no vampire, no.

35
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:21,257
And who can blame her? Who would?

36
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,054
But she was forced to.

37
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,176
And then came a talking dog...

38
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:29,223
Whoop. I done almost spoiled the ending.
Heh.

39
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,768
We got to start at the beginning, cher.

40
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:37,279
And that,
that happened along way from here.

41
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,841
<i>Scooby, Shaggy,
you guys spot anything yet?</i>

42
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,683
- Uh-uh.
- Call me crazy, Scooby...

43
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:07,806
- ...but don't these pipes look familiar?
- Kind of.

44
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:10,734
Didn't we run into
that big rat creature down here?

45
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:14,435
That was two weeks ago, Shaggy,
in the New York sewers.

46
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:16,280
How could you forget?

47
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:18,607
Wasn't that the glop monster?

48
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:22,452
The glop monster was on Saturday.
Remember?

49
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:26,951
Rat creature, then glop monster,
then snake-osaurus.

50
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,460
They're all starting to merge.

51
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:32,463
Better get ready for this one, Shaggy,
because it's coming.

52
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:35,462
I know. It's coming our way.

53
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,426
That was on Saturday too.

54
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:43,971
Huh?

55
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:57,150
- Hang on.
- It's huge!

56
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:58,702
We're coming.

57
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:02,580
Whatever you do, don't let it eat you
before we get there.

58
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,165
Oh, it's just a common cockroach.

59
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,011
There is nothing common
about a cockroach.

60
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:18,507
Is it singing?

61
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,181
Not singing. Signaling.

62
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,013
Signaling to what?

63
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,265
To that cockroach.

64
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,443
Gross!

65
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:34,273
Glad I brought a giant roll of flypaper.

66
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:37,527
Oh... Unh!

67
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:47,004
There, that's better.

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,335
Or not.

69
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,692
Mr. Clapper.

70
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,649
Of course.
He was using the cockroach monster...

71
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:12,776
...to drum up customers
for his exterminator company.

72
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,403
Just as I thought, guys. Guys?

73
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,043
Ew! Get it away!

74
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:32,509
I think we could all use a nice vacation.

75
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:34,803
Vacation?

76
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:40,679
- No, Daphne.
- Don't do it. We're begging you.

77
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:43,647
I'm sorry, guys, but I have to do this.

78
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:46,606
- No!
- No!

79
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,484
Show tunes make road trips
so much better.

80
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,778
The songs do get stuck in your head.

81
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,198
Tell us about it.

82
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:56,909
Well, I don't hear Velma complaining.

83
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,709
Did you say something?

84
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,952
Oh, are we still listening to show tunes?

85
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:04,796
You all complain now, but I bet
you'll be singing along in no time.

86
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:08,172
- Ha, ha. You hear that, Scoob?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:14,423
So, Velma, you ever gonna reveal
our secret vacation destination?

88
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:15,978
Not till we get there.

89
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:17,636
You guys are gonna love it.

90
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,472
Just as long as
they've got plenty of sunshine.

91
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:25,813
There is only one thing Scooby-Doo
and I are hoping for this vacation.

133
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,843
See? Show tunes really do
help pass the time.

134
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,675
"Petit Chauve Sourie Ville"? Ooh.

135
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:25,267
Like, it sounds monster-free to me.
Hoo-hon!

136
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:27,098
Yeah, up top.

137
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:29,149
What does the French translate to?

138
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,358
Oh, it means "Little Bat Town."

139
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:34,020
- Uh-oh.
- Not to worry, Scoob.

140
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:38,197
Velma promised us this place would be
ghost-, ghoul-, and goblin-free.

141
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:40,819
What? Whoa!

142
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,550
Hey, I'm stalking here! I'm stalking here!

143
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:57,505
She didn't say anything about vampires.

144
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,713
Didn't I?

145
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,383
Mm, must've slipped my mind.

146
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,730
Shaggy, Scooby, you can come out.

147
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:06,477
It was just a kid in a costume.

148
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:08,894
Like, you sure?

149
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:13,068
Absolutely. He's probably just here
for the vampire festival.

150
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:14,861
Oh.

151
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:16,234
Vampire festival?

152
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:21,825
Yup, Vampire Palooza.

153
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,754
You brought us to a vampire convention?

154
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:27,251
To relax?

155
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:28,882
Not a vampire convention.

156
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,720
It's a celebration of all things vampiric.

157
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:36,097
Cool. And what better place
to experience it than Little Bat Town.

158
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:40,597
Ooh! Vampires are so romantic.
Have you read <i>Silverlight</i>?

159
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:45,274
Twelve times. I'm hoping
the author will be here to sign it.

160
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,437
Are we missing something here?

161
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:52,240
Like, what's so romantic about
undead creatures who sleep in coffins...

162
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:55,612
...prowl the night in search of victims,
steal their blood...

163
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,789
...and turn them
into their zombie servants?

164
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:01,165
Oh, those are old-school vampires.

165
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:03,910
Modern vampires are fun and super-cool.

166
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,748
Vampires don't sleep in coffins any more.

167
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:08,087
They sleep in Seattle.

168
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,805
- You're not making us feel better.
- Uh-uh.

169
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:16,019
Says here this place was founded
in the 19th century...

170
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:20,599
...by Abraham Van Helsing, the famous
vampire hunter of Dracula fame.

171
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,943
And it's still owned by
one of the Van Helsings' descendants.

172
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:26,272
So it's like a ghost town.

173
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:29,112
No, a vampire ghost town.

174
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:34,744
This is the last time
we let you pick the vacation spot.

175
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,990
- Yeah.
- Relax, guys.

176
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:38,994
There's absolutely nothing to fear.

177
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,994
Hey, Scoob,
when have we heard that before?

178
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:47,425
Every day of our lives.

179
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,008
You guys worry too much.

180
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,758
Well, we're not the only ones.

181
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:59,521
This fair is an abomination,
an affront to all that is good and decent.

182
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,942
Sign the petition to ban vampires?

183
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:06,690
- Like, that's a cause we can support.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

184
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:09,784
Here there be demons.

185
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:13,204
Here there also be corn dogs.

186
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,832
Fools. Fools, I say.

187
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:25,127
Will you allow temptation to lure you
into the fangy den of the bloodsucker?

188
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,390
Pretty much. Corn dogs!

189
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:30,218
Corn dogs, yum.

190
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:36,730
Hey, Scoob, if the food's this good
outside the festival...

191
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:40,234
...I can't wait to see
what they've got inside.

192
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:43,524
Guys, there's no such thing
as real vampires.

193
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:44,731
Mm.

194
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:47,316
No such thing
as paying customers either.

195
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:52,240
Five more complimentary passes.
I'll be lucky to break even this year.

196
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:55,584
Like, not exactly the kind of bite
I'm looking for.

197
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,915
We're guests of Vincent Van Helsing.

198
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,172
- He owns...
- Yes, yes.

199
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:03,384
I'm Lita Rutland, owner of the festival.

200
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,007
I know who Van Helsing is.
Unfortunately no one else does.

201
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:22,149
Imagine a vampire author
in these vampire-crazed times...

202
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:23,736
...who doesn't sell any books.

203
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,869
Maybe he's just having an off day.

204
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,706
Yeah, maybe.

205
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:31,118
He's still one of the foremost authorities
on vampire history.

206
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:35,542
Perhaps, but the world's moved on
from his old-school vampire tales.

207
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:37,957
Well, I've read all his books.

208
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:39,297
I think.

209
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:45,176
Well, you kids enjoy your free lunch. I
mean, your time here at Vampire Palooza.

210
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:46,382
She's friendly.

211
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,059
Velma.

212
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:54,022
It's good to see a familiar face.

213
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:58,274
And this must be the rest
of the famous mystery-hunting crew.

214
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,649
Guys, I'd like you to meet our host...

215
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:03,491
...the world's foremost expert
on vampires...

216
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:05,662
...Vincent Van Helsing.

217
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:09,283
A pleasure.
You know, I'm also an author.

218
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,417
Perhaps you've read my books?

219
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,795
My vampire tales are fact-based.

220
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:17,798
And not that lusty teen tripe
that's all the rage these days.

221
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:21,678
Yeah, that modern stuff is way lame.

222
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,009
Hey, did you guys know
Mr. Van Helsing...

223
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,686
...is the great-great-great-grandson
of Abraham Van Helsing?

224
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,773
Wow, a direct descendant...

225
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:33,809
- ...of the famous vampire hunter for real?
- It's true.

226
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:38,151
My family has been in the vampire
business for a long time.

227
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,492
That's why I became a vampirologist.

228
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,204
A vampire-what-igist?

229
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:48,873
Uh, vampirology is the academic study
of the vampire from A to Z.

230
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,371
Come, I'll show you.

231
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:55,625
My collection of vampire artifacts...

232
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:59,173
...go back to the very dawn
of the vampire.

233
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:01,508
This stuff is fang-tastic.

234
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,887
Heh. Get it?
I used the word "fang" instead of "fan."

235
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:07,645
We get it.

236
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:11,102
Wow, the ancient book of vampire.

237
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:14,232
I thought only one copy
of this existed in the world.

238
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:15,818
You're looking at it.

239
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:18,444
Check out these awesome stakes.

240
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:21,192
- Steaks? Where?
- Yummy.

241
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:26,201
- Oh, those kinds of stakes.
- Aw.

242
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:31,174
Look at these vampire jewels. Gorgeous.

243
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:34,427
Those belonged
to an actual Vampire's bride...

244
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,924
...in ancient Walachia.

245
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:39,599
Looks like she scored
a wealthy vampire husband.

246
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:41,347
They're quite priceless.

247
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:46,100
But those stones don't compare
to the real jewel of my collection.

248
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:49,563
A face to launch 100 million fears.

249
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:54,235
I bring you the dreaded vampire
Lord Valdronya.

250
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:58,782
Entombed in glass
for nigh a thousand years.

251
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,246
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow!

252
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:02,578
Awesome.

253
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:09,756
- Looks fake to me.
- Me too.

254
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,935
The vampire lives!

255
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:21,812
Guys, don't be ridiculous.

256
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:24,521
- His eyes were glowing!
Mm-hm.

257
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:27,813
You'll have to excuse them.
They tend to be slightly excitable.

258
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:30,319
Perfectly understandable.

259
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:34,571
Lord Valdronya was quite
the fearsome fellow in his day.

260
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,119
We're lucky he's sealed under glass now.

261
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:40,498
This glass is so murky.

262
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:45,629
- Ah, Velma, always the skeptic.
- Eh, it's my thing.

263
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:48,796
Even if the vampire were alive,
he wouldn't get anywhere.

264
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:50,964
This glass is 6 inches thick.

265
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:54,057
If only Valdronya would wake...

266
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:58,353
...I'd have tourists filling this place
like back in the day.

267
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,598
And I wouldn't have
to rent my property...

268
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:05,152
...to Lita Rutland's
traveling vampire festival just to get by.

269
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:06,483
Sounds rough.

270
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:10,701
Lita's threatened to pull out next year
if things don't pick up.

271
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:15,164
I'm afraid I may not be able
to save my family's legacy.

272
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,205
Then again,
you never know what will happen.

273
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:21,663
Maybe my latest book
will become a best seller.

274
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:24,337
You write books? That's fu... Ow.

275
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:28,377
- Don't we have a show to see?
- Ah, yes. We'd better get going.

276
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:31,592
The vampires await.

277
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,224
Wait for us!

278
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:46,194
Our tickets are
being held in the box office. Wait here.

279
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:48,111
I'll be right back.

280
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:49,910
"Fangenschanz."

281
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,825
Fangenschanz?

282
00:18:51,985 --> 00:18:53,077
I've heard of them.

283
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:57,033
They're supposed to be the most amazing
vampire-themed theater troupe ever.

284
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,963
Here, Scoob.
Wear this garlic for protection.

285
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,501
- Vampires hate it.
- Yeah.

286
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,761
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't bring garlic in here.

287
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:13,136
"No wooden stakes, garlic
or flash photography."

288
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:18,396
Huh. Well, I hate to let
perfectly good food go to waste.

289
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,116
No garlic on us.

290
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:30,497
Ugh. Gross. Just go inside.

291
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:33,241
Weirdos.

292
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,337
Hello.

293
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,264
Ew, someone's wearing
some stanky perfume.

294
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:52,851
- I don't smell it. Do you, Scoob?
- Nope.

295
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:54,303
According to the program...

296
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,647
...the members of Fangenschanz are so
dedicated to the vampire lifestyle...

297
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,316
...they perform only at night.

298
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:02,739
Method actors.

299
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:13,293
Ladies and gentle mortals,
it's feeding time.

Yeah!

326
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:53,150
What? I'm just showing my appreciation.

327
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,080
We welcome you,
friends and potential blood donors.

328
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,953
And while we are mere performers,
be warned.

329
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,542
If you fear the sight of a real living
vampire, please, leave now.

330
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,248
That's our cue.

331
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,799
Too late.

332
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:25,316
And now for the first time on any stage,
we shall attempt the unheard of:

333
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:28,568
The Vampire's return from the grave.

334
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:33,529
Wow, he's very good.

335
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,192
Don't you guys think he's good?
Like, good?

336
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:37,401
Meh.

337
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:42,408
Behold the ancient talisman
of the immortal blood-drinkers.

338
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:47,000
Take heed, for the mortal world
shall soon be invaded.

339
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:54,631
<i>Blackest rose, wolf and bane
Bats and crows.</i>

340
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:58,143
That spell is from
the ancient book of vampire.

341
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,181
These jokers are playing
with supernatural fire.

342
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,340
What the...?

343
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:43,395
It's working?

344
00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:47,521
Uh... Uh...

345
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:53,494
This is bad. This is very bad.

346
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,748
That's not Henry.

347
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:06,751
Oh, no.

348
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:30,446
Whoa.

349
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:41,958
- Next year, we're going to Miami.
- Yeah.

350
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:46,963
I was getting ready before the show
when I was attacked by that vampire.

351
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:48,301
Are you sure?

352
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,931
Unless you know someone else with
massive fangs and glowing green eyes.

353
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:57,399
I guess he put me under some sort of spell
and I passed out.

354
00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:01,937
That resurrection chant
was from the ancient book of vampire.

355
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:04,274
Where on earth did you learn it?

356
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:06,532
Um, the Internet.

357
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:12,078
Well, I am afraid you may have unleashed
an unholy terror upon us all.

358
00:25:12,237 --> 00:25:15,086
Maybe we shouldn't
jump to conclusions just yet.

359
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:17,461
Yeah, I'm sure this nice young man...

360
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:20,503
Uh, I didn't get your name. Oh.

361
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:24,175
Bram. And you are?

362
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:28,049
Bram. I mean, Daphne.

363
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:30,551
I'm not Bram, you are. Ha-ha-ha.

364
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,769
Oh. What were we talking about?

365
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,986
We were saying we don't know for sure
that Valdronya escaped from his tomb.

366
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:41,444
Oh. Uh, we should check that out.

367
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:42,815
You kids go ahead.

368
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:47,864
I'll stick around here to have a word
with the actors.

369
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:53,211
You guys can't hide forever.

370
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:57,164
Care to try us?
- No. Let's go.

371
00:26:02,252 --> 00:26:03,722
- Careful.
- Unh.

372
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:08,139
- He's been bitten.
- Hmm. Maybe. Or...

373
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,854
We've got bigger problems.

374
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:13,686
Unh. This lid is still sealed tight.

375
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:16,697
Well, that vampire couldn't have
just walked through the glass.

376
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:21,741
The vampire queen's jewels are gone.

377
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:23,288
Jinkies.

378
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,324
Duck!

379
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:31,246
No, bat!

380
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,417
Such beauty and innocence...

381
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,764
...with the countenance of a queen.

382
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:43,472
My queen.

383
00:26:43,631 --> 00:26:46,100
Your queen?

384
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,599
I don't think so.

385
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:05,165
Yeah, there's no such thing
as real vampires, until now.

386
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:11,125
There's a beast on the loose,
a spawn of the netherworld.

387
00:27:11,286 --> 00:27:16,590
I say it's time we shut this foul fair down
for the good of the community.

388
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:24,766
Uh, set it up over there
by that rabble rouser.

389
00:27:25,928 --> 00:27:28,776
Hello, Kelly Smith
from <i>KDTV Action 10 News.</i>

390
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:32,937
Looks like someone spilled the beans
about our escaped vampire.

391
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:35,403
The audience thought
it was all part of the show.

392
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:38,281
- Hope you're not implying my performers-
- I leaked it.

393
00:27:38,442 --> 00:27:39,533
You? But..

394
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:42,327
This could be just the thing we need
to boost attendance.

395
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:45,951
Ah. They do say there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

396
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:50,340
That's the spirit. Now,
which would you say is my good side?

397
00:27:50,788 --> 00:27:54,846
I am so relieved
that none of you kids were hurt last night.

398
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:58,216
Not physically,
but the mental wounds run deep.

399
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,765
Yeah, run deep.

400
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:05,682
Those foolish actors have no idea
the monster they've set loose.

401
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:08,185
We can't be certain this is their doing.

402
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,936
Or that we've got a real vampire
on our hands.

403
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:13,190
Did you check the museum's
security system?

404
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:15,408
Yep, the cameras recorded nothing.

405
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:20,158
System's on the fritz, but I just
can't afford to fix it right now.

406
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,208
Let's say it is a real vampire.

407
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,869
How did he escape that sealed tomb?

408
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:29,584
A living vampire can transform into mist.

409
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,046
All it would need
is a tiny gap in the glass.

410
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,722
This could all be a diversion
to steal those jewels. Just saying.

411
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,851
Oh, what a night.

412
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,930
Thanks for letting me sleep here, boss.

413
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:44,440
No problem, Daniel.
I hope you're feeling better.

414
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,734
Neck's a little sore,
but other than that...

415
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,784
The bite of the beast.

416
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,908
He could turn batty any second.

417
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:59,416
Doubtful. If he had been bitten
by a vampire, could he survive this?

418
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,249
Sunlight makes a vampire explode.

419
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,252
Wow, gorgeous day outside.

420
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:08,261
- Huh?
- He didn't crumble to dust.

421
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:13,639
He could be one of the rare few with
an antibody resistant to vampire venom.

422
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:15,388
Or he wasn't bitten at all.

423
00:29:15,548 --> 00:29:18,267
Those look more like blisters than bites.

424
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:22,062
When you were attacked, did it feel like...

425
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:25,070
...oh, I don't know,
a thousand volts of electricity?

426
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:28,405
Uh, actually, yeah. How'd you know?

427
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:30,865
I volunteer at the police academy
on weekends.

428
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:33,789
If there's one thing I know,
it's Taser burns.

429
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,951
That tickles.

430
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:42,871
- Pretty good detective work, pal.
- Thanks.

431
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:45,967
Well, we also found your Taser
lying on the ground next to you.

432
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,879
I must've tripped and zapped myself.
Huh.

433
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:52,810
Weird.
I'd better go put that in my report.

434
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:56,927
That explains the bite marks,
but how do you explain the vampire?

435
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,606
So many questions.
It's quite the conundrum.

436
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,402
A real whodunit.

437
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,647
We'll need to put our heads together
on this one.

438
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,282
Uh-oh.

439
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,444
I know where this is going.

440
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:13,613
Yep, I'd say we've got a real live
boney fide mystery on our hands.

441
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,238
Eyewitness accounts aside...

442
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:18,504
...we've had no confirmation
of the supposed vampires' existence...

443
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,583
...from anyone associated with the fair.

444
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:22,502
You want confirmation?

445
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,582
No one is safe.

446
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:27,135
I'm here to tell you
from firsthand experience...

447
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,016
...that vampires bite.

448
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:31,675
So much for keeping this
on the down-low.

Looks like Lita's little
press conference was good for business.

479
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:26,720
Aah! Vampire!

480
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:28,475
Where? Where?

481
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,645
Fred, don't tell me
you're buying into the hype.

482
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,742
Of course not.

483
00:32:38,897 --> 00:32:40,654
Want a bite of this garlic pizza?

484
00:32:40,817 --> 00:32:43,913
It has magical protective powers.

485
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:50,876
Having a vampire on the loose is the best
thing that's ever happened to this festival.

486
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,171
Hasn't boosted my book sales.

487
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:58,713
- It just did.
- Why, thank you, Lita.

488
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:00,136
You want it signed?

489
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:02,349
Sure, make it out to "receptacle."

490
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:04,684
Trash receptacle.

491
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,355
- Huh?
- Ha-ha-ha!

492
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:10,356
Hey!

493
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:14,360
It's getting so you can't find a safe place
to hide anywhere.

494
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:19,527
Vampires are all around us, people.
Now, keep alert.

495
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:22,707
You hear that, Scoob?
Let's move, move, move.

496
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:25,912
Hey, Poubelle,
I told you to get off the property.

497
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:28,330
You're scaring away the customers.

498
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:32,173
<i>I'm here with Jesper Poubelle from the
Society for Moral and Wholesome Living.</i>

499
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,547
<i>Jesper, how can people slay safe
from vampire attacks?</i>

500
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,347
<i>They can join in our crusade of moral
righteousness against supernatural evil.</i>

501
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:45,305
<i>Together we can stamp out
the vampire scourge.</i>

502
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,358
I've heard enough.

503
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:50,531
That guy is becoming
quite the media star.

504
00:33:50,685 --> 00:33:53,533
More like milking the situation
for everything it's worth.

505
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:56,738
I think it's time
we pay Mr. Poubelle a visit.

506
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:02,702
That's right. This is
a certifiable, undeniable crisis, people.

507
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:07,421
It is high time we institute
a dusk-to-dawn curfew.

508
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:11,045
I'll keep Poubelle occupied.
You guys see what you can dig up.

509
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,714
...Overreacting.

510
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:18,596
But ignore this warning
and you'll be knocking on the doors to...

511
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:23,232
Shaggy, you and Scooby stand watch.
If anyone comes, tap on the door.

512
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:25,308
We're in.

513
00:34:29,354 --> 00:34:31,026
Wow, what a wreck.

514
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:35,863
They may be moral and wholesome,
but they're not very clean.

515
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:39,206
We've got hundreds of reports
of vampire sightings.

516
00:34:39,364 --> 00:34:43,126
Couldn't people be imagining these things
because you're causing them to panic?

517
00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:45,455
I didn't create the evil.

518
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:49,762
Maybe not, but you sure seem to be eager
to take advantage of it.

519
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,718
Young lady, your questions
were not cleared with my staff.

520
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,551
Someone check her credentials.

521
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:56,886
Uh, I think I left them in the car.

522
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:59,688
Fred, I found something.

523
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:02,811
Ew, I hope it's not more spiders.

524
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,946
"Poubelle for mayor"?

525
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,497
What are you two doing back here?

526
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,714
- Um, uh...
- Uh... Uh...

527
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,007
- We're, uh...
- We're door inspectors.

528
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,549
Stand back. This one might explode.

529
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,509
Doors don't explo...

530
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,349
Why'd you signal?

531
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,686
Stay right where you are.

532
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:38,062
Run away!

533
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:46,443
Get in!

534
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:49,360
Hey, stop that thing! Stop!

535
00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:59,545
Poubelle is running for office.

536
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:01,092
That explains a lot.

537
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,964
He's using the vampire to get attention
for his movement...

538
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:05,929
...and boost his upcoming campaign.

539
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:09,217
Still, it isn't proof
he's behind the vampire attacks.

540
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,932
He's just using them to his advantage.

541
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,061
This fog is like soup.

542
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:17,815
Maybe you should let me drive.

543
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,061
I'm good. Sort of enjoying it.

544
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:48,386
Daphne, look out!

545
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:51,603
Brace yourselves!

546
00:36:59,937 --> 00:37:02,618
That opening is too tight.
We won't make it.

547
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:16,838
I'm telling you, Poubelle,
you can't come in here.

548
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:18,586
You're scaring off my customers.

549
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:24,099
And I'm telling you, I've got a special
dispensation from the sheriff himself.

550
00:37:24,254 --> 00:37:25,466
That's right, Ms. Rutland.

551
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,479
By order of the court,
I have recruited these gentlemen.

552
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:32,775
We are hereby deputized
vampire hunters.

553
00:37:35,976 --> 00:37:39,156
Vampire hunters, ho!

554
00:37:39,313 --> 00:37:40,606
- All right.
- Let's go.

555
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:48,411
Who would actually fall
for that scaremonger's rantings?

556
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:51,160
They say there's a fraidycat
born every minute.

557
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:55,254
Ah, there you are. I got us all
neck protectors, just to be safe.

558
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:56,801
I see your point, Velma.

559
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:58,630
Hey, where are Scooby and Shaggy?

560
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:01,344
They went to the food court
to calm their nerves.

561
00:38:01,504 --> 00:38:03,225
Heh. Those guys are so jumpy.

562
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:06,811
Yaah! A vampire!

563
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,190
The food court should be right here
behind the theater.

564
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:16,531
Unless the map is upside down.

565
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,536
Careful. Damage anything
and we're as good as dead.

566
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:28,876
What are you doing back here?
This is a restricted area.

567
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:32,547
We're just looking for the food court.

568
00:38:32,706 --> 00:38:33,879
Uh-oh.

569
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,460
- We can't let them go.
- What if they tell someone...

570
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:38,798
- ...what they've seen?
- You're right.

571
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:40,766
Uh, what have we seen?

572
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:42,891
Scooby, I think we're in...

573
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,226
Hey, look, a Hollywood talent scout.

574
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:52,899
I think we lost them.

575
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:55,689
Huh?

576
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:59,736
We better find that food court, Scoob
Your tummy's grumbling.

577
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,907
Not mine.

578
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,827
Well, it isn't mine.

579
00:39:07,994 --> 00:39:10,497
Stay back or I'll be forced to use this.

580
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,378
Maybe later!

581
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,761
I've been bitten by a vampire!

582
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,943
Look, Mama, a real vampire.

583
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:58,805
Incoming!

584
00:40:05,307 --> 00:40:09,319
Phew. He's gone, Scoob.
And I'm a goner.

585
00:40:09,478 --> 00:40:11,734
I've been bitten by a vampire.

586
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:15,576
I'll probably sprout fangs any second
and...

587
00:40:15,736 --> 00:40:17,622
Is this ketchup?

588
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,706
Bloodsuckers!

589
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:23,960
Where?

590
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,171
That one shape-shifted into a dog.

591
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:27,375
Uh-oh.

592
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:29,842
- I think they mean us.
- Get them!

593
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,063
Appears we lost
them crafty shape-shifters.

594
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:43,519
I guess we best head back
before our torches burn out.

595
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:45,190
- Yeah.
- All right.

596
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:47,605
Oh, well. Maybe next time.

597
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:53,869
Ah. Phew. We're safe, Scoob.
Except for the fact we're lost in a swamp.

598
00:40:54,028 --> 00:40:57,207
And I could turn into a vampire
at any moment.

599
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:14,720
Check out my bite. Is it bad?

600
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:22,398
Don't sugarcoat it. I know I'm done for.

601
00:41:22,768 --> 00:41:26,232
You should get out of here
before I turn all bat-ified.

602
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:29,358
Uh-uh. I'm not going.

603
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:32,989
Once the vampire venom
takes hold of my system...

604
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:36,786
...there's no guarantee
I won't sink my fangs into you.

605
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:38,671
We have to split up, Scoob.

606
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:40,418
No, Shaggy. No.

607
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,169
It's the only way to save yourself.

608
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:47,045
Just turn away from me
and don't look back.

609
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:52,477
I can't.

610
00:41:57,764 --> 00:42:01,111
I guess I'll have to do this myself.

611
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,156
Huh?

612
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,279
Goodbye, old friend.

613
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:09,954
I hope one day you'll see that
this is best for both of us.

614
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,119
Shaggy?

615
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:21,542
One foot in front of the other.

616
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,639
Don't look back. Don't ever look...

617
00:42:39,811 --> 00:42:41,282
I looked back.

618
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:59,009
- Shaggy.
- Promise you'll never leave me, Scoob.

619
00:42:59,165 --> 00:43:00,804
Never.

620
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:08,435
Wha...? What are you doing?

621
00:43:08,593 --> 00:43:11,808
Checking for vampire symptoms.
Say "ah."

622
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:13,015

hereby issuing a dusk-to-dawn curfew.

- No one is to be out past dark.
- Yes!

Now that is more like it.

661
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:10,482
This extreme measure is seen as a victory
for local anti-vampire crusader...

<i>- Don't give up</i>

00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:06,958
<i>We're not the same as you.</i>

681
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:08,761
<i>Where would I be without you?</i>

682
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,506
<i>Scooby and me We always will be.</i>

683
00:46:12,672 --> 00:46:15,602
<i>- Together forever as friends.

<i>- The pal on which a buddy depends.

686
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:23,898
<i>They are the ones
They're evil and bad.</i>

687
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:26,859
<i>Watch out for them
They're crazy and mad.</i>

688
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,235
<i>What do you do when there's vampires
Where there shouldn't be?</i>

689
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,819
<i>- Listen to me.
- You can't do this to me.</i>

690
00:46:32,985 --> 00:46:34,243
<i>Doesn't anyone see?</i>

691
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:35,531
<i>Why'd this happen to me?</i>

692
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:39,707
<i>It's always going to be
Scooby and me</i>

693
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,755
Scooby, I think we've got company.

694
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:56,390
<i>But critics call the move shortsighted and
a slinging blow to the local economy.</i>

695
00:46:57,847 --> 00:47:01,477
<i>It's an assault on capitalism.
Disgusting.</i>

696
00:47:01,642 --> 00:47:04,572
<i>This is the last time I bring my fair
to this Podunk town.</i>

697
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,997
Without the income from Lita's festival,
there's no way I can keep this place afloat.

698
00:47:11,152 --> 00:47:12,577
I'm ruined.

699
00:47:12,738 --> 00:47:16,083
We'll try to solve this mystery
before Lita packs up for good.

700
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:17,962
Thank you, Velma.

701
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,206
I'm really lucky to have you kids here.

702
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,794
Hey, guys.

703
00:47:21,956 --> 00:47:23,796
I'm worried about Shaggy and Scooby.

704
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:25,762
I haven't seen them since last night.

705
00:47:25,919 --> 00:47:29,300
They probably got spooked by
their own shadows and hid out all night.

706
00:47:29,464 --> 00:47:31,470
I just hope the vampire didn't get them.

707
00:47:31,634 --> 00:47:34,315
I highly doubt we're dealing
with a real vampire.

708
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:35,598
Show him, Daphne.

709
00:47:36,014 --> 00:47:39,609
I found this in the Mystery Machine.
It's a piece of the Vampire's cloak.

710
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:41,773
I must've torn it loose
when he attacked us.

711
00:47:42,812 --> 00:47:44,949
What's an old piece of fabric
gonna prove?

712
00:47:45,106 --> 00:47:46,318
It's not old.

713
00:47:46,483 --> 00:47:51,620
It's clearly poly-krillion, a synthetic
material first produced in 1997.

714
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,584
Girlfriend knows her fabrics.

715
00:47:54,951 --> 00:47:59,674
So the vampire, or whatever it was,
probably isn't a thousand years old.

716
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:01,041
Oh, what a relief.

717
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:05,004
I mean, not that I thought
we were dealing with a real vampire.

718
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,807
That would be dumb to think that.

719
00:48:07,757 --> 00:48:09,512
Actually I must confess...

720
00:48:09,675 --> 00:48:13,983
...the outfit Valdronya was wearing
in his tomb was new.

721
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:17,852
How? You said he was sealed in his tomb
for a thousand years.

722
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:21,197
Yes, but his clothing
had disintegrated overtime.

723
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:27,372
We unsealed him briefly for authentication
and in the name of modesty.

724
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:32,880
Valdronya's clothing had disintegrated,
but he didn't. That's odd.

725
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:37,675
A vampire is a living being,
even in a state of slumber.

726
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,880
This is what's left
of his original garments.

727
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,015
Antique Asian silk.

728
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,351
Spun gold markings.
The thick hand weave.

729
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,522
Fabric like this hasn't been made
for 500 years.

730
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:53,522
Valdronya is still out there.

731
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:56,063
Think I'll just grab these things.

732
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:03,241
I'm afraid those actors unleashed
an unholy terror upon us all.

733
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:05,704
Yes, the actors.

734
00:49:05,862 --> 00:49:08,543
Ooh. I'll go check them out.

735
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,587
I bet you will.

736
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:13,461
Freddy, do I detect a little
twinge of jealousy?

737
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:18,877
Me, jealous of some vitamin D-deprived,
historical vampire reenactment nuts?

738
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:22,214
Maybe I should go with you.

739
00:49:22,381 --> 00:49:25,512
No, thanks.
I'm well prepared to handle Bram.

740
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:28,310
Uh... I mean, the actors. Bye.

741
00:49:30,348 --> 00:49:31,391
Hmm.

742
00:49:35,186 --> 00:49:38,236
Hello? Anyone in here?

743
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,389
Strange place for a laser projector.

744
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:15,485
Bram. Don't sneak up on a girl like that.

745
00:50:15,647 --> 00:50:17,487
I wasn't the one sneaking.

746
00:50:17,649 --> 00:50:21,660
You looking for something or someone?

747
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:24,834
Actually, I... Do you sleep up there?

748
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:28,955
To know the vampire,
you must become the vampire.

749
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,465
Hm. You're really committed.

750
00:50:31,623 --> 00:50:34,092
It's the role I was meant for.

751
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:38,475
So do you lurk around
darkened theaters often?

752
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:40,222
More than you know.

753
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:43,231
Well, there's something
we have in common...

754
00:50:43,386 --> 00:50:46,485
- ...right off the bat.
- Cute.

755
00:50:47,182 --> 00:50:50,148
Grab on. I'll teach you to fly.

756
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:53,320
I don't know. Promise not to drop me?

757
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:56,366
Only a fool would drop a girl like you.

758
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:58,199
Smooth.

759
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:04,880
Wow, this is amazing.

760
00:51:05,036 --> 00:51:06,708
It's fate that brought you here.

761
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:10,302
Destiny. A cosmic occurrence.

762
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:12,593
A vision foretold.

763
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:14,344
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

764
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:19,595
Bram, I think you're very interesting,
but you're one cliché from my limit.

765
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:21,148

00:53:18,098 --> 00:53:19,356
Points for trying though.

803
00:53:19,517 --> 00:53:21,689
This makes us very unhappy.

804
00:53:21,853 --> 00:53:24,357
Well, I'm sorry, but... Us?

805
00:53:30,864 --> 00:53:33,200
Seize the Vampire's bride.

806
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:34,707
The what?

807
00:53:54,848 --> 00:53:56,022
Where are we?

808
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:58,734
No clue, Scoob. Not that it matters.

809
00:53:58,895 --> 00:54:02,906
This swamp is as good a home as any
for a vampire and his canine pal.

810
00:54:03,858 --> 00:54:07,073
- Except for the leeches.
- Leeches?

811
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:17,585
But, hey, we won't let a few little leeches
spoil things, will we, Scoob?

812
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:19,089
No way.

813
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:25,262
Snake!

814
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:28,350
Gators!

815
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:34,019
Crawdads!

816
00:54:34,182 --> 00:54:36,864
Snakes and gators and crawdads.
Oh, my.

817
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,448
I think we need a new life plan,
Scooby-Don.

818
00:54:40,606 --> 00:54:42,197
Shaggy, look.

819
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:46,500
A tin shack. It's a dream come true.

820
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:54,795
Remember, Scoob, don't say anything
about me being a vampire.

821
00:54:54,955 --> 00:54:56,297
Okay.

822
00:54:57,458 --> 00:55:02,466
- Company? Come on in, cher. Hoo-hon!
- Whoa!

823
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,095
Sit you down a spell
while I put on that gumbo.

824
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,304
Gumbo?

825
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,103
Like, man, our luck has changed, Scoob.

826
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,733
My name's Tulie.

827
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,316
That's not my real name, no.

828
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:18,987
But that's what it say on the shack,
so I go with that. Hoo-hon!

829
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:29,129
Hon! Look at that right there.
Now we cooking some kind of yeah.

830
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,086
How come you live way out here
in the middle of nowhere?

831
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:36,258
Well, if you must know, I'm on the run.

832
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:38,838
- From what?
- Vampires!

833
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:41,425
Ooh, I hate them, me.

834
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:46,681
And if I ever catch me one,
I'm going to grind his bones for stew.

835
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:48,685
Maybe we should be going.

836
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:50,605
Stay right there.

837
00:55:50,768 --> 00:55:52,689
It's gumbo time.

838
00:55:54,355 --> 00:55:55,909
Ah.

839
00:55:58,611 --> 00:56:01,457
Well, I wasn't always a crazy old hermit.

840
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:06,038
I used to be a handsome inventor
of fantastical devices.

841
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:08,373
Oh, yeah? What'd you invent?

842
00:56:08,537 --> 00:56:11,919
Gadgets, whatchamacallits, thingamajigs.
Stuff that go:

843
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,088
Buzz, buzz, hoppity-hoppity, hoop!

844
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:17,468
I had me a little shop over there
at Petit Chauve Sourie Ville...

845
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:18,972
...where I sold things...

846
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:24,815
...the most popular item being a hat
with two cup holders and along straw...

847
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:29,232
...so you could have two soda pops
while you're watching that ball game.

848
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:33,072
Like, wow, ha, ha,
you invented the drinky hat?

849
00:56:34,732 --> 00:56:37,154
No, but I sold them in the store.

850
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,373
Ain't nobody ever bought my inventions
because, like I said, they mostly just went.

851
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,205
Bleep, bleep, bloop, bloop,
hoop, hoop.

852
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:48,248
But then I created
the greatest invention ever:

853
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:50,918
Flying shoes.

854
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:53,469
They're based on the same principle
as a hover boat.

855
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:56,428
But the fans be pointed down
to lift you off the ground.

856
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,180
Whoo-whoo-whoo! There you go.

857
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:01,143
And I was all set to show them
to a big shoe company...

858
00:57:01,304 --> 00:57:05,446
...when a vampire attacked me
and stole the prototypes.

859
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,566
Well, I filed me an insurance claim.

860
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:11,943
But it turns out
they don't cover vampire attacks.

861
00:57:12,274 --> 00:57:13,402
Hoo-hon.

862
00:57:13,568 --> 00:57:14,779
That's awful.

863
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:16,118
More, please.

864
00:57:16,278 --> 00:57:17,369
Me too.

865
00:57:17,531 --> 00:57:19,286
I was ruined, y'all.

866
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:22,214
I've been living out here
in the swamp ever since.

867
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:25,466
And that is why
I hates me them vampires.

868
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:27,878
Like, how long ago did this happen?

869
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:31,638
I don't know, long as
I've been growing these here whiskers.

870
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,599
Maybe two, three weeks now.

871
00:57:33,756 --> 00:57:34,930
Oh, well, that's life.

872
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:38,271
You know, sometime you lose everything
on account of vampires...

873
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:40,018
...sometime you don't. Ha, ha.

874
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:41,391
How y'all like the gumbo?

875
00:57:41,557 --> 00:57:42,815
Amazing.

876
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:47,198
Amazing. Mm-mm-mm.

877
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,654
Yeah.

878
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:51,745
That's because of my special ingredient.
Heh.

879
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:55,034
Leeches.
I likes to put them leech in the gumbo.

880
00:57:55,198 --> 00:57:58,162
Leech gumbo. Yum. That's good, yeah.

881
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:06,669
Thanks for everything.

882
00:58:06,835 --> 00:58:09,848
Y'all come back anytime!

883
00:58:14,217 --> 00:58:19,142
Look at this. The stolen jewels are part of
some sort of vampire wedding ceremony.

884
00:58:19,307 --> 00:58:21,358
The vampire bonding ritual.

885
00:58:21,517 --> 00:58:25,824
According to legend, if the vampire
takes the soul of his mortal bride...

886
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,317
...he'll gain unbridled power.

887
00:58:28,483 --> 00:58:31,283
The ceremony must take place
upon the third moon...

888
00:58:31,444 --> 00:58:34,032
...following the Vampire's release
from captivity.

889
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:35,490
That's tonight.

890
00:58:35,657 --> 00:58:38,507
If Valdronya succeeds,
he'll be unstoppable.

891
00:58:38,661 --> 00:58:41,212
Unstoppable? Not if I can help it.

892
00:58:41,373 --> 00:58:45,514
Maybe vampires were tough to catch
back in the day, but times have changed.

893
00:58:45,668 --> 00:58:49,050
There's a new breed of vampire hunter
me.

894
00:58:49,214 --> 00:58:52,229
Vampire hunting
is serious business, Fred.

895
00:58:52,384 --> 00:58:55,232
You must be prepared for anything.

896
00:58:55,388 --> 00:58:57,358
Oh, I'm prepared, all right.

897
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,703
Gotta watch that hair trigger.

898
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,034
Not so fast.

899
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:10,536
The vampire has the jewels...

900
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:13,710
...but he still needs one thing
a bride.

901
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:16,038
Not just any bride.

902
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:19,714
A mortal beauty, pure of heart.

903
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,511
That could take a while to find.

904
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:25,929
Hey, it's a text from Daphne.

905
00:59:26,089 --> 00:59:29,054
"Been kidnapped by vampire actors.
Help!."

906
00:59:29,218 --> 00:59:32,598
A mortal beauty, pure of heart.

907
00:59:33,097 --> 00:59:34,983
- Daphne.
- Jinkies.

908
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:37,526
I knew those actors
were involved somehow.

909
00:59:37,685 --> 00:59:39,275
According to the book...

910
00:59:39,437 --> 00:59:44,906
...those who offer up the Vampire's bride
will be rewarded with immortality.

911
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:48,414
That's a heck of a finder's fee.
Any idea where they'll take her?

912
00:59:48,572 --> 00:59:52,998
I saw a star chart in here pointing out
the precise coordinates of the ceremony.

913
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,295
We could make a copy.

914
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:58,423
- Or that.
- Let's move.

915
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:03,803
If the wedding takes place, Daphne
will become the bride of the vampire.

916
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:06,637
You know, I'm pure of heart.

917
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:10,099
Does anyone ever think
of kidnapping me? No.

918
01:00:10,263 --> 01:00:12,268
Uh, Velma, focus.

919
01:00:13,391 --> 01:00:14,434
Sorry.

920
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:19,816
Tonight we give Valdronya the king
his queen.

921
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:25,831
And we shall be rewarded
with eternal life as real vampires.

922
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:29,003
All hail Valdronya!

923
01:00:30,368 --> 01:00:32,503
Relax, Daphne.

924
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,750
It's just your soul you're giving up.

925
01:00:34,915 --> 01:00:38,462
Easy for you to say.
You obviously never had one.

926
01:00:41,797 --> 01:00:42,842
We're close.

927
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:47,313
Stop. Did you hear that? In the trees.

928
01:00:56,188 --> 01:00:58,692
Must have been my imagination.

929
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:05,327
- Hang on.
- Save yourselves.

930
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:10,997
Zoinks!

931
01:01:11,163 --> 01:01:13,464
I got something. Come on.

932
01:01:17,545 --> 01:01:20,844
- Shaggy?
- Nice shooting, Fred.

933
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:23,725
Scooby, what are you guys doing
in the swamp?

934
01:01:23,885 --> 01:01:26,021
Yeah, don't you know
it's dangerous out here?

935
01:01:26,305 --> 01:01:28,689
- Clearly.
- Yeah.

936
01:01:29,226 --> 01:01:31,562
The calibration is still off.

937
01:01:31,727 --> 01:01:33,317
Let's get you down from there.

938
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,076
Don't get too close, Velma.
I've been bitten by a vampire.

939
01:01:37,233 --> 01:01:39,914
I could turn bloodsucker any second.

940
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,707
That's no bite. It's a splinter.

941
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:46,919
So I'm not gonna turn
into a bloodsucking weirdo?

942
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:50,839
Bloodsucker? No.
Weirdo? We're too late for that.

943
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:54,760
Fire in the hole.

944
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,551
Still off.

945
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:03,939
Maybe it's best if you set that thing
to net mode from now on.

946
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:13,284
The appointed hour is near, my friends.

947
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,530
And soon our efforts will be repaid
with immortality.

948
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:21,790
A jewel for a jewel.

949
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:26,209
You're such the charmer.

950
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,874
You are so lucky to be chosen.

951
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:32,634
I'm sure you'll find an evil vampire king
of your own one day.

952
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:36,057
Let the wedding ceremony begin!

953
01:02:39,636 --> 01:02:43,100
<i>♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

954
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:46,444
<i>♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

955
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:52,818
<i>♪ Dearly beloved

956
01:02:53,234 --> 01:02:59,831

958
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:14,513
<i>♪ Valdronya, we present you
Your vampire bride ♪</i>

959
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:18,018
- Looks like we're in time for the wedding.
- Wedding?

960
01:03:18,178 --> 01:03:21,525
I wish someone had told us.
We don't even have a gift.

961
01:03:21,683 --> 01:03:23,521
I've got a gift right here.

962
01:03:23,685 --> 01:03:25,191
- Huh?
- I don't get it.

963
01:03:25,352 --> 01:03:27,939
He means we're gonna stop the wedding
from happening.

964
01:03:28,106 --> 01:03:29,493
My way sounded cooler.

965
01:03:29,648 --> 01:03:32,236
<i>♪ Hear us now, Valdronya</i>

966
01:03:32,402 --> 01:03:35,951

01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:47,218

969
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:51,434
<i>♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪</i>

970
01:03:54,385 --> 01:03:57,731
Behold, the king has heard our call.

971
01:03:58,514 --> 01:04:00,899
This is it. Here he comes.

972
01:04:05,563 --> 01:04:09,407
Bow down before your king.

973
01:04:13,156 --> 01:04:17,249
Excellent work, my little vampire-lings.

974
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:21,587
<i>♪ Close your eyes
♪ And come to me</i>

975
01:04:21,749 --> 01:04:25,711

978
01:04:43,397 --> 01:04:46,743
<i>♪ Spirits arise and

979
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:50,745

980
01:04:50,906 --> 01:04:56,126
<i>♪ Beware and behold
the vampire queen ♪</i>

981
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,416
A mortal beauty.

982
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:04,302
Your queen.

983
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:07,220
Hold it.

984
01:05:08,508 --> 01:05:12,471
Hi. Uh, mind if I get a picture
of the happy couple?

985
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:16,812
That one's for the memory book.

986
01:05:16,976 --> 01:05:18,269
Ha, ha. Yikes!

987
01:06:21,171 --> 01:06:22,726
Daphne, you okay?

988
01:06:23,717 --> 01:06:26,646
Ha, ha. Velma, you came to my wedding.

989
01:06:26,803 --> 01:06:31,194
Oh, don't cry, Velma.
You won't always be a bridesmaid.

990
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:32,822
I'm not crying.

991
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:35,859
Valdronya's using gas
to hypnotize everyone.

992
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:39,485
Whatever you've gotta tell yourself.
Ha, ha.

993
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:43,494
Like, that is one unhappy groom.

994
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:54,843
Come on. I must have gotten water
in the compressor.

995
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,180
Keep him busy while I fix this thing.

996
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:01,258
- Aah!
- Dead end!

997
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:04,263
Whoa!

998
01:07:05,762 --> 01:07:07,732
In more ways than one!

999
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:18,951
Yipe!

1000
01:07:21,114 --> 01:07:22,370
Ha-ha-ha. Hm?

1001
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,667
Ahem. Here's your stupid amulet.

1002
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:28,123
Nice shot.

1003
01:07:28,288 --> 01:07:29,795
- He-yah!
- Unh!

1004
01:07:30,248 --> 01:07:32,834
Actually, Velma,
I kind of wanted to keep that.

1005
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:34,045
Sorry.

1006
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:38,971
I'll make you all my vampire servants.

1007
01:08:06,163 --> 01:08:09,508
I'd say you're looking at a net loss.

1008
01:08:11,335 --> 01:08:13,672
I think I'll raise the stakes.

1009
01:08:17,008 --> 01:08:20,022
Let's see who's under that mask.

1010
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:24,735
Like I've been saying all along,
there's no such thing as real vampires.

1011
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,656
Right, Mr. Van Helsing?

1012
01:08:27,811 --> 01:08:29,697
Van Helsing?

1013
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,702
But why?

1014
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,361
He was trying to save
Petit Chauve Souris Ville...

1015
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,244
...by staging a series
of real live vampire events.

1016
01:08:37,406 --> 01:08:40,787
Events tied to his latest book,
The <i>Bride</i> of the Vampire...

1017
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:43,337
...which I actually read. It's not bad.

1018
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:45,216
You really liked it?

1019
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:47,841
I said it's not bad. Don't push it.

1020
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:52,391
So by creating a real vampire legend,
he'd get tourists year-round.

1021
01:08:52,548 --> 01:08:54,018
And sell books.

1022
01:08:55,383 --> 01:08:56,512
It's true.

1023
01:08:56,677 --> 01:09:00,059
I wanted to put the Van Helsing name
back on the map.

1024
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:03,069
I thought once word spread
of the ceremony...

1025
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,562
...tourists would flock here
to see the place...

1026
01:09:05,728 --> 01:09:09,572
...where a real live vampire
wedding ritual had happened.

1027
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:12,581
Then I would no longer need
Lita Rutland...

1028
01:09:12,735 --> 01:09:16,616
...and her schlocky Vampire Palooza
to make ends meet.

1029
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:18,538
And what about the actors?

1030
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:20,208
Merely pawns in his game.

1031
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:24,250
<i>They were so devoted to the vampire
way of life, they were easily duped.</i>

1032
01:09:24,415 --> 01:09:28,592
<i>When Valdronya first appeared, they really
thought their ritual had conjured him up.</i>

1033
01:09:28,754 --> 01:09:32,017
Van Helsing used their intense belief
in vampires against them.

1034
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:36,683
But Van Helsing was in the audience when
Valdronya materialized in the theater.

1035
01:09:36,846 --> 01:09:39,647
<i>He used a laser projector for that.</i>

1036
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:43,154
<i>I'd wager he planted
similar projectors in the museum...</i>

1037
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:46,112
<i>...to give the illusion of the vampire
in the glass coffin.</i>

1038
01:09:46,273 --> 01:09:49,951
<i>Security cameras rewired for
special effects would explain a lot...</i>

1039
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:55,118
<i>...including why there was no surveillance
footage of Valdronya's supposed escape.</i>

1040
01:09:55,284 --> 01:09:59,045
<i>When Daphne tore off a piece of modern
fabric from Valdronya's cloak...</i>

1041
01:09:59,204 --> 01:10:02,633
<i>...Mr. Van Helsing must've feared the
threads of his plot were unraveling...</i>

1042
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:03,882
<i>...so to speak.</i>

1043
01:10:04,043 --> 01:10:05,134
<i>Looking at it now...</i>

1044
01:10:05,294 --> 01:10:09,933
<i>...I suspect he passed off ancient
fabric from his museum as a cover-up.</i>

1045
01:10:10,092 --> 01:10:14,149
He staged his own demise in the swamp
using this.

1046
01:10:14,303 --> 01:10:16,773
Aah! Vampires!

1047
01:10:16,933 --> 01:10:20,480
No, a simple mechanical device
he planted in the marsh.

1048
01:10:20,852 --> 01:10:22,443
Probably a prop from the theater.

1049
01:10:22,605 --> 01:10:24,491
So when he was kicking and flailing...

1050
01:10:24,648 --> 01:10:27,662
He was actually triggering it.

1051
01:10:28,736 --> 01:10:31,322
But, like,
how did he hypnotize everyone?

1052
01:10:32,365 --> 01:10:33,872
Knockout gas.

1053
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:35,375
<i>No one knew what hit them.</i>

1054
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:38,171
<i>But when they awoke,
they remembered seeing Valdronya...</i>

1055
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,834
<i>...and thought he'd mesmerized them.</i>

1056
01:10:47,299 --> 01:10:49,767
By gassing everyone at the wedding,
he'd slip away...

1057
01:10:49,927 --> 01:10:53,475
...but leave eyewitnesses to tell the
tale of Valdronya and his bride.

1058
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,436
The actors already lived like vampires,
so they could just go on like that...

1059
01:10:57,602 --> 01:10:59,488
...thinking they were actually immortal.

1060
01:10:59,646 --> 01:11:02,495
You've really thought of everything.

1061
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:04,322
Eh, it's what we do.

1062
01:11:09,447 --> 01:11:13,375
Daphne, I... I'm sorry
for putting you through all this.

1063
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:17,594
Well, it's not every day a girl is kidnapped
to be an ancient Vampire's bride.

1064
01:11:17,749 --> 01:11:19,885
In a strange way, I'm flattered.

1065
01:11:20,252 --> 01:11:24,559
Really? Maybe after I get out of prison,
we could grab a coffee and...

1066
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:27,266
Heh. Not on your life, bat boy.

1067
01:11:27,426 --> 01:11:28,768
I don't date actors.

1068
01:11:28,928 --> 01:11:30,768
Move along, fella.

1069
01:11:31,556 --> 01:11:34,355
Like, there's one thing
about this whole plan I don't get.

1070
01:11:34,517 --> 01:11:36,523
Why'd Van Helsing need us?

1071
01:11:36,686 --> 01:11:38,657
You were my credible witnesses.

1072
01:11:38,813 --> 01:11:43,074
It's one thing to have a bunch of
weirdo vampire-reenactment nuts...

1073
01:11:43,235 --> 01:11:44,743
...spreading my tale.

1074
01:11:44,904 --> 01:11:46,910
Quite another
when the story is recounted...

1075
01:11:47,073 --> 01:11:50,585
...by respected monster hunters
such as yourselves.

1076
01:11:51,161 --> 01:11:52,583
We're respected?

1077
01:11:52,746 --> 01:11:55,760
My family's legacy
would have been restored.

1078
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,890
Not to mention,
you would have sold loads of books.

1079
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:01,593
