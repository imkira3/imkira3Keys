1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:38,219
What's on the menu?

3
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,554
It could be ceviche

4
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,894
Stinky-oo, it's Pumbaa

5
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:44,395
Ingonyama

6
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,314
I got to tell you, Timon...

7
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:49,359
that song always
gets me right here.

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,822
Yeah, Pumbaa.

9
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,825
Well, enough of that.

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,289
Timon, what are you doing?

11
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,917
I'm fast forwarding to the part
where we come in.

12
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:02,503
But you can't go out of order.

13
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:04,465
Au contraire, my porcine pal.

14
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:06,470
I've got the remote.

15
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:09,597
But everyone's going
to get confused.

16
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:12,183
We got to go back
to the beginning of the story.

17
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:15,772
We're not in the beginning
of the story.

18
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:18,694
Yes, we were, the whole time.

19
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:21,280
Yeah, but they don't know that.

20
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,787
Then why don't we
tell them our story?

21
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:28,459
Hey, I've got an idea.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,835
Why don't we tell them
our story?

23
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,547
Oh, I like the sound of that.

24
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:34,132
A little backstage tour.

25
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:38,056
Take them behind the scenes for
a revealing and intimate look...

26
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,143
at the story within the story.

27
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,478
Because what they don't know
is how we really were there...

28
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,482
even though they didn't know
we were there, you know?

29
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:46,400
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

30
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,447
So, does this mean we're going
back to the beginning?

31
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:50,992
Oh, no, Pumbaa, no.

32
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:53,200
We're going way back...

33
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:56,333
to before the beginning.

34
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:11,562
Pride Rock.

35
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:14,484
So majestic.

36
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:16,986
So powerful.

37
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,448
So bizarrely named.

38
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,953
Pumbaa, how can a rock be proud?
It's a rock.

39
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:27,419
I think it's because a pride is
what they call a group of lions.

40
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,214
Oh, sure,
the lions get Pride Rock.

41
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:32,009
And what about us meerkats?

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,637
Where I come from, we didn't
have nothing to be proud of.

43
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:36,599
Why...

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,770
When I was a young meerkat

45
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:46,321
When he was a young meerkat

46
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:47,865
Very nice.

47
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,907
Thanks.

48
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:50,159
But maybe it would be safer...

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,911
if I just show them
where I came from.

50
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:54,667
Oh, boy! Do we get
to see where you grew up?

51
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:57,252
Yeah, Pumbaa,
but it ain't pretty.

52
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:59,966
Please remain seated while
the camera is in motion.

53
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,608
Here we are.

54
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:17,072
From Pride Rock
to the pit of shame.

55
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:20,202
We're so low on the food chain,
we're underground.

56
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:22,289
But you don't have
to take my word for it.

57
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,125
I'll just let my fellow
meerkats do the talking.

58
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:26,463
What was that, what was what?

59
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:28,128
What was that, what was that?

60
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,716
Where, what, where, where,
What was that?

61
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,433
Quick, before the hyena come

62
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:36,559
Clear.

63
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:41,690
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

64
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:44,319
When you're done,
you dig a bigger tunnel

65
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,488
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

66
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,368
Quick, before the hyena come

67
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:51,580
Dig, dig a tunnel,
dig, dig a tunnel

68
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,668
You could dig
and never get done

69
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,585
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

70
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,258
What was that?

71
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,885
Quick before
the hyena come, dig

72
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:03,390
Dig a tunnel is what we do

73
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,184
Life's a tunnel,
we'll dig it, too

74
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,980
Dig a tunnel is what we sing

75
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,482
Dig a tunnel is everything

76
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,778
Mud and clay
is a meerkat's friend

77
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:15,281
Always more around every bend

78
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:17,451
And when you get
to your tunnel's end

79
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,496
Hallelujah,
let's dig again, dig

80
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:22,457
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

81
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,878
When it's done,
you dig a bigger tunnel

82
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,880
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

83
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:29,551
What was that?

84
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,761
Quick, before the hyena come

85
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:32,681
Dig

86
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,768
Timon! Excuse me.

87
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:37,188
Have you seen my son?
Has he been through here?

88
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,647
Timon!

89
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:40,107
Dig, dig a tunnel

90
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:42,403
Uncle Max?

91
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:45,323
Uncle Max, relax.
Have you seen Timon?

92
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:48,330
No, I haven't,
and what a day it's been.

93
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,415
No fractures, no lacerations...

94
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,462
no concussions, contusions,
or injuries of any sort.

95
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,130
As a matter of fact...

96
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:59,930
there's no sign of Timon's
handiwork anywhere.

97
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,483
That would be...

98
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:11,614
Timon!

99
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,119
Hey, everybody.

100
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,288
Nice work, Timon.

101
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:22,042
- Way to go, tunnel klutz.
- Who else could break a hole?

102
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:24,465
Four in one week, a new record.

103
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,131
Not again.

104
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:29,139
What? It's called a skylight.

105
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:34,770
Ho ho.

106
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:37,273
Isn't that creative?

107
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,321
A skylight. Oh.

108
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:44,157
I'll just have a word with him.

109
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:46,245
I... I was just trying
to shed a little light...

110
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,081
on our pathetic existence.

111
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,088
Timon, this can't go on.

112
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,341
Just this month,
you've pulled down four walls...

113
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:58,344
and collapsed two tunnel exits.

114
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,223
We have to look after
each other.

115
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:01,769
Our survival depends on it.

116
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,187
What's the point?
All we do is dig...

117
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:07,108
so we can hide,
and hide so we can dig.

118
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:11,697
I want to be where
we don't have to dig tunnels...

119
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:14,201
and live with our heads
stuck in the sand.

120
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:17,456
What's so bad about dreaming
of a better home?

121
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:20,126
I want to show you something.

122
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:23,172
Look, Timon.

123
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,550
Go on, look.

124
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,598
Look out to the horizon,

125
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,226
past the trees...

126
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:34,438
over the grasslands.

127
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:39,028
Everything the light touches...

128
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,241
belongs to someone else.

129
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,455
Funny.
I thought you were going...

130
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,333
a whole different
direction with this.

131
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,208
What can I say?
It's nature's design.

132
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,295
She's right.
We're food for other animals,

133
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:51,674
a moveable feast...

134
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:54,468
feared by no one
and eaten by all.

135
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:57,262
But when they die,
they become the grass...

136
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:59,894
and we eat the grass, right?

137
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:01,686
Not exactly.
We can't digest grass.

138
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,023
We're grass intolerant.

139
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:04,901
OK, Max. Thank you.

140
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,026
You've been a big help.

141
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:08,362
Meerkat,
it's what's for dinner.

142
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:10,324
Thank you, Uncle Max.

143
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:15,874
I think uncle Max dislodged one
too many rocks with his skull.

144
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,128
But he's right, Timon.

145
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:23,718
Oh, I just know there's a way
for you to fit in here.

146
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,936
All right,
who's on sentry duty?

147
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,606
That's it.

148
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:34,734
That's it,
my son on sentry duty.

149
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:37,445
Timon the sentry.

150
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:39,032
Timon the sentry?

151
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,910
Why don't you save the hyenas
the trouble and kill me now?

152
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,914
Just kill me now.

153
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:45,085
He has a point.

154
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:48,837
All you have to do is watch for
hyenas and yell if you see one.

155
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:50,508
Look at Iron Joe.

156
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,052
Don't close your eyes!
Don't look away!

157
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:53,428
Somebody's got to guard us!

158
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:55,099
Somebody's gotta protect us!

159
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,603
Well, now I'm convinced.

160
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:02,357
Listen, it's outside...

161
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,984
up in the breeze,
under the wide open sky.

162
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,030
Isn't that what you want?

163
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:07,696
Or maybe you would
rather have him...

164
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,158
go back on the digging crew.

165
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:11,037
No!

166
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:15,417
Good, then we all agree.

167
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:17,296
Timon, listen to Uncle Max.

168
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,465
He'll teach you
everything you need to know.

169
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,635
And, honey,
try to make this one work.

170
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,890
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

171
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:28,228
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

172
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,857
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

173
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,649
Good. Now...

174
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,280
what do we do
if we see a hyena?

175
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,534
Scream, "Mommy"?

176
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:38,909
That's right, mister...

177
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,288
because the world out there
is fraught with danger.

178
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,749
Fraught, I tell you!

179
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,169
Oh, boy. It's the fraught fest.

180
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,295
Rip us limb from limb.

181
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:48,173
Bravo, Uncle Max.

182
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,925
Way to sell it
to the cheap seats.

183
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:51,428
Applaud now, sonny boy...

184
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:55,182
but try clapping when
you don't have any hands.

185
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:00,900
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

186
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,118
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

187
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,544
I like the sound of that.

188
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,381
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

189
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:20,303
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

190
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,724
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

191
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:26,560
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

192
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:29,483
There's more to life than panic

193
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:32,737
And bein' some other guy's
snack, yuck

194
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,323
I may be delicious organic

195
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:39,289
But this little entree's
fighting back

196
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,417
I'm gonna put
digging tunnels behind me

197
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:45,253
And live at a new altitude

198
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:48,260
I'm gonna reach
for the stars to remind me

199
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:51,805
That meerkats
are not merely food

200
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:56,103
For once I'll be

201
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:58,899
Lookin' out for me

202
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:04,324
Yeah, I'll tell you what I want

203
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:05,869
This cat is movin' on

204
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,497
He's a bon vivant
who's missin' out on bon

205
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:11,500
I'd be a bigger cheese
far from the desert scene

206
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:14,546
A little cooling breeze,
a little patch of green

207
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,801
And I'll be snoozing
in my hammock

208
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:17,469
By a rippling stream

209
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:20,390
Many miles from any tunnel
and the digging team

210
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:23,226
Looking after number one
will be my only creed

211
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,897
That's all I need

212
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:29,236
That's all I need

213
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:32,239
I've always been good
at running away

214
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,242
Well, now I'm gonna run to show

215
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,832
I've always been seen
as the ultimate prey

216
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,209
But now my status ain't so quo

217
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,462
A dream sublime

218
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:47,178
It's hyena time...

219
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,056
Oh, look,
it's dinner and a show.

220
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,434
And I thought beans
were the only musical food.

221
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:57,024
Well, hi to you, too.

222
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,616
OK.

223
00:11:02,617 --> 00:11:04,954
This is no time
for horseplay, Timon.

224
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,124
You're supposed to be up there
looking out for...

225
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,379
Hyenas!

226
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,303
Look at them scramble.

227
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:18,599
And that's just
how I like them...

228
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:22,061
Scrambled...

229
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:25,482
And a little bit runny.

230
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,152
Hyenas!

231
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,501
Get in here.

232
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:39,503
What are you, a meshugginah?

233
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:48,849
Stumpy? Flinchy? Swifty?

234
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,519
Oh, what a relief.

235
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,978
Everybody's...

236
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:53,231
Where's Uncle Max?

237
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:00,531
Max! Run for your life!

238
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:01,702
Play dead!

239
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:02,869
Andale!

240
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,787
Almost there!

241
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,374
Suede is the look
for this fall.

242
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,709
Hey, what's going on?

243
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,503
Pumbaa, you're sitting
on the remote.

244
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:13,552
Oh, sorry.
I thought it was a brownie.

245
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:15,135
You've got it, Max!

246
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:18,185
Aww!

247
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:24,317
Max!

248
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:28,322
I flinched
when I should've scurried.

249
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:29,741
Oh, man.

250
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,620
It just never gets old,
does it?

251
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:33,831
The classics never do, honey.

252
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:41,632
I...

253
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:45,807
I guess I owe everyone
an apology.

254
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:48,518
All right,
so I made a teensy mistake.

255
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,357
Like we all haven't broken
into song on sentry duty before.

256
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:53,777
Come on.

257
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:56,027
Let me have a show of hands.

258
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:57,365
OK.

259
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,874
Maybe it's a little too soon...

260
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,086
but I'm sure we're all going
to laugh about this someday.

261
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,465
Trust me.

262
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,638
I did trust you.

263
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,561
But...

264
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,286
Aw, sweetie...

265
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,788
I'm never going to fit in here.

266
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,999
Nobody even likes me.

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,378
Sure they do, honey.
Sure they do.

268
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,215
Besides you, Ma.

269
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:09,676
Besides me? There's...

270
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:13,348
I have to find my place,
but it isn't here.

271
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:16,061
Yes, it is.
We just haven't found it yet.

272
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:16,978
But we will.

273
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:18,440
Oh, here's an idea. You can...

274
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:22,445
Stop with the hair already.
My place is out there, Mom.

275
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:27,619
Oh, I may not know exactly where
or how far, but I got to go.

276
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,623
No, wait, wait, wait.
I know. If we just...

277
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:31,081
Ma.

278
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:46,605
Well, I hope you find what
you're looking for, honey.

279
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:52,364
I love you.

280
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:54,116
I love you, Ma.

281
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,710
Oh, Timmy.

282
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:03,296
My Timmy.

283
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:06,841
Mom...

284
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:09,638
Choking. Not breathing.

285
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:15,812
And people wonder
why I have issues.

286
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:19,236
Oh, I'll be OK.

287
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:22,824
Oh, I know you will. You will.

288
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:38,886
Be careful!

289
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,641
I will.

290
00:15:42,103 --> 00:15:44,604
Don't talk to strangers!

291
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,359
I know, Ma!

292
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:50,529
Remember,
wash behind your ears!

293
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,535
Ma, I'm not a kid anymore!

294
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,496
Never go swimming
without a buddy!

295
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:57,539
Got it.

296
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,919
Oy.

297
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,590
What?

298
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:09,142
What?!

299
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:14,023
Good-bye, Ma.

300
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:39,266
And so, with high spirits...

301
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:41,353
I boldly ventured off...

302
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:44,773
where no meerkat
had dared to go before.

303
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:47,945
I put my past behind me, ha!

304
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:50,242
And never looked back.

305
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:58,377
Mommy! Mommy!

306
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,052
What am I doing?

307
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:07,222
Which way should I go?

308
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:09,642
That depends on what you think.

309
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,188
How convenient.

310
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:13,689
Enter omniscient monkey,
right on cue.

311
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,693
Well, you know what they say.

312
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:18,821
When the student is ready,
the teacher appears.

313
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:22,162
That's it. No more
fortune cookies for you.

314
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:23,412
Hey, where'd you come from?

315
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:27,584
Oh, the better question
is, where are you going?

316
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:33,302
Oh, someplace wonderful,
mister, where...

317
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,679
You didn't happen to catch
the song...

318
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,515
I sang a few minutes ago,
did you?

319
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:38,102
I didn't have the pleasure.

320
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:42,774
To recap, I want to live in
some beautiful place outside...

321
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,694
a carefree place where
I don't have to hide or worry.

322
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:50,201
Life without worry.

323
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:52,371
You seek hakuna matata.

324
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,373
Harpoon a tomato?

325
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:54,791
Hakuna matata,

326
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,544
it means "No worries."

327
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:58,756
Perfect. Mind taking
that stick of yours...

328
00:17:58,757 --> 00:18:00,508
and drawing me a map, bub?

329
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,804
Hey!

330
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:07,936
To find it, you must look
beyond what you see.

331
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:09,522
What the heck
is that supposed to mean?

332
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:14,820
It means look beyond
what you see.

333
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,116
Beyond what I see.

334
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:21,706
Get a load of the monkey
getting all existential on me.

335
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:24,835
Beyond what I see.

336
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:34,223
Beyond what I see.

337
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:39,649
Beyond what I see.

338
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:45,614
It's kind of hard to think
with all this music.

339
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,408
Beyond...

340
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:48,954
what I see.

341
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,373
Oh, wait a second.

342
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:54,667
It's coming to me.

343
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:58,009
It's either that slug I ate
or I'm having an epiphany.

344
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:04,892
I'm going
to the big pointy rock!

345
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,688
Right?

346
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,776
Who was that strange monkey?

347
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:11,984
Well.

348
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,242
Dream home, here I come.

349
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:27,215
Hello?

350
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:30,178
Strange but wise monkey?

351
00:19:58,512 --> 00:20:01,680
You know, first
impressions are very important.

352
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,310
Oh, I thought
you were a scream.

353
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:08,441
Just eat me now...
and please make it fast.

354
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,195
I got a low threshold for pain.

355
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:14,159
Easy, easy there, little guy.
I'm not going to eat you.

356
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,788
What? You're not?

357
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:18,206
Then why were you stalking me?

358
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:20,749
Well, gee, I saw you go by...

359
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,170
and I figured
a little fellow like you

360
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:24,381
shouldn't be out here
all alone.

361
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:28,179
Hey, what about you?
You're all alone.

362
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,012
You are all alone, aren't you?

363
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:34,604
Yeah. Most animals give me
a pretty wide berth.

364
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:37,651
They do? Even the hungry ones?

365
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:40,487
Yeah. I drive
almost everyone away.

366
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:43,365
People see me coming,
and they run for cover.

367
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,661
They can't get out
of the way fast enough.

368
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,790
You don't say, you don't say.

369
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,878
Must be the gleam
on those vicious tusks?

370
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:52,880
Strikes fear into their hearts.

371
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:56,300
Actually, they say
I wreck their appetite.

372
00:20:56,301 --> 00:21:00,392
It's like you have
this... this special power.

373
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,852
Special power?

374
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:06,106
Well, it's pretty powerful,
all right.

375
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:07,484
Perfect. You're hired.

376
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:10,070
Great! For what?

377
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:12,241
To get me to a little
worry-free haven...

378
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:16,038
out by that big pointy rock.

379
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,083
And you want me
to come with you?

380
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,754
Do you see
any other big lovable...

381
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:23,091
chunk of warthog here...

382
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:25,428
who also happens to have
razor-sharp tusks...

383
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:28,013
and the ability
to repel predators?

384
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:28,931
I'm your pig.

385
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:32,437
You and me, I can tell,
we see eye to eye.

386
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:35,107
You mean, like friends?

387
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,777
Easy there, big fella.

388
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:40,742
I'd say more like...
acquaintances.

389
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,745
Well, it's a start.

390
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:45,332
Put 'er there, acquaintance.

391
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,918
- I'm Timon.
- Pumbaa.

392
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,086
No, really.

393
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:53,382
All right, then.

394
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:54,638
Let's hit the road.

395
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,262
You got it...

396
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:59,310
acquaintance.

397
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:01,312
So, clear up one thing for me.

398
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:03,022
If you weren't
going to eat me...

399
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:05,360
what kind of a wacky,
wild pig are you?

400
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:07,070
I'm an insectivore.

401
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:09,822
Oh ho! A bug eater.

402
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:11,409
Well, me, too.

403
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,288
I just never had a name for it.

404
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:15,916
I'm kind of partial
to the crawly critters myself.

405
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,919
- How about you, big boy?
- I prefer the ones with wings.

406
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,883
Pumbaa, this could be
the start of a beautiful...

407
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,305
acquaintanceship.

408
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:38,657
Nants ingonyama

409
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:41,703
OK, so now we're
back at the beginning.

410
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:42,830
Right, Timon?

411
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:44,458
Oh, you got that right, pally.

412
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,377
Ingonyama

413
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:49,755
At last,
things were looking up.

414
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:53,221
I had the sun on my shoulders,
the wind at my heels...

415
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:54,930
A song in my heart.

416
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:05,570
And to protect me,
a great big fat guy.

417
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:07,741
You really think I look fat?

418
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:10,035
Pumbaa, Pumbaa, Pumbaa.

419
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:12,663
You're a pig.
It's a compliment.

420
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:15,293
Oh, thank you.

421
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:24,514
It's the circle of life

422
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:26,475
And it moves us all

423
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:30,065
There it is,
the big pointy rock.

424
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,986
Oh, baby, we're almost there.

425
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:37,867
I think we're a little late.

426
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,370
It's a land rush.

427
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:41,330
That loudmouth monkey.

428
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:43,751
He must've blabbed it
to the whole world.

429
00:23:43,752 --> 00:23:45,295
What exactly did he say?

430
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:48,300
Look beyond what you see.

431
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,969
So maybe you're supposed to look
beyond the big pointy rock.

432
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,264
Maybe I'm supposed to look
beyond the big pointy rock.

433
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:55,642
Well...

434
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,606
let's have a little look,
shall we?

435
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:59,899
Beyond what I see.

436
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,735
Beyond what I see.

437
00:24:02,736 --> 00:24:05,742
Beyond what I see.

438
00:24:07,492 --> 00:24:09,162
What do you know?

439
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:11,914
The monkey's got an eagle eye
for real estate!

440
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:13,043
Timon, look!

441
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:15,130
He-he-hey! It's the monkey!

442
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:16,589
What's that he's holding up?

443
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,675
Aw, who cares?
It's not important.

444
00:24:18,676 --> 00:24:22,015
Come on! My dream home awaits.

445
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:27,563
I don't do so well in crowds.

446
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:29,523
Maybe we better go around.

447
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,278
Don't you know
the shortest distance...

448
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,947
between me and my dream home...

449
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:35,451
is a straight line? Follow me!

450
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:37,830
- Oh!
- Excuse me.

451
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,915
Goodness.

452
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,958
Make room, make room!

453
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,795
Watch it, twiggy.

454
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:45,799
I'm walkin' here!

455
00:24:57,189 --> 00:24:59,067
Timon!

456
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:01,986
There's something
I gotta tell you.

457
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:02,990
Pumbaa, Pumbaa, Pumbaa.

458
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:06,661
We'll have plenty of time
to chat once we settle in.

459
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:10,084
I could really use a rest stop.

460
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:12,711
Don't worry.
You'll get your second wind.

461
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:16,592
I got a really bad feeling!

462
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:17,594
It'll pass!

463
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:20,222
Trust me. It'll pass.

464
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,696
Oh, look,
the rhinos are bowing.

465
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,784
We'd better bow, too.

466
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:46,802
Look, sire, how they kneel
before the royal son.

467
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:56,942
So, I guess that's
your special power?

468
00:25:56,943 --> 00:25:58,735
What a weapon!

469
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:01,280
You mean, you don't mind?

470
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:02,908
Are you kidding?

471
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,828
It was a gas!

472
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:08,835
Well, I don't like
to toot my own horn.

473
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,921
Yeah, that's probably
for the best.

474
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:13,341
Let's go, Pumbaa!

475
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:15,428
Lead the way!

476
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:26,444
This is it, buddy boy.

477
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:28,444
Home, sweet home.

478
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:30,950
And I don't gotta share it
with anybody.

479
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:33,661
Don't you get, you know,
lonely out here?

480
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:36,166
Lonely? Try commitment-free.

481
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,460
The elbow-to-elbow life
reminds me...

482
00:26:38,461 --> 00:26:39,961
a little too much of home.

483
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:41,796
This place has everything:

484
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:44,384
Cool refreshments,
cozy little hammock...

485
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:48,266
a lovely water feature,
and it's all mine.

486
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,399
Well, it's really coming
together, Timon, so...

487
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,824
so, I guess I'll just be going.

488
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,582
Wait a minute, now. Wa-wa-wait.

489
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,418
There's no law
that says you have to go.

490
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,589
I mean, if you want...

491
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,051
Great! I already
made up two beds!

492
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:16,097
One for you, and one for me.

493
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,448
Gee, all this construction work
has me bushed.

494
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:30,119
Think I'll turn in early.

495
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:37,212
Yeah.

496
00:27:54,443 --> 00:27:55,654
Good night!

497
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:56,905
Sleep tight.

498
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:59,536
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

499
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:08,171
Home, sweet home indeed.

500
00:28:32,082 --> 00:28:34,460
Hey, keep it down up there!

501
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:37,046
We have neighbors?
We should go say hello.

502
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:38,301
Noisy neighbors.

503
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,635
There go the property values.

504
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,848
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing

505
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:50,441
It's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling

506
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:54,155
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king

507
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:57,076
Oh, perfect. We moved
to the theater district.

508
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:58,871
Get a load of these guys.

509
00:28:59,913 --> 00:29:01,083
Knock it off!

510
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,170
Just can't wait

511
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:06,381
Timon, look out!

512
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:09,427
To be king

513
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:15,893
I'm OK.

514
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:17,772
Oy.

515
00:29:17,773 --> 00:29:19,443
Show people.

516
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:20,776
Chin up, Pumbaa.

517
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:24,449
Our dream home's
around here somewhere.

518
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,951
You know, Timon,
I once came across a place...

519
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:29,245
that might be just what
you're looking for.

520
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:31,249
Spectacular waterfalls...

521
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,794
set in a lush tropical oasis...

522
00:29:33,795 --> 00:29:34,962
a scrumptious array of...

523
00:29:34,963 --> 00:29:36,341
Hey, hey. Forget it, Pumbaa.

524
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:39,970
I'm a realist, and I'm not gonna
go chasing after some fantasy.

525
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:42,141
I'm going beyond what I see.

526
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:44,560
But if you always go
beyond what you see...

527
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:45,813
how do you know
when you're there?

528
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:47,897
Oh, I'll tell you how I know.

529
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,610
We're there!

530
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:56,868
This is a lovely spot.

531
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,789
Lovely, rustic, picturesque.

532
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,916
Home, sweet home, Pumbaa.

533
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,295
Home, sweet...

534
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,632
Whoop!

535
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:10,012
I... I mean, sure,
it needs a little work...

536
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:12,183
but it's got good bones.

537
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:16,272
After all,
this is an elephant graveyard...

538
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,402
and who would ever come
to an elephant graveyard?

539
00:30:21,614 --> 00:30:23,783
Sire, the hyenas
are after the children!

540
00:30:26,913 --> 00:30:30,042
I see carnivores.

541
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:31,713
Beyond what you see.

542
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:34,340
Beyond what you see.

543
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:35,551
Beyond what you see!

544
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:37,969
Timon?
Would this be a bad time...

545
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,849
to bring up that little place
I told you about?

546
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,978
Hey! This is home,
sweet home, baby!

547
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:44,480
Home...

548
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:48,652
Steam! Steam is good.

549
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:52,575
Steam is... is... is water.
Gotta have water.

550
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:54,243
You know, for the dream home.

551
00:30:54,244 --> 00:30:55,412
Steam home, dream home.

552
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:57,498
Steam, steam, steam.

553
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:01,254
I am perfectly happy
right here!

554
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:03,633
It's remote, private...

555
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:05,509
no unexpected visitors.

556
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:13,230
Somethin' tells me
this ain't...

557
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:15,859
the traveling company
of "Riverdance".

558
00:31:21,702 --> 00:31:23,451
Beyond what you see.

559
00:31:23,452 --> 00:31:25,455
Beyond what you...

560
00:31:25,456 --> 00:31:27,832
Hey, how am I supposed...

561
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,212
to look beyond what I see
beyond that?

562
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:33,259
Oh, sorry.

563
00:31:40,062 --> 00:31:42,438
What this place lacks
in water and shade...

564
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:45,775
it makes up for with searing
heat and blinding sunshine.

565
00:31:45,776 --> 00:31:47,321
Home, sweet home, Pumbaa.

566
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,042
Shall we run for our lives?

567
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:58,296
Oh, yes, let's.

568
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:18,366
Hang on, Timon!

569
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:20,242
This is it!

570
00:32:20,243 --> 00:32:22,913
Good-bye, cruel world!

571
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:34,890
That's it?

572
00:32:35,015 --> 00:32:37,225
That wasn't so bad.

573
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:40,436
You can't knock
old Timon down that easy!

574
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:42,942
Yeah! Bring it on!

575
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:46,990
Pumbaa?

576
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:48,492
Question:

577
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:51,495
Is it possible to fall off
the edge of the earth?

578
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:53,165
Technically, no.

579
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,459
The earth is round
like a sphere, Timon...

580
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,756
so it doesn't actually
have an edge.

581
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:08,396
You mind if I pause it
for a second?

582
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,439
Sure, go ahead.

583
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,692
Be right back.

584
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:27,505
It's a small world after all

585
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,136
It's a small world after all

586
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,599
It's a small, small world

587
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,890
Everybody

588
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:37,478
It's a small world after all

589
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:51,081
OK, I got the jumbo
so we could share.

590
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:54,127
Were you just
picking your nose?

591
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:56,799
No, I had an itch
on the inside.

592
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:28,385
Timon, you OK?

593
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:30,638
I give up.

594
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,391
But you can't give up.

595
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:34,477
We still haven't found
our dream home.

596
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:36,646
Forget it, Pumbaa.

597
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:39,651
I've been dragging you down
long enough.

598
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:43,657
I'm going home,
and I suggest you do the same.

599
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:48,121
Oh, I... I would if I could,
but I can't.

600
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:50,918
Oh, sure you can, buddy.
I won't stop you.

601
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,209
No, I mean...

602
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,754
I don't have a home.

603
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:56,299
You don't? What happened?
Are you lost?

604
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,598
No place good enough for you?

605
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:03,769
What, you're all alone
in this big empty world?

606
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:18,166
The truth is...

607
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:21,545
I'm all alone, too.

608
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:29,431
Pumbaa, you're the only friend
I've ever had.

609
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:31,393
Y-you mean...

610
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:35,273
Yeah, Pumbaa... and friends
stick together to the end.

611
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,585
Timon, are you crying?

612
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:53,424
I'm fine.

613
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:58,096
I... I just have something
in my eye.

614
00:35:58,097 --> 00:36:00,099
Here, blow.

615
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:05,482
Here, Pumbaa.

616
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:07,276
Gee, thanks.

617
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:09,781
OK, I'm better.

618
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:38,112
Aw, well.

619
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,573
It's too bad we never found
that perfect place.

620
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,660
Why'd we ever listen
to that stupid monkey?

621
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:47,042
I think maybe you're
giving up too soon, Timon.

622
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:49,380
Beyond what you see.

623
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,760
Remember that place
I told you about?

624
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:56,473
Forget about your place.

625
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,559
Get a load of what I found.

626
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,190
Talk about beyond what you see.

627
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:05,193
Pumbaa, this is our dream home.

628
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:07,156
Dramatic views.

629
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:10,408
Your very own porch swing.

630
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:12,744
Hot tub and spa.

631
00:37:12,745 --> 00:37:14,040
Well stocked cupboard.

632
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,878
Let's celebrate!

633
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:19,922
The monkey was right.

634
00:37:19,923 --> 00:37:23,135
We found it, the perfect life.

635
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:26,389
I'll just whip up
a little something.

636
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,935
He had the perfect name
for it, too.

637
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:30,853
Come and get it.

638
00:37:30,854 --> 00:37:33,566
Such a wonderful phrase.
It had this rhythm.

639
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,319
Laduda Ladada.

640
00:37:35,444 --> 00:37:37,823
Hot tuna frittata.

641
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:38,993
No, that's not it.

642
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,451
The spinach armada.

643
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,286
Quiet, Pumbaa.
I'm trying to think.

644
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:43,373
A spoon of ricotta.

645
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:44,374
Two words.

646
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,876
A wormy piccata.

647
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,295
Six syllables.

648
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:48,587
Kahuna colada.

649
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:49,506
Twelve letters.

650
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:50,592
A blue enchilada.

651
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:51,592
Rhymes with...

652
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:53,553
- Legumes on a platter.
- Think.

653
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:54,473
This ought to be hotter.

654
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:57,519
- I forget.
- I got to lambada!

655
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,355
Hey, how can you dance
at a time like this?

656
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:02,357
I'm dying here.

657
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:04,778
Sorry about that, pal.

658
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:06,449
Hakuna matata.

659
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:08,826
Come again?

660
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,872
Hakuna matata,
it means "No worries".

661
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:21,553
Hey, Timon, I got an idea.

662
00:38:21,554 --> 00:38:23,055
Let's do a sing-along.

663
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,015
Oh, you tease.

664
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:28,315
I love karaoke. I'm there.

665
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:47,007
Wait a second.

666
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:49,177
Pumbaa, where's the grub?

667
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:56,103
Oh, you just can't
help yourself, can you?

668
00:38:56,104 --> 00:38:57,103
Sorry.

669
00:38:57,228 --> 00:39:01,401
OK, but this time,
show a little self-control.

670
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:37,911
Hahuna ma-what-a?

671
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:39,414
Oh ho ho ho ho!

672
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:41,168
It means "No worries."

673
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:42,584
I see.

674
00:39:42,585 --> 00:39:46,674
So, I told the boy
to find hakuna matata...

675
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,553
you must look
beyond what you see.

676
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,225
Oh, a metaphor.

677
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,938
Well, actually,
it's not a meta...

678
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,774
You used a metaphor on Timon?

679
00:39:57,775 --> 00:40:00,112
He takes things literally.

680
00:40:00,113 --> 00:40:02,197
That's it.
He's starving out there.

681
00:40:02,198 --> 00:40:03,575
I just know it.

682
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:06,870
Max, Timon's out there
chasing metaphors.

683
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,290
I've got to go find him.

684
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,707
Are you nuts?

685
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,461
Nice to have
a supportive family, isn't it?

686
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:14,213
Well, here I go.

687
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:17,051
Remember, the journey
of a thousand miles...

688
00:40:17,052 --> 00:40:18,886
begins with the first step.

689
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:22,269
Thanks. Here's my first step.

690
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,021
Yeow!

691
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,651
Ay!

692
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:29,278
This bowling for porcupines...

693
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:31,365
wasn't the best idea?

694
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:32,990
Yeah. Got to be
right up there...

695
00:40:32,991 --> 00:40:34,744
with bobbing
for snapping turtles.

696
00:40:35,914 --> 00:40:37,666
Oh, that's going
to leave a little mark.

697
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:41,752
Hey, look, Timon, buzzards.

698
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:43,339
What do you say,
one more round?

699
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,094
Oh, sure. There must be
some part of me...

700
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:46,593
we haven't injured yet.

701
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:47,722
Oh, please?

702
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:49,726
Oh, please, oh, please,
oh, please, oh, please?

703
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,141
Nah, Pumbaa, I'm beat.

704
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:53,104
You go ahead.
I'm calling it a day.

705
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:57,736
But it's no fun alone.

706
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:04,493
Aw, why not?

707
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:07,417
One more run
won't change our lives.

708
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,588
Who knows why fate led us...

709
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:13,256
to little Simba that day.

710
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:15,886
Maybe it was just
my love of adventure...

711
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:17,430
or my innate courage...

712
00:41:17,513 --> 00:41:20,184
my valiant
and fearless way of...

713
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:22,853
OK, who's in charge
of the freeze frames?

714
00:41:22,854 --> 00:41:24,107
Sorry.

715
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,985
Anywho...

716
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:28,446
rescuing Simba was a cinch.

717
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,910
Then came the really
scary part...

718
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:34,665
parenthood.

719
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:38,668
In the jungle,
the mighty jungle

720
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:42,257
The lion sleeps tonight

721
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:45,846
In the jungle,
the mighty jungle...

722
00:41:45,847 --> 00:41:48,309
Timon. Timon.

723
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,267
Timon!

724
00:41:50,938 --> 00:41:52,732
- I got to go.
- Go?

725
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:53,899
Go where?

726
00:41:53,982 --> 00:41:56,361
You know, go... bad.

727
00:41:56,362 --> 00:41:59,072
Oh, go. Why didn't you say so?
Come on, let's go.

728
00:41:59,073 --> 00:42:01,576
When you got to go,
you got to go.

729
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:04,206
Young lion,
get down from there.

730
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:06,877
All right!

731
00:42:06,878 --> 00:42:09,088
Man, you guys look like
ants down there.

732
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:11,175
I'm counting to three.

733
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:13,261
Yahoo!

734
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:18,394
One, two...

735
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:21,813
Three.

736
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:23,525
In the jungle,
the mighty jungle

737
00:42:23,526 --> 00:42:24,445
Timon.

738
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,152
Oh! Again?

739
00:42:26,153 --> 00:42:28,073
No. I'm thirsty.

740
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:29,536
You know this means
you'll be up again...

741
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:31,704
about two hours from now.

742
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:33,708
Jungle boogie

743
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:36,085
Jungle boogie, get it on

744
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,089
Hang on, Simba! I'll save you!

745
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,510
Yahoo!

746
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,932
Timon?

747
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:47,019
The mighty jungle...

748
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:50,063
We're going to get old
walking across this thing.

749
00:42:50,064 --> 00:42:53,108
Jungle boogie

750
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:54,653
In the jungle, the might...

751
00:42:54,654 --> 00:42:56,533
Timon?

752
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,535
What have you got
against the concept...

753
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,913
of a good night's sleep?

754
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:03,708
Actually, I...

755
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,378
I had a bad dream.

756
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:08,840
Oh, well...

757
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:10,925
It wasn't me.

758
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:13,556
Junior had a bad dream.

759
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:18,645
Why don't you sleep
over here with us?

760
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:21,150
Mi Pumbaa, su Pumbaa.

761
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:22,526
All right!

762
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:25,698
The lion sleeps tonight

763
00:43:25,699 --> 00:43:26,700
Good night.

764
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:27,743
Sleep tight.

765
00:43:27,826 --> 00:43:29,995
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

766
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:37,091
Uyy!

767
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:10,344
My little darling

768
00:44:10,345 --> 00:44:13,224
Don't fear, my little darling

769
00:44:13,225 --> 00:44:16,604
Hey-a, oh, my little darling

770
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:20,402
Oh, don't fear,
my little darling

771
00:44:28,246 --> 00:44:30,916
Don't fear, my little darling

772
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:34,673
Hey-a, oh, my little darling

773
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:51,361
Watch where you aim
that morning breath.

774
00:44:51,362 --> 00:44:53,199
That should come
with a warning label.

775
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,161
What a wake-up call.

776
00:44:55,284 --> 00:44:57,538
Looks like someone woke up...

777
00:44:57,539 --> 00:44:59,333
on the wrong side
of the warthog.

778
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:00,458
What's the matter, pops?

779
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,462
Had a little too much
hakuna matata?

780
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:06,634
Sonny boy,
I invented hakuna matata.

781
00:45:06,635 --> 00:45:09,220
Oh, yeah? Well, I perfected it.

782
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:11,558
Sure you did, sure you did.

783
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:16,231
Pumbaa, who holds the record for
the world's longest bug belch?

784
00:45:16,232 --> 00:45:17,983
That would be Simba.

785
00:45:17,984 --> 00:45:19,571
All righty, then.

786
00:45:19,696 --> 00:45:22,074
Who's the champion
at slug swallowing?

787
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:23,074
Simba again.

788
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:24,910
- Cricket crunching?
- Simba.

789
00:45:24,911 --> 00:45:25,829
- Grub gulping?
- Simba.

790
00:45:25,914 --> 00:45:27,245
- Maggot munching?
- Still Simba.

791
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:28,417
Snail slurping?

792
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:30,209
Oh nobody.

793
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,090
We never had a snail eating
contest before.

794
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:50,238
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

795
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:43,359
I told you this wasn't
such a good idea.

796
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:08,142
Thus did the pupil
surpass the teacher.

797
00:47:08,143 --> 00:47:09,311
You've been hanging around...

798
00:47:09,186 --> 00:47:10,690
with the monkey again,
haven't you?

799
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:23,164
Our Simba is growing up.

800
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:32,552
Is this the little boy
I carried?

801
00:47:32,553 --> 00:47:37,769
When did he grow to be so tall?

802
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,356
Wasn't it yesterday

803
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:48,615
When he was small?

804
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,205
Sunrise, sunset

805
00:47:51,206 --> 00:47:54,417
Sunrise, sunset

806
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:59,966
Swiftly fly the years

807
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:06,808
One season following another

808
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:10,232
Laden with happiness

809
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:15,780
And tears

810
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:19,702
So, you see, that's why
they call it a dung beetle.

811
00:48:19,703 --> 00:48:21,497
Ew. You don't say.

812
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,085
And yet still so tasty.

813
00:48:23,169 --> 00:48:26,213
Oh, yeah,
and they're my favorite, too.

814
00:48:36,227 --> 00:48:38,479
Just what the doctor ordered.

815
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,527
Yep. After a long day
of doing nothing...

816
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:43,780
it's good to kick back.

817
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:46,201
Three pals and no worries.

818
00:48:46,202 --> 00:48:48,913
What more could you want?

819
00:48:58,927 --> 00:49:01,889
I'm bushed.

820
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,310
Think I'll turn in
for the night.

821
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,114
I'm out.

822
00:49:14,156 --> 00:49:15,826
Right behind you.

823
00:49:18,996 --> 00:49:20,750
You're killing me.

824
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:27,426
Timon, it's your turn
to say good night.

825
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:28,551
Good night.

826
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,096
Sleep tight.

827
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:32,349
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

828
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,222
You got to admit...

829
00:49:59,223 --> 00:50:01,641
we had a pretty good thing
going there.

830
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:04,644
We could've gone on
like that forever.

831
00:50:04,645 --> 00:50:07,818
Except for one
teeny weeny little thing...

832
00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:09,443
we forgot to count on.

833
00:50:12,117 --> 00:50:14,869
Nala?

834
00:50:16,999 --> 00:50:18,039
- How did you...
- How did you...

835
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,754
This is a disaster, Pumbaa,
a disaster, I tell you.

836
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:24,300
You mean because they've
finally found each other...

837
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:26,843
like two soul mates
joined across the years...

838
00:50:26,844 --> 00:50:28,513
by the bonds of true love?

839
00:50:28,514 --> 00:50:30,601
Sweet, innocent little Pumbaa.

840
00:50:30,602 --> 00:50:32,812
She's going to put a stake
right through the heart...

841
00:50:32,813 --> 00:50:34,187
of our hakuna matata.

842
00:50:34,188 --> 00:50:37,693
Oh, then I guess
we ought to do something.

843
00:50:37,694 --> 00:50:40,114
And I know just what it is.

844
00:50:40,115 --> 00:50:44,788
Pumbaa, we can't let them
feel the love tonight.

845
00:51:05,108 --> 00:51:11,827
Can you feel the love tonight?

846
00:51:29,603 --> 00:51:35,566
Can you feel the love tonight?

847
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,905
That's so romantic.

848
00:51:48,129 --> 00:51:49,045
Can you feel the love tonight?

849
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:21,467
Can you feel the love tonight?

850
00:52:21,468 --> 00:52:27,476
The peace the evening brings?

851
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,608
Well, that worked like a dream.

852
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:33,942
It did?

853
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:37,155
Sarcasm is a foreign language
to you, isn't it?

854
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:38,118
Look!

855
00:52:40,078 --> 00:52:42,040
Can you feel the love tonight?

856
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:44,458
She's making those eyes.

857
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:46,921
He's smiling that smile.

858
00:52:46,922 --> 00:52:48,631
They're laughing...

859
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,717
and hugging...

860
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:53,222
and... and...

861
00:52:54,682 --> 00:53:00,734
And if he falls in love tonight

862
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:08,034
It can be assumed

863
00:53:08,035 --> 00:53:10,661
His carefree days

864
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:14,002
With us are history

865
00:53:14,003 --> 00:53:22,003
In short, our pal is doomed

866
00:53:53,725 --> 00:53:55,311
That's it, buddy.

867
00:53:55,312 --> 00:53:58,732
We gave it our best shot,
but he's a goner.

868
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:02,195
Maybe not.

869
00:54:02,196 --> 00:54:04,407
You never give up, do you?

870
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:05,909
Look.

871
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,911
You don't even know
what I've been through.

872
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,996
- I would if you'd just tell me.
- Forget it.

873
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,668
Fine!

874
00:54:14,253 --> 00:54:16,882
Pumbaa, do you know
what this means?

875
00:54:16,883 --> 00:54:18,467
He can't express
his feelings...

876
00:54:18,468 --> 00:54:20,221
and she has commitment issues?

877
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:21,724
We won.

878
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,850
We split them up.

879
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:27,108
And that's a good thing?

880
00:54:30,444 --> 00:54:34,199
He seems to be
taking it kind of hard.

881
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,368
Yeah, I know. Look, I...

882
00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:38,164
But it's the best thing for us.

883
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:41,125
I mean for him.
Let's go, Pumbaa.

884
00:54:41,126 --> 00:54:43,713
I think this storm's
coming to a head.

885
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,264
Hakuna matata
is safe at last, pal...

886
00:54:49,265 --> 00:54:52,642
because nothing's going
to take our boy away now.

887
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:55,436
He's gone?
What do you mean, he's gone?

888
00:54:55,437 --> 00:54:57,649
It's just like the baboon said.

889
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:59,861
The king has returned.

890
00:55:05,537 --> 00:55:08,539
You want me
to go over it again?

891
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,084
Yes, please, but be a dear...

892
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:11,964
and just skip to the part
about Simba,

893
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:14,799
not that your childhood
wasn't fascinating.

894
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,260
OK, look, Simba's
the rightful king...

895
00:55:17,261 --> 00:55:18,806
but after he disappeared...

896
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,516
Scar proclaimed
himself the king...

897
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:22,268
and formed an alliance
with the hyenas.

898
00:55:22,269 --> 00:55:23,354
Poor Simba,

899
00:55:23,438 --> 00:55:24,938
the treachery, the villainy...

900
00:55:24,939 --> 00:55:28,110
the sheer indescribable horror.

901
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:29,611
Blah, blah, blah.

902
00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:31,364
Why is she toying with us?

903
00:55:31,448 --> 00:55:33,451
Oh, this crazy chick
is going to eat us.

904
00:55:33,452 --> 00:55:35,995
Simba has to go home
to challenge his uncle...

905
00:55:35,996 --> 00:55:38,667
and reclaim his
rightful place as king.

906
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:45,341
Don't you get it?

907
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:49,639
Simba needs us, now!

908
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,351
He needs us?

909
00:55:51,352 --> 00:55:53,064
Then he shouldn't have left us!

910
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,900
If he wants to run off
to be "His Highness"...

911
00:55:55,901 --> 00:55:58,694
well, I say don't let
the branches hit you...

912
00:55:58,695 --> 00:56:00,073
on the way out.

913
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:03,534
Leave hakuna matata
to someone who appreciates it.

914
00:56:03,535 --> 00:56:07,874
But, Timon, it's not really
hakuna matata without Simba.

915
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:10,170
What's gotten into you?
Not hakuna matata?

916
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:12,883
That's crazy talk,
crazy talk, I tell you.

917
00:56:12,884 --> 00:56:14,426
Nothing's changed here.

918
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:16,678
We had hakuna matata
before Simba...

919
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:18,766
and we've still got it now.

920
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:21,101
We got to go help
our friend, Timon.

921
00:56:21,102 --> 00:56:23,105
Et tu, Pumbaa?

922
00:56:23,106 --> 00:56:26,359
You're just going to walk away,
give up on all this?

923
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,530
What happened to "friends
stick together to the end"?

924
00:56:30,157 --> 00:56:34,290
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

925
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:45,472
I got everything
I ever wanted right here.

926
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,504
Now, this is more like it...

927
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:11,299
Elbow room.

928
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:27,282
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

929
00:57:37,214 --> 00:57:40,133
Hakuna matata

930
00:57:40,134 --> 00:57:44,139
What a wonderful phrase

931
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,518
Hakuna matata

932
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:53,736
Ain't no passing craze

933
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:55,699
It means...

934
00:57:57,198 --> 00:57:59,913
No worries.

935
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:05,251
You. No, no. Don't say a word.

936
00:58:05,252 --> 00:58:06,963
I know what
you're going to say.

937
00:58:06,964 --> 00:58:09,176
Did you find hakuna matata?

938
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:11,386
Well, yes, I did.

939
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:12,888
Thank you very much.

940
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,765
And I am happy.

941
00:58:14,766 --> 00:58:17,897
Happy, happy,
deliriously happy.

942
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:20,691
I see.

943
00:58:20,692 --> 00:58:22,236
Happy, is it?

944
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:24,864
So, if you're so happy,
why do you look so miserable?

945
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:26,240
Miserable, you say?

946
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,453
Why should I be miserable?

947
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:30,079
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe my two best pals...

948
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,542
in the world deserted me.

949
00:58:31,543 --> 00:58:36,840
They've... they've headed off
on some heroic mission.

950
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:40,805
My friends are gone.

951
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:49,066
And my hakuna matata
went with them.

952
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:53,321
Would you mind?

953
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:54,908
Ay!

954
00:58:54,909 --> 00:58:57,161
Thanks. I'm glad
we had this talk.

955
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:03,002
My work here is done.

956
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:44,689
Friends stick together
to the end.

957
00:59:55,412 --> 00:59:58,082
What was with the running?
If you can call that running.

958
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:00,293
I was giving you time
to catch up.

959
01:00:00,294 --> 01:00:05,134
Aw, you big lug.

960
01:00:05,968 --> 01:00:07,387
Hop on, buddy.

961
01:00:07,388 --> 01:00:09,348
We got a fight to catch.

962
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:12,269
Let's whip some grass.

963
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,775
This is the stuff
of legends, an epic struggle...

964
01:00:16,776 --> 01:00:19,611
the place
where heroes are born.

965
01:00:19,612 --> 01:00:23,951
Pumbaa, this could be
our finest hour.

966
01:00:23,952 --> 01:00:25,621
Luau!

967
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,247
If you're hungry for a hunk
of fat and juicy meat

968
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,792
Eat my buddy Pumbaa
here because he...

969
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:31,629
Let's just
cut to the chase, shall we?

970
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,965
Oh, sure.

971
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:42,312
What the...

972
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:55,955
I love the smell of Pumbaa
in the morning.

973
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:59,669
Hey, hey, hey,
move your tush, honey.

974
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,131
Ma? Uncle Max?

975
01:01:01,132 --> 01:01:03,508
- Oh, Timmy!
- Timon?

976
01:01:03,509 --> 01:01:05,261
What are you doing here?

977
01:01:05,386 --> 01:01:10,311
Looking for you.
Aw. Mommy's here.

978
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:13,439
Well, let me introduce you
to my best friend.

979
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,318
Pumbaa, Ma, Uncle Max.

980
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:16,777
Ma, Uncle Max, Pumbaa.

981
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,660
Look, there's Simba,
and that must be his uncle Scar.

982
01:01:21,661 --> 01:01:23,621
Oh, good, they're
talking things out...

983
01:01:23,622 --> 01:01:25,121
which is how it should be.

984
01:01:25,122 --> 01:01:26,668
You know, I have a feeling...

985
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:28,588
everything's going
to be just fine.

986
01:01:29,879 --> 01:01:31,800
On the other hand...

987
01:01:31,883 --> 01:01:34,385
the hyenas are up there
protecting Scar.

988
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:35,846
What do we do?

989
01:01:35,847 --> 01:01:37,306
Well, I've got a plan.

990
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:39,308
How can we help?

991
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:41,604
Ma, Uncle Max,
you're going to dig a trap.

992
01:01:41,605 --> 01:01:43,481
We're going to need...

993
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:45,026
dare I say it?

994
01:01:45,027 --> 01:01:48,488
Tunnels, lots and lots
of tunnels.

995
01:01:48,489 --> 01:01:50,158
And, Pumbaa, you and me...

996
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:51,955
we've got to get those hyenas
away from Simba.

997
01:01:51,956 --> 01:01:53,956
And lure them into the trap?

998
01:01:53,957 --> 01:01:56,959
Ho ho! Nothing gets past you.

999
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,256
Come on, Pumbaa, let's ride.

1000
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:05,888
Something's different
about Timon.

1001
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:09,522
You think?
He's wearing a dress!

1002
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:21,495
Hey, Pumbaa.

1003
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:24,248
What do you call a hyena
with half a brain?

1004
01:02:24,249 --> 01:02:27,380
Beats me, Timon. What?

1005
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:28,465
Gifted.

1006
01:02:30,843 --> 01:02:32,179
They're talking about us.

1007
01:02:32,305 --> 01:02:36,936
For your last meal,
you're going to eat those words.

1008
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,574
Ma, I think we got
their attention.

1009
01:02:46,575 --> 01:02:50,163
Not yet. Keep stalling.

1010
01:02:50,164 --> 01:02:51,955
OK.

1011
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:55,753
You got to be kidding me.

1012
01:02:58,591 --> 01:03:00,051
Now, Ma?

1013
01:03:00,052 --> 01:03:01,679
Need more time, honey.

1014
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:08,690
Freestyle.

1015
01:03:12,863 --> 01:03:14,945
Encore, encore.

1016
01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:17,494
No, no, no.
You mean entree, entree.

1017
01:03:17,495 --> 01:03:19,119
No, you right.
Let's just eat them.

1018
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,206
Is it ready yet, Ma?

1019
01:03:21,207 --> 01:03:23,542
Not yet. Keep stalling.

1020
01:03:29,677 --> 01:03:32,262
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

1021
01:03:32,263 --> 01:03:35,059
Timon? What are you doing?

1022
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:39,815
Shenzi Marie Predatora
Veldetta Jacquelina Hyena...

1023
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:44,659
would you do me the honor
of becoming my bride?

1024
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:49,289
I don't think so.

1025
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:52,125
Shenzi Marie, please.
I know what you're thinking.

1026
01:03:52,126 --> 01:03:54,129
We're too different.
It'll never work.

1027
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,091
What will the children
look like?

1028
01:03:57,217 --> 01:03:59,426
That violates
so many laws of nature.

1029
01:03:59,427 --> 01:04:02,223
Listen to me. The problems
of a couple of wacky kids...

1030
01:04:02,224 --> 01:04:04,433
like us don't amount
to a hill of termites...

1031
01:04:04,434 --> 01:04:06,313
in this nutty
circle of life thing.

1032
01:04:06,314 --> 01:04:10,235
If not now, when?

1033
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:13,029
If not me, who?

1034
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:15,033
I'm lonely.

1035
01:04:15,034 --> 01:04:17,037
Can I be your best man?

1036
01:04:17,038 --> 01:04:21,377
I say we skip the wedding
and go straight to the buffet.

1037
01:04:21,378 --> 01:04:22,334
Now?

1038
01:04:22,335 --> 01:04:23,630
Sure, if you're ready.

1039
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:26,093
Now, Max, now!

1040
01:04:26,218 --> 01:04:29,888
Hyenas in the hole!

1041
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:43,617
I need help. It didn't work.

1042
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:45,034
Hey, it works for me.

1043
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:50,502
What are we going to do?

1044
01:04:58,014 --> 01:04:59,305
What?

1045
01:04:59,388 --> 01:05:00,474
Timon, no!

1046
01:05:04,772 --> 01:05:07,277
Let's get 'em.

1047
01:05:31,603 --> 01:05:33,689
I'd say Scar is down and out.

1048
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,355
We did it! We did it!

1049
01:05:35,356 --> 01:05:37,568
Where's Timon? Where's my baby?

1050
01:05:37,569 --> 01:05:41,741
He's hurt! Oh, no!
Oh, no! He's dead! Or worse!

1051
01:05:41,742 --> 01:05:43,993
We got to find him.
We've got to find him.

1052
01:05:43,994 --> 01:05:45,122
It's OK, Ma.

1053
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:47,667
Oh, please. It is not OK!

1054
01:05:47,668 --> 01:05:50,546
Don't you tell me it's OK!

1055
01:05:51,841 --> 01:05:54,677
Timmy!

1056
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:59,016
My son...

1057
01:05:59,017 --> 01:06:01,229
the hero.

1058
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:07,277
You missed a spot.

1059
01:06:12,203 --> 01:06:15,747
That's so beautiful.

1060
01:06:15,748 --> 01:06:17,752
Choking. Not breathing.

1061
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:47,377
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

1062
01:06:57,768 --> 01:07:00,272
That's our boy.

1063
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:04,445
I promised myself
I wasn't going to cry.

1064
01:07:28,436 --> 01:07:31,650
You've really come
a long way, Timon.

1065
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:34,820
Did you find what
you were looking for?

1066
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:39,326
I found a place that was
beyond my wildest dreams...

1067
01:07:39,327 --> 01:07:41,539
but it still wasn't home.

1068
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:44,001
Let's go home, Ma.

1069
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,308
Welcome to our new home,

1070
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:56,099
a predator-free environment.

1071
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:00,731
I got to hand it to you, Timon.
This place has everything.

1072
01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:03,363
Well, now that
we're all here, it does.

1073
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:16,630
Crane...

1074
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:22,181
spreads its wings,
turns with dainty hands.

1075
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,558
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

1076
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,854
We're never gonna dig
another tunnel

1077
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:29,190
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

1078
01:08:29,191 --> 01:08:31,569
Never gonna hyena come

1079
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,947
Sing the praises of great Timon

1080
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:36,282
The greatest meerkat
we've ever known

1081
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:38,745
Never dreamed
he'd help Simba shine

1082
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:41,247
Proved it's cool
to hang out with swine

1083
01:08:41,248 --> 01:08:43,710
Accidentally saved the day

1084
01:08:43,711 --> 01:08:45,754
Planned it so
it would look that way

1085
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,133
Brought us out of
the dirt and sand

1086
01:08:48,134 --> 01:08:51,514
Brought his family
to the promised land

1087
01:08:51,515 --> 01:08:53,140
Sing the praises of great Timon

1088
01:08:53,141 --> 01:09:01,141
Greatest meerkat
we've ever known

1089
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:05,909
Well, that's it,

1090
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:08,578
the big wrap-up,
the happy ending...

1091
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:10,916
the grand finale.

1092
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:13,001
It's over already?

1093
01:09:13,002 --> 01:09:15,006
Well, Pumbaa, that's
the thing about endings.

1094
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:16,717
They come at the end.

1095
01:09:16,718 --> 01:09:18,720
Can we watch it again?

1096
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:21,432
Pumbaa, we just saw it.
Maybe tomorrow.

1097
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:23,102
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1098
01:09:24,478 --> 01:09:27,063
You didn't tell me
you were watching the movie.

1099
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:28,608
I want to watch, too.

1100
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:31,361
Ma, we just finished.
Show's over.

1101
01:09:31,362 --> 01:09:33,074
Well, you're just going
to have to rewind it.

1102
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:34,159
Ma!

1103
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,453
Uncle Max,
we're going to watch the movie.

1104
01:09:36,454 --> 01:09:38,749
Oh, no!

1105
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,542
Hey, I brought extra butter.

1106
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,254
Hey, you guys
are watching the movie?

1107
01:09:43,465 --> 01:09:46,343
Any story worth telling
is worth telling twice.

1108
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:50,307
- What the...
- Oh, excuse me.

1109
01:09:50,308 --> 01:09:51,598
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1110
01:09:51,599 --> 01:09:52,520
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1111
01:09:52,645 --> 01:09:53,684
- Excuse me.
- Get out of the way.

1112
01:09:53,685 --> 01:09:54,814
Who is this crowd?

1113
01:09:54,939 --> 01:09:57,110
Hey, down in front!

1114
01:09:58,234 --> 01:09:59,612
Gawrsh!

1115
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:02,034
Aloha!

1116
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:07,622
Watch it!

1117
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:15,969
OK, buddy, you win.

1118
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:17,263
Sure you don't mind?

1119
01:10:17,264 --> 01:10:18,890
Hakuna matata.

1120
01:10:18,973 --> 01:10:20,058
Sorry.

1121
01:10:20,059 --> 01:10:21,810
Timon...

1122
01:10:21,811 --> 01:10:25,149
I still don't do
so well in crowds.

1123
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:30,780
Quick before the hyena come

1124
01:10:34,786 --> 01:10:36,331
All we do is dig...

1125
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,461
so we can hide
and hide so we can dig.

1126
01:10:38,544 --> 01:10:39,962
Dig

1127
01:10:43,176 --> 01:10:44,801
All we do is dig...

1128
01:10:44,802 --> 01:10:46,679
so we can hide
and hide so we can dig.

1129
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,013
Dig

1130
01:10:48,014 --> 01:10:49,558
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

1131
01:10:49,559 --> 01:10:51,896
Keep a-digging, never get done

1132
01:10:51,897 --> 01:10:53,773
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

1133
01:10:53,774 --> 01:10:55,860
Quick, before the hyena come

1134
01:10:55,861 --> 01:10:58,069
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

1135
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,032
Keep a-digging, never get done

1136
01:11:00,157 --> 01:11:01,991
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

1137
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:04,205
Quick, before the hyena come

1138
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,543
Hakuna matata.

1139
01:11:08,544 --> 01:11:09,881
All we do is dig...

1140
01:11:10,048 --> 01:11:11,883
so we can hide
and hide so we can dig.

1141
01:11:11,884 --> 01:11:12,801
Dig

1142
01:11:15,013 --> 01:11:17,556
Hakuna matata.

1143
01:11:17,557 --> 01:11:20,853
Quick, before the hyena,
hyena, hyena come

1144
01:11:20,854 --> 01:11:22,939
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

1145
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:25,024
Keep a-digging, never get done

1146
01:11:25,025 --> 01:11:26,987
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel

1147
01:11:27,113 --> 01:11:29,073
Quick, before the hyena come

1148
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:40,048
Quick, before the hyena come

1149
01:11:42,926 --> 01:11:44,804
Can you dig it?

1150
01:11:44,805 --> 01:11:46,600
I can dig it

1151
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:56,152
Oh, yeah

1152
01:11:58,408 --> 01:12:02,288
Sure is memories
living in the grass

1153
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:03,623
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

1154
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,332
Baby, can't you dig it?

1155
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:10,256
What a trip just watching
as the world goes past

1156
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:11,510
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

1157
01:12:11,511 --> 01:12:13,179
Baby, can't you dig it?

1158
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,557
There are so many
groovy things to see

1159
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:17,645
While grazing in the grass

1160
01:12:17,729 --> 01:12:19,145
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

1161
01:12:19,146 --> 01:12:20,814
Baby, can't you dig it?

1162
01:12:20,815 --> 01:12:22,444
Flowers with colors

1163
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:25,112
Making everything
out of sight in the grass

1164
01:12:25,113 --> 01:12:26,825
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

1165
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:28,993
Here we go

1166
01:12:28,994 --> 01:12:33,247
The sun beaming down
between the leaves

1167
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:34,626
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

1168
01:12:34,752 --> 01:12:35,880
Baby, can't you dig it?

1169
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:37,962
And the birds

1170
01:12:37,963 --> 01:12:40,427
Darting in and out of the trees

1171
01:12:40,428 --> 01:12:42,051
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

1172
01:12:42,052 --> 01:12:44,014
Yeah, yeah

1173
01:12:44,015 --> 01:12:46,266
And everything here is so clear

1174
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:48,103
You can see it

1175
01:12:48,104 --> 01:12:50,191
And everything here is so near

1176
01:12:50,192 --> 01:12:51,817
You can feel it

1177
01:12:51,818 --> 01:12:54,072
And it's real

1178
01:12:54,156 --> 01:12:56,030
So real, so real

1179
01:12:56,031 --> 01:12:58,786
So real, so real, so real

1180
01:12:58,787 --> 01:13:00,998
Can you dig it?

1181
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,625
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

1182
01:13:04,626 --> 01:13:06,255
We can dig it, they can

1183
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,092
Oh, let's dig it

1186
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:13,806
We can dig it, they can

1187
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:15,893
Oh, let's dig it

1188
01:13:15,894 --> 01:13:20,650

01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:24,156

1192
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:34,252
Can you dig it, baby?

1193
01:13:34,253 --> 01:13:40,055
The sun beaming down
between the leaves

1194
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:43,557
And the birds

1195
01:13:43,558 --> 01:13:47,606
Darting in and out of the trees

1196
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:51,694
Everything here is so clear

You can feel it

1200
01:13:57,497 --> 01:13:59,246
And it's real

1201
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:01,333
So real, so real

1202
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:04,002
So real, so real, so real

1203
01:14:04,003 --> 01:14:06,676

01:14:13,644 --> 01:14:16,106

01:14:17,814 --> 01:14:19,235
We can dig it, they can

01:14:19,236 --> 01:14:21,114

01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:23,782

01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:26,997
We can dig it, they can

1215
01:14:26,998 --> 01:14:28,414
Oh, let's dig it

1216
01:14:28,415 --> 01:14:31,333
Baby

1217
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:33,046
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

1218
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:34,550
We can dig it, they can

1219
01:14:34,551 --> 01:14:35,965
Oh, let's dig it

1220
01:14:35,966 --> 01:14:37,594
Everything here is so clear

1221
01:14:37,678 --> 01:14:39,347
You can feel it

1222
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:41,349
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

1223
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:43,646
We can dig it, baby,
everybody dig it

1224
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:51,281
It's Timon-a-rama time!

1225
01:14:53,158 --> 01:14:54,911
I've never been the type

1226
01:14:55,036 --> 01:14:56,706
You'll have a perfect home

1227
01:14:56,707 --> 01:14:58,414
To form a hole and hide

1228
01:14:58,415 --> 01:14:59,792
When old hyenas come

1229
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:01,629
Above the meerkat role

1230
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,423
Where it's a shooting scene

1231
01:15:03,424 --> 01:15:04,924
In some organic hole

1232
01:15:04,925 --> 01:15:06,637
Then you won't have to fear

1233
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,431
And all that circle rot

1234
01:15:09,932 --> 01:15:12,018
Is just a cunning plot

1235
01:15:13,396 --> 01:15:15,150
For comin' to the crunch

1236
01:15:16,858 --> 01:15:18,611
I ain't nobody's lunch

1237
01:15:18,612 --> 01:15:20,362
Get on the roundabout

1238
01:15:20,363 --> 01:15:24,412
This isn't a diversion,
it's a monkeyshine

1239
01:15:24,413 --> 01:15:26,414
I ain't asking for a lot

1240
01:15:26,415 --> 01:15:28,835
But what is mine is mine

1241
01:15:28,836 --> 01:15:32,672
You never want to argue
with a chorus line

1242
01:15:32,673 --> 01:15:34,174
That's all I need

1243
01:15:34,175 --> 01:15:35,970
That is all he needs

1244
01:15:36,054 --> 01:15:37,598
I'm begging please

1245
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,683
Begging please

1246
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:43,520
That is all

1247
01:15:43,521 --> 01:15:46,653
I

1248
01:15:46,654 --> 01:15:48,028
Need

1249
01:15:48,153 --> 01:15:49,782
That is all I need

1249
01:15:50,305 --> 01:16:50,703
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
