2
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:20,134
Well, it was here... someplace.

3
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:23,271
But we've already been past here.

4
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,276
The trees have grown so big.

5
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:33,214
It's been so long
since my last visit.

6
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:42,724
Come on. Blaze.

7
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,394
Grandma, when was
the last time you were here?

8
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:48,963
Years and years ago.

9
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:52,734
Way before you were born, sweetheart.

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,504
Oh, look! Blaze found a squirrel.

11
00:01:56,537 --> 00:02:00,808
Now, just a minute.
I'm trying to get my bearings.

12
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:03,711
Oh, there are so many paths here.

13
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:07,248
So easy to get turned around.
Come on, darling.

14
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:10,785
Grandma,
we're in the middle of nowhere!

15
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:13,821
We're right in the middle
of New York City!

16
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:16,758
You'll make yourself tired
walking so long.

17
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:20,728
Nonsense. It hasn't been
more than a quarter of an hour.

18
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:23,331
Not much further.

19
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:25,333
Blaze is getting tired.

20
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,235
Oh, I see!

21
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:33,241
Grandma,
what are we looking for anyway?

22
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,276
Uh, a memorial.

23
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:37,779
A me... - what?

24
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:41,749
A reminder of a wonderful story...

25
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:45,019
and a place very far away from here.

26
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:47,088
What place is that. Grandma?

27
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,359
Nome, Alaska.

28
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:55,063
It's a small town
almost on top of the world.

29
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:56,698
Hmm.

30
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:00,268
Now, that really was
in the middle of nowhere, sweetheart.

31
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:06,641
In the cold winter of 1925,

32
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:09,210
it was snowing hard.

33
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:15,550
<i>Back then, the fastest and most
reliable way of getting around</i>

34
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,554
<i>was with teams of dogs
pulling long sleds.</i>

35
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:24,659
<i>Races were held every year
to find out the best team.</i>

36
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:29,931
<i>And the competition
was very fierce.</i>

37
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,770
Mush!

38
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,812
Gee up, boy.

39
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:52,153
Giddap, Steele! Giddap, giddap!

40
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,337
Steele! Whoa! Whoa!

41
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,609
Steele, we're not gonna make it!

42
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:21,916
- Easy, now! Easy!
- Steele, hold back!

43
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:38,900
Ohh! Steele!

44
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,502
Get in line, Steele!

45
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,338
Get in line!

46
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:48,409
Mush! Mush!

47
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:53,314
It's the three-mile marker.

48
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:57,285
Balto,
get your slobbering mouth off me!

49
00:04:57,318 --> 00:05:00,488
Let's go, Boris. We'll get around back
and catch the end of the race.

50
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:04,392
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm a delicate country bird.

51
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,695
I hate going into town.

52
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,265
Ah, come on.
What's the worst that can happen?

53
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:18,873
Please! Aah!

54
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,877
Why do I let you talk me
into these things?

55
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:36,858
What the... ?! Eeeh!

56
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:51,372
Bring that back, you thief!

57
00:05:54,876 --> 00:06:01,282
- You are putting me down now, Mr Golden Retriever?
- Whatever you say, Boris.

58
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:04,952
Every time there's a race,
you run around like you're in it.

59
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:07,488
- Maybe one day I will be.
- Heel, boy!

60
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:10,324
Boris Goosinoff is no spring chicken.

61
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:16,998
I'm no spring penguin, either!

62
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:20,134
Oy, it's cold!

63
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:25,206
Look! The two-mile mark.

64
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,442
Come on! We don't wanna miss the finish.

65
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:29,477
Oh, that would be a tragedy.

66
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:33,681
I was being sarcastic.

67
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:39,120
OK, you can open your eyes now.

68
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:48,596
I love these runners!
I love this brush bow!

69
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:51,632
I love this sled!
Jenna, you're lead dog!

70
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,769
OK, just a minute. Come on. Mush!

71
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:56,871
Then you'll need... this.

72
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:01,109
A real musher's hat!
We're a real sled team now!

73
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,343
Mush!

74
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:05,313
Mister Johanssen,
the sled is beautiful.

75
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:08,149
- We're very grateful.
- Oh, thank you!

76
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:11,085
- Rosy's grateful too, huh?
- So I gather!

77
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:13,788
- Watch this!
- Coming, sweetheart.

78
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,858
I don't know, honey, maybe we
should've gotten her the doll house!

79
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,560
It's the one-mile marker.

80
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:22,697
Mush, Jenna, mush!
Let's win this race!

81
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,167
I think she'll learn to like it!

82
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:30,004
Jenna. Easy, girl.

83
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:36,878
Good morning, Jenna. Oughta be
a close race, don't you think?

84
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:39,814
Maybe even neck and... neck.

85
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:44,652
Say something about her new collar
before she gets whiplash.

86
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:47,455
Urn, Dixie, what a pretty collar.
Is it new?

87
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:49,324
What? This old thing?

88
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:53,528
Yeah. Do you think,
urn, Steele will notice?

89
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:57,765
I'm afraid the only way Steele notices
anyone is if they're wearing a mirror.

90
00:07:57,832 --> 00:07:59,934
They're comin'!

91
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:10,645
- Steele!
- You can do it!

92
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:12,780
Jenna! Stay, girl!

93
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:14,882
That's some dog!

94
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,225
Jenna!

95
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:31,766
Hold on. Come on, Steele!

96
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,768
Oh, no!

97
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,245
My hat!

98
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:58,426
- It's that stray dog!
- He's gonna ruin the race!

99
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:05,833
Hey! Outta my way, lobo.

100
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,821
When will you learn
to stay on the sidelines?

101
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,799
To Juneau Daily Chronicle. Stop.

102
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,768
Steele wins first race
of season. Stop.

103
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:45,039
Three-time winner keeps
Golden Collar. Stop. Nome. Stop.

104
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:48,276
That Steele is some dog, huh, Morris?

105
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:53,981
Congratulations there, boss, there.

106
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:56,651
It was a pleasure
runnin' behind youse.

107
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:58,686
Of course, the view got monotonous.

108
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,290
You are the most amazing, the most exalted,
the most pre-eminent, the most top of...

109
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:03,958
You won!

110
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:11,199
I don't know.
You think maybe Steele is losing his edge?

111
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:14,202
Yeah, looks like just about any dog
could outrun him.

112
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:22,210
What a crazy thing to do
just to show off to a pretty girl!

113
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:26,748
I'm sure Jenna would love
to have you on her team.

114
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:29,484
- Hey! Rosy! Stay away from him!
- Dad!

115
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:32,854
He might bite you, honey.
He's part wolf.

116
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,656
Now you've hurt his feelings.

117
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,493
Come on now.

118
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:41,162
Congratulations, Steele.

119
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:43,531
Ladies.

120
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:48,936
- Hi, there, Jenna. Enjoy the race?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,939
- Almost as much as you did.
- Thanks.

122
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:55,743
Jenna, let's go celebrate. I know
where all the bones are buried.

123
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,380
I don't know.
Suddenly, I've lost my appetite.

124
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:06,554
Well, maybe your taste
runs more toward... wolf.

125
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,724
Jenna! Come on, girl.
We're going back home.

126
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:12,593
Sorry, Steele.
My girl is calling me.

127
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:15,096
On the other hand.

128
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:18,633
my girl is away
at boarding school.

129
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:39,153
Jenna!

130
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:48,763
Jenna, I, uh...

131
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:51,566
- Jenna.
- Jen! Come on!

132
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:03,611
Jenna! Come here, girl.

133
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:10,518
Balto, there's some things
I can't do for you.

134
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:11,986
Yeah.

135
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,955
I'm goose, not Cupid.

136
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:16,457
Didn't make the team... Bingo?

137
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:19,327
Don't listen to him or look at him.
Live a long life.

138
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,329
My name's Balto.

139
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:23,531
But you can call him "idiot"!

140
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:26,067
I'm sorry. Balto.
Balto the half-breed.

141
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:30,104
Hey, goose,
you a half-breed too, huh?

142
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:33,174
- Part turkey?
- Waa-hah-hah!

143
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:35,009
Good wordplay there, boss.

144
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,178
You are the wittiest, the quickest.

145
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:41,149
You are the drollest, the cleverest,
the sharpest, the most hilarious...

146
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:43,017
You crack me up!

147
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:50,925
Steele. Just leave him out of this.

148
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:55,229
Oh, Balto, I've got a message
for your mother.

149
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:03,705
Hi, Mom!

150
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:07,408
Balto, translate this for me...

151
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,911
What's wolf for "Go chase your tail"?

152
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:11,446
Balto, stop! Whoa!

153
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,353
Get him.

154
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:23,458
Get out of here, wolf-dog.
You'd better get back to your pack!

155
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:28,496
Maybe it's the unrelenting fear talking,
but I'm seeing wisdom in this advice.

156
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:30,465
Maybe we go now, huh? Now!

157
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:35,570
I'm thinking Balto's friend
got his feathers ruffled!

158
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,538
Goose! Ha! I get it!

159
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:43,745
Half-wolf in the side pocket there.

160
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:47,782
That was the most dead centre,
the most on-target, the most down-the-middle...

161
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:49,751
Ya hit him!

162
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:58,159
That son-of-a...

163
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:02,997
He is the most malicious, the most disgusting,
obnoxious, the most revolting, the most repulsive...

164
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:04,766
He's no lap dog.

165
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:45,940
Not a dog, not a wolf.

166
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:49,610
All he knows is what he is not.

167
00:14:49,644 --> 00:14:52,980
If only he could see what he is.

168
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,986
Homesick, Boris?

169
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,090
- You ever think about going back?
- Don't fret, Fido.

170
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:12,894
I'm sticking here until I'm sure
you can stand on own four feet.

171
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:16,364
- YOU'RE taking care of ME?!
- Don't thank me.

172
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,234
I smell... herring.

173
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:23,604
- The herring are flying south too?
- Say!

174
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:26,474
- Must be Muk and Luk.
- Oh. Good news.

175
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,777
- Uncle Boris!
- Oh, no!

176
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,814
How sweet. "Uncle Boris. "

177
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:34,749
No hugging, no licking!

178
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,920
Uncle Boris!

179
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:50,164
He says he's glad to see you.

180
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,066
We love you. Uncle Boris.

181
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,323
What are you talking about?
Of course he's glad to see us.

182
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:19,160
He loves us... don't you?

183
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:21,462
Oy. OK, ОК.

184
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:25,166
Hey, boychicks, uh, let's play a game.

185
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,001
Yes, please. Uncle Boris.

186
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:29,337
Race you to the shore.
One, two, three, go!

187
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:33,341
They win.

188
00:17:33,374 --> 00:17:36,544
Help! Help! We can't swim!

189
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:41,482
Help! Help! We're drowning!
Save us, please!

190
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:42,884
Bears!

191
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,655
- Fellas! Idiot balls of fluff!
- Easy, Boris. You know how they are.

192
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:49,357
Muk! Luk!

193
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,727
Relax! Come on, you're OK.
You're not drowning.

194
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:57,965
He has point, bears.
You are not drowning.

195
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:01,436
Cause if you will pause one moment
you will observe that's...

196
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:03,471
... tide is out!

197
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,877
He said what?

198
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:13,815
Oh, the shame of the polar bear
who fears the water.

199
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:18,186
No wonder we are shunned
by our fellow bear. Woe is us!

200
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:21,356
It's what he said.
Kind of pathetic, really.

201
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,892
What, more whimpering?

202
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:29,564
Between you and Balto, it's like
Dostoevsky novel here. Lighten up.

203
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:37,505
And what is so interesting?

204
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:41,743
- Jenna.
- Is love.

205
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:44,312
So go make move.

206
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:50,018
When the angels' balalaikas
strum the sweet song of love, mambo!

207
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:52,520
Nan. She's not my type.

208
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,323
And why not?
This wolf business again?

209
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:58,826
What's wrong with being half
and half, I'd like to know?

210
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,262
Sometimes I wish lik crazy,
I was half eagle.

211
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:02,497
Why?

212
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,932
Better profile, for one thing. Hmm.

213
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:07,235
And no one eats you, for another.

214
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:16,377
Jenna?

215
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:19,947
Jenna!

216
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,850
Jenna! Hi, girl!

217
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:36,898
Rosy! Rosy, come on. You're gonna
catch your death out here.

218
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:40,168
- OK, Dad.
- Come on, the doctor's waiting.

219
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:24,712
Jenna?

220
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:27,415
Jenna.

221
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,617
Balto. Hi.

222
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:31,753
Hi.

223
00:20:31,786 --> 00:20:34,856
Look, uh...

224
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:38,059
Just a shot in the dark,
but I was wondering if...

225
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:43,398
I don't know, maybe you'd like to
go chase a few sticks by moonlight.

226
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:52,440
Jenna?

227
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:56,210
- Rosy's in there.
- In a hospital? Why?

228
00:20:57,145 --> 00:21:00,248
She feels warm
and she has a terrible cough.

229
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,720
Balto, what's wrong with her?

230
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:11,092
Uh, I'm not sure,
but I know how to find out. Come on.

231
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:15,730
I have the keys to the city.

232
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,838
After you.

233
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:28,009
Balto!

234
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:31,179
Big paws kinda run in my family.

235
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:34,015
At least, uh, one side of my family.

236
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:41,422
- Stay close.
- No problem there.

237
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:48,629
It's so gloomy down here.

238
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:50,698
Not that I'm scared or anything.

239
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,804
Gloomy? You kiddin'? It's the
most beautiful spot in the world.

240
00:21:56,938 --> 00:22:00,174
Dogs travel for years
just to be right here.

241
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,344
Here? I can't see why.

242
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:07,682
That's cos you're looking
at the bowl half empty.

243
00:22:07,715 --> 00:22:11,185
See this? It's the polar ice caps.

244
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,855
Balto, those are broken bottles.

245
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:17,291
And they're not half empty,
they're all empty.

246
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:19,961
- The sun.
- Oh, Balto...

247
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:23,398
And... to the north...

248
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:29,904
The northern lights!

249
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:35,276
Oh, Balto, you're right.

250
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:38,079
It's beautiful.

251
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,616
Yeah.

252
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:43,584
Beautiful.

253
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:54,796
- Good night, Rosy.
- I'm so cold.

254
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:59,500
I have another blanket for you here.
Stay warm and get some rest.

255
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,176
Doctor, how is she?

256
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:11,779
Exhausted from coughing.
Her fever's getting worse.

257
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:14,949
Looks like diphtheria.

258
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:18,486
She's the 18th case this week.

259
00:23:20,188 --> 00:23:24,125
And I'm out of antitoxin.

260
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:28,029
Jenna. Jenna, I'm sorry.

261
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:31,699
Jenna, I...
I didn't mean to upset you.

262
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:35,470
- I shouldn't have taken you there.
- No, I'm glad you did.

263
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,574
Steele.

264
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:42,310
Well, well.

265
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:46,481
What's wrong with this picture?
Jenna, join me for dinner.

266
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:49,584
You start at one end,
I'll start at the other.

267
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:52,754
When we get to the middle, well...

268
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:55,256
- You tell me.
- All right, Steele.

269
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:57,392
No, Balto.

270
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:04,866
Gee, Steele...

271
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:08,036
... I have to admit your offer
is very tempting.

272
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:10,471
It is.

273
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:15,176
But these days I prefer my meat... cooked.

274
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:21,516
Come on, let's go!

275
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:25,620
What's all the noise?

276
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:29,357
- I think it's over here.
- Jenna, come on.

277
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:39,701
Looks like Balto's found a way
to your meat locker.

278
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:43,671
Good thing Steele was here.
Good boy Steele, you've earned these.

279
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:47,842
Besides, I can't use 'em after
that wild animal's touched 'em.

280
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:52,447
Go on, get out of here, you thief!
Come on, Jenna, let's go home.

281
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:02,824
Anchorage. Stop.

282
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:05,059
Repeat, urgent request.

283
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:08,963
More diphtheria antitoxin. Stop.

284
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:12,266
Nome in grave danger. Stop.

285
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,069
Please help. Stop.

286
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:32,086
<i>Nome, pack ice closing in.</i>

287
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:36,557
<i>Cannot ship antitoxin by sea.</i>

288
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:39,560
<i>Will try by air.</i>

289
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:49,237
<i>Nome, storm at airport.</i>

290
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,975
<i>Planes grounded until storm clears.</i>

291
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,244
<i>Many regrets.</i>

292
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:59,447
<i>From Juneau, Office of the Governor,</i>

293
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:03,785
<i>we are shipping antitoxin by rail. Stop.</i>

294
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:06,454
<i>Train line ends at town ofNenana. Stop.</i>

295
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:09,157
<i>Select fastest dogs for sled team.</i>

296
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,594
<i>To carry antitoxin from Nenana to Nome. Stop.</i>

297
00:26:13,628 --> 00:26:17,932
<i>God willing, train will make it through. Stop.</i>

298
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:24,772
... to select the fastest dogs for
the sled team to fetch the antitoxin.

299
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:27,942
the race is from...

300
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:36,250
Just look at him.
He's gonna save the entire town.

301
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:39,887
He's positively... magnesium!

302
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:43,057
It's not exactly a one-dog show, Dixie.

303
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:46,160
They're racing to see who's gonna
be on the dog sled team.

304
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:49,597
What's with you, Jenna?
Steele's a genuine hero.

305
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,966
But do you give him a sniff?

306
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,837
That's because Jenna
is running with Balto.

307
00:26:55,903 --> 00:27:00,441
She was seen in the boiler room
the other night with Balto.

308
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:03,811
They went in together
and they left together.

309
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:06,848
I heard it all from
a very reliable source.

310
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:08,850
And don't bother to deny it.

311
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:11,019
Well, then I won't.

312
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:14,055
Oh! I'm speechless.

313
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:17,158
All mushers, get your dogs ready!

314
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:20,528
- The race is about to begin!
- Wait! Balto!

315
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:25,099
Racing is a spectator sport.
It requires very little preparation.

316
00:27:27,268 --> 00:27:29,971
You sit, you arrange refreshments.

317
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:31,973
You like potato chip?

318
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:37,378
I'm not watching the race,
I'm running it.

319
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:42,650
- You said what?
- Hey look, I wanna help Rosy get better.

320
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:44,852
I can get that medicine through.

321
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,821
First... First...

322
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:50,958
First of all get it through your had that they
wouldn't put you in a sled team

323
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:55,029
even if you did win, which won't happen
and if it did, it wouldn't matter.

324
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:59,067
Boris, did you ever think maybe you're
the reason the other geese fly south?

325
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:02,136
If only your feet
were as fast as your mouth.

326
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,006
- Dogs to the line!
- They're starting.

327
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,075
- Wish me luck.
- Luck?

328
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:11,512
I don't wish you luck,
I wish you sense!

329
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:15,216
Good luck, kiddo.

330
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:17,318
Balto? What are you, nuts?

331
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:20,955
If Steele catches you here,
he'll turn you into kibble!

332
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:24,992
Let the half-dog run. It will be fun
making him eat our snow.

333
00:28:25,026 --> 00:28:27,028
Get set.

334
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:30,031
- Balto?
- What does he think he's doing?

335
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:37,605
Oh, Balto, come on, come on!

336
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:40,041
Balto, go!

337
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:48,349
Hey! That's a foul!

338
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:51,786
Where's the referee? Is he blind?

339
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:58,059
Go, Balto, go! Jump, jump, jump!

340
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,862
Hey! That's my boy!

341
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:02,897
Go, Balto!

342
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,469
Balto, where are you going?

343
00:29:08,536 --> 00:29:13,041
That's the long way...
Balto, get back in the race!

344
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,082
Sorry!

345
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:25,420
Who's eating whose snow now, mutt?

346
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,792
Time!

347
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:36,931
Did I teach him well?.
I could kiss that crazy pooch.

348
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:47,408
Ok, Nikki, Kaltag, Star, move it.
We're strapping up.

349
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:50,011
Hey, now, just a second here, Steele.

350
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:52,246
I was the fastest dog.

351
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,850
You were the fastest... what?

352
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:59,687
Do you honestly think any musher
would ever put you on his team?

353
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:02,757
- You're more mixed-up thatn I thought!
- Steele!

354
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,195
It doesn't matter who's on the team
as long as the medicine gets through.

355
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:09,330
Stop being such a glory hound.

356
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:12,700
You're a hundred per cent right,
Jenna. I... I...

357
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,269
I wasn't thinking about those children.

358
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:20,141
The important thing here is to get the medicine
through, and that's just what I wanna do.

359
00:30:20,174 --> 00:30:23,745
And when I come back I'm gonna
fold you five ways...

360
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,314
and leave you for a cat toy.

361
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:28,850
Good dog, Steele.

362
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:32,353
Good boy! Now, let's take a look
at our winner here.

363
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:35,990
Let's take a look at our winner.

364
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,795
Ah, we can't trust this one.

365
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:43,331
- He's part wolf.
- See those teeth?

366
00:30:43,364 --> 00:30:45,166
He might turn on me.

367
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:48,536
Nikki, Kaltag, Star! Let's go!

368
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:59,914
- Balto, I'm sorry...
- Better not talk to me, Jenna.

369
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:03,551
- I might turn on you.
- Balto, wait. Balto!

370
00:31:08,456 --> 00:31:12,326
As long as there's hope
for those kids, I'll keep this lit.

371
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,295
It'll guide the team back.

372
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:17,398
Easy, easy. Back, back.

373
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:23,204
The sooner they leave,
the sooner they're back.

374
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:27,108
Stretch out, now.
Stretch out, Star.

375
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:15,790
Easy with that.

376
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:20,428
All right, now make sure
you lash her down tight.

377
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:22,563
Giddap, Steele! Giddap!

378
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:25,566
- Mush!
- Take care now, y'hear?

379
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,570
- Good luck!
- Go on, boys, go on! Move along.

380
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:44,819
Come on.

381
00:32:46,187 --> 00:32:47,822
Steele!

382
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:51,659
Maybe we should go back. We're lost!

383
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:55,196
I am not lost!

384
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:57,765
Lost? Heh-heh. Did I say lost?

385
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,634
You didn't let me finish.

386
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,270
- I wanted to say... Aaah!
- This way!

387
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:21,756
It's terrible, my friends.
Just terrible.

388
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:25,793
Steele and his team... are lost.

389
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:28,730
- No! Steele? - What
do you mean? - How come?

390
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:31,499
- When?
- They missed the second checkpoint.

391
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:33,735
They're off the trail.

392
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:35,870
Can't they send another team?

393
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:38,873
It's too dangerous
for us and our men.

394
00:33:38,906 --> 00:33:41,275
What about... them little ones?

395
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:44,579
The medicine won't be here in time.

396
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:47,181
We're going to lose them.

397
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,386
Rosy.

398
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:59,994
Please, Doctor,
it's the only medicine we got.

399
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:02,296
ок.

400
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:21,716
Jenna?

401
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:16,904
Rosy.

402
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:25,046
Balto, please.
Don't go crazy on me now.

403
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,750
This is foolishness.

404
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:32,020
You will die like a dog!
Oh, uh, no offence.

405
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:41,029
You will be frozen stiff by morning!

406
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:46,634
When you are big frozen-stiff
statue named Balto,

407
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:48,936
don't come running to me!

408
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:53,274
- He says...
- "Where is he going?"

409
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:57,145
He's going into freezing coldness
to find a dog he doesn't like

410
00:35:57,178 --> 00:36:00,648
to bring medicine back to a town
that doesn't like him!

411
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:03,584
Oh, no! I'm beginning
to understand the bear!

412
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,855
Yes! Yes! Count us in!

413
00:36:07,955 --> 00:36:09,857
Bears! Dogs!

414
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:12,727
Balto! Balto! Put me down!

415
00:36:16,964 --> 00:36:22,303
No brains at all! Might as well
be talking to hu... mans.

416
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:36,884
So, let's go get the medicine.

417
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:39,253
Wait a minute. Now you're coming?

418
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,157
Spending days in bitter cold,
facing wild animals.

419
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:45,326
risking death from exposure...

420
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,696
.. is like holiday in old country.

421
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:53,634
Oh! Great! We're goin' on holiday!

422
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:29,370
Balto?

423
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:33,541
Good, Balto!

424
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:35,943
You took on the roughest, toughest.

425
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:38,880
meanest tree in the forest...
and you won.

426
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:41,382
I'm marking the trail.

427
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:44,619
He's marking our trail.
He's very clever.

428
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,757
And here I've been dropping bread crumbs!

429
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,697
I spy with my little eye

430
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,666
something beginning with "S".

431
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:16,751
Steele.

432
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:26,427
Bears!

433
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:29,464
Come on.

434
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:33,000
Steele and his team passed this way.

435
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,136
Boy, is he lost.

436
00:38:43,611 --> 00:38:45,513
Steele!

437
00:38:45,546 --> 00:38:47,648
We're going in circles!

438
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:49,550
- What?
- Gaa-aaah!

439
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:54,389
Circles is a good thing. I mean,
they're, uh... They're circular.

440
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,026
I know what I'm doing! It's...

441
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:02,697
It's... this way! Come on!

442
00:39:47,275 --> 00:39:49,744
Ohh! I hit my head on somethin'.

443
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:51,746
Yeah. My head.

444
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:53,915
Looks like he's hurt bad, Steele.

445
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:56,617
W- what are we gonna do now, Steele?

446
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:27,615
Brilliant! Right on the beak!
What a bull's-eye!

447
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:32,186
That did it! Who did that?

448
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:38,326
I- It was him.

449
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:52,140
Guys, I think...

450
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,179
I think we should keep moving.

451
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:01,482
Is that your answer to all problems?
Motion?

452
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,922
Yeah, yeah! It's good.

453
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:09,924
Come on! Let's get going.

454
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:12,860
"Come on, boys. Let's go, boys.
Faster, boys. "

455
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:15,296
Easy to say for a guy with four legs!

456
00:41:16,798 --> 00:41:19,801
OK, that's it.

457
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:23,971
Is time for goose to
kick a little bear butt.

458
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:27,175
Aha! Finally!

459
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:31,379
Your old Uncle Boris
is making an impression!

460
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:33,381
Now what?

461
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:29,570
Jenna?

462
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:13,247
Balto!

463
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:52,320
Geronimo!

464
00:43:56,924 --> 00:43:58,860
Luk! Muk!

465
00:43:58,926 --> 00:44:00,895
They cannot swim!

466
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:03,798
What? Polar bears who can't swim?

467
00:44:19,147 --> 00:44:20,915
He's drowning!

468
00:44:22,183 --> 00:44:23,618
No!

469
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:27,155
Well?

470
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:29,691
I don't see them.

471
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:34,662
Where are they?

472
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:45,306
- Balto!
- Muk! Luk!

473
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:49,243
Balto!

474
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:00,455
Come to life. Come to life.

475
00:45:00,488 --> 00:45:02,490
Breathe! Come on!

476
00:45:02,523 --> 00:45:05,827
Is he be OK? He's not breathing.
He doesn't look very well.

477
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,895
Stop hitting him. Uncle Boris!

478
00:45:09,364 --> 00:45:13,000
Balto, I was so scared
I got people bumps.

479
00:45:15,403 --> 00:45:17,305
Boris...

480
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:21,476
I know you think
this trip is crazy, but...

481
00:45:22,677 --> 00:45:24,545
I'm glad you came.

482
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:28,516
Who else should you bring on a wild
goose chase but a goose, hmm?

483
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:31,052
- Are you OK?
- Are you OK? Jen...

484
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:35,656
I'm fine. Look, a message came through,
we have to take the mountain trail.

485
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,127
But if we take Eagle Pass,
it'll save us half a day.

486
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:43,464
It's blocked. The mountain trail
is dangerous, but we can do it.

487
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:47,268
I'm beginning to see
there isn't anything you can't do.

488
00:45:47,335 --> 00:45:49,737
I'm seeing a few things too.

489
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:52,006
and it's making the ice melt.

490
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:57,745
I hate bears!

491
00:45:57,845 --> 00:46:01,582
You guys oughta learn how to swim someday.
You'd be very good at it.

492
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:09,157
Of course we were in the water!
We were moving, we got wet...

493
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:14,228
Luk! We were swimming!

494
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:19,167
Ohh! Clumsy.

495
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:22,437
- No, you're not. You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

496
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:29,110
Maybe I'm not so fine.

497
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:32,113
- You should all go ahead without me.
- Jenna...

498
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:36,351
I'll be slowing everyone down.
Rosy can't hold out much longer.

499
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:42,824
Muk, you and Luk carry
Jenna back to town on this.

500
00:46:42,857 --> 00:46:47,695
And this time don't take time out for a swim!

501
00:46:47,762 --> 00:46:49,831
You can make sure of that, Boris.

502
00:46:49,864 --> 00:46:53,267
You're gonna lead them home.
Just follow my marks.

503
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:56,537
- You're going alone?
- Won't be the first time.

504
00:46:56,604 --> 00:47:00,208
Here. Afraid it won't keep you very warm.

505
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:02,810
Yeah, it will.

506
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:11,152
Well, of course Balto will come back.

507
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:13,821
He's Balto, will he?

508
00:47:13,855 --> 00:47:16,991
Hey! I'm coming back
with the medicine.

509
00:47:17,025 --> 00:47:18,793
I promise, Jenna.

510
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:21,129
Go ahead, guys. Take her home.

511
00:47:21,162 --> 00:47:24,699
Balto, I do not like
leaving you out here alone.

512
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:27,935
Who's going to tell you
how cold you are?

513
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:30,071
Boris.

514
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,340
They need you even more than I do.

515
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:39,647
Let me tell you something, Balto.

516
00:47:39,681 --> 00:47:43,051
A dog cannot make this journey alone.

517
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:48,556
But maybe a wolf can.

518
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:53,594
Right, you two balls of fluff! Let's move!

519
00:47:53,661 --> 00:47:55,897
Hey! Two, three, four!

520
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,666
<i>Nome. Stop.</i>

521
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,104
<i>Cannot send more antitoxin. Stop.</i>

522
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:07,375
<i>Weather too severe. Stop.</i>

523
00:48:07,408 --> 00:48:11,279
<i>Lost sled team only hope. Stop.</i>

524
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:14,882
<i>Our prayers are with them.</i>

525
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:17,418
<i>Anchorage. Stop.</i>

526
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:46,614
Steele.

527
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,892
Oh!

528
00:49:00,595 --> 00:49:02,330
Balto!

529
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,932
- Is that Balto?
- How did you find us?

530
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:10,004
- Is anyone hurt?
- Everyone... is... fine.

531
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:14,308
Yeah, but our mushier hit his head
and he didn't get up.

532
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:17,445
- And he's not movin'.
- All right, follow me.

533
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:19,280
I can lead you home.

534
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,350
We don't need your help!

535
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,652
М- maybe we should listen to him.

536
00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:28,589
How would youse get us home?

537
00:49:28,656 --> 00:49:32,026
Well, I marked the trail, like this.

538
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:33,961
- Oh! Yeah!
- Ohh!

539
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:38,066
I'll get us back.
I'm the lead dog. I'm in charge.

540
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:42,036
Then let me take back the medicine.
They're getting sicker.

541
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,310
Touch that box
and I'll tear you apart.

542
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:52,347
- Two bones says Steele takes him.
- You're on.

543
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:57,952
Steele, I'm not leaving
without that medicine.

544
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:02,357
Who do you think you are?

545
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,659
Hey, this is gonna be good.

546
00:50:04,692 --> 00:50:09,464
Since... Since when do you need
a pedigree to help someone?

547
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,167
Steele.

548
00:50:13,201 --> 00:50:15,436
Let me help you.

549
00:50:15,503 --> 00:50:17,472
Look at his eyes!

550
00:50:25,246 --> 00:50:28,516
- He'll feel that tomorrow.
-1 think he is feeling it now!

551
00:50:28,649 --> 00:50:30,318
Ouch!

552
00:50:32,353 --> 00:50:34,555
I don't want to fight.

553
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,930
- Whoa! That can't be legal!
- Yeah!

554
00:50:50,938 --> 00:50:52,740
That stuff is fragile!

555
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:55,710
What's with Steele?
All Balto wants to do is help.

556
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:14,862
Ah! Look!

557
00:51:50,264 --> 00:51:53,568
Oh, good boy.

558
00:52:14,322 --> 00:52:16,257
Mush!

559
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:22,964
Go ahead, wolf-dog!
You'll never get home!

560
00:52:24,165 --> 00:52:26,968
I'll make sure of that.

561
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,705
I'll show 'em.

562
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:34,208
Why not this way?
How about over here?

563
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:37,979
Oops! Wrong way!

564
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:42,517
Oh, no.

565
00:52:46,854 --> 00:52:48,690
Which way, Balto, which way?

566
00:52:48,756 --> 00:52:51,659
- Which way?
- Uh, this way.

567
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:14,248
- Why are you taking us in circles?
- I'm not!

568
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:18,219
I mean, I don't know. It's Steele.

569
00:53:18,286 --> 00:53:21,255
Maybe we was
better off with him there.

570
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:23,324
No! Come on. Mush!

571
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:33,167
Balto, slow down! Wait... Uhh!

572
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,207
Hey! Hey! Goin' too fast!

573
00:53:57,725 --> 00:53:59,260
Look out!

574
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:06,701
All right!

575
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:10,238
Good catch, Balto!

576
00:54:24,952 --> 00:54:26,454
I don't get it.

577
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:29,824
how could Balto hope to
find Steele and his team?

578
00:54:29,924 --> 00:54:31,826
They were off the trail.

579
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,062
Well, he's... tracking them.

580
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:36,064
That mutt?

581
00:54:36,097 --> 00:54:39,467
Tracking a championship team
in a blizzard?

582
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:49,143
- Balto?
- Steele!

583
00:54:49,177 --> 00:54:52,046
- You're alive!
- You're back!

584
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,850
- Where ya been?
- Are ya OK?

585
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,186
Steele, w-where are the others?

586
00:54:58,252 --> 00:55:03,458
- What happened to you?
- Well, one by one they... fell.

587
00:55:03,524 --> 00:55:06,194
Frozen, barely alive.

588
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,700
I pulled four onto the sled.

589
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,636
Three more on my back!

590
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:20,575
And, uh, I walked...

591
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,543
and I walked.

592
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,546
but i-it was just...
it was too late.

593
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,615
They were...

594
00:55:27,648 --> 00:55:30,618
What about the medicine?

595
00:55:30,651 --> 00:55:33,054
Well, uh, I... I went on,

596
00:55:33,154 --> 00:55:35,823
d- dragging the medicine alone...

597
00:55:35,857 --> 00:55:37,492
all alone...

598
00:55:37,525 --> 00:55:39,560
and... and then suddenly...

599
00:55:40,862 --> 00:55:43,831
that wolf-dog appeared, Balto.

600
00:55:43,865 --> 00:55:47,201
H- he demanded I let him
take the medicine.

601
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:53,574
You know, he just wanted
so much to be a hero in your eyes.

602
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,644
And h-he grabbed the crate.

603
00:55:58,312 --> 00:56:00,648
but he couldn't handle it.

604
00:56:00,715 --> 00:56:03,217
H- he couldn't see the patch of ice...

605
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:05,920
Th-the snow, the wind and...

606
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,456
And then the log and the cliff...

607
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:11,225
Well, he just didn't have a ch...

608
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:12,694
He just...

609
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,663
I'm sorry.

610
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:17,665
And then...

611
00:56:20,068 --> 00:56:22,603
My bandana!

612
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:27,075
He... made me promise
to take care of you, Jenna.

613
00:56:32,413 --> 00:56:34,382
You're lying.

614
00:56:34,415 --> 00:56:37,852
Steele's lying.

615
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:39,854
Balto's alive.

616
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:42,757
And he's coming home.

617
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:48,730
Uh... Well, you know,
she needs a little time.

618
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:32,006
The sun. Ice caps.

619
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,588
Balto.

620
00:57:59,834 --> 00:58:01,536
Rosy.

621
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,007
Hmm?

622
00:58:51,652 --> 00:58:54,022
<i>Let me tell you something, Balto.</i>

623
00:58:54,055 --> 00:58:58,693
<i>A dog cannot make this journey alone.</i>

624
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,764
<i>But maybe a wolf can.</i>

625
00:59:48,743 --> 00:59:51,879
Great, things are not bad enough.
Now we got wolves.

626
00:59:51,913 --> 00:59:54,382
Wolves?

627
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:57,719
- Hey, over here!
- What is it? What?

628
00:59:57,752 --> 01:00:01,089
- Balto?
- And he's got the medicine!

629
01:00:01,122 --> 01:00:04,025
Come on, Balto. Youse can make it.

630
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:10,732
That's the most amazing, the most fantastic,
that is the most incredible...

631
01:00:10,765 --> 01:00:13,601
That's the most phenomenal...

632
01:00:13,634 --> 01:00:16,004
That's good! Ohh!

633
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:19,974
Hey, he has got the feet of a wolf there.

634
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,177
- Come on, Balto.
- Keep tryin', baby.

635
01:00:23,277 --> 01:00:26,581
- Pull! Pull! You got it!
- Just keep pullin'!

636
01:00:26,614 --> 01:00:29,851
- You're almost there.
- Yeah! You got it!

637
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:33,321
- Come on, Balto!
- Come on, let's go!

638
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:36,924
- Let's go!
- Yes! You're there!

639
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:40,194
- That's it, that's it!
- All right!

640
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:43,197
-Yeah! All right!
- You did it!

641
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,433
Congratulations! That was great!

642
01:01:43,391 --> 01:01:45,693
Come on! Mush!

643
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,230
Gesundheit.

644
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,215
Mush!

645
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,461
Oh, dear.

646
01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:10,531
Come back to bed.

647
01:05:13,901 --> 01:05:16,304
Here, drink this.

648
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,808
Thanks.

649
01:05:38,426 --> 01:05:40,395
Balto.

650
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,669
В- B-Balto.

651
01:05:56,844 --> 01:05:58,446
Balto.

652
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:03,418
Balto's back!

653
01:06:08,823 --> 01:06:10,358
Jenna.

654
01:06:20,335 --> 01:06:22,303
The team!

655
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:24,505
They made it!

656
01:06:48,229 --> 01:06:50,164
Of course, as you know.

657
01:06:50,264 --> 01:06:52,367
I swam and I swam.

658
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,736
I was freezing cold. And then...

659
01:06:56,904 --> 01:06:59,741
Finally, I said, Steele,

660
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,810
you'll have to gnaw
your way to the surface.

661
01:07:02,844 --> 01:07:05,213
So I... What?

662
01:07:05,246 --> 01:07:08,249
It's Balto. With the medicine!

663
01:07:10,918 --> 01:07:13,488
Steele, you are positively...

664
01:07:13,554 --> 01:07:16,190
disposable!

665
01:07:23,731 --> 01:07:25,466
OK, OK. I can explain.

666
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,435
Tell me about it.

667
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,437
You guys weren't there, so you don't...

668
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:32,940
Wait a minute, guys.
Wait just a second. Please?

669
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,175
Get lost.

670
01:07:56,464 --> 01:08:00,234
Steady, there. Easy, now.
That's had a long journey.

671
01:08:00,268 --> 01:08:02,337
- How is he?
- He's gonna be OK.

672
01:08:20,922 --> 01:08:23,424
Good dog, Balto.

673
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:24,959
Dear, dear Balto.

674
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,396
Good boy!

675
01:08:28,429 --> 01:08:31,366
Not dog! Not wolf!

676
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,901
You're a hero!

677
01:08:33,935 --> 01:08:36,671
Balto!

678
01:08:44,178 --> 01:08:47,615
Come on, boy.
There's someone wants to see you.

679
01:08:47,715 --> 01:08:49,617
Thank you! Thank you!

680
01:09:04,465 --> 01:09:06,267
Mommy?

681
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,236
Rosy, darling. Ohh!

682
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,938
- I fell asleep.
- Rosy.

683
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:17,111
It's such a relief.

684
01:09:25,186 --> 01:09:26,688
Balto.

685
01:09:27,755 --> 01:09:29,791
I'd be lost without you.

686
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,801
Jenna.

687
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:02,924
Way to go, Balto!

688
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:06,227
He has the most endurance, the most fidelity,
the most intelligence!

689
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,796
They should build a statue of him!

690
01:10:08,863 --> 01:10:11,666
- You said it!
- I did?

691
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:40,895
This is it. Grandma.
Blaze found it.

692
01:10:49,103 --> 01:10:51,406
What does it say?

693
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:55,610
"Dedicated to the... " Indomable?

694
01:10:55,677 --> 01:10:57,578
Indomitable.

695
01:10:57,645 --> 01:11:02,583
"Indomitable spirit
of the sled dogs... "

696
01:11:02,617 --> 01:11:05,586
"... that relayed antitoxin

697
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:11,159
"600 miles from Nenana
to the relief of stricken Nome...

698
01:11:11,259 --> 01:11:14,329
"in the winter of 1925. "

699
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:18,466
"Endurance, fidelity, intelligence. "

700
01:11:18,499 --> 01:11:21,436
Balto really did do all of that,
didn't he, Grandma?

701
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:23,771
Oh, yes, sweetheart, he really did.

702
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:26,574
And today they run
the Iditarod Dog Race

703
01:11:26,607 --> 01:11:29,610
over the very path
he and the others took.

704
01:11:29,644 --> 01:11:33,448
- Can Blaze do that too. Grandma?
- Maybe.

705
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:35,616
With practice.

706
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,921
A lot of practice.

707
01:11:39,954 --> 01:11:42,490
Come on, Blaze. Come on! Mush!

708
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,866
Thank you, Balto.

709
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,936
I would've been lost without you.

710
01:11:58,006 --> 01:11:59,941
Grandma Rosy!

711
01:12:04,812 --> 01:12:07,015
Grandma Rosy, come on!

712
01:12:28,936 --> 01:12:32,473
# Deep in the night

713
01:12:32,507 --> 01:12:36,744
# The winds blow cold

714
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:40,648
# And in a heartbeat

715
01:12:40,682 --> 01:12:44,152
# The fear takes hold

716
01:12:45,286 --> 01:12:48,856
# Deep in the storm

717
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:52,994
# There's a place
that's soft and still

718
01:12:53,027 --> 01:12:57,265
# Where the road waits to be taken

719
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:01,336
# If you only will

720
01:13:01,369 --> 01:13:05,406
# The voices inside you

721
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,510
# Can lead you so astray

722
01:13:09,544 --> 01:13:13,614
# Believe in what you dream

723
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,450
# Don't turn away

724
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,985
# Don't you turn away

725
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:21,789
# Reach for the light

726
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:26,027
# You might touch the sky

727
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,864
# Stand on a mountain top

728
01:13:29,897 --> 01:13:34,402
# And see yourself flyin'

729
01:13:34,469 --> 01:13:38,106
# Reach for the light

730
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:42,176
# To capture a star

731
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:46,381
# Come out of the darkness

732
01:13:46,414 --> 01:13:48,383
# And find out

733
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:52,620
# Who you are

734
01:13:59,794 --> 01:14:02,597
# Somewhere in time

735
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:06,167
# The truth shines through

736
01:14:08,269 --> 01:14:10,772
# And the spirit knows

737
01:14:10,805 --> 01:14:14,008
# What it has to do

738
01:14:15,309 --> 01:14:18,846
# Somewhere in you

739
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:23,017
# There's a power with no name

740
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:27,188
# It can rise to meet the moment

741
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:31,359
# And burn like a flame

742
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:35,530
# And you can be stronger

743
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:39,634
# Than any fear you know

744
01:14:39,667 --> 01:14:43,705
# Hold on to what you see

745
01:14:43,805 --> 01:14:45,640
# Don't let it go

746
01:14:45,673 --> 01:14:48,076
# Don't you let it go

747
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:51,879
# Reach for the light

748
01:14:51,979 --> 01:14:56,050

# And your destiny is callin'

758
01:15:29,751 --> 01:15:32,820
# Listen to the thunder roll

759
01:15:32,854 --> 01:15:34,689
# And let your heart

760
01:15:34,756 --> 01:15:37,258

761
01:15:52,073 --> 01:15:54,075
