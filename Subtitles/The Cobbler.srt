00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,417
Hello, Max.

3
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,787
I'm dropping these off,
they were my Albert's shoes.

4
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,223
They shouldn't go to waste,
you should sell them.

5
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,891
I don't sell shoes,
Mrs. Stevens.

6
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,593
And his overcoat
is in there too.

7
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,362
It's very nice,
you should wear it.

8
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,997
Well, I don't...

9
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,434
You should take your
coat, Mrs. Stevens.
I don't need it.

10
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,537
Uh, $16.

11
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,540
So, where did you go?

12
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,476
Oh, yeah?
Who else was there?

13
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,613
Thanks.

14
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,281
Mmm.

15
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,549
Sir, you have a light?

16
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,353
No, uh, do I...
Excuse me, sir.

17
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,721
Do you have a light?
Sure.

18
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,055
Thank you.

19
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,760
Thanks. Sorry.

20
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,663
Yeah, I know, he
thinks he's adorable.

21
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,565
There you go. Cheers.

22
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,966
Hello, mate,
you all right?

23
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,501
Hey.

24
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,775
Morning, kid.

25
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,178
Mornin', Jimmy.

26
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,147
Yeah, that's crazy.

27
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,982
Now, that's
an attractive-looking couple.

28
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,784
Babe?
Yeah.

29
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,619
Come on.
All right,
gotta go.

30
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,155
If they ever have a kid,
you won't be able
to look directly at it.

31
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,631
What about you?

32
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,533
Max, you got
any prospects?

33
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,734
Me? No.

34
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,104
Well, you should.
You're a good-looking guy.

35
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,006
You got a good job.
That kid's got
nothing on you.

36
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,342
He's got his
own driver.

37
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,545
What, you got somewhere
you wanna go?

38
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,114
I don't know.

39
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,418
Maybe it's about time
I figure out my own
thing, you know.

40
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,253
You're a cobbler,
that's your thing.

41
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,721
It's my father's thing.

42
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,290
And his father
before that.
You should be proud.

43
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,728
Yeah. I gotta get
back to work.

44
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,531
Hey, hey,
how's your mother?
You give her those pears?

45
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,500
I did.
She says, "Thank you."

46
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,001
All right,
let her know...

47
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,972
Kids.

48
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,044
Hi.

49
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,548
Is this your shop?

50
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,450
No, it's actually
my father's.

51
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,520
Is he here?
No, he is not.

52
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,955
Well, I've been trying
to talk to all the
proprietors in the area.

53
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,957
Do you expect
him back soon?

54
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,993
No, I don't expect
him back soon.

55
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,028
Can I help you?

56
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,898
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.
Uh, what's your name?

57
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,166
Max Simkin.

58
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,501
Well, Max,
I'm Carmen Herrara

59
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,136
from the Lower East
Side Action Committee.

60
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,204
Okay.

61
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,972
Basically, we're dedicated
to the preservation

62
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,041
and rejuvenation of
the Lower East Side.
Uh-huh.

63
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,709
We're trying to stop
real estate developers

64
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,244
from converting
the neighborhood

65
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,979
into luxury housing
and retail spaces,

66
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,981
forcing the regular
people out.

67
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,449
How are they
forcing them out?

68
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,684
Money.

69
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,720
I mean, they buy them out
or they raise the rent.

70
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,890
How much do you think
I'd get for a place
like this?

71
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,226
That doesn't matter.

72
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,695
It does to me.

73
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,965
Max, we need people
like you to stay.

74
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,867
That's why we're
doing all of this.

75
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,102
Well, maybe you should
have checked with me first,

76
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,038
make sure I wanna stay.

77
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,442
Yeah, that's fair.

78
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,478
You know what?
Come here, I wanna
show you something.

79
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,954
Look around you, Max.

80
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,022
What do you see?

81
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,891
The city.
Exactly.

82
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,093
The city.

83
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,494
A living city.

84
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,763
And your shop
is a part of it.

85
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,900
How long have you had
this shop for, Max?

86
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,068
Fourth generation.

87
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,869
That's amazing.

88
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,973
See? This is not just
a playground for the rich.

89
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,240
It is for all of us.

90
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,109
Don't you think?

91
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,711
Yeah, I guess.

92
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,246
Good. So could
you sign this?

93
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,116
Okay.
Great. Thanks.

94
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,920
Do you have
plans tonight?

95
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:23,955
Excuse me?

96
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,824
There's a rally
if you're interested.

97
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,859
Mmm. Mmm.

98
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,095
Here. Here's a flyer.

99
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,697
Mr. Solomon is a
wonderful old man who
lives on Grand Street

100
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,499
and they're trying to evict
him from his apartment.

101
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,235
Okay.

102
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,338
Our office is on
Orchard Street,
come by.

103
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,240
You should really
get involved, Max.

104
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,775
Okay.

105
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,877
Okay.

106
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,054
Hey. Did you get
her number?

107
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,690
It's not that.

108
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,318
Ma?

109
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,954
Uh-huh.

110
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,460
What are you doing here?

111
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,195
You'll break
your eardrums.

112
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,464
Did you bring any pears?

113
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,835
I brought you pears
yesterday, Ma, remember?
From Jimmy.

114
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,337
Yes, call Papa.
Tell him to bring pears.

115
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,307
Okay. I will.
Good boy.

116
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,042
How was work?

117
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,512
Work was, uh, same
as every other day.

118
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,182
Why don't you call
the Abramowitz girl?

119
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,951
Take her out on
a date this weekend.
She always liked you.

120
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,089
Uh, she got married
10 years ago.

121
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,390
She's got three kids.

122
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,559
She's a pretty girl.

123
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,294
You should step up
to the plate.

124
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,598
Um.

125
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,634
Okay, I will.
But not tonight.

126
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,404
You ready for dinner?

127
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,406
Yeah, it's in
the microwave.

128
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,568
Yo, shoeman!

129
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,639
Come on, let's go, man.
Time is money.

130
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,647
What's up, man?
Come on, hook me up.

131
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,383
Yeah, sure.

132
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,086
How you doing today,
my G? Working hard?

133
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,221
Yes.
Yeah? Good. Good.

134
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,523
Can't knock the hustle.

135
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,125
Work hard, play harder,
right player?

136
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,494
God bless Americola.

137
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,033
You like that watch, huh?

138
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,036
Sure.

139
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,872
Shit, I got a collection
at home worth
three times this shop.

140
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,075
You can always tell
a man by his watch,
right, shoeman?

141
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,311
Four bucks.

142
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,646
Four bucks?

143
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,748
That's the rate.

144
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,850
Fair enough.

145
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,288
Oh, almost forgot.

146
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,425
I need these
fixed, shoeman.
Okay.

147
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,195
What do you want done?

148
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,931
New soles,
and I need 'em tonight.

149
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,533
We close at 6:00.

150
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,635
You close when
I get my shoes.

151
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,209
I'm just playing
with you, shoeman.

152
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,877
See you at 6:00.

153
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,859
<i> Right.</i>

154
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,996
You sure you
can't come today?

155
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,399
<i> Okay. Well, I'll see you</i>
<i> tomorrow. Thank you.</i>

156
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,980
Max?
Yeah!

157
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,619
What are you
doing down here?

158
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,622
Using this old stitcher.
Mine... Mine busted.

159
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,492
Whoa. Look at this thing.

160
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,295
Yeah, it's something, huh?

161
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:34,098
My pop taught me how
to use this when I was little.

162
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,733
And it still works?

163
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,670
I'm surprised, but
it's doing the trick.

164
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:39,837
Yeah.

165
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,507
Shows you what I know.

166
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,043
I was always telling your
pop he should sell this crap

167
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,878
and make some money,

168
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
but he could never
throw anything away.

169
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,115
Yeah, except his family.

170
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,619
He didn't throw
you away, Max.

171
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,790
Hmm.

172
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,793
Uh, my post is up
on the chair.

173
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,631
Oh. All right, I'll...
I'll leave you the news.

174
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,791
<i> Hey, I'm going around</i>
<i> the corner for a beer,</i>
<i> you wanna come?</i>

175
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,627
Nah, I gotta wait
for a customer.

176
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,962
Ah, good for you.

177
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,331
Keep 'em
coming back.
Yes.

178
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,599
Listen.

179
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,404
I picked up an extra jar
from the Pickle Guys.

180
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,672
Hey, thank you.

181
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,475
Okay, good night, kid.
Good night, Jimmy.

182
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,743
What the hell was that?

183
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,327
Oh, boy.

184
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,028
Wow.

185
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,658
What the hell?

186
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,547
It's the stitcher.

187
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,227
Oh, my God.

188
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,547
He's dead! He's dead!
He's dead!

189
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,033
Whoa!

190
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,402
I'm a woman.

191
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,540
Ooh. No, I'm not.

192
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,775
No, I'm not.

193
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,578
Ten and a half?

194
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,213
Yeah.

195
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,414
Nice.

196
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,421
Yep, that's them. Great.
All right.

197
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:40,991
Sorry about losing
the ticket, pal.
Don't worry, everybody does.

198
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,828
I put taps on
the front and back.
Beautiful.

199
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,497
How much?
That's 12 bucks.

200
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,932
You got it.

201
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,168
You look familiar.
You an actor
or something?

202
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,304
Uh, no. TV reporter.

203
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:57,041
Yeah. That's right. Uh,
from New York One.
Yeah.

204
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,609
The guy with
the two first names.

205
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,511
Yeah.
Danny Donald.

206
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,813
Danny Donald. Wow.

207
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,783
My mother watches
you all the time.

208
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,551
Yeah? That's great.

209
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,989
You look like you,
but you're a little
different.

210
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,896
You like that?
You like being on TV?

211
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,765
It's great.
I love going to work.

212
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,633
I'm a lucky guy.
Yeah.

213
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,437
Here, it's my card.
Oh, yes.

214
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,506
Tell your mother I said,
"Thanks for watching."

215
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:29,874
Oh, yeah.

216
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,410
Thanks again.
Yeah, I will.

217
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,618
Hello.

218
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,187
Can I help you?

219
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,423
Uh, what time
do you close?

220
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,892
6:00. It's on the door.

221
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,629
Okay.

222
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,465
You want a haircut?

223
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,634
No. I have to go now.

224
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,370
Okay.

225
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,073
So go.

226
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,509
Good-bye, Jimmy.

227
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,591
It freaking works.

228
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:24,495
I can't believe it.
He had no idea who I was.

229
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,365
I could be anybody I want.

230
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,458
This is great.

231
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,027
I'm gonna hang out
in the Chinatown.

232
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,663
I have an accent.

233
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,000
I have an accent.

234
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,735
Nice!

235
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,027
Ten and a half.

236
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,696
Got some big
feet there, kid.

237
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,932
I'm big boned.

238
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,816
Thank you.
Welcome, sir.

239
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,318
Where's the bathroom?

240
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,187
Ah, yes. To your left
and down the stairs.

241
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,709
Park it.

242
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,557
Okay. Thank you.

243
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,998
Excuse me.

244
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,166
Yeah?

245
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,235
What size are
your shoes?

246
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,572
Ten and a half. Why?

247
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:23,273
Gimme them.

248
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,509
What?
Give me your shoes.

249
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,913
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm real serious.

250
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,185
I don't believe
this shit.

251
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,703
Wow!

252
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,205
Whoo!

253
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,709
Bye-bye.

254
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,847
Whoo!

255
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,493
Mmm.

256
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,096
Oh.

257
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,065
What is this?

258
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,767
Yeah, those
are for you.

259
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,370
Oh, so pretty.

260
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,338
I knew you'd like them.

261
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,775
How was your day, Maxie?

262
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:34,578
It was good.
It was really good.

263
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,914
It was the best day
I've had in a long time.

264
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,349
Good.

265
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,718
You work so hard.

266
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,786
How was your day, Ma?

267
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:50,160
Uh, better, now that
my <i> tateleh</i> is home.

268
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,862
Yeah.

269
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:54,898
Hey, Ma, let me
ask you something.

270
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,401
You ever wish you
were somebody else?

271
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,136
No.

272
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,873
I'm your mother.

273
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,008
That's all I ever
wanted to be.

274
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:11,281
But if you could do
whatever you wanted to do

275
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,850
what would it be?

276
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,285
Um.

277
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,327
Have dinner with your father.

278
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,097
That would be nice.

279
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,138
That would be
really nice.

280
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:55,826
Hi.

281
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,364
Hi.
Hi.

282
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,599
How are you?

283
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,601
Good. How are you?
Very good.

284
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,537
Good. Emiliano wanted
me to drop these off.

285
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,206
What does he want done?

286
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,008
Whatever they need.

287
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,778
Well, it's a 10 and a half.

288
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,116
I could clean
'em up for you.
Okay.

289
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:22,252
Mmm, looks like
they need new soles.

290
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,254
Sounds good.

291
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,026
Here you are.

292
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,128
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.

293
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,646
Hey, man.
What can I get you?

294
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,281
I'll have a light beer.

295
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,983
No light beer.

296
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:28,285
Here is the beer list.

297
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,688
And here is our
cocktail list.

298
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,891
Why don't you
check that out?

299
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,927
What's a pickletini?

300
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,795
Uh, it's vodka
and pickle juice.

301
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:39,930
Want one?

302
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,032
Sure. Okay.

303
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,634
You'll love it.

304
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,751
Enjoy, buddy.

305
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,789
Hi.

306
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,758
Hi.

307
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,760
I know who
you are.

308
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,695
You do?
Yeah.

309
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,797
I saw you spin at the
Jane on New Year's.

310
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,632
You saw me spin?

311
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,735
Isn't that what
you call it?

312
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,038
Anyway, I tried
to pick you up.

313
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,073
Oh, yeah?

314
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,641
Did it work?

315
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:27,044
No. You went home
with that model.

316
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:28,979
You were all
over each other.

317
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:31,248
Oh, yeah,
that's my girlfriend.

318
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,649
It wasn't
your girlfriend.

319
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,351
Yeah, we live together.

320
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:37,154
No, it definitely
wasn't your girlfriend.

321
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,655
Well, how do
you know that?

322
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:39,756
'Cause it was a guy.

323
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,793
What... A guy?
Are you kidding me?

324
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,227
It's okay.

325
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,229
I don't care.
I think it's hot.

326
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:47,931
You... You do?

327
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,933
Mmm-hmm.

328
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,871
Oh.

329
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,278
Hi.

330
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,647
So, where are we going?

331
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,949
Uh, I don't know.
Where do you live?

332
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,585
Can't do that, love.
Boyfriend, sorry.

333
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:12,556
Oh. Oh. Uh, okay,
well, we could go to my place.

334
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,324
Just got to make a call.

335
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,659
Who are you calling?

336
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,194
Uh, my mother.

337
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,197
You... You live
with your mother?

338
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,566
Yeah. And she gets a
little screwy at night,

339
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,034
so I don't wanna
surprise her.

340
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,838
Really?
Where do you live?

341
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,473
Sheepshead Bay.

342
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,842
Get home safe.

343
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,045
My name is Bond,

344
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,247
James Bond.

345
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:40,550
And I live in
Sheepshead Bay
with my mother.

346
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,391
Oh, hey.

347
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,725
How's it goin', mate?

348
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,494
All right.
Beautiful night for it.

349
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:51,962
Oh, yeah.

350
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,410
<i> Yeah?</i>

351
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,613
I forgot my keys.

352
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:12,749
<i> You're a dork.</i>
<i> I'm about to take a shower.</i>

353
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,869
You there?

354
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,071
Yeah.

355
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,874
Come here.

356
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,111
You want me to come in?

357
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,813
Yeah, come here.

358
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,221
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

359
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:52,989
What the hell
are you wearing?

360
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,991
You're beautiful.

361
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,059
Are you high?

362
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,428
No, but I wish I was.

363
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,797
Get over here.

364
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,767
Oh sure, okay.

365
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,743
Thank you.

366
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,879
Look, I'm sorry
I screamed at you before.

367
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,181
It's just...

368
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,717
I get scared and I need
to know you want me here.

369
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,120
Oh, I... I do.

370
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,855
I definitely do.

371
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,090
Get in here, cute boy.

372
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,926
Me with...
Really, in there?

373
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,362
With you?
Yeah, really.

374
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,164
Your friends can wait.

375
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,234
Oh, yeah. Yep. Yeah.

376
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:40,337
Definitely,
they can wait.

377
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,141
My friends can wait.

378
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,445
What?

379
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,483
I can't do this.

380
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,185
I gotta go.
Are you serious?

381
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,587
Yeah, I am.
I'm really sorry.

382
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,024
Why are you acting
like such a spaz?

383
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,393
I'm not, I just...
Is this thing locked?

384
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:04,628
What's the matter
with you?

385
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,496
I've got it, right.
What are you doing?

386
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,698
I gotta go.
I'm really sorry.

387
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,433
Bye.

388
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,801
Emiliano?

389
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,037
Emiliano, come back.

390
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,506
Emiliano!

391
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,243
<i> We are here in the</i>

396

399
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,527
He came by the shop
the other day,
I meant to tell you.

400
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,095
How's work?

401
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,331
Work?

402
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,233
Work, uh...
Work was something.

403
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,069
And it's Carmen.

404
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,271
<i> ...and I too have lived</i>
<i> here all of my life...</i>

405
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:50,006
She was in the shop, too.

406
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,209
<i> ...to stay here and</i>

Yeah me, too.

414
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,261
Who's Carmen?

415
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,803
Max!

416
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,672
Hey.

417
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:25,075
Hi, how's it going?

418
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:28,311
Good. You left
your door open.
Oh, pfft!

419
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,347
Can you shut that
for me, please?

420
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,848
Sure.
Thanks.

421
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,654
I'm delivering
groceries to one of
our elderly neighbors.

422
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,822
All by yourself?

423
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:40,557
Yeah, Max,
I'm a badass.

424
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,592
Yeah, okay.

425
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,061
So, you like pickles, huh?

426
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,297
Yeah. Do you?

427
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,632
No, not really.

428
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:50,867
But I'm glad that
you're supporting
a local business.

429
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,469
That's cool.

430
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:55,405
Oh, we need more names
for our petition.

431
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,774
Do you think you could
get your dad to sign?

432
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,743
No.

433
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,112
Max, this is important.

434
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:06,483
I know. My, uh,
father took off
a while ago.

435
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,018
He ain't around anymore.

436
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,353
I'm sorry.

437
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,588
It happens.

438
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,957
Yeah, it does.
My dad split
when I was 12.

439
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,158
Life goes on.

440
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,295
Yeah, right.

441
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,297
Yeah, I gotta
deliver these.

442
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,499
I'll see you soon, Max.
Okay.

443
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,769
Come by the office,
get involved.

444
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,072
Yeah. Okay.

445
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,453
Hey, Pop.

446
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,158
There you are.

447
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,580
Ma?

448
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,285
Wow!

449
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,254
You look beautiful.

450
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:27,891
Come on, it's time.

451
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,859
Okay, my love.

452
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,850
Abraham?

453
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,752
Hello, Sarah.

454
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,967
Of course I'm home.

455
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,402
We have a date.

456
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,410
I missed you so much.

457
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,180
I'm here now.

458
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,584
But where did you go?

459
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,489
I went for pears.

460
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,058
Remember?

461
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,561
Yes, of course.

462
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,333
I'm so glad you're home.

463
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,468
Me too.

464
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,883
Good-bye, Pop.

465
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,521
Good-bye, son.

466
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,784
Ma, you overslept?

467
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,786
Is that what happens
when you have a big date?

468
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,188
Ma?

469
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,931
Ma.

470
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,503
Ma?

471
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,773
Ma?

472
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,412
Ma.

473
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,514
Oh, Ma.

474
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,651
Oh, no.

475
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,362
Max. Max.

476
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,898
You should start saving
for a nice headstone.

477
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,268
She deserves a
nice headstone,
your mother.

478
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,504
They're not cheap, Max.

479
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:35,571
Yeah.

480
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,877
Good of you to come.

481
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,384
How you doin', kid?

482
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:50,119
You're gonna
freeze out here.

483
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,688
I'm all right.

484
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,992
Hey, this was...
This was really nice.

485
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:57,527
What you did.

486
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,296
She'd have liked it.

487
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,935
You were a good
son to her, Max.

488
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,673
Look, Max,

489
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,042
if your dad was
here right now...

490
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,777
But he's not here.

491
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,117
I was all she had and
I wasn't good enough.

492
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,120
Of course you were.

493
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:26,189
You don't know
the half of it, Jimmy.

494
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,326
I can't even afford
a decent headstone.

495
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,495
I can help out, kid,
you know that.

496
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,430
Why?

497
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,466
What have I ever
done for you?

498
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:38,401
What have I ever
done for anybody?

499
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:45,842
Look, you're hurting
right now, but don't
beat yourself up. Okay?

500
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,744
I better go back
inside, Jimmy.

501
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,379
Thanks for coming.

502
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:51,948
Max?

503
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,583
I promise

504
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:56,519
it's gonna get better.
Just give it time.

505
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:58,788
Don't do anything
you'll regret.

506
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,957
It's a little
late for that.

507
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:08,998
Yo, shoeman?

508
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:11,167
Shoeman?

509
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:13,369
Yes.

510
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,341
Yo, where you been, man?

511
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:21,444
I've been back and forth
to the shop all week
waiting on your punk ass.

512
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,579
I'm sorry.

513
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,515
I was sitting <i> shivah</i> .

514
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,049
Where they do that at?

515
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,719
It's a Jewish ritual for

516
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:31,521
when somebody dies.

517
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,823
You Jewish?

518
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:34,991
Yeah.

519
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,526
Lucky you.

520
00:46:36,528 --> 00:46:38,928
So who croaked, man?

521
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,029
What?

522
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:42,899
Who died? Or you just
making some shit up?

523
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,069
My mother.

524
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,472
Oh, man.

525
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,541
Sorry to hear that.

526
00:46:51,543 --> 00:46:54,110
She leave you
any money, man?

527
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:56,546
No, right? Figures.

528
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:58,748
Ain't that just
like a woman?

529
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,819
Do you have your ticket?

530
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:05,421
Do I look like
I got my ticket, man?

531
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,989
Just go back there
and get my shoes

532
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,758
before I kick some skin
off your forehead.

533
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,793
You know how much
them gators cost?

534
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:13,396
No, I don't.
But you need
your ticket.

535
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,568
New rules, shoeman.

536
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,169
You find my shoes
by tomorrow

537
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,705
or you gonna be reunited
with your moms real quick,

538
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:23,773
you got that?

539
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,275
I got it.

540
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,463
Hey, Mommy,
you want another baby daddy?

541
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,298
Jerk.

542
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,807
You got two days to pay
or I'll kill you.

543
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:32,975
So long.

544
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,276
Yo, fatty had a party,
what you lookin' at, man?

545
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,147
I ain't no box
of Twinkies, yo.

546
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,151
Take the stairs.

547
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,825
Hello?

548
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,634
Jesus!
What are you doing here?

549
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,269
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

550
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,271
I thought you left.
What?

551
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,107
Why are you back?

552
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,944
Oh, um,
I forgot something.

553
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:16,545
Oh, yeah,
what'd you forgot?

554
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,180
You forgot to
hit me again?

555
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,348
No.

556
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,650
Yeah, well I'm taking
my shit and I'm leaving.

557
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:22,718
Okay.

558
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,822
Do you know where my
watches are by any chance?

559
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:29,091
I didn't touch your
stupid watches.

560
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:30,793
I was just asking
where they were.

561
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,561
I have no idea,
but if I did

562
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,363
I'd take them and
I'd sell them shits.

563
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,098
You took my money,
Leon, and you know it.

564
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,933
I worked my ass off
and you just took it!

565
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:40,836
Let me get
that for you.
Don't touch my stuff!

566
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:42,238
I was just trying to help.

567
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,875
Leon, one day you're
gonna get yours.

568
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,076
You're gonna get yours.

569
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:52,915
Go to hell.

570
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,387
Man, this guy is a jerk.

571
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,924
Come on.

572
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,498
Come on.

573
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,566
Where?

574
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,904
Where, where?

575
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:39,061
What the crap?

576
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,696
What the crap?

577
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,601
Oh, my God.

578
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,970
What is that?

579
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:56,445
Ahhh!

580
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,277
What the...
Hey.

581
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,950
Ahhh!

582
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,128
I don't know who you are,

583
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,530
but you're dead.

584
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,422
Hi.

585
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:20,296
It's no use. I tied
you down pretty good.

586
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:22,865
Just tell me where you hide
your watches and I'll split.

587
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:28,804
You finished?

588
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,309
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

589
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,344
I'm not a bad person.

590
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:36,779
I just gotta take
care of some things

591
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,980
and do right by my mother.

592
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:39,915
Okay?

593
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,522
I don't know who put
you up to this, fat boy,

594
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:49,158
but I'm gonna cut a slab
of bacon off your back.

595
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,294
That's rude.

596
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:53,963
And I'm not fat,

597
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:55,264
I'm big-boned.

598
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,002
Oh, well, suit yourself.

599
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,239
But you'll be sorry.

600
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,351
I heard somebody's
not cooperating.

601
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,825
You done?

602
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,461
I'm gonna make this easy.

603
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,029
The watches?

604
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,498
You gotta know

605
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,166
you can't hide looking
the way you do.

606
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:33,202
I'll take my chances.
The watches.

607
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,975
There's a fake wall behind
the bathroom mirror.

608
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,144
<i> So here's</i>
<i> how we're gonna do this.</i>

609
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:44,947
<i> I'm gonna take your</i>
<i> watches, tase you,</i>

610
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:48,617
<i> and you're gonna</i>
<i> wake up in your bed</i>
<i> like it's a bad dream.</i>

611
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,085
Wow.

612
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,356
That was a
great hiding spot.

613
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:56,925
Okay, you ready?

614
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,065
Be careful with that, man,
that's not a regular Taser.

615
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:04,466
That's weapons-grade shit!

616
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,602
I'm sorry, man.
I have to do this,
it's the only way.

617
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,438
Yo, boss!
Yo!

618
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,646
Oh, crap.

619
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,287
You scream
and I will tase you

620
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:28,223
and throw you out
the back window.
You got that?

621
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,925
Now, who is that?

622
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,494
That's my boys.

623
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,430
We've got business.

624
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:35,931
And when they see you,

625
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,200
they're gonna just about
break you in half.

626
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:39,635
What kind of business?

627
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:41,236
Gotta pick up
my money, bitch.

628
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:42,371
How much money?

629
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:44,306
What the hell
is it to you?

630
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,141
Fifty large.

631
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,243
$50,000?

632
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,390
Hey, boss.

633
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,392
Hey.

634
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,327
New coat?

635
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,663
Yeah.

636
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:09,832
Let's go.

637
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,044
Gotta make a
quick stop, boss.

638
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,313
Got a little
surprise for you.

639
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,983
I just wanna
pick up my money.

640
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:30,753
It's on the way.
You're gonna like this.

641
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,695
Hey, boss,

642
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,764
remember our
old friend Patrick?

643
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,066
Patrick the Ratprick.

644
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,636
I didn't know
it was you, Leon.

645
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:22,638
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

646
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,306
We found Ratprick
down in Philly.

647
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:25,741
Bitch tried to run.

648
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,876
No more.

649
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,845
No more, please. Please.

650
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:31,747
No more? Okay.

651
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:32,815
Okay.

652
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,085
Bye-bye, Ratprick.

653
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,621
No, don't! Hold on!
Stop, stop, stop!

654
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:43,992
Okay, boss,
what do you want to do?

655
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,262
I don't know.

656
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:49,031
I gotta think about this.

657
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:50,899
Is there a bathroom
around here?

658
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,401
What?

659
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,903
I gotta pee.

660
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,805
Oh man, oh man, oh man.

661
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,842
Oh man, oh man.
You should not be here.

662
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:02,911
You should not be here.
You should not be here.

663
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,150
You can do this.

664
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,093
You sorry for what
you did, Ratprick?

665
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,098
Yeah.

666
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,401
And you're never
gonna do it again?

667
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,605
No.

668
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,508
Okay, I believe you.

669
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:35,544
You believe me?

670
00:58:35,546 --> 00:58:36,678
He believes me.

671
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,980
Let him go.

672
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:40,182
Let him go?
That's it?

673
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,384
Yeah, that's it.

674
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:44,553
Maybe take him
to the hospital,
he's in bad shape.

675
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:46,054
Boss, he stole from us.

676
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:48,690
I know!
The guy apologized.

677
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,360
Just do what I said.

678
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,161
I'm the boss, right?

679
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,430
Thank you!

680
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,366
Thanks a lot!

681
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:33,335
Leon, follow me.

682
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,903
You stay here.

683
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:45,147
Good evening,
Mr. Ludlow.

684
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,451
I am making duck ragu.

685
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,219
First time,
very tricky business.

686
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,088
Do you like duck, Leon?

687
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,691
I don't know.

688
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:57,626
Yeah, me neither.

689
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:00,395
I'm a Jew from Queens.
What do I know from duck?

690
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,435
Are you okay, Leon?

691
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,271
Yeah. I'm fine.

692
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:12,407
Good. I am ready to
move forward on the
Grand Street deal.

693
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:15,644
I will need the trash
taken out before Friday.

694
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,814
You get the rest
when the job is done.

695
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,116
Okay.

696
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,418
There is no margin
for error on this one.

697
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,421
None. None. You got it?

698
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,458
Yeah, I got it.

699
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:34,796
Maybe you'll stop by
for some duck ragu
when you're through.

700
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,509
Holy crap.

701
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,747
Okay, Ludlow, it's time.

702
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,351
Welcome home, Mommy.

703
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,953
Turn around.

704
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,827
So where are your
friends at, huh?
What?

705
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,629
The fat kid,
the guy that
looks like me.

706
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:08,830
No, it's just me.

707
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,267
Damn, you ugly.

708
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,937
And what have we here, hmm?

709
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:19,574
Thought you were gonna
steal my watches, huh?

710
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:24,579
Don't shoot me, please.

711
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:26,214
Oh, don't worry.

712
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,683
I ain't gonna
shoot you, she-man.

713
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,787
I am gonna
choke you to death.

714
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:50,872
Shoeman!

715
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,274
Hey.

716
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,834
No.

717
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,269
No.

718
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,307
Oh, my God.
What the crap?

719
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:26,975
What the crap?

720
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,633
Thank you.

721
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,031
Hey.

722
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:57,332
Yeah, what do you need?

723
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,701
I'd like to
report a crime.

724
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:00,902
What kind of crime?

725
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,038
Murder.

726
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,906
I killed a man,
but by accident.

727
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,843
Why don't you
have a seat?

728
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,149
You unlawfully
entered the alleged
victim's house?

729
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:16,384
Yes. His girlfriend
let me in.

730
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,620
His ex-girlfriend.
They broke up.

731
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,722
I think he was hitting her.

732
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:23,725
So, why did she let you in?

733
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:26,595
Because I looked
just like him.

734
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:29,064
But you don't
look like him now.

735
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:30,932
No, not at all.
He is black.

736
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:37,339
And you said that you
killed him with a...

737
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,942
Stiletto heel.

738
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,510
Yes, that's right.

739
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:46,181
Six-inch platform,
molded plastic, but with
metal tube reinforcement.

740
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:48,149
Not great quality,
but it did the trick,

741
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,918
unfortunately.

742
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,586
Right.

743
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:52,821
Right.

744
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,696
The body is just
right in the living room.

745
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,305
You might wanna
stay out here. It's...

746
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:12,374
It's pretty ugly
in there.

747
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,611
What the hell?

748
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,282
The body was right here.

749
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,786
There was blood everywhere.

750
01:05:24,788 --> 01:05:26,621
He was dead. I swear.

751
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,391
Where are my shoes?

752
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:32,294
There was a blue bag here
with my shoes in it

753
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:34,262
and $50,000 cash

754
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,064
and a gun

755
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,400
and my Taser.

756
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:40,869
Where's my Taser?
It's all gone.

757
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:44,739
In fact, there was
a whole cache of guns.

758
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,942
What the hell?

759
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:48,543
Something
screwy's going on.

760
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:51,046
We need to get some
leads or something.

761
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,180
Yeah.

762
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,216
Yeah.

763
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:57,919
I'm telling you,
he was dead. I...

764
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:59,254
I killed him.

765
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,291
Guys, I mean, should
we question the super?

766
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,592
Maybe he knows.

767
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:06,294
Sir, let go
of the door.

768
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,495
Like...

769
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,767
I'm telling you the truth!

770
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,886
You gotta be kidding me.

771
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:44,165
What the crap is going on?

772
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,114
Gotta stop this.

773
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,590
Max.
Hey, Jimmy.

774
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:10,225
You leaving?
You just got here.

775
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,560
Yeah. I gotta go
take care of somethin'.

776
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:14,529
It's peak hours.
What's so important?

777
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,032
Don't worry about it.

778
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:19,134
What are you doing?
I'm worried, okay.
What's going on?

779
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:21,302
One second. What?

780
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:23,905
You've been running
around half-cocked since
your mother passed away.

781
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:25,373
Will you just be
straight with me?

782
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:29,611
All right, look,
I took some money that
doesn't belong to me,

783
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:31,379
and I gotta go give it
back. All right?

784
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:35,650
No.

785
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,752
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa!

786
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:40,255
Damn it, Jimmy.
Why did you do that?

787
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:43,158
'Cause I'm trying
to stop you from
screwing up your life.

788
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,728
Your shop's closed
half the time.
You're acting all crazy.

789
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,564
I'm not blind, Max.
I know where this is going.
I've seen it before.

790
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,267
You have not seen
this before. Trust me.

791
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:54,836
Oh, yes, I have.
You know with who?
Your father.

792
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,273
My father?
Yeah.

793
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:00,742
He was acting
just like you are
before he took off.

794
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,411
What are you saying?

795
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,880
Listen, your old man,

796
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:09,584
he got into some trouble
with some bad people
and he had to disappear.

797
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:12,353
He had to make them think
that he was dead and
never coming back,

798
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:14,456
or else they were
gonna hurt you,
hurt your mother.

799
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,330
You knew this
all this time
and you didn't tell me.

800
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,065
How come you
didn't tell me?

801
01:08:24,067 --> 01:08:25,733
He made me promise not to.

802
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,368
He what?

803
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:30,738
He said that I was the
only one he could trust.

804
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,210
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

805
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,012
New rules, Jimmy!

806
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,682
You stay out
of my business.
You hear me?

807
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:44,619
Max, I just don't want you
to make the same mistakes
your old man did.

808
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,753
Maxie!

809
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,989
Max!

810
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:54,028
Mrs. Greenawalt,
I got someone out here
who wants to see you.

811
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:55,930
Who is it?

812
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:57,599
You got to see
for yourself.

813
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,641
Hello, Greenawalt.

814
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:08,643
Hello.

815
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:11,880
Ludlow sent me
to give you this.

816
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,716
And, um, what is it?

817
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,684
Your money.

818
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:18,353
He can't take out the trash.

819
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,054
He can't?

820
01:09:20,056 --> 01:09:21,723
No, he can't.

821
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,491
He's sorry.

822
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:27,629
Okay.

823
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,867
And your name is?

824
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:36,571
I'm Marsha.

825
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:41,109
And where is Leon,
Marsha?

826
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:42,443
I don't know.

827
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:44,846
I don't believe you.

828
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:48,616
You see, um,
Leon left me,
well, and you

829
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:50,585
in a very difficult
situation here.

830
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:53,288
If we don't get this
little matter cleaned up,

831
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,657
I stand to lose an
enormous amount of money

832
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,559
and I don't like
losing money.

833
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:59,627
You don't have enough?

834
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,496
No. I don't.

835
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:03,798
Thank you for bringing
back my money.

836
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,134
Brian will give your
receipt now. Brian.

837
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:12,373
You hungry?

838
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,775
No.

839
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,910
You mind if we
stop to get some food?

840
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:18,913
Yeah, I mind, Brian.
We're kind of busy right now.

841
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,816
I'm starving, Jeffrey.

842
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:25,053
Well,
you should've thought
of that before we left.

843
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:27,055
I wasn't hungry then.

844
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:29,791
We'll get something
to eat after we get
rid of our friend.

845
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:32,660
We need to talk about
Grand Street anyway.

846
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,829
We torching the place?

847
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,664
Yeah, tomorrow night.

848
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,167
You smell something?

849
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,769
I thought that was you.

850
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:43,238
No, it's not me, Jeffrey.

851
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,240
Maybe princess
pissed herself.

852
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,464
Hey, mister, you okay?

853
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,333
Huh?

854
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:23,311
Don't eat me!
Please don't eat me!

855
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:25,146
All right. All right.

856
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,949
I'm not! I'm not
gonna eat you!

857
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:30,585
Kid!

858
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,587
Ah!

859
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:35,456
Kid, wake up!
I'm not gonna eat you!

860
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,158
Kid!

861
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,793
Kid!

862
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:57,779
Hey, there he is.

863
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,247
You finished?

864
01:11:59,249 --> 01:12:01,149
Yep, just in time.

865
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:05,253
Are you feeling better?

866
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:06,721
Yeah.

867
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,358
I'm sorry about
the way I acted.

868
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,593
Oh, don't worry
about it, Max.

869
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,429
I should have told you
about your father sooner.

870
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:15,963
I'm sorry.

871
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:18,132
You're a good friend,
Jimmy.

872
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,468
To him and to me.

873
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,940
How about a pickle?

874
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:27,475
Yeah, thanks.

875
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,646
Why don't you let me
give you shave?

876
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,717
I think I'll stick
with the pickle.

877
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,200
Oh, crap.

878
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:54,969
<i> Mr. Solomon is a</i>
<i> wonderful old man who</i>
<i> lives on Grand Street</i>

879
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:57,205
<i> and they're trying to evict</i>
<i> him from his apartment.</i>

880
01:12:57,207 --> 01:13:00,908
<i> I will need the</i>
<i> trash taken out before Friday.</i>

881
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,343
<i> We torching the place?</i>

882
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:04,712
<i> Yeah, tomorrow night.</i>

883
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:07,281
<i> I stay here until I die.</i>

884
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,356
Max?

885
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:18,059
Hey, I think I'm ready
to get involved.

886
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,262
And how did you
hear all of this?

887
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:23,131
I heard it. I...

888
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:24,966
Look, I have a
special ability

889
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:28,202
to see and hear
stuff I shouldn't.

890
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:29,937
Max, I really need to
get back to the office.

891
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:32,907
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm not crazy.
You gotta believe me.

892
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,909
Max, I'm gonna ask
you this one time

893
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,744
and I want you to
tell me the truth.

894
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,247
Are you making
this all up just
to get with me?

895
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,849
What? No. I swear.

896
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,484
I do think you
are very pretty,

897
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:45,286
but I'm telling
you the truth.

898
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:46,754
Okay, so who are
these people?

899
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,356
Do you know any names?

900
01:13:48,358 --> 01:13:50,091
The woman's name
is Greenawalt.

901
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,726
Elaine Greenawalt?

902
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:53,961
Yeah, that's it.
You know her?
Yeah.

903
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:56,497
Her company owns
Mr. Solomon's building.

904
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:59,200
She's got a pretty
nice place upstate too.

905
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:01,903
You went
to her house?

906
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,073
This is the building.

907
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:08,242
Once he's gone,
they can sell
the whole block.

908
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:09,377
It's worth a fortune.

909
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:11,546
Wow. You really
think you can stop them?

910
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:13,948
Of course, I do.
I told you, Max,
I'm a badass.

911
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,383
Oh yeah,
that's right.

912
01:14:15,385 --> 01:14:16,918
Come on,
he lives on
the third floor.

913
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,219
He's the last one left.

914
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,024
See? Everyone's gone.

915
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,600
Hello, Carmen.

916
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:34,635
Hi, Mr. Solomon.
This is my friend, Max.

917
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,838
And we need to talk
to you about something.

918
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,172
Oh, come.

919
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,442
How are you?

920
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,079
And these men,
they said they
want to kill me?

921
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:48,082
They said
they would burn
your building down

922
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,383
with you in it.
So, yeah.

923
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:52,753
You believe him?

924
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,992
Yeah, I do.

925
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,699
Thank you very much
for telling me this,

926
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:06,734
but I can't leave.

927
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:08,636
Are you kidding me?

928
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:11,472
These are bad people,
Mr. Solomon.

929
01:15:11,474 --> 01:15:12,807
They are not
messing around.

930
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:17,578
Max, my wife
and I lived in this
apartment 45 years.

931
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,181
I raised my daughter
here, Sonia.

932
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,317
I cannot run away.

933
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,459
Mr. Solomon, where does
your daughter live now?

934
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,027
Chicago.

935
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,830
Can I ask you a
personal question?

936
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,298
Hmm.

937
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,368
What size are your shoes?

938
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:49,110
Mr. Solomon.
I am Elaine Greenawalt.

939
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:50,711
It's nice to
finally meet you.

940
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,381
I want to make a deal.

941
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:54,815
I'm ready to leave.

942
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:58,319
How much?

943
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,923
$100,000 cash

944
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:04,191
and a bus ticket
to Chicago.

945
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,062
How soon can you be ready?

946
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,530
Tomorrow.

947
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:11,766
Okay.

948
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:15,803
Brian here will escort
you to Chicago.

949
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,440
No. I don't need escort.

950
01:16:19,442 --> 01:16:21,742
I wanna see that
you get there safely.

951
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,778
Do we have a deal,
Mr. Solomon?

952
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,113
A deal.
Good.

953
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:57,311
Ah.

954
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,381
Come in, but
take off shoes.

955
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,150
You're wearing yours.

956
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,286
It's my house.

957
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,021
Oh, come on,
quit stalling,
old man.

958
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:08,489
Then you don't
come inside.

959
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,691
Take off.

960
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:13,294
Just do it.
Let's get this
over with.

961
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,841
It's all there, pal.

962
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:28,576
Hundred grand.

963
01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:30,044
This is all
you're bringing?

964
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:31,946
What about the rest
of this crap?

965
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:33,781
I leave it
all behind.

966
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:35,383
Start new life.

967
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:42,189
Where the hell
are our shoes?

968
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,458
Oh, bad crime.

969
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,960
That's why
I'm leaving.

970
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,828
You think you're
funny, asshole?

971
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,330
Forget the shoes, Brian.

972
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,766
What do you mean
"Forget the shoes"?
It's freezing out, Jeffrey.

973
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:53,267
We'll pick up some new ones.

974
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:55,770
Mrs. Greenawalt.

975
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:57,638
<i> Yeah, is he gone?</i>

976
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,607
They're on the bus.
<i> Good.</i>

977
01:17:59,609 --> 01:18:02,410
Now get over to Solomon's.
I want you to sweep
the entire building

978
01:18:02,412 --> 01:18:04,245
and wait outside until
morning. Clear?

979
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,579
<i> Yes, ma'am.</i>

980
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,396
What the...

981
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,699
Ludlow?

982
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:29,136
I don't believe this asshole.

983
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,783
Brian?

984
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:18,919
What the hell are
you doing here?

985
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,321
Behind you!

986
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,428
I love this thing.

987
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:33,834
<i> Hello.</i>
Any problems?

988
01:19:33,836 --> 01:19:36,303
<i> No.</i>
Good, I'm 10 minutes away.

989
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:38,572
<i> I'm meeting Mr. Tan</i>
<i> in front of the building.</i>

990
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:40,007
Okay.

991
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:42,343
I'm parked right out front.

992
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:43,811
I'll wait here.

993
01:19:43,813 --> 01:19:45,579
Good idea.

994
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:46,814
Idiot.

995
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,616
Thanks for the
phone, handsome.

996
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,472
Where the hell
is this idiot?

997
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,277
Call Jeffrey.

998
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,548
What are you doing?
That's private property.

999
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,749
I'm visiting a friend.

1000
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:23,350
Who?
Leonard Solomon.

1001
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:25,319
He doesn't live here
anymore. He moved.

1002
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,888
Really? Somebody
should tell him that.

1003
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,759
Oh, and by the way.

1004
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:42,536
Oh, no.

1005
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,219
Sir, can you step
over here, please?

1006
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:01,288
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. I didn't do...

1007
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,523
Hey, Solomon!

1008
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:05,526
Solomon, stop! Solomon!

1009
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:14,368
No.

1010
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:16,203
Hello.

1011
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,606
You are on the bus
to Chicago,
I just talked to Brian.

1012
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,541
He lied.

1013
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:24,044
That's impossible.

1014
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,479
No, not really.

1015
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:29,283
I just gave him
some of the money
that you gave to me.

1016
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:32,353
What kind of game
are you trying to play
here, Mr. Solomon?

1017
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:33,487
You and I had a deal.

1018
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,422
No game.

1019
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:37,858
This is my home.

1020
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,526
I'm not leaving.

1021
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,465
Okay.

1022
01:21:44,467 --> 01:21:47,268
Let me tell you how
this is gonna work.

1023
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,904
If you don't get up
and walk out of here
right now,

1024
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:54,008
I am going to burn
this whole place to the
ground with you in it.

1025
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,644
And then I'm gonna
send someone to Chicago

1026
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:58,045
to find your daughter,

1027
01:21:58,047 --> 01:22:01,282
and throw her off
the Sears Tower tonight.

1028
01:22:01,284 --> 01:22:02,650
Is that clear?

1029
01:22:02,652 --> 01:22:04,285
Yes.

1030
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:06,720
That's very clear.

1031
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:09,556
And that is good
for the television.

1032
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:11,458
For the television?
Mmm-hmm.

1033
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,328
What are you talking about,
you senile old man?

1034
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,563
New York One.

1035
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,434
Hello, Mrs. Greenawalt.

1036
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,269
Danny Donald
for New York One.

1037
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,504
You're who?

1038
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:25,372
Yeah, that's Danny Donald.

1039
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:28,742
Care to tell me
what you're doing here?

1040
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:30,110
What am I doing here?

1041
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,946
I just heard you
threaten to kill
Mr. Solomon

1042
01:22:31,948 --> 01:22:33,847
and then threaten
to kill his daughter
in Chicago.

1043
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:35,282
I'm not in Chicago!

1044
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:36,684
I did not say that!

1045
01:22:36,686 --> 01:22:39,253
No? Oh, because we
have it all on tape.

1046
01:22:39,255 --> 01:22:41,221
I could play it back
for you right now.

1047
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:43,757
You know what,
I did not give consent

1048
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:46,026
to being filmed for
television right now.

1049
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:48,462
You set this up
and I will make you pay.

1050
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:51,598
Maybe they've got
duck ragu in prison.

1051
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,135
You son of a bitch!

1052
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:00,674
Get away!

1053
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,715
Hi.

1054
01:23:07,717 --> 01:23:09,583
I came to get
Emiliano's shoes.

1055
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,785
Oh, yeah.

1056
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:23,163
New soles.
Perfect.

1057
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:25,299
He's gonna be happy.
He wanted to wear
them tonight.

1058
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:27,534
Oh yeah? Going out
on a big date?

1059
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:29,003
No. It's boys' night.

1060
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,940
Huh. No charge.

1061
01:23:32,942 --> 01:23:35,943
Really? That's really
sweet. Thank you.

1062
01:23:35,945 --> 01:23:37,277
Thank you.

1063
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:47,554
Hi, Max.

1064
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:48,889
Hi, Carmen.

1065
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:51,291
My favorite boots.

1066
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,527
I busted the zipper
and I thought
they were goners

1067
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:57,531
and then I remembered that
I know a badass cobbler.

1068
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:00,234
Ah, well, these
are good shoes.

1069
01:24:00,236 --> 01:24:02,669
I could do something
with these.

1070
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:04,538
Yeah, work your magic.

1071
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:12,246
So, I talked to
Mr. Solomon this morning.

1072
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:13,981
Oh, yeah?
How's he doing?

1073
01:24:13,983 --> 01:24:15,883
He said he's having
a wonderful time

1074
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:18,786
and that when
he comes home, he wants
to thank you in person.

1075
01:24:18,788 --> 01:24:20,220
Oh, okay.

1076
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:25,626
How did you pull it off, Max?

1077
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,662
Pull what off?

1078
01:24:28,664 --> 01:24:31,465
Solomon, Greenawalt,
all of it.

1079
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:35,803
Here's your ticket.

1080
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,909
Thanks.
Don't lose it.

1081
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:47,548
So, do you have plans
next Friday night?

1082
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:50,017
No. Why?
You having
another rally?

1083
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:51,852
No.

1084
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:53,687
I would like to have
dinner with you.

1085
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:55,889
Would you like to have
dinner with me, Max?

1086
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,226
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

1087
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,196
Got a pen?

1088
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,133
Here's my number.

1089
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:09,436
Don't lose it.

1090
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,538
I won't.

1091
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,273
Good.

1092
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:16,043
Bye, Max.

1093
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,378
Bye, Carmen.

1094
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:27,821
Shit!
Whoa, whoa. Hold it.

1095
01:25:27,823 --> 01:25:28,989
I'm not here to hurt you.

1096
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:30,691
Bullshit.
Leave me alone.

1097
01:25:30,693 --> 01:25:33,293
I'm not staying.
I just want to
give you these.

1098
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:35,729
Take a look.

1099
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,600
You're giving me
your watches?

1100
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:42,503
Sell them,
they're worth a lot.

1101
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,405
Why are you doing this?

1102
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:47,107
I'm sorry for what I did.

1103
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:49,810
You deserve better,
much better.

1104
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,854
Hey, man,
you got a light?
No.

1105
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:03,023
I do. Let's go.

1106
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,904
Hello, Leon.
Remember me?

1107
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:18,672
Ratprick?

1108
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:21,642
My name is Patrick,
you piece of shit. Patrick.

1109
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:23,944
Time for some payback.
Okay, hold up.

1110
01:26:23,946 --> 01:26:25,212
Just let me take my shoe off.

1111
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:28,048
Don't worry about your shoes.
You're not gonna need them.

1112
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,449
But I let you go.

1113
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:30,851
Well, we all make mistakes.

1114
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:33,487
You look like crap,
by the way. Let's go.

1115
01:26:33,489 --> 01:26:34,855
You smell like
crap, too.

1116
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:37,124
You been rolling around
the garbage, Leon, hmm?

1117
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:38,959
Well, you should've
stayed...
Hey, look out!

1118
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,206
Where am I?

1119
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:54,208
You're in my shop.

1120
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:56,743
How did I get here?

1121
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,080
Here, drink.

1122
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:03,750
You took quite a knock.

1123
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:09,990
What happened, Jimmy?

1124
01:27:09,992 --> 01:27:11,491
You were in a car accident.

1125
01:27:11,493 --> 01:27:13,594
I found you,
pulled you out.

1126
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:16,496
Have a pickle.

1127
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:18,599
No, I'm good.

1128
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:20,834
Just take one.

1129
01:27:20,836 --> 01:27:22,236
I don't want a pickle.

1130
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:24,571
I don't care if you
want one, you need it.

1131
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:25,906
Just take one.

1132
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:27,407
What're you talking
about, I need it?

1133
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:32,179
Pickles preserve you
when you change, Max,

1134
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:33,614
they give you strength.

1135
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:36,550
Otherwise you get all
screwed up jumping
from body to body.

1136
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,285
You know?

1137
01:27:38,287 --> 01:27:39,753
Of course I know.

1138
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:42,556
Who do you think
got rid of that putz,
Ludlow?

1139
01:27:42,558 --> 01:27:44,758
That stiletto heel
made quite a mess, kid.

1140
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,493
That was you. How?

1141
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:54,768
You see the thing is,
I'm not just a barber, Max.

1142
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:57,504
I'm also a cobbler.

1143
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,173
And...

1144
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,510
I'm your father.

1145
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,345
Pop?

1146
01:28:05,347 --> 01:28:07,080
That's right, Max.

1147
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:13,253
But you're...
No, I'm right here.

1148
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,429
Oh!

1149
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:32,039
You were right next door
to me the whole time
and you didn't tell me?

1150
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:33,473
I wanted to tell you.

1151
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:37,110
Yeah, you should have.
I was all alone. And Ma?

1152
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:38,245
Ma never knew.

1153
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:39,546
She thought you were
dead or something.

1154
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:40,847
I felt like I was dead.

1155
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:42,716
All that time on the
outside, looking in.

1156
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:43,950
Because you left us!

1157
01:28:43,952 --> 01:28:45,319
No, because I didn't
have a choice, Max.

1158
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:47,621
You had a choice.
Will you try to understand?

1159
01:28:47,623 --> 01:28:50,891
No! I don't understand.
I don't understand!

1160
01:28:50,893 --> 01:28:52,726
I don't understand
any of this!

1161
01:28:52,728 --> 01:28:54,761
Maxie, I wanted to
tell you so many times,

1162
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:56,730
but it was too dangerous.

1163
01:28:56,732 --> 01:29:00,534
If it was so dangerous, why
are you telling me now, huh?

1164
01:29:00,536 --> 01:29:02,402
Because it's time.

1165
01:29:02,404 --> 01:29:04,438
It's time you knew the truth.

1166
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,972
You're ready.

1167
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,108
I'm ready?

1168
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:09,176
That's right, son.

1169
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:10,677
For what?

1170
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,779
What are you
talking about?

1171
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:16,116
Come to the
basement, Max.

1172
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:19,252
You need to see something.

1173
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:20,954
See what?

1174
01:29:22,725 --> 01:29:24,257
Your birthright.

1175
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,710
You gotta be kidding me.

1176
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:47,414
As my father's
shoes worked for me,
mine will work for you.

1177
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:50,450
Who are all these people?

1178
01:29:50,452 --> 01:29:52,319
Customers.

1179
01:29:52,321 --> 01:29:53,887
They help us to help others.

1180
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:56,289
They're all labeled.

1181
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,657
Derek Jeter?

1182
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,193
That one was for me.

1183
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,797
Pop, you made
all these shoes?

1184
01:30:03,799 --> 01:30:09,836
These shoes go all the
way back to your great
grandfather, Pinchas.

1185
01:30:09,838 --> 01:30:13,206
He passed them on to
my father, Herschel,

1186
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,609
just as I am passing
it onto you.

1187
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:20,046
It's a privilege to walk
in another man's shoes, Max,

1188
01:30:20,048 --> 01:30:23,817
but it's also
a responsibility.

1189
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:26,286
I think you've learned
that by now.

1190
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:31,358
You're a guardian
of souls, Max.

1191
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:35,529
You are the cobbler.

1192
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:37,964
This is your thing.

1193
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:43,303
I missed you, Max.
I really missed you.

1194
01:30:43,305 --> 01:30:44,371
Pop...

1195
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,541
I'm so...

1196
01:30:47,543 --> 01:30:50,343
Listen to me, I'm sorry.

1197
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:52,612
I'm sorry about Ma.

1198
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:55,315
I didn't mean to.

1199
01:30:55,317 --> 01:30:57,784
Oh.
I didn't know.

1200
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:00,420
I'm the one who left.
I made the mistakes.

1201
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,023
And you...

1202
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,426
You did right by her.

1203
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,129
By me...

1204
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,398
You did right.

1205
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:21,608
It's been a long day.

1206
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:24,044
What do you say
we close up shop
and go home?

1207
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:26,947
Yeah, let's go home.

1208
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:32,719
Son, I can't go
out the front.

1209
01:31:32,721 --> 01:31:34,454
Not like this.
Let's go out the back.

1210
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,423
What back?

1211
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:40,560
This back.

1212
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:45,232
Wow! I don't believe it.

1213
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,869
Believe it.
Beats the subway.

1214
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:52,005
Pop, this is yours?
It's ours.

1215
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:54,574
Webb, this is
my son, Max.

1216
01:31:54,576 --> 01:31:56,910
Nice to meet
you, Max.
Hi, Webb.

1217
01:31:56,912 --> 01:31:58,945
Webb, we are heading
home to Brooklyn.

1218
01:31:58,947 --> 01:32:00,113
Very good, sir.

1219
01:32:00,115 --> 01:32:02,816
Did Jimmy
have this place?

1220
01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:06,353
No, no, no, no.
I put this in after
I bought Jimmy out.

1221
01:32:06,355 --> 01:32:08,321
Where is he?
The Caribbean.

1222
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:10,824
He sends his regards.

1223
01:32:10,826 --> 01:32:14,227
You know, barbers
have always been very
trusted friends to us.

1224
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:16,196
We never have to
worry about 'em.

1225
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:18,164
Who do we have
to worry about?

1226
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,699
Dry cleaners.

1227
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,568
Dry cleaners?
Really?

1228
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:24,738
They're not nice fellas
and they're very powerful.

1229
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,306
Wow.

1230
01:32:26,308 --> 01:32:28,008
Uh...

1231
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:33,246
So, Pop, you mean
we're not the only ones?

1232
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:36,550
No, no, no.
There's plenty of
tradesmen like us out there.

1233
01:32:36,552 --> 01:32:38,752
Some good, some bad,

1234
01:32:38,754 --> 01:32:40,787
and it's been that
way for centuries.

1235
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:44,324
Tomorrow, we'll sit down
with the stitcher.
I'll show you everything.

1236
01:32:44,326 --> 01:32:46,159
Oh, man,
that thing is great, Pop.

1237
01:32:46,161 --> 01:32:47,694
Where did we get it?

1238
01:32:47,696 --> 01:32:51,097
The stitcher?
Oh, that's a good
story, actually.

1239
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:53,233
A long time ago,

1240
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:55,068
on the coldest
of winter nights,

1241
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:58,471
a vagrant came knocking
at the door of our shop.

1242
01:32:58,473 --> 01:33:01,308
Your great-great grandfather
gave him shelter

1243
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,043
when no one else would.

1244
01:33:03,045 --> 01:33:06,212
He fed the man,
mended his shoes...

1245
01:33:06,214 --> 01:33:08,214
In the morning,
the vagrant...

1246
01:33:09,305 --> 01:34:09,876
