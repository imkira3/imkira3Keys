1
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:50,702
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:40,836
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:45,382
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:50,762
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:53,390
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:54,850
I only meant...

7
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,978
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,522
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,234
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:07,070
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:11,199
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:14,411
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:16,830
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,053
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,891
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:41,396
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:43,398
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

18
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:49,905
Harry.

19
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,324
Harry!

20
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,410
Are you all right?

21
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,246
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:01,750
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,168
Last night.

24
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:05,587
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:07,005
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,673
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,176
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:14,679
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:24,189
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:27,943
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:29,611
Keep up!

32
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,032
Arthur!

33
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,201
It's about time, son.

34
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:40,747
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:46,586
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:49,297
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:50,632
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,467
This way.

39
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:57,556
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:00,475
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,435
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:07,732
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:11,820
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:13,155
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:17,492
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:20,829
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:23,498
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,000
Time to go!

49
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,793
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,006
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,257
...three!

52
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,436
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:47,189
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:01,828
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,373
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,298
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:18,053
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:23,725
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:26,520
Look!

60
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:29,689
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:37,989
Blimey!

62
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:40,033
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,576
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:43,078
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:44,913
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,628
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:54,965
What?

68
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,266
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:05,767
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,436
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,439
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:14,109
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:16,570
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,948
I love magic.

75
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:38,675
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:42,137
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:43,722
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:43,972 --> 00:07:45,682
If it rains...

79
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:48,185
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:51,354
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:54,816
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:57,152
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,446
There's no need with these people.

84
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:04,409
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:06,661
While you can.

86
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,721
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:26,765
Come on!

88
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:30,977
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,979
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,530
<i>Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!</i>

91
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:48,995
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:56,419
Who's that?

93
00:08:57,212 --> 00:09:00,215
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:05,804
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

95
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,768
Krum!

96
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,687
Yes!

97
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:23,321
Good evening!

98
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,867
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:30,120
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:34,499
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:40,547
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:42,549
Let the match...

103
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:44,509
...begin!

104
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,809
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

105
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,319
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:04,112
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,324
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:10,410
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,953
He's an artist.

110
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,289
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,957
<i>Viktor, I love you</i>

112
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:17,751
<i>Viktor, I do</i>

113
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,129
<i>When we're apart
My heart beats only for you</i>

114
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,965
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:25,884
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,011
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:31,306
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,811
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:39,314
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,150
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:44,486
Go!

122
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,488
Harry!

123
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,463
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:06,842
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,016
<i>Morsmordre!</i>

126
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,252
Harry!

127
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:28,965
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,844
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,764
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:38,600
What is that?

131
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:43,772
<i>Stupefy!</i>

132
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,273
Stop!

133
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,651
That's my son!

134
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:51,363
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,823
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,200
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,327
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:59,538
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:01,206
What crime?

140
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:03,875
It's the Dark Mark, Harry.
It's his mark.

141
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,210
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:10,257
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,634
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:14,719
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,474
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:21,309
There!

147
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:23,812
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:25,981
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,732
Who?

150
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,943
I don't know.

151
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,780
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:53,133
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:57,262
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:02,934
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:05,312
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,272
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,817
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,988
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,658
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,665
Thank you.

161
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,502
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,671
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,591
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,802
This is horrible.

165
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,888
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,848
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,810
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:48,939
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:54,986
It's hurting again, isn't it?
Your scar.

170
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:56,822
I'm fine.

171
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,743
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,914
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,551
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,009
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,184
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:36,087
<i>Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.</i>

177
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:40,509
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:43,845
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,765
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,267
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,852
What is it?

182
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:56,525
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:02,656
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,866
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:07,494
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,831
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,124
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,753
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,713
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,800
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,885
And trust me when I say...

192
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:27,055
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:31,685
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:35,897
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:40,026
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,124
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,342
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:28,450
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:31,453
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,414
...and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,064
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:00,690
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:02,734
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,078
Albus.

205
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,955
Igor.

206
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:32,264
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,975
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:38,687
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:41,106
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:43,900
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:51,867
You idiot!

212
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:58,874
Your attention, please!

213
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,378
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,174
Eternal glory.

215
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:11,678
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:16,057
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:20,103
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,688
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

219
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:26,026
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:27,569
To explain all this...

221
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:31,364
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,658
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,801
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:20:51,593 --> 00:20:54,805
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

225
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:58,433
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:02,270
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:17,786
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

228
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:19,079
Thank you.

229
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,462
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:30,882
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,808
After due consideration...

232
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:42,853
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,981
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:49,901
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,779
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

236
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:55,532
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:59,452
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

238
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:21,266
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,728
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:27,814
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:31,067
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:34,404
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:38,366
If chosen, there's no turning back.

244
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:43,497
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:11,733
Alastor Moody.

246
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:15,278
Ex-Auror...

247
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:19,407
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:22,035
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:26,665
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,583
Any questions?

251
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:33,505
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,551
...I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:43,431
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:46,268
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

255
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:49,688
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

256
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:53,942
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:56,903
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,532
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:02,868
You need to be prepared.

260
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:05,495
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:07,956
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:11,126
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:13,587
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:19,468
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:20,844
- Weasley!
- Yes?

266
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:22,345
Stand.

267
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:27,309
Give us a curse.

268
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:31,313
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:33,148
The Imperius Curse.

270
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:36,568
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:24:37,027 --> 00:24:39,696
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,657
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,625
Hello.

274
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:54,961
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,091
<i>Engorgio.</i>

276
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,135
<i>Imperio!</i>

277
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,975
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:16,817
If she bites...

279
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,860
...she's lethal.

280
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:23,198
What are you laughing at?

281
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:25,951
Get off!

282
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,163
Talented, isn't she?

283
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,708
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,087
Drown herself?

285
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,144
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,314
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,733
...under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

288
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,819
But here's the rub:

289
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:04,156
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:08,201
Another, another.

291
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:10,745
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:12,455
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:14,624
Up.

294
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:20,464
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:24,092
There's the...

296
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:26,261
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:29,264
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:31,099
Particularly nasty.

299
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:35,979
The torture curse.

300
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,149
<i>Crucio!</i>

301
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,665
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:17,312
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:21,066
No?

304
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,402
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

305
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:29,699
The Killing Curse.

306
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:33,995
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:36,915
...and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,282
Brilliant, isn't he?

309
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:14,494
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:17,831
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:20,584
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,921
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

313
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,259
Neville?

314
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:30,886
Son?

315
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:32,888
You all right?

316
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:37,225
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,742
We're gonna be late!

318
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:09,674
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:29:25,273 --> 00:29:27,776
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:30,612
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,405
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:34,491
Yes!

323
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,620
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:41,832
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:29:41,998 --> 00:29:44,167
It's not going to work.

326
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:47,879
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

327
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:51,007
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:52,968
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:54,594
So?

330
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:59,808
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:02,978
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:07,399
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:11,153
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

334
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,155
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

335
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:18,493
- Yes!
- Yes!

336
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:20,829
Yeah!

337
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:23,623
Yes!

338
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,542
Ready?

339
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:31,006
- Yes!
- Yes!

340
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:41,516
- You said!
- You said!

341
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:45,896
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

342
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:48,565
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

343
00:30:48,732 --> 00:30:50,192
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

344
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,032
We're "old school," right?

345
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:59,576
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:33,610
Sit down. Please.

347
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,908
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:42,202
The champion selection.

349
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:17,445
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:35,797
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:37,966
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:51,521
The Hogwarts champion,
Cedric Diggory!

353
00:33:01,573 --> 00:33:05,994
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:10,332
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:13,835
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:17,172
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,549
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,998
Harry Potter.

359
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:55,710
Harry Potter?

360
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,300
No. No.

361
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:04,094
Harry Potter!

362
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:06,054
Go on, Harry.

363
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:07,973
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:34:39,463 --> 00:34:40,672
He's a cheat!

365
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,758
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,123
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

367
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,293
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- Quiet! I can't think!

368
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,462
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

369
00:35:20,629 --> 00:35:21,797
- Harry.
- I protest!

370
00:35:21,963 --> 00:35:23,840
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:26,176
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:27,677
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

373
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:30,764
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:33,433
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

375
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:35,977
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:39,314
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.

377
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:41,483
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,653
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,989
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:35:48,156 --> 00:35:51,243
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

381
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:55,330
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:35:56,665 --> 00:35:58,875
The rules are absolute.

383
00:36:00,085 --> 00:36:03,839
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,551
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:36:08,343 --> 00:36:10,637
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:14,516
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:44,588
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:36:44,921 --> 00:36:47,757
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:49,926
What do you suggest, Minerva?

390
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:53,180
Put an end to it.

391
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:55,640
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:58,268
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:36:58,435 --> 00:37:01,271
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:03,899
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:08,069
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:12,157
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:15,911
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:19,080
...let them unfold.

399
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:21,416
What...? Do nothing?

400
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,251
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:27,088
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:37:27,964 --> 00:37:30,717
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:34,095
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:36,848
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

405
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:40,227
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:43,438
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:46,358
Then again, we all are.

408
00:38:01,248 --> 00:38:03,041
How did you do it?

409
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:07,129
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

410
00:38:07,295 --> 00:38:09,214
Might've let
your best friend know, though.

411
00:38:09,381 --> 00:38:12,634
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

412
00:38:12,801 --> 00:38:15,178
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

413
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:17,264
Okay?

414
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,933
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

415
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,645
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

416
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:29,317
I didn't put my name in that cup.

417
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:33,572
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

418
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,784
Look, I don't know
what happened tonight...

419
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:39,828
...and I don't know why.

420
00:38:39,995 --> 00:38:41,204
It just did.

421
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,665
Okay?

422
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:54,217
Piss off.

423
00:39:09,232 --> 00:39:11,693
What a charismatic quartet.

424
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:14,654
Hello.

425
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,074
I'm Rita Skeeter.

426
00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:21,161
<i>I write for the Daily Prophet.</i>

427
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:26,458
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

428
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,835
You're the juicy news.

429
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:33,215
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

430
00:39:33,381 --> 00:39:36,885
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

431
00:39:37,052 --> 00:39:40,263
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

432
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,475
In short, what makes a champion tick?

433
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:48,271
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

434
00:39:48,438 --> 00:39:50,941
So who's feeling up to sharing?

435
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:56,863
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

436
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:10,919
This is cozy.

437
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:13,213
It's a broom cupboard.

438
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,882
You should feel right at home, then.

439
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:18,844
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

440
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,595
No.

441
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,931
So tell me, Harry.

442
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:26,017
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

443
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:27,686
I'm 14. Sorry.

444
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:30,814
- About to compete
against three students...

445
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:34,276
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

446
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:37,028
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

447
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:39,531
...in your dizziest daydreams.

448
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:42,075
Concerned?

449
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:46,079
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

450
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:48,123
Just ignore the quill.

451
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:51,126
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

452
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,879
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

453
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:56,798
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

454
00:40:56,965 --> 00:41:00,218
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

455
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:02,137
No, I didn't enter.

456
00:41:02,304 --> 00:41:03,930
Of course you didn't.

457
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:07,809
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

458
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:11,605
Scratch that last.

459
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:15,108
Speaking of your parents,
were they alive...

460
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,651
...how do you think they'd feel?

461
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:18,570
Proud? Or concerned...

462
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:22,574
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

463
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:25,327
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

464
00:41:26,328 --> 00:41:31,416
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

465
00:42:03,698 --> 00:42:06,034
<i>Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.</i>

466
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:09,496
<i>Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...</i>

467
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:11,873
<i>... and she's too easily recognized.</i>

468
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,918
<i>We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</i>

469
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:19,256
<i>Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.</i>

470
00:42:19,422 --> 00:42:21,216
<i>And make sure you're alone.</i>

471
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:22,884
<i>Sirius.</i>

472
00:42:23,051 --> 00:42:24,553
<i>P. S:</i>

473
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,513
<i>The bird bites.</i>

474
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,275
Sirius?

475
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,085
<i>Harry Potter, age 12...</i>

476
00:42:57,252 --> 00:43:00,213
<i>... suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.</i>

477
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,966
<i>His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...</i>

478
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:04,718
<i>... and choking back tears...</i>

479
00:43:20,192 --> 00:43:22,777
Sirius. How...?

480
00:43:22,944 --> 00:43:25,447
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

481
00:43:25,614 --> 00:43:28,575
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

482
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:30,202
No!

483
00:43:30,786 --> 00:43:32,078
I had to ask.

484
00:43:32,245 --> 00:43:37,042
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

485
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:39,628
But who was the third man in the room?

486
00:43:39,795 --> 00:43:42,297
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

487
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:44,674
No.

488
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:49,304
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

489
00:43:49,471 --> 00:43:50,764
And what was that?

490
00:43:52,974 --> 00:43:54,601
He wanted...

491
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,436
...me.

492
00:43:56,978 --> 00:44:01,316
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

493
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:04,694
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

494
00:44:05,153 --> 00:44:06,780
Yes.

495
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:08,490
It's just a dream.

496
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:10,659
Look, Harry.

497
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:14,329
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

498
00:44:14,496 --> 00:44:18,500
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

499
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:19,751
What are you saying?

500
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:24,172
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

501
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:28,718
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

502
00:44:29,177 --> 00:44:31,721
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

503
00:44:31,888 --> 00:44:34,266
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

504
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:41,231
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

505
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:43,692
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

506
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:47,863
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

507
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:51,450
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

508
00:44:55,036 --> 00:44:57,456
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

509
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,711
- Who were you talking to?
- What?

510
00:45:02,878 --> 00:45:05,297
- Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

511
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:09,593
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

512
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:13,472
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

513
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:41,041
Amazing.

514
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:46,713
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

515
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:48,673
Right, sorry.

516
00:45:49,549 --> 00:45:52,552
<i>"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?</i>

517
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,889
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

518
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,100
It's already been through enough people.

519
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:01,394
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

520
00:46:02,854 --> 00:46:05,190
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

521
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:07,442
What do you want me to say again?

522
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:08,944
Go.

523
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:15,992
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

524
00:46:16,618 --> 00:46:20,247
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

525
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:22,833
Is that right? Well, you...

526
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:24,084
What?

527
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:32,134
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

528
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:37,889
Dean was told by Parvati that...

529
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:41,351
Please don't ask me to say it again.

530
00:46:41,726 --> 00:46:43,186
Hagrid's looking for you.

531
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:46,773
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

532
00:46:57,325 --> 00:46:59,578
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

533
00:46:59,744 --> 00:47:02,330
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

534
00:47:02,497 --> 00:47:03,915
You'll see soon enough.

535
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:06,293
Now pay attention, this is important.

536
00:47:08,003 --> 00:47:09,421
What's with the flower?

537
00:47:10,505 --> 00:47:12,924
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

538
00:47:13,341 --> 00:47:15,051
As a matter of fact, I have.

539
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,430
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

540
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:28,398
Hagrid?

541
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,154
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

542
00:47:40,744 --> 00:47:44,164
<i>- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.</i>

543
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:48,043
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

544
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,879
...you had forgotten me.

545
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:53,006
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

546
00:47:53,673 --> 00:47:55,425
What is it you wanted to show me?

547
00:47:57,177 --> 00:48:00,388
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

548
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:02,224
...exhilarated.

549
00:48:02,808 --> 00:48:05,644
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

550
00:48:16,238 --> 00:48:17,989
Can we get closer?

551
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:27,249
Dragons?

552
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:28,917
That's the first task?

553
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:31,294
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

554
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:35,674
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

555
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:38,260
Oh, crikey!

556
00:48:38,802 --> 00:48:40,887
Although, I have to admit...

557
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:43,890
...that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.

558
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:46,810
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

559
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:50,438
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

560
00:48:50,605 --> 00:48:54,109
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

561
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:55,652
Didn't Ron tell you that?

562
00:48:57,654 --> 00:48:59,072
No, he didn't.

563
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:01,658
He didn't tell me a thing.

564
00:49:11,626 --> 00:49:14,713
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

565
00:49:16,214 --> 00:49:18,884
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

566
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,720
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

567
00:49:22,804 --> 00:49:24,473
Like the badge?

568
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:26,766
Excuse me.

569
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:32,397
Harry.

570
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:34,941
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

571
00:49:35,108 --> 00:49:36,610
Can I have a word?

572
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:39,446
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

573
00:49:39,613 --> 00:49:42,616
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

574
00:49:45,118 --> 00:49:47,662
Dragons. That's the first task.

575
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:50,999
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

576
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:53,168
Are you serious?

577
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,005
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

578
00:49:57,172 --> 00:49:59,424
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

579
00:49:59,591 --> 00:50:01,051
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

580
00:50:01,218 --> 00:50:03,720
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

581
00:50:03,887 --> 00:50:06,932
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

582
00:50:07,098 --> 00:50:09,518
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

583
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:11,686
It just happens a fair bit.

584
00:50:11,853 --> 00:50:14,940
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

585
00:50:15,106 --> 00:50:16,983
You're a right foul git, you know that?

586
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,361
- You think so?
- I know so.

587
00:50:19,528 --> 00:50:20,862
Anything else?

588
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:24,533
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

589
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,539
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

590
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,708
My father and I have a bet, you see.

591
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:37,045
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

592
00:50:39,631 --> 00:50:42,551
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

593
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:45,846
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

594
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:50,851
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

595
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:54,271
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

596
00:50:56,523 --> 00:50:59,401
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

597
00:50:59,568 --> 00:51:03,405
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

598
00:51:03,572 --> 00:51:05,323
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

599
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,410
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

600
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:13,582
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

601
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:21,131
Stand still! Stand still!

602
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,311
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

603
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:36,438
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

604
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:38,440
Professor!

605
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:42,194
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

606
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,071
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

607
00:51:45,238 --> 00:51:49,034
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

608
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:51,411
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

609
00:51:51,953 --> 00:51:56,416
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

610
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:58,960
Away!

611
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:04,299
You. Come with me.

612
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:41,586
That's a Foe-Glass.

613
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:44,422
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

614
00:52:44,881 --> 00:52:49,302
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

615
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:55,934
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

616
00:52:56,101 --> 00:52:58,145
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

617
00:52:58,395 --> 00:53:00,105
Now...

618
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:04,609
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

619
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,824
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

620
00:53:12,284 --> 00:53:13,785
Sit.

621
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:18,874
Listen to me, Potter.

622
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:21,042
Your pal Diggory?

623
00:53:21,209 --> 00:53:25,630
By your age, he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.

624
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,091
Miss Delacour?

625
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:31,219
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

626
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,307
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

627
00:53:35,474 --> 00:53:37,642
...but Karkaroff's is not.

628
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:39,644
They'll have a strategy.

629
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:43,273
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

630
00:53:48,111 --> 00:53:49,696
Come on, Potter.

631
00:53:49,863 --> 00:53:51,948
What are your strengths?

632
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:54,910
I don't know.

633
00:53:55,076 --> 00:53:57,871
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

634
00:53:58,038 --> 00:54:02,083
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

635
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,879
You're allowed a wand.

636
00:54:12,302 --> 00:54:13,762
Bets! Place your bets!

637
00:54:13,929 --> 00:54:16,097
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

638
00:54:16,264 --> 00:54:19,226
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

639
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:22,187
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

640
00:54:22,437 --> 00:54:23,939
Yes, sir?

641
00:54:24,272 --> 00:54:26,942
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

642
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:29,444
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

643
00:54:29,653 --> 00:54:32,280
<i>This is a great day for all of us.</i>

644
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,955
<i>Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.</i>

645
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:42,791
<i>Please keep your seats at all times.</i>

646
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,710
<i>This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.</i>

647
00:54:45,877 --> 00:54:49,297
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

648
00:54:49,464 --> 00:54:51,174
<i>I'm sure we all wish our champions...</i>

649
00:54:51,341 --> 00:54:54,427
<i>- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ... the greatest of luck.</i>

650
00:54:56,721 --> 00:55:00,142
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

651
00:55:00,308 --> 00:55:02,144
Battle a dragon.

652
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:08,900
Young love.

653
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:10,902
How...

654
00:55:13,363 --> 00:55:14,656
...stirring.

655
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:20,495
If everything goes unfortunately today...

656
00:55:20,662 --> 00:55:23,457
...you two may even
make the front page.

657
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:25,834
You have no business here.

658
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:28,003
This tent is for champions...

659
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:30,088
...and friends.

660
00:55:32,883 --> 00:55:37,053
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

661
00:55:40,182 --> 00:55:43,018
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

662
00:55:43,185 --> 00:55:47,355
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

663
00:55:47,522 --> 00:55:50,775
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

664
00:55:50,942 --> 00:55:53,069
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

665
00:55:54,362 --> 00:55:56,031
Sorry, I'll just go.

666
00:55:56,198 --> 00:55:57,741
Barty, the bag.

667
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,410
Champions, in a circle around me.

668
00:56:00,577 --> 00:56:03,705
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

669
00:56:03,872 --> 00:56:07,793
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

670
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:10,378
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

671
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:16,134
The Welsh Green.

672
00:56:20,764 --> 00:56:22,057
Mr. Krum.

673
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,978
The Chinese Fireball.

674
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:35,862
The Swedish Short-Snout.

675
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:38,323
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

676
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,742
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

677
00:56:44,162 --> 00:56:46,581
The Hungarian Horntail.

678
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,878
These represent four
very real dragons...

679
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:55,090
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

680
00:56:55,257 --> 00:56:57,759
Your objective is simple:

681
00:56:57,926 --> 00:56:59,427
Collect the egg.

682
00:56:59,594 --> 00:57:02,597
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

683
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:06,268
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

684
00:57:06,434 --> 00:57:07,769
Any questions?

685
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,439
Very well. Good luck, champions.

686
00:57:11,606 --> 00:57:14,401
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

687
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:26,913
<i>Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!</i>

688
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:41,845
<i>Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...</i>

689
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:45,515
<i>... and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.</i>

690
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:49,186
<i>And now our fourth
and final contestant.</i>

691
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:54,733
<i>Harry! Harry! Harry!</i>

692
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:04,761
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

693
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,305
<i>Accio Firebolt!</i>

694
00:59:36,293 --> 00:59:38,462
- Yeah!
- Yes!

695
00:59:47,387 --> 00:59:48,805
Oh, my God.

696
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,735
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

697
01:02:33,762 --> 01:02:35,931
Yes! Yes!

698
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:01,832
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.

699
01:03:01,998 --> 01:03:03,959
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

700
01:03:04,126 --> 01:03:05,877
- Never!
- Never!

701
01:03:07,963 --> 01:03:09,297
Shush!

702
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:12,467
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

703
01:03:13,468 --> 01:03:16,304
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

704
01:03:17,139 --> 01:03:19,641
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

705
01:03:30,819 --> 01:03:33,238
What the bloody hell was that?

706
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:40,120
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

707
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:44,332
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

708
01:03:47,502 --> 01:03:51,423
I reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

709
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,551
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

710
01:03:55,677 --> 01:03:57,804
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

711
01:03:57,971 --> 01:04:00,223
Everyone was saying it
behind your back.

712
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:05,687
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.

713
01:04:06,605 --> 01:04:09,983
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

714
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,651
No, no, no, I did.

715
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:14,863
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

716
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:19,075
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

717
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:23,205
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

718
01:04:24,206 --> 01:04:27,209
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

719
01:04:27,417 --> 01:04:29,419
...after you'd figured that out.

720
01:04:29,795 --> 01:04:32,464
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

721
01:04:33,131 --> 01:04:34,549
That's completely mental.

722
01:04:34,716 --> 01:04:37,761
Yeah. Isn't it?

723
01:04:37,928 --> 01:04:39,971
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

724
01:04:42,557 --> 01:04:44,267
Boys.

725
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,168
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

726
01:05:13,797 --> 01:05:16,424
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

727
01:05:20,345 --> 01:05:22,055
Shush.

728
01:05:22,764 --> 01:05:24,099
Look at this!

729
01:05:26,101 --> 01:05:28,603
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

730
01:05:29,646 --> 01:05:31,898
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

731
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:34,818
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

732
01:05:34,985 --> 01:05:37,279
Her latest prey, sources report...

733
01:05:37,446 --> 01:05:41,074
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

734
01:05:41,366 --> 01:05:45,287
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

735
01:05:46,663 --> 01:05:48,623
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

736
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:50,292
Thank you, Nigel.

737
01:05:55,088 --> 01:05:57,924
Not now, Nigel. Later.

738
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:01,303
Go on.

739
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:09,394
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

740
01:06:11,605 --> 01:06:13,356
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

741
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:23,325
Mum sent me a dress.

742
01:06:23,492 --> 01:06:27,329
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

743
01:06:27,788 --> 01:06:29,623
Nose down, Harry.

744
01:06:30,165 --> 01:06:34,044
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

745
01:06:35,837 --> 01:06:37,672
What are you on about?

746
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,800
They're not for Ginny.

747
01:06:39,966 --> 01:06:41,301
They're for you.

748
01:06:42,344 --> 01:06:46,097
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

749
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:49,518
The Yule Ball...

750
01:06:49,684 --> 01:06:55,023
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

751
01:06:55,732 --> 01:06:57,818
...since its inception.

752
01:06:58,485 --> 01:07:02,364
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

753
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:04,199
...gather in the Great Hall...

754
01:07:04,366 --> 01:07:08,411
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

755
01:07:09,955 --> 01:07:12,207
As representatives of the host school...

756
01:07:12,374 --> 01:07:17,420
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

757
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:20,423
And I mean this literally, because...

758
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:25,053
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

759
01:07:25,887 --> 01:07:27,389
...a dance.

760
01:07:31,643 --> 01:07:33,436
Silence!

761
01:07:33,645 --> 01:07:36,648
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

762
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:39,443
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

763
01:07:39,609 --> 01:07:43,697
I will not have you, in the course of a
single evening, besmirching that name...

764
01:07:43,864 --> 01:07:48,076
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

765
01:07:48,785 --> 01:07:50,745
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

766
01:07:50,912 --> 01:07:52,414
Now, to dance...

767
01:07:52,581 --> 01:07:56,293
...is to let the body breathe.

768
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,796
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

769
01:07:59,963 --> 01:08:02,340
...Ionging to burst forth
and take flight.

770
01:08:02,507 --> 01:08:06,511
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

771
01:08:06,678 --> 01:08:09,806
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

772
01:08:09,973 --> 01:08:12,225
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

773
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:14,811
Will you join me, please?

774
01:08:19,441 --> 01:08:22,944
Now, place your right hand
on my waist.

775
01:08:23,111 --> 01:08:25,697
- Where?
- My waist.

776
01:08:25,864 --> 01:08:28,408
And extend your arm.

777
01:08:28,867 --> 01:08:30,827
Mr. Filch, if you please.

778
01:08:33,914 --> 01:08:35,916
One, two, three.

779
01:08:36,082 --> 01:08:39,586
One, two, three. One, two, three.

780
01:08:43,298 --> 01:08:45,425
Never gonna let him forget this,
are you?

781
01:08:45,592 --> 01:08:46,760
- Never.
- Never.

782
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:50,806
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

783
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:15,831
Why do they have to travel in packs?

784
01:09:15,997 --> 01:09:18,625
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

785
01:09:26,508 --> 01:09:30,011
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

786
01:09:30,178 --> 01:09:32,430
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

787
01:09:38,645 --> 01:09:40,188
I take after my mum.

788
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:44,317
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

789
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,403
No, not the maternal sort, her.

790
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:50,157
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

791
01:09:50,323 --> 01:09:54,870
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

792
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:57,372
He laughed so hard at that.

793
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:01,293
Very funny.

794
01:10:07,215 --> 01:10:10,969
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

795
01:10:11,136 --> 01:10:14,181
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

796
01:10:14,598 --> 01:10:16,766
But enough of me. What about you?

797
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:39,122
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

798
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:44,127
Well, us and Neville.

799
01:10:44,294 --> 01:10:46,963
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

800
01:10:47,714 --> 01:10:51,051
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

801
01:10:53,512 --> 01:10:55,263
Now I'm really depressed.

802
01:11:01,102 --> 01:11:04,523
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

803
01:11:06,608 --> 01:11:08,610
Who you going with, then?

804
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:13,031
<i>- Oi, Angelina?
- What?</i>

805
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:18,495
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

806
01:11:18,829 --> 01:11:20,580
To the ball?

807
01:11:20,747 --> 01:11:22,165
Yeah, all right.

808
01:11:25,919 --> 01:11:27,462
Oi, Hermione.

809
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:29,297
You're a girl.

810
01:11:29,464 --> 01:11:30,799
Very well spotted.

811
01:11:30,966 --> 01:11:32,884
Come with one of us?

812
01:11:37,514 --> 01:11:40,433
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

813
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,102
For a girl, it's just sad.

814
01:11:42,269 --> 01:11:46,022
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

815
01:11:52,988 --> 01:11:54,990
And I said yes!

816
01:11:56,825 --> 01:11:58,410
Bloody hell.

817
01:11:58,577 --> 01:12:00,245
She's lying, right?

818
01:12:00,412 --> 01:12:01,621
If you say so.

819
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:05,667
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

820
01:12:05,834 --> 01:12:07,919
Tonight, when we get back
to the common room...

821
01:12:08,086 --> 01:12:09,796
...we'll both have partners. Agreed?

822
01:12:09,963 --> 01:12:11,465
Agreed.

823
01:12:35,822 --> 01:12:37,157
- Cho!
- Harry!

824
01:12:40,702 --> 01:12:43,455
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

825
01:12:43,622 --> 01:12:45,207
Okay, thanks.

826
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:50,712
Cho?

827
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:53,215
Yes?

828
01:12:54,591 --> 01:12:56,843
Well, I just wondered if you...

829
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:59,763
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

830
01:13:01,473 --> 01:13:03,725
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

831
01:13:04,643 --> 01:13:09,564
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

832
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,155
Harry...

833
01:13:17,322 --> 01:13:20,158
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

834
01:13:21,159 --> 01:13:22,577
And...

835
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:26,498
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

836
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:30,669
Okay. Yeah. Great.

837
01:13:32,045 --> 01:13:34,756
Fine. No problem.

838
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:36,675
Okay. Good.

839
01:13:38,135 --> 01:13:39,678
Harry?

840
01:13:40,303 --> 01:13:42,097
I really am...

841
01:13:42,264 --> 01:13:43,932
...sorry.

842
01:13:53,692 --> 01:13:55,193
It's all right, Ron.

843
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,572
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

844
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:00,615
What happened to you?

845
01:14:00,866 --> 01:14:03,034
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

846
01:14:03,201 --> 01:14:05,704
- What?
- What did she say?

847
01:14:05,871 --> 01:14:07,247
No, of course.

848
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:12,127
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

849
01:14:12,544 --> 01:14:16,965
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

850
01:14:17,716 --> 01:14:21,344
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

851
01:14:21,511 --> 01:14:24,931
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

852
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:29,769
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

853
01:14:29,936 --> 01:14:33,648
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

854
01:14:33,815 --> 01:14:35,066
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

855
01:14:35,233 --> 01:14:38,320
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

856
01:14:39,654 --> 01:14:42,199
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

857
01:14:42,783 --> 01:14:43,825
Hey!

858
01:15:00,926 --> 01:15:02,636
Bloody hell.

859
01:15:04,846 --> 01:15:06,640
Bloody hell.

860
01:15:10,143 --> 01:15:11,436
Bloody...

861
01:15:11,603 --> 01:15:12,813
Oh, bloody...

862
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:19,236
What are those? What are those?

863
01:15:19,402 --> 01:15:22,447
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

864
01:15:22,614 --> 01:15:25,534
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

865
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,702
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

866
01:15:27,869 --> 01:15:32,791
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

867
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:38,296
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

868
01:15:43,051 --> 01:15:44,886
Murder me, Harry.

869
01:15:46,263 --> 01:15:47,848
Leave it alone!

870
01:15:48,807 --> 01:15:52,227
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

871
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:54,896
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

872
01:15:55,063 --> 01:15:58,650
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

873
01:15:58,817 --> 01:16:01,027
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

874
01:16:01,194 --> 01:16:06,283
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

875
01:16:07,242 --> 01:16:08,660
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

876
01:16:08,827 --> 01:16:10,662
Don't you look...

877
01:16:11,246 --> 01:16:12,414
...dashing.

878
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:16,168
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

879
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:18,170
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

880
01:16:18,336 --> 01:16:21,381
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

881
01:16:21,548 --> 01:16:22,591
- Are the first to dance.

882
01:16:22,924 --> 01:16:25,510
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

883
01:16:26,136 --> 01:16:27,888
Well, now you know.

884
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:33,685
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

885
01:16:33,852 --> 01:16:36,188
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

886
01:16:36,396 --> 01:16:37,939
Come along this way.

887
01:16:42,778 --> 01:16:44,613
Oh, come on.

888
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:47,449
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

889
01:16:47,616 --> 01:16:50,994
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

890
01:16:53,205 --> 01:16:55,624
This way. This way. Come along.

891
01:16:57,292 --> 01:16:59,544
She looks beautiful!

892
01:16:59,711 --> 01:17:01,296
Yeah, she does.

893
01:17:48,677 --> 01:17:52,264
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

894
01:17:52,889 --> 01:17:55,475
No. Absolutely not.

895
01:18:00,188 --> 01:18:01,731
Hi!

896
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,451
Harry, take my waist.

897
01:18:13,368 --> 01:18:14,786
- What?
- Now!

898
01:19:21,394 --> 01:19:23,146
Are you ready?

899
01:19:23,772 --> 01:19:25,982
<i>Move your body like a hairy troll</i>

900
01:19:26,817 --> 01:19:29,277
<i>Learning to rock and roll</i>

901
01:19:29,694 --> 01:19:32,280
<i>Spin around like a crazy elf</i>

902
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:35,033
<i>Dancing by himself</i>

903
01:19:35,325 --> 01:19:38,662
<i>Boogie down like a unicorn</i>

904
01:19:38,829 --> 01:19:41,289
<i>No stopping till the break of dawn</i>

905
01:19:41,456 --> 01:19:44,292
<i>Put your hands up in the air</i>

906
01:19:44,459 --> 01:19:47,254
<i>Like an ogre who just don 't care</i>

907
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:50,632
<i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i>

908
01:19:52,968 --> 01:19:55,137
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

909
01:19:57,305 --> 01:20:00,725
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

910
01:20:02,644 --> 01:20:04,187
May I have your arm?

911
01:20:04,354 --> 01:20:07,065
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

912
01:20:33,008 --> 01:20:34,593
Hot, isn't it?

913
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,597
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

914
01:20:38,763 --> 01:20:42,434
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

915
01:20:44,144 --> 01:20:46,480
What's got your wand in a knot?

916
01:20:46,772 --> 01:20:50,442
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

917
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:54,196
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

918
01:20:54,905 --> 01:20:57,365
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

919
01:20:57,532 --> 01:21:01,036
...is international
magical cooperation...

920
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,121
...to make friends.

921
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:07,042
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

922
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:19,346
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

923
01:21:19,513 --> 01:21:20,931
No.

924
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:31,608
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

925
01:21:31,775 --> 01:21:35,987
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

926
01:21:36,154 --> 01:21:39,825
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

927
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:42,119
You know the solution then, don't you?

928
01:21:42,285 --> 01:21:44,287
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

929
01:21:44,454 --> 01:21:47,582
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

930
01:21:47,749 --> 01:21:49,793
And not as a last resort.

931
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:54,172
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

932
01:21:54,339 --> 01:21:55,674
Harry.

933
01:21:56,133 --> 01:21:57,425
Where have you been?

934
01:21:57,592 --> 01:22:00,095
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

935
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:06,935
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

936
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:08,979
What's this about?

937
01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:16,278
<i>No, don 't let</i>

938
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:22,409
<i>This magic die</i>

939
01:22:24,161 --> 01:22:26,955
<i>The answer's there</i>

940
01:23:25,263 --> 01:23:27,349
Let me see it again.

941
01:23:28,683 --> 01:23:31,561
Yes, the time is close now.

942
01:23:36,274 --> 01:23:38,110
<i>Harry, at last!</i>

943
01:23:39,444 --> 01:23:44,783
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

944
01:23:55,377 --> 01:23:56,795
You all right, Harry?

945
01:23:58,213 --> 01:24:00,006
I just got in.

946
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:01,842
Me.

947
01:24:13,103 --> 01:24:16,398
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

948
01:24:16,565 --> 01:24:20,735
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

949
01:24:22,279 --> 01:24:24,072
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

950
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:27,075
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

951
01:24:28,285 --> 01:24:32,914
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

952
01:24:36,626 --> 01:24:39,838
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

953
01:24:40,297 --> 01:24:42,549
Mostly, he watches me study.

954
01:24:43,341 --> 01:24:45,427
It's a bit annoying, actually.

955
01:24:46,803 --> 01:24:49,514
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

956
01:24:50,348 --> 01:24:51,808
What's that supposed to mean?

957
01:24:52,434 --> 01:24:55,437
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

958
01:24:55,604 --> 01:24:58,774
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

959
01:24:59,941 --> 01:25:01,568
And...

960
01:25:03,904 --> 01:25:05,781
...I'm scared for you.

961
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:09,326
You got by the dragons
mostly on nerve.

962
01:25:09,951 --> 01:25:12,454
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

963
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:14,289
Hey, Potter!

964
01:25:20,045 --> 01:25:21,546
- Potter!
- Cedric.

965
01:25:24,257 --> 01:25:25,926
How...? How are you?

966
01:25:26,968 --> 01:25:28,386
Spectacular.

967
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:33,767
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

968
01:25:33,934 --> 01:25:36,228
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

969
01:25:36,561 --> 01:25:38,146
Exactly.

970
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:41,733
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

971
01:25:45,654 --> 01:25:48,240
It's not a bad place for a bath.

972
01:25:50,617 --> 01:25:52,494
Just take your egg...

973
01:25:53,245 --> 01:25:55,997
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

974
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,368
I must be out of my mind.

975
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:45,714
I'm definitely out of my mind.

976
01:26:48,383 --> 01:26:51,678
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

977
01:26:51,845 --> 01:26:53,722
Myrtle!

978
01:26:53,889 --> 01:26:55,640
Hello, Harry.

979
01:26:56,433 --> 01:26:59,644
Long time no see.

980
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:07,569
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

981
01:27:07,736 --> 01:27:11,198
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

982
01:27:11,364 --> 01:27:13,700
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

983
01:27:13,867 --> 01:27:15,619
Polyjuice Potion?

984
01:27:16,411 --> 01:27:20,415
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

985
01:27:27,255 --> 01:27:28,924
That's what he did.

986
01:27:29,758 --> 01:27:31,426
The other boy...

987
01:27:32,844 --> 01:27:34,930
...the handsome one...

988
01:27:36,223 --> 01:27:37,557
...Cedric.

989
01:27:40,852 --> 01:27:43,522
Well, go on. Open it.

990
01:27:51,613 --> 01:27:56,618
<i>Come seek us
Where our voices sound</i>

991
01:27:56,785 --> 01:28:01,456
<i>We cannot sing
Above the ground</i>

992
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:05,961
<i>An hour long you'll have to look</i>

993
01:28:06,753 --> 01:28:11,424
<i>To recover what we took</i>

994
01:28:19,599 --> 01:28:21,101
Myrtle...

995
01:28:22,477 --> 01:28:25,939
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

996
01:28:26,815 --> 01:28:28,483
Very good.

997
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:33,738
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

998
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:37,993
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

999
01:28:55,677 --> 01:28:57,637
Harry, tell me again.

1000
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:02,184
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

1001
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:04,895
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

1002
01:29:05,854 --> 01:29:08,398
"An hour long you'll have to look."

1003
01:29:08,565 --> 01:29:12,027
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

1004
01:29:13,403 --> 01:29:15,280
"Potentially problematic"?

1005
01:29:15,447 --> 01:29:18,700
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1006
01:29:19,242 --> 01:29:23,580
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1007
01:29:23,747 --> 01:29:26,249
Hate to break up the skull session.

1008
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:28,418
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1009
01:29:28,668 --> 01:29:31,046
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1010
01:29:31,213 --> 01:29:33,882
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1011
01:29:34,049 --> 01:29:36,676
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1012
01:29:36,843 --> 01:29:38,720
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1013
01:29:38,887 --> 01:29:41,389
Go. Now!

1014
01:29:51,358 --> 01:29:53,151
Longbottom!

1015
01:29:53,318 --> 01:29:55,320
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1016
01:30:03,995 --> 01:30:06,206
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1017
01:30:06,373 --> 01:30:08,959
<i>...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.</i>

1018
01:30:09,584 --> 01:30:13,880
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1019
01:30:14,047 --> 01:30:17,801
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1020
01:30:18,426 --> 01:30:20,137
...about plants.

1021
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,180
Now, if there's...

1022
01:30:22,347 --> 01:30:27,144
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1023
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:29,813
...then great. But otherwise...

1024
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:33,775
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1025
01:30:35,026 --> 01:30:37,863
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1026
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:39,489
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1027
01:30:39,656 --> 01:30:41,116
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1028
01:30:41,283 --> 01:30:43,452
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1029
01:30:43,618 --> 01:30:45,120
Don't be so mean.

1030
01:30:45,745 --> 01:30:47,539
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1031
01:30:49,749 --> 01:30:51,751
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1032
01:30:51,918 --> 01:30:53,837
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1033
01:30:54,004 --> 01:30:55,505
Most likely?

1034
01:30:55,672 --> 01:30:57,883
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1035
01:30:58,049 --> 01:31:00,510
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1036
01:31:00,677 --> 01:31:03,346
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1037
01:31:03,513 --> 01:31:05,474
I just wanted to help.

1038
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:08,769
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1039
01:31:08,935 --> 01:31:10,687
Where are they anyway?

1040
01:31:10,854 --> 01:31:13,899
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1041
01:31:20,906 --> 01:31:23,158
<i>Welcome to the second task.</i>

1042
01:31:23,325 --> 01:31:26,995
<i>Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.</i>

1043
01:31:27,162 --> 01:31:28,538
<i>A treasure of sorts.</i>

1044
01:31:28,705 --> 01:31:31,333
<i>These four treasures,
one for each champion...</i>

1045
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,211
<i>... now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.</i>

1046
01:31:34,377 --> 01:31:35,962
<i>In order to win...</i>

1047
01:31:36,129 --> 01:31:39,966
<i>... each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.</i>

1048
01:31:40,133 --> 01:31:42,761
<i>- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.</i>

1049
01:31:42,928 --> 01:31:46,556
<i>They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.</i>

1050
01:31:46,723 --> 01:31:50,602
<i>After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.</i>

1051
01:31:51,144 --> 01:31:53,396
<i>You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.</i>

1052
01:32:19,923 --> 01:32:22,884
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1053
01:32:24,219 --> 01:32:27,139
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1054
01:32:29,057 --> 01:32:30,934
Yeah!

1055
01:32:32,102 --> 01:32:33,728
What?

1056
01:33:53,308 --> 01:33:55,477
<i>The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...</i>

1057
01:33:55,644 --> 01:33:58,146
<i>... has unfortunately
been forced to retire...</i>

1058
01:33:58,814 --> 01:34:01,900
<i>... so she will take no further part
in this task.</i>

1059
01:35:19,686 --> 01:35:21,480
But she's my friend too!

1060
01:35:23,106 --> 01:35:24,858
Only one!

1061
01:36:16,201 --> 01:36:18,078
Let's get down below.

1062
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:30,966
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

1063
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,192
Yes!

1064
01:37:48,293 --> 01:37:50,378
<i>Ascendio!</i>

1065
01:37:55,592 --> 01:37:57,302
Harry!

1066
01:37:59,596 --> 01:38:01,056
He's all right.

1067
01:38:02,265 --> 01:38:03,725
He's all right. Barty!

1068
01:38:03,892 --> 01:38:07,312
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1069
01:38:07,896 --> 01:38:11,358
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1070
01:38:12,067 --> 01:38:13,693
My little sister.

1071
01:38:14,152 --> 01:38:15,737
Thank you.

1072
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:19,241
And you! You helped.

1073
01:38:19,908 --> 01:38:22,911
Well, yeah, a bit.

1074
01:38:30,127 --> 01:38:31,294
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1075
01:38:31,461 --> 01:38:34,131
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1076
01:38:35,382 --> 01:38:37,300
Personally, I think
you behaved admirably.

1077
01:38:37,467 --> 01:38:39,511
I finished last, Hermione.

1078
01:38:40,345 --> 01:38:44,474
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1079
01:38:44,641 --> 01:38:47,894
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1080
01:38:48,061 --> 01:38:50,939
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1081
01:38:53,275 --> 01:38:55,902
Attention!

1082
01:38:56,361 --> 01:39:00,240
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1083
01:39:00,657 --> 01:39:04,161
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1084
01:39:04,327 --> 01:39:06,997
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1085
01:39:07,164 --> 01:39:12,127
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1086
01:39:12,294 --> 01:39:16,590
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1087
01:39:16,756 --> 01:39:18,758
...second place...

1088
01:39:18,925 --> 01:39:20,385
- Second place!
- Well done!

1089
01:39:20,552 --> 01:39:23,221
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1090
01:39:24,473 --> 01:39:26,016
Yes!

1091
01:39:29,519 --> 01:39:31,313
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1092
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,148
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1093
01:39:33,315 --> 01:39:35,650
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1094
01:39:35,817 --> 01:39:38,487
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1095
01:39:38,653 --> 01:39:40,322
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1096
01:39:40,489 --> 01:39:42,032
Well done, boy.

1097
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:45,452
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1098
01:39:45,619 --> 01:39:49,623
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1099
01:39:50,624 --> 01:39:54,085
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1100
01:39:54,252 --> 01:39:56,213
...to lose one's family.

1101
01:39:58,256 --> 01:40:00,425
Never whole again, are we?

1102
01:40:02,677 --> 01:40:04,721
Still, life goes on...

1103
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:07,099
...and here we stand.

1104
01:40:10,018 --> 01:40:12,687
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1105
01:40:12,854 --> 01:40:14,356
Bartemius!

1106
01:40:14,523 --> 01:40:18,652
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1107
01:40:18,819 --> 01:40:22,239
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

1108
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:36,378
And they say I'm mad.

1109
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:49,391
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1110
01:40:49,558 --> 01:40:52,561
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1111
01:40:53,103 --> 01:40:55,689
Suppose you remind me
of meself a little.

1112
01:40:55,856 --> 01:40:59,901
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1113
01:41:00,068 --> 01:41:03,405
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1114
01:41:03,572 --> 01:41:05,115
And Harry, of course.

1115
01:41:05,282 --> 01:41:10,662
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1116
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:12,914
Hooray!

1117
01:41:14,332 --> 01:41:16,835
<i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</i>

1118
01:41:17,002 --> 01:41:19,629
<i>Teach us something, please</i>

1119
01:41:29,598 --> 01:41:31,099
Mr. Crouch?

1120
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:41,777
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1121
01:41:41,943 --> 01:41:43,528
I will not.

1122
01:41:43,695 --> 01:41:47,783
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1123
01:41:47,949 --> 01:41:49,326
Then for once show them some!

1124
01:41:49,493 --> 01:41:53,538
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1125
01:41:53,705 --> 01:41:56,917
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1126
01:41:57,083 --> 01:41:59,878
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1127
01:42:00,045 --> 01:42:03,715
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1128
01:42:08,053 --> 01:42:09,638
Oh, Harry!

1129
01:42:09,805 --> 01:42:12,099
Harry, how good to see you again.

1130
01:42:12,933 --> 01:42:14,434
I can come back later, professor.

1131
01:42:14,601 --> 01:42:17,979
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1132
01:42:18,146 --> 01:42:20,690
Minister, after you.

1133
01:42:21,233 --> 01:42:23,235
There you are. Your hat.

1134
01:42:23,401 --> 01:42:27,072
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1135
01:42:27,239 --> 01:42:30,408
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1136
01:44:01,917 --> 01:44:03,502
Professor?

1137
01:44:03,668 --> 01:44:06,213
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1138
01:44:17,099 --> 01:44:20,894
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1139
01:44:21,061 --> 01:44:22,979
...to present evidence to this council.

1140
01:44:23,146 --> 01:44:25,857
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1141
01:44:26,024 --> 01:44:30,112
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1142
01:44:30,278 --> 01:44:34,866
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1143
01:44:35,033 --> 01:44:36,660
Do you accept these terms?

1144
01:44:37,285 --> 01:44:39,955
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1145
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:42,791
I have names, sir.

1146
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:46,962
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1147
01:44:49,631 --> 01:44:52,134
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1148
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:54,428
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1149
01:44:54,636 --> 01:44:57,264
- Lf that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1150
01:44:57,431 --> 01:45:00,725
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1151
01:45:00,892 --> 01:45:03,270
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1152
01:45:03,437 --> 01:45:04,604
Yeah, the same.

1153
01:45:04,771 --> 01:45:08,483
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1154
01:45:09,693 --> 01:45:12,988
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1155
01:45:13,155 --> 01:45:15,115
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1156
01:45:15,282 --> 01:45:19,995
No! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1157
01:45:20,162 --> 01:45:23,165
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1158
01:45:23,331 --> 01:45:27,294
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1159
01:45:27,461 --> 01:45:30,464
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1160
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:34,092
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1161
01:45:34,259 --> 01:45:36,511
Silence!

1162
01:45:37,137 --> 01:45:40,557
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1163
01:45:40,724 --> 01:45:42,851
...this session is now concluded.

1164
01:45:43,018 --> 01:45:45,061
Oh, no, no, no.

1165
01:45:46,021 --> 01:45:47,522
I've heard about one more.

1166
01:45:47,689 --> 01:45:50,233
- What's that?
- The name.

1167
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,860
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1168
01:45:52,027 --> 01:45:54,070
...this person took part
in the capture...

1169
01:45:54,237 --> 01:45:56,406
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1170
01:45:56,573 --> 01:46:00,076
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1171
01:46:00,243 --> 01:46:02,579
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1172
01:46:02,746 --> 01:46:05,290
Barty Crouch...

1173
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:09,044
...Junior.

1174
01:46:18,512 --> 01:46:20,222
Hold him down!

1175
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:27,479
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1176
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:30,774
Hello, Father.

1177
01:46:32,192 --> 01:46:34,236
You are no son of mine.

1178
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:50,043
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1179
01:46:51,419 --> 01:46:52,796
It's a Pensieve.

1180
01:46:52,963 --> 01:46:57,634
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1181
01:46:57,801 --> 01:47:01,346
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1182
01:47:01,805 --> 01:47:04,766
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1183
01:47:04,933 --> 01:47:06,518
...some small detail...

1184
01:47:07,936 --> 01:47:10,063
...something I might have overlooked...

1185
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:14,443
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1186
01:47:15,235 --> 01:47:19,114
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1187
01:47:20,157 --> 01:47:21,783
It's maddening.

1188
01:47:24,161 --> 01:47:25,871
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1189
01:47:26,621 --> 01:47:28,707
What exactly happened to him?

1190
01:47:28,874 --> 01:47:33,670
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1191
01:47:34,337 --> 01:47:37,966
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1192
01:47:39,426 --> 01:47:42,387
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1193
01:47:43,138 --> 01:47:45,265
I had a dream about him.

1194
01:47:47,517 --> 01:47:50,312
It was in the summer, before school.

1195
01:47:52,481 --> 01:47:55,484
<i>In the dream, I was in a house.</i>

1196
01:47:55,650 --> 01:48:00,447
<i>And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn 't quite human.</i>

1197
01:48:00,614 --> 01:48:04,242
<i>And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch 's son.</i>

1198
01:48:04,618 --> 01:48:07,454
<i>- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.</i>

1199
01:48:08,288 --> 01:48:09,915
Always the same one.

1200
01:48:12,959 --> 01:48:15,295
Sir, these dreams...

1201
01:48:15,462 --> 01:48:20,675
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1202
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,263
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1203
01:48:25,764 --> 01:48:27,724
I think it's best if you simply...

1204
01:48:33,355 --> 01:48:35,148
...cast them away.

1205
01:48:44,407 --> 01:48:48,370
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1206
01:48:57,087 --> 01:48:58,296
Potter!

1207
01:48:58,463 --> 01:49:01,007
What's your hurry?

1208
01:49:06,096 --> 01:49:09,891
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1209
01:49:10,058 --> 01:49:12,310
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1210
01:49:13,061 --> 01:49:14,604
Yes, sir.

1211
01:49:15,564 --> 01:49:16,940
Ingenious.

1212
01:49:18,775 --> 01:49:22,737
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1213
01:49:23,572 --> 01:49:27,075
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1214
01:49:28,743 --> 01:49:30,704
Nor is this.

1215
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:36,585
Know what it is?

1216
01:49:37,878 --> 01:49:39,296
Bubble juice, sir?

1217
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,757
Veritaserum.

1218
01:49:42,507 --> 01:49:46,219
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1219
01:49:46,386 --> 01:49:51,558
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1220
01:49:52,225 --> 01:49:55,270
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1221
01:49:55,437 --> 01:50:00,275
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1222
01:50:00,442 --> 01:50:04,863
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1223
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:11,703
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1224
01:50:12,412 --> 01:50:15,749
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1225
01:50:15,916 --> 01:50:18,126
...I'm going to find out why!

1226
01:50:44,945 --> 01:50:46,530
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1227
01:51:05,715 --> 01:51:07,259
<i>Sonorus!</i>

1228
01:51:11,513 --> 01:51:16,852
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1229
01:51:17,018 --> 01:51:21,982
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1230
01:51:24,067 --> 01:51:25,861
...and Mr. Potter...

1231
01:51:27,737 --> 01:51:29,489
...are tied for first position...

1232
01:51:29,656 --> 01:51:33,785
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1233
01:51:35,036 --> 01:51:38,498
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1234
01:51:39,416 --> 01:51:42,461
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1235
01:51:46,798 --> 01:51:49,551
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1236
01:51:49,718 --> 01:51:52,637
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1237
01:51:52,804 --> 01:51:57,309
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1238
01:51:57,642 --> 01:52:01,563
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1239
01:52:04,691 --> 01:52:09,029
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1240
01:52:09,196 --> 01:52:12,574
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1241
01:52:12,741 --> 01:52:15,744
You see, people change in the maze.

1242
01:52:15,911 --> 01:52:17,621
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1243
01:52:17,788 --> 01:52:22,584
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1244
01:52:24,044 --> 01:52:27,047
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1245
01:52:36,098 --> 01:52:37,557
Good luck.

1246
01:52:37,933 --> 01:52:39,893
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1247
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:44,856
On the count of three. One...

1248
01:56:12,647 --> 01:56:13,857
Fleur?

1249
01:56:15,525 --> 01:56:16,985
Fleur.

1250
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:22,365
<i>Periculum!</i>

1251
01:57:01,029 --> 01:57:02,531
Get down!

1252
01:57:03,073 --> 01:57:04,825
Get down!

1253
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:06,701
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1254
01:57:16,294 --> 01:57:19,506
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1255
01:57:19,673 --> 01:57:21,716
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1256
01:57:33,395 --> 01:57:35,063
Yes.

1257
01:57:55,917 --> 01:57:57,711
Harry!

1258
01:58:00,046 --> 01:58:01,673
Harry!

1259
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:05,469
Harry!

1260
01:58:07,929 --> 01:58:09,514
Harry!

1261
01:58:11,516 --> 01:58:13,268
<i>Reducto!</i>

1262
01:58:30,076 --> 01:58:32,579
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1263
01:58:32,954 --> 01:58:37,667
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1264
01:58:37,834 --> 01:58:39,586
For a moment, so did I.

1265
01:58:41,463 --> 01:58:42,631
Some game, huh?

1266
01:58:43,632 --> 01:58:45,050
Some game.

1267
01:58:50,472 --> 01:58:52,140
Go!

1268
01:59:02,275 --> 01:59:05,320
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1269
01:59:05,487 --> 01:59:07,489
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1270
01:59:07,656 --> 01:59:08,865
...three!
...three!

1271
01:59:21,378 --> 01:59:24,256
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1272
01:59:31,346 --> 01:59:32,681
Where are we?

1273
01:59:38,353 --> 01:59:40,021
I've been here before.

1274
01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:45,235
It's a Portkey.

1275
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:51,283
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1276
01:59:53,368 --> 01:59:56,746
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1277
01:59:56,913 --> 01:59:58,874
What are you talking about?

1278
02:00:04,129 --> 02:00:07,048
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1279
02:00:14,681 --> 02:00:17,017
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1280
02:00:17,184 --> 02:00:19,936
<i>- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!</i>

1281
02:00:31,239 --> 02:00:33,116
Do it! Now!

1282
02:00:45,087 --> 02:00:47,589
Bone of the father...

1283
02:00:47,756 --> 02:00:50,675
...unwillingly given.

1284
02:00:57,516 --> 02:01:00,560
Flesh of the servant...

1285
02:01:02,604 --> 02:01:05,774
...willingly sacrificed.

1286
02:01:09,861 --> 02:01:13,615
And blood of the enemy...

1287
02:01:19,412 --> 02:01:21,915
...forcibly taken.

1288
02:01:27,963 --> 02:01:30,924
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1289
02:01:31,675 --> 02:01:33,635
...again.

1290
02:02:37,032 --> 02:02:40,410
My wand, Wormtail.

1291
02:02:49,961 --> 02:02:51,922
Hold out your arm.

1292
02:02:52,089 --> 02:02:53,715
Master.

1293
02:02:53,882 --> 02:02:56,510
Thank you, master.

1294
02:02:56,676 --> 02:02:58,136
The other arm, Wormtail.

1295
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:40,679
Welcome, my friends.

1296
02:03:42,097 --> 02:03:44,850
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1297
02:03:45,475 --> 02:03:50,981
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1298
02:03:51,940 --> 02:03:54,860
I confess myself...

1299
02:03:55,318 --> 02:03:56,903
...disappointed.

1300
02:03:57,571 --> 02:03:59,656
Not one of you tried to find me.

1301
02:03:59,823 --> 02:04:03,201
Crabbe! Macnair!

1302
02:04:04,119 --> 02:04:05,454
Goyle!

1303
02:04:07,956 --> 02:04:09,583
Not even you...

1304
02:04:13,462 --> 02:04:15,380
...Lucius.

1305
02:04:17,215 --> 02:04:22,053
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1306
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:25,223
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1307
02:04:25,390 --> 02:04:30,562
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1308
02:04:32,272 --> 02:04:37,903
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1309
02:04:39,905 --> 02:04:42,532
...that is my true mask.

1310
02:04:42,908 --> 02:04:44,493
I returned.

1311
02:04:46,953 --> 02:04:50,832
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1312
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,756
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1313
02:05:02,969 --> 02:05:05,305
Thank you, master.

1314
02:05:05,889 --> 02:05:07,641
Thank you.

1315
02:05:10,727 --> 02:05:13,105
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1316
02:05:14,564 --> 02:05:16,066
Harry.

1317
02:05:16,233 --> 02:05:19,027
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1318
02:05:19,194 --> 02:05:23,615
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1319
02:05:23,782 --> 02:05:25,158
I'd introduce you...

1320
02:05:25,325 --> 02:05:29,621
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1321
02:05:32,290 --> 02:05:34,960
The boy who lived.

1322
02:05:35,127 --> 02:05:38,046
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1323
02:05:38,213 --> 02:05:42,217
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1324
02:05:42,384 --> 02:05:47,097
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1325
02:05:47,264 --> 02:05:48,765
Yes, shall I?

1326
02:05:49,224 --> 02:05:50,559
It was love.

1327
02:05:50,725 --> 02:05:55,230
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1328
02:05:55,397 --> 02:05:57,983
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1329
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,193
I could not touch him.

1330
02:06:01,403 --> 02:06:03,572
It was old magic.

1331
02:06:03,738 --> 02:06:05,991
Something I should have foreseen.

1332
02:06:06,158 --> 02:06:07,951
But no matter, no matter.

1333
02:06:08,118 --> 02:06:10,328
Things have changed.

1334
02:06:11,079 --> 02:06:14,583
I can touch you...

1335
02:06:15,208 --> 02:06:16,918
...now.

1336
02:06:25,093 --> 02:06:26,428
Yeah.

1337
02:06:32,768 --> 02:06:36,438
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1338
02:06:37,647 --> 02:06:39,316
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1339
02:06:40,942 --> 02:06:43,153
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1340
02:06:44,780 --> 02:06:47,073
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1341
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,659
First, we bow to each other.

1342
02:06:49,826 --> 02:06:52,245
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1343
02:06:52,412 --> 02:06:55,624
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1344
02:06:55,791 --> 02:06:57,125
I said, bow.

1345
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:03,298
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1346
02:07:03,715 --> 02:07:05,592
<i>Crucio!</i>

1347
02:07:08,053 --> 02:07:09,805
<i>Crucio!</i>

1348
02:07:10,847 --> 02:07:12,808
Attaboy, Harry.

1349
02:07:12,974 --> 02:07:15,102
Your parents would be proud.

1350
02:07:15,393 --> 02:07:18,814
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1351
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:20,565
<i>Expelliar...</i>

1352
02:07:23,568 --> 02:07:25,987
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1353
02:07:26,154 --> 02:07:28,156
I'm going to destroy you.

1354
02:07:30,325 --> 02:07:35,914
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1355
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:39,126
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1356
02:07:39,292 --> 02:07:41,962
...they'll speak only of how you...

1357
02:07:42,254 --> 02:07:44,089
...begged for death.

1358
02:07:44,256 --> 02:07:48,009
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1359
02:07:48,552 --> 02:07:50,178
...obliged.

1360
02:07:50,512 --> 02:07:52,013
Get up!

1361
02:07:57,018 --> 02:07:58,979
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1362
02:07:59,146 --> 02:08:01,398
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1363
02:08:01,565 --> 02:08:04,776
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1364
02:08:18,707 --> 02:08:20,459
Have it your way.

1365
02:08:21,501 --> 02:08:23,879
<i>- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!</i>

1366
02:08:41,396 --> 02:08:44,065
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1367
02:08:48,653 --> 02:08:50,363
He's mine!

1368
02:09:23,438 --> 02:09:27,442
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1369
02:09:27,609 --> 02:09:29,653
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1370
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:31,613
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1371
02:09:32,781 --> 02:09:35,826
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1372
02:09:35,992 --> 02:09:38,537
Take my body back to my father.

1373
02:09:39,579 --> 02:09:40,914
Let go.

1374
02:09:41,373 --> 02:09:43,333
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1375
02:09:44,167 --> 02:09:46,795
Let go! Let go!

1376
02:09:52,551 --> 02:09:53,927
<i>Accio!</i>

1377
02:09:59,641 --> 02:10:01,643
No!

1378
02:10:14,364 --> 02:10:15,991
He did it!

1379
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,869
Harry!

1380
02:10:21,663 --> 02:10:23,165
Harry!

1381
02:10:24,332 --> 02:10:27,586
No! No! No, don't!

1382
02:10:27,878 --> 02:10:29,755
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1383
02:10:30,046 --> 02:10:32,632
He's back. He's back.

1384
02:10:32,799 --> 02:10:34,843
Voldemort's back.

1385
02:10:35,010 --> 02:10:37,387
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1386
02:10:37,554 --> 02:10:39,890
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1387
02:10:40,056 --> 02:10:42,851
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1388
02:10:43,018 --> 02:10:45,353
He's home. You both are.

1389
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:49,149
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1390
02:10:52,194 --> 02:10:55,822
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1391
02:10:56,156 --> 02:10:57,866
Let me through.

1392
02:10:58,033 --> 02:10:59,534
Let me through!

1393
02:11:01,453 --> 02:11:02,704
Let me through!

1394
02:11:02,871 --> 02:11:04,289
That's my son!

1395
02:11:05,582 --> 02:11:07,042
That's my boy!

1396
02:11:09,878 --> 02:11:12,589
It's my boy!

1397
02:11:15,383 --> 02:11:18,970
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1398
02:11:19,137 --> 02:11:22,099
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1399
02:11:22,766 --> 02:11:24,976
No!

1400
02:11:28,063 --> 02:11:30,440
It's all right, I got you.

1401
02:11:30,607 --> 02:11:33,944
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1402
02:11:37,948 --> 02:11:39,741
No!

1403
02:11:40,867 --> 02:11:42,744
No!

1404
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:26,830
Are you all right, Potter?

1405
02:12:27,414 --> 02:12:29,332
Does it hurt? That?

1406
02:12:29,499 --> 02:12:31,293
Not so much now.

1407
02:12:32,252 --> 02:12:34,337
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1408
02:12:37,466 --> 02:12:39,468
The cup was a Portkey.

1409
02:12:42,179 --> 02:12:44,014
Someone had bewitched it.

1410
02:12:44,306 --> 02:12:46,391
What was it like?

1411
02:12:46,725 --> 02:12:48,393
- What was he like?
- Who?

1412
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,312
The Dark Lord.

1413
02:12:52,647 --> 02:12:55,734
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1414
02:12:56,985 --> 02:12:58,820
I don't know.

1415
02:13:01,656 --> 02:13:04,576
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1416
02:13:07,537 --> 02:13:09,539
...into one of my nightmares.

1417
02:13:28,266 --> 02:13:29,851
Were there others?

1418
02:13:30,018 --> 02:13:32,270
In the graveyard, were there others?

1419
02:13:36,191 --> 02:13:37,609
I...

1420
02:13:38,318 --> 02:13:42,239
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1421
02:13:49,704 --> 02:13:52,958
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1422
02:13:57,379 --> 02:14:00,424
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1423
02:14:00,590 --> 02:14:02,509
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1424
02:14:06,054 --> 02:14:09,724
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1425
02:14:09,891 --> 02:14:12,394
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1426
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:16,690
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1427
02:14:16,857 --> 02:14:20,068
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1428
02:14:20,235 --> 02:14:21,778
...that led him straight to it?

1429
02:14:30,203 --> 02:14:34,207
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1430
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:38,420
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1431
02:14:38,587 --> 02:14:40,756
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1432
02:14:41,381 --> 02:14:44,885
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1433
02:14:45,051 --> 02:14:46,344
And now the deed is done.

1434
02:14:48,013 --> 02:14:52,350
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1435
02:15:00,859 --> 02:15:04,362
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1436
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,783
...that I have once and for all...

1437
02:15:08,408 --> 02:15:12,746
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1438
02:15:12,913 --> 02:15:14,164
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1439
02:15:18,877 --> 02:15:20,128
Severus.

1440
02:15:22,631 --> 02:15:24,132
That's it, take it.

1441
02:15:26,093 --> 02:15:29,554
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1442
02:15:29,721 --> 02:15:32,432
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1443
02:15:32,599 --> 02:15:35,685
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1444
02:15:38,730 --> 02:15:40,273
Harry, away from there!

1445
02:16:01,253 --> 02:16:04,589
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1446
02:16:05,549 --> 02:16:07,634
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1447
02:16:09,428 --> 02:16:10,512
Polyjuice Potion.

1448
02:16:10,679 --> 02:16:13,932
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1449
02:16:14,182 --> 02:16:16,101
We'll get you up in a minute.

1450
02:16:50,552 --> 02:16:51,928
Harry!

1451
02:16:55,599 --> 02:16:57,809
Barty Crouch Junior.

1452
02:16:58,059 --> 02:17:00,979
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1453
02:17:03,356 --> 02:17:04,566
Your arm, Harry.

1454
02:17:08,904 --> 02:17:11,156
You know what this means, don't you?

1455
02:17:12,073 --> 02:17:13,408
He's back.

1456
02:17:14,576 --> 02:17:16,745
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1457
02:17:17,662 --> 02:17:19,998
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1458
02:17:20,207 --> 02:17:24,753
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1459
02:17:25,212 --> 02:17:27,714
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1460
02:17:28,256 --> 02:17:31,134
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1461
02:17:51,029 --> 02:17:53,698
Today, we acknowledge...

1462
02:17:54,407 --> 02:17:57,160
...a really terrible loss.

1463
02:17:59,287 --> 02:18:02,040
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1464
02:18:02,207 --> 02:18:04,543
...exceptionally hard-working...

1465
02:18:05,502 --> 02:18:07,796
...infinitely fair-minded...

1466
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:10,674
...and, most importantly...

1467
02:18:10,966 --> 02:18:15,554
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1468
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:21,059
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1469
02:18:24,104 --> 02:18:25,647
You see...

1470
02:18:26,481 --> 02:18:28,567
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1471
02:18:29,484 --> 02:18:31,486
...by Lord Voldemort!

1472
02:18:33,363 --> 02:18:36,950
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1473
02:18:37,576 --> 02:18:41,288
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1474
02:18:43,457 --> 02:18:45,125
Now, the pain...

1475
02:18:45,292 --> 02:18:48,962
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1476
02:18:49,129 --> 02:18:50,464
...and reminds us...

1477
02:18:50,630 --> 02:18:54,342
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1478
02:18:54,509 --> 02:18:57,929
...our hearts beat as one.

1479
02:18:58,430 --> 02:19:00,474
In light of recent events...

1480
02:19:00,807 --> 02:19:05,729
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1481
02:19:06,605 --> 02:19:11,943
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1482
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:14,529
You remember that...

1483
02:19:15,113 --> 02:19:18,158
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1484
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:21,161
...kind and honest...

1485
02:19:21,661 --> 02:19:26,249
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1486
02:19:51,483 --> 02:19:53,527
I never liked these curtains.

1487
02:19:54,111 --> 02:19:56,780
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1488
02:19:57,114 --> 02:19:58,949
By accident, of course.

1489
02:20:04,621 --> 02:20:09,000
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1490
02:20:12,421 --> 02:20:14,089
Professor...

1491
02:20:14,297 --> 02:20:17,300
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1492
02:20:18,093 --> 02:20:22,514
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1493
02:20:24,099 --> 02:20:26,435
<i>Priori Incantatem.</i>

1494
02:20:30,564 --> 02:20:33,275
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1495
02:20:33,859 --> 02:20:35,694
They reappeared.

1496
02:20:37,154 --> 02:20:40,949
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1497
02:20:43,493 --> 02:20:46,121
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1498
02:20:46,580 --> 02:20:51,418
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1499
02:20:54,796 --> 02:20:56,465
But remember this:

1500
02:20:56,631 --> 02:20:58,550
You have friends here.

1501
02:21:00,552 --> 02:21:02,304
You're not alone.

1502
02:21:22,991 --> 02:21:24,743
Hermione.

1503
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:27,162
This is for you.

1504
02:21:27,746 --> 02:21:29,956
Write to me. Promise.

1505
02:21:31,041 --> 02:21:32,459
Bye.

1506
02:21:38,673 --> 02:21:40,634
<i>Au revoir, Ron.</i>

1507
02:22:24,553 --> 02:22:27,097
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1508
02:22:27,264 --> 02:22:28,390
- No.
- No.

1509
02:22:28,557 --> 02:22:32,936
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1510
02:22:37,357 --> 02:22:40,193
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1511
02:22:47,492 --> 02:22:48,952
Yes.

1512
02:22:53,707 --> 02:22:57,002
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1513
02:22:57,169 --> 02:22:59,755
I won't. You know I won't.

1514
02:23:01,006 --> 02:23:04,760
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
