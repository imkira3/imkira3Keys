Good to see you also.

3
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,773
Louisa, beautiful Louisa.

4
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:37,114
Although many of our families
were locked up in internment camps,

5
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,492
we Japanese-Americans fought valiantly

6
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,577
for our country in World War II.

7
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,833
We forged a special bond
of friendship with our white officers,

8
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,086
realising that all of us believed in the ideals

9
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,547
that forged our country.

10
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,091
In battles in ltaly and France,

11
00:02:56,093 --> 00:03:01,097
we became one of the most
decorated army units in World War II.

12
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,352
Today, the President
of the United States honours us

13
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,563
with a special unit citation.

14
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,983
The citation will be accepted on our behalf

15
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:17,196
by Sergeant Kesuke Miyagi
and Mrs Louisa Pierce,

16
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,532
the widow of Lieutenant Jack Pierce.

17
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,371
These men were
legendary soldiers in a regiment of heroes.

18
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,457
Attention!

19
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,295
Guard! Colours.

20
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,673
Attention!

21
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,009
Fire.

22
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,803
Fire.

23
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,764
Fire!

24
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,786
More potatoes, Mr Miyagi?

25
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,413
No, thank you, Louisa-san.

26
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,832
Miyagi is rice man, remember?

27
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,008
I am so sorry that
my granddaughter's not here to meet you.

28
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,718
I don't know where she can be.

29
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,433
Julie! Julie, this is Mr Miyagi.
He was a friend of your grandfather.

30
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,481
Hi.

31
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,903
Please excuse me for a moment.

32
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,117
Julie, I want you to come out
and meet Mr Miyagi.

33
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,452
I did. I said "Hi."

34
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,120
I want you to talk to him.

35
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,789
You invited him here. You talk to him.

36
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,999
-What are you doing?
-Getting some meat.

37
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,918
-Why?
-It's for a friend.

38
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,337
May I ask which friend?

39
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,090
Why is it, whenever I come back here,

40
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,800
I feel like I'm in a police station?

41
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,551
I'm surprised you don't take my fingerprints.

42
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,430
I worry about you, that's all.
You've got to tell me what you want.

43
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,225
What I want is for you to leave me alone!

44
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,686
Where are you going? Susan!

45
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,067
My name is Julie.
My mother's name was Susan.

46
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,235
She was killed in a car accident

47
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,362
with my father, and they're both dead.

48
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,781
So stop trying to bring them back.

49
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:34,125
I'm sorry you had to see that.
She is always so very angry.

50
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,502
Anybody who lose parent,

51
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,880
have much grief.

52
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:45,177
Grief trapped in the heart become big anger.

53
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,222
I don't know what to do any more.

54
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,266
Have suggestion.

55
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,610
Suggest Louisa-san,

56
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,364
water flowers.

57
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,741
What?

58
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,368
What do you mean, flowers?

59
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,120
Not here flower.

60
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,750
Flower in Miyagi garden. California.

61
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,971
Hi, Angel.

62
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,516
Hi.

63
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,019
Hi.

64
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,897
How you doing, huh?

65
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:24,902
How's your wing? Does it feel any better?

66
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,907
Come here. Can you come to me?
Come here, hop to my hand.

67
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,495
Good girl. Let's go for a walk, okay?

68
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,664
Come on.

69
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,877
I got in another argument
with my grandmother tonight.

70
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,297
I wish my parents were still here.

71
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,094
Everything wouldn't be so messed up.

72
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,724
You know,

73
00:07:56,268 --> 00:08:00,020
if they found out you were here,
they'd take you away.

74
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:04,441
Wouldn't that be awful? In some small cage.

75
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,735
You wouldn't know anybody.

76
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,203
544, handle code two.

77
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,997
We're checking it out.

78
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,586
Larry, look at that, up on the roof.

79
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,175
Oh, if she hasn't jumped yet,
I'm gonna throw her.

80
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,219
I'll be back. You be quiet, okay?

81
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,929
You be quiet.

82
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,105
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

83
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,988
You think she's still up here?

84
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,531
Beats me.

85
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,575
What was that?

86
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,619
Look out!

87
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,538
You! Hold it right there!

88
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,166
I said hold it! Police!

89
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,101
Stop!

90
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,146
Oh, come on!

91
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,744
Julie.

92
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,413
Look, I've heard all this before.

93
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,581
Why don't you put it on a video

94
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,541
so I can fast-forward
through the familiar parts?

95
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:49,171
I love you, Julie, and I know you love me.

96
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,592
But these days,
we act as if we hate each other.

97
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:58,180
Talking doesn't seem to help.
It just makes things worse.

98
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,476
Mr Miyagi's invited me to spend some time
at his house in California.

99
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,312
He'll stay here
and take care of everything while I'm gone.

100
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,861
Julie.

101
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,534
This zone is for the immediate loading

102
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,245
and unloading of passengers only.

103
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,038
No parking.

104
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,709
Please do not leave any baggage unattended.

105
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:34,133
-Hey, Skycap! Here.
-Yes, sir?

106
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,137
I've tried sometimes,

107
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,015
just to talk to you and not get angry,

108
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,559
but everything gets messed up,
and I don't know why.

109
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,437
Things get messed up for me too.

110
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,900
Bye.

111
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,368
Grandmother barely on plane...

112
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,537
Miss you already.

113
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,083
My birthday's in a couple of weeks.
I guess she forgot.

114
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,836
Birthday.

115
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,591
Very special day. Everybody have birthday.

116
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,927
Miyagi make you special dinner, okay?

117
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:24,850
Tempura. Tempura, sukiyaki. You like?

118
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,102
No like. Okay.

119
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,190
Sushi. Sushi, sashimi. Huh?

120
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,734
Sashimi. No. Okay.

121
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,114
Miyagi have it.
Hamburger teriyaki with French fry.

122
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,371
Look, I don't need a special dinner.
I can take care of myself.

123
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,457
I know where I'm going.

124
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,750
Good.

125
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:54,296
Miyagi know where you're going too.
Going school.

126
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,764
Miyagi pick you up here this afternoon.
Okay, Julie-san?

127
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,518
Sayonara.

128
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,354
Hey, get to class. Get going.

129
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,609
You! Get to class. Let's go.

130
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:15,043
Morning, Julie. No, no, no.
Those are bad for your ears.

131
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,545
Go to hell, Ned.

132
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,715
Now, I could take you down
to the principal's office,

133
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,049
and get you into a little trouble.

134
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,135
Or, I could pick you up tomorrow night

135
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,929
and take you down to the docks.

136
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,850
You've been to the docks, haven't you, Julie?
Pretty girl like you.

137
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,435
Dream on.

138
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,564
Hey! Most girls in this school

139
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,191
invite me.

140
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,068
Now, you're lucky to get an invitation.

141
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,071
Now, come on, Julie.
You know it's going to happen.

142
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,698
Let go of me!

143
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,326
You start hanging out
with me and my friends,

144
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,497
-you can have any damn thing that you want.
-Let go of me.

145
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,831
What's going on, Ned?

146
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,250
Colonel Dugan, sir.

147
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,503
I caught this young lady smoking cigarettes.

148
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,713
What are you talking about?
I wasn't smoking.

149
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,675
Her name is Julie Pierce, sir.

150
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,346
To the office. Let's go.

151
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,765
Curb your dog.

152
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,477
A member of the Alpha Elite
caught this student

153
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,771
smoking in the greenhouse nursery.

154
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,357
Put her record in the centre file.

155
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:22,778
If this student screws up again,
I want her out of here.

156
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,573
Of course, it depends
on which rule she breaks.

157
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,658
No.

158
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,204
No second chances. Next time, that's it.

159
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,084
I agree.

160
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,629
All right, young lady, you've been warned.

161
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,091
Now get to your next class.

162
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,885
It's a big school. I might get lost on the way.

163
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,095
McGowen.

164
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,306
take this student to her next class.
Room 238.

165
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,690
Hey, I'm Eric. What's your name?

166
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,233
Go to hell.

167
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,737
"Go to hell." Wow. That's a funny name.
What is that, Chinese?

168
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,281
Don't strain yourself, all right?

169
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,866
You're just another jerk
working for Colonel Dugan.

170
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,286
So, you got a problem with that?

171
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,372
Hang out with morons,
and you catch their stupidity.

172
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,875
The Alpha Elite,
it's like a championship football team.

173
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,335
That's what this school's known for.

174
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,381
Right. And you believe everything you hear?

175
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,467
I don't believe your name is "go to hell."

176
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,013
See you later.

177
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,452
-McGowen, right?
-Yeah.

178
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,039
Colonel Dugan told me you took
Julie Pierce to her next class.

179
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,373
Any problems?

180
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,750
No.

181
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,335
No? Good.

182
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,671
Don't forget, she's mine.

183
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,063
Anybody home?

184
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,733
Julie?

185
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,875
It's okay. It's okay.

186
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:49,216
How's the wing, huh? Does it feel any better?

187
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,969
Don't worry.

188
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,556
What are you doing up here?

189
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,600
Where'd you get the hawk?

190
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,104
She got shot in the wing.
I found her on the grass near the gym.

191
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,438
-Does it bite?
-Yeah.

192
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,692
Yeah, so stay back.

193
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,115
So, what is this place?

194
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,118
One of the janitors
used to keep pigeons up here.

195
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,372
Yeah? It's pretty cool.
You got your own private little zoo.

196
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,708
This is my secret, all right?

197
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,459
Well, not any more.

198
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,964
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

199
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,049
What do I mean?

200
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,593
You tell anybody about this,
and you're gonna be in trouble.

201
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,305
-What kind of trouble?
-Well, I'll...

202
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,307
-I'll call Domino's Pizzas.
-Yeah?

203
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,893
And have them
deliver 48 pizzas in the middle of the night.

204
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,980
That's great. I love pizza.
No anchovies, okay?

205
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,733
I'll write your name
all over the girls' bathroom.

206
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,276
Yeah, he said that?

207
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,404
I'll tell everyone you have
some weird social disease.

208
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,906
I guess I'm gonna be
pretty popular then, huh?

209
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,118
-You have a car?
-Yeah.

210
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,746
How would you like a pound of
sugar poured down the gas tank?

211
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,955
You're kinda angry, aren't you?

212
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,207
-Yes!
-I like that.

213
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,252
Just tell me what are you
gonna do about Angel.

214
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,590
So, what are you gonna do?

215
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,008
You'll see.

216
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:16,136
In the past, we've had external enemies.

217
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,556
In the past, we've had external enemies.

218
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,769
Now the enemy is in our country.

219
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:28,356
It's inside our cities, in our schools.

220
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:33,028
In a war, you have to be
ready and able to destroy your enemy.

221
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,239
Your school is clean and orderly

222
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:40,660
because you are ready and able
to give a maximum response.

223
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,456
Some punk brings spray paint,
puts graffiti on our walls,

224
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,709
we spray paint his eyeballs
so that he sees red.

225
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,921
Some kid drops a candy wrapper...

226
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,256
You make him pick it up and eat it.

227
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,051
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, sir!

228
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,304
Are you ready and able
to give a maximum response?

229
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,347
Yes, sir.

230
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,057
-A maximum effort?
-Yes, sir.

231
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,809
-To go to the limit?
-Yes, sir.

232
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,019
All right.

233
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:09,773
Now, this is a bullring, and I am the bull.

234
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,568
My objective is to defend.

235
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,029
Your objective is to attack.

236
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,074
So take your best shot.

237
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,409
Does that mean anything goes,
Colonel Dugan?

238
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,537
Try whatever you'd like.

239
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,510
I got him. Hit him.

240
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,648
-Very good, Ned.
-Sir!

241
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,944
Where is McGowen?

242
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,656
McGowen, get out here.

243
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,203
You have a problem?

244
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,458
No, I don't.
I'll fight for my family, I'll fight for myself,

245
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:13,169
but I'm not gonna step in there just
so you can show me how tough you are.

246
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,464
Maybe you should fight out of anger then.

247
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,305
Yes! Now that's more like it.

248
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,141
That's what I like to see.

249
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,227
Get back.

250
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,317
I guess that made you feel like a man, huh?

251
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,444
Did you feel pretty good?

252
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,990
When the enemy is weakest,
that's when you destroy them.

253
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,575
Excuse me.

254
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,871
Looking for student named Julie Pierce.

255
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,165
Who the hell are you?

256
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,004
My name Miyagi.
Friend of student grandmother.

257
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,425
I don't care if you're a friend of the Pope.

258
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,469
You're trespassing.

259
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,430
Now get your butt off school property.

260
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,434
Boy, you okay?

261
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,227
Yeah, I'm all right.

262
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,483
What are you all gawking at?
Let's do some laps. Come on!

263
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,367
Hey.

264
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,370
I told you to leave.

265
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,247
Do you have a problem with your hearing?

266
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,208
No, hearing okay.

267
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,336
Then it must a problem with
this old body of yours getting rickety.

268
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,172
-You don't move very fast.
-Move fast enough,

269
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,466
when necessary.

270
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,259
I told you to leave.

271
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:48,348
Miyagi raised in small village

272
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,016
on Okinawa.

273
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,602
At that time,

274
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,271
was a very bad-tempered bull

275
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,857
live in a pasture near village.

276
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,236
Oh, bull very bad. He chase children,

277
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,406
woman going shopping, farmer, everybody.

278
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,118
Then, one day, big festival.

279
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,996
Everybody happy.

280
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,754
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

281
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:27,595
That day, bad bull become good soup.

282
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,397
Did you tell Dugan about the hawk?

283
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,149
You stayed after school to ask me that?

284
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,860
If anyone finds out about Angel,
they're gonna take her away.

285
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,278
Is that what you call her, Angel?

286
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,614
-How do you know she's a girl?
-Will you just answer the question?

287
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,575
I'm sorry. I have to go.

288
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,077
Well, I'm not getting out of this car

289
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,329
until you tell me what you're gonna do.

290
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,290
Fine. Have it your way.

291
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,919
Hey, do you like my car?

292
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,299
It's an Oldsmobile 442.
I saved it from the junkyard.

293
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,470
-It's just a car.
-"It's just a car"?

294
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,473
Does Michael Jordan just play basketball?

295
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,683
Is Wayne Gretzky just a hockey player?

296
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,268
I don't know. Is he?

297
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,147
No, he's not. He's great, like this car.

298
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,696
-Where are you going?
-To work.

299
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,701
You're a train driver?

300
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,828
Security.

301
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,039
A security guard?

302
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:41,002
Yeah, that's right. You know, my grandfather,
he used to be an engineer in this train yard.

303
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:45,173
I just chase the rats.
Come here, I wanna show you something.

304
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,681
From up here you could see
the top of the world.

305
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,350
Come on up.

306
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,366
Why do you do this?

307
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,870
Well, for the money. What else?

308
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,917
My dad walked out on us about six years ago.

309
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:24,170
For a while he was sending us money,
but then he just stopped.

310
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,381
So, I had to get a job.

311
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,512
I don't know, I guess he didn't
think we were very important.

312
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,601
It doesn't matter though. This is temporary.

313
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,897
I'm going to the Air Force Academy.
I'm gonna be a fighter pilot.

314
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,316
Dugan said I can get in.

315
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,610
That's why you joined his group?

316
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,946
Yeah.

317
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:55,118
Yep, it's a pain in the ass, but, hey,
it'll get me in the cockpit of an F-15.

318
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,205
I never think about the future.

319
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:04,085
Sure you do. Sure you do.
What are you doing next month?

320
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,920
Don't know.

321
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,091
-What are you doing next week?
-Don't care.

322
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,094
What are you doing in the next five seconds?

323
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,555
I'm gonna make you promise me

324
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,391
that you won't tell anybody about the hawk.

325
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,767
Don't worry.

326
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,519
Promise.

327
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,481
-Look, if it's that important to you...
-Promise!

328
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,485
All right.

329
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,988
I promise.

330
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,824
I promise.

331
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,743
Sayonara.

332
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,954
Talk to you again soon. Bye-bye.

333
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,876
Julie-san, hello.

334
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,130
Julie-san.

335
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,883
So, how was school tod...

336
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,886
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

337
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,264
You're supposed to knock
before you come into a girl's room!

338
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,392
Very, very sorry. Miyagi apologise.

339
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:05,563
Very sorry. Oh, very sorry. Very sorry.
Very sorry.

340
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,194
Okay, I'm dressed. You can look now.

341
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,367
Miyagi apologise. You see,

342
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,829
before, live with friend, Daniel-san.

343
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,999
Daniel-san come Miyagi room,
Miyagi go Daniel-san room.

344
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,878
No big thing. A boy is easier.

345
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,880
Just forget about it, okay?

346
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,215
Okay.

347
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:37,011
Today, Miyagi go pick up
Julie-san at the school,

348
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,514
but you not there.

349
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,891
I went to the train yard to talk to this guy.

350
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,186
-No big deal.
-Miyagi also talk to people...

351
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,562
Your teachers.

352
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:50,024
Bring home homework you miss
for three weeks.

353
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,194
Great. Maybe I'll do it sometime.

354
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,947
Maybe do it tonight.

355
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,284
Don't order me around.

356
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,870
Is not order. Is very small request.

357
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,707
I told you this morning,
I know where I'm going in my life,

358
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,042
and I don't need
any math problems to get there.

359
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,878
Julie-san.

360
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,507
Ambition without the knowledge

361
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,594
is like boat on dry land.

362
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,557
Forget it, I'm outta here!

363
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,563
Julie-san. Julie-san.

364
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,024
Julie-san.

365
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,902
Will you just stay out of my life?
Stop telling me what to do!

366
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,156
Not trying to tell you nothing.
Try teach you something.

367
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,451
Teach me? Look at you!
You can't even speak English.

368
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,965
-Wow, I'm really sorry. Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

369
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,926
Are you okay? I'm really sorry.

370
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,054
She came out of nowhere, man.
I didn't even see her.

371
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,306
-You're not hurt?
-I said I was okay!

372
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,392
Hey, look, I'm really sorry!
Listen, man, I'm really sorry.

373
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,519
I'm really sorry.
I just gotta deliver this pizza down the road.

374
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,438
My boss has been on my case, you know.

375
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,524
And I've been having trouble with my...
I gotta go! I'm sorry!

376
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:17,904
Are you sure you're okay?
I gotta go! I'm really sorry!

377
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,662
Go ahead. Do what my grandmother does.

378
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,040
Tell me I made another mistake.

379
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,541
"Julie, you're so thoughtless.

380
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,710
"Julie, you lost your temper again."

381
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,382
Julie-san, Miyagi no need say nothing.

382
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,134
You're doing very nice job, thank you.

383
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,387
You're not gonna say anything?

384
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:47,016
Have small question. Where you learn that?

385
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,601
Learn what?

386
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,397
Jump into tiger position
when car almost hit you.

387
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,690
They no teach that kind of stuff girl's gym.

388
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,735
I don't know what you're talking about.

389
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,321
I just reacted.

390
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,515
My father taught me karate
when I was a little girl.

391
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,270
We used to do it every night after school.

392
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,647
I thought it was a game.

393
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,358
Your grandpapa

394
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,194
save Miyagi life...

395
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,947
Long time ago.

396
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,284
Was war time.

397
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,956
So, Miyagi try to say thank you...

398
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,709
Teach him karate.

399
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,712
He love karate.

400
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,591
He teach your father.

401
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,594
Your father teach you.

402
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,890
And then they died.

403
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,225
Everybody died.

404
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,229
Miyagi understand.

405
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,858
Miyagi also have parents at one time.

406
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,197
Anger no bring them back.

407
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,662
My mother was a beautiful woman.

408
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:35,416
Whenever I
watched her get dressed for a party,

409
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,419
I thought she looked like a magical princess.

410
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,671
My father loved her.

411
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:45,176
He was wise and funny and kind.

412
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,974
It wasn't right that they were killed.

413
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,268
It wasn't fair.

414
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,565
Death not fair to anyone...

415
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,944
But still we must

416
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,238
live our lives.

417
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,449
I used to see them so bright in my mind...

418
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,243
So clear.

419
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,580
Now all I have are these photographs.

420
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,961
Julie-san, parents leave you

421
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,797
more than just the photographs.

422
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:26,050
Leave you with very valuable legacy.

423
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,636
What legacy?

424
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,388
Karate.

425
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,058
What's so special about that?

426
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,479
Karate here.

427
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:44,819
But, this time, you too young to understand

428
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,822
true value of karate.

429
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:52,618
You know, for once, I wish you could give
me an answer I could understand.

430
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,416
Answer only important

431
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,501
when ask right question.

432
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,756
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

433
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:30,823
Hey.

434
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,534
How come my makeup's
all over the bathroom?

435
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,202
Too much makeup.

436
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,371
What?

437
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,458
Bathroom have too much makeup.

438
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,543
What do you mean, "too much makeup"?

439
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,379
There's no such thing as too much makeup.

440
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,507
Julie-san, it become problem when...

441
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,801
The problem is my teeth.

442
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,804
I just realised. They don't match my nose.

443
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,976
Teeth fine, nose fine.

444
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,729
Everything fit just fine.

445
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:07,818
I've been thinking about
this karate stuff my dad taught me.

446
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,279
Do you think I could still do it?
I'm not real strong.

447
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,406
Many kind of strength, Julie-san.

448
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,701
Well, I thought maybe
you could give me a few lessons...

449
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:20,164
So if Dugan's guys try to hassle me,
I could take care of myself.

450
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:24,085
You want a lesson? You pay Miyagi.

451
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,879
Pay you? With what? I'm broke.

452
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:33,594
Miyagi take four homework
paper payment one karate lesson.

453
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,679
No way.

454
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,764
No way, no teach.

455
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,265
All right.

456
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,061
Two math papers for one lesson.

457
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,439
Two math paper, one history paper.

458
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,901
Okay. Deal.

459
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,612
Let's start right now.

460
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,157
Good. First, we wax the car.

461
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:59,161
This hand wax on, this hand wax off. See?

462
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,123
Forget it. I'm not waxing anybody's car.

463
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,043
But first we wax car, then we work engine.

464
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,213
This new kind karate. Very much fun.

465
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,632
Fun? The mall is fun.

466
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,677
You have money for gasoline go mall?

467
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,721
I told you, I'm broke.

468
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,806
Then no need go mall.

469
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,977
You know what?
I don't think you know anything about girls.

470
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,062
Hai.

471
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,899
Miyagi have much to learn about girls.

472
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,321
Boys easier.

473
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,787
-Mr Miyagi.
-Hai.

474
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,838
I still want to go to the mall.

475
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,967
But I thought maybe
you could loan me some money.

476
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,303
No need loan money.

477
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,182
Family across street have
three young boys need baby-sitter.

478
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,185
Miyagi told them
you'd be very happy take job.

479
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,820
Hi, I'm Julie.

480
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,283
Hey, hey.

481
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,409
Yes!

482
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,833
What are you doing here?

483
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,794
Miyagi figure

484
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,672
children no have enough toys,
so bring more.

485
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,259
Nerf balls, flying disc.

486
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,554
All kind good stuff. You just have fun.

487
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,058
"Have fun"?
Mr Miyagi, they don't need any more toys.

488
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,560
They need three child-sized straitjackets.

489
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,648
Sun is warm, grass is green.

490
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,024
What?

491
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,528
If today Julie-san get angry,

492
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,405
just you repeat those words.

493
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,242
Take deep breath in through nose.

494
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,161
Sun is warm, grass is green.

495
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,996
Everything work out.

496
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,165
Sayonara.

497
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,583
Sayonara.

498
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,382
The sun is warm, the grass is green.

499
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,596
Get her! Get her! Come on!

500
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,516
Hey.

501
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,816
Come on! Come on!

502
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,236
-Move! Go!
-Got ya!

503
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,447
Let's get outta here!

504
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,173
You planned that whole thing.

505
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:03,637
Baby-sitting sometime good
exercise for karate student, Julie-san.

506
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:08,017
Well, when do I learn
how to break boards and stuff like that?

507
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,731
Why break boards? What boards do to you?

508
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,570
That kind stuff no teach you
how to conquer anger, Julie-san.

509
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,572
Understand?

510
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,532
Yeah.

511
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:09,244
Julie Pierce... I knew it.
Cops said it was a girl. Let's go.

512
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,053
Julie, what's going on?
Looking for an education?

513
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,847
-Surprise.
-Where you going, Julie?

514
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,224
Hey, hey, hey.

515
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,769
-Maybe she left something in her locker.
-Let go of me!

516
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,359
She's feisty, feisty.

517
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,283
Get her!

518
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,756
There's no way out, Julie!

519
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,929
I know you're in here, Julie.

520
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,187
Come on, Julie. I'm not that bad.

521
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,068
Let's just talk.

522
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,780
Let's try to be friends, Julie.

523
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,289
I hope I didn't scare you, Julie.

524
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,916
I didn't mean to.

525
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,548
I just want to see if we can
work out some of our differences.

526
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,223
I really don't like McGowen.

527
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,812
I thought maybe we can

528
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,814
talk about that a little bit.

529
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,332
Hi.

530
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,807
-You should have let me take you to...
-No.

531
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:35,933
Get off.

532
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,393
You're real pretty in the moonlight,
but this is nice.

533
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,145
Get off!

534
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,275
Sometimes I like it different.
Where you going, Julie?

535
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,531
Get her, will you?

536
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,046
Come on, guys, move it!

537
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,552
Don't let her out of this courtyard!

538
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,970
Here we come, Julie!

539
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,221
Get her!

540
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,183
Don't let her go! Open the door!

541
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,690
I'll see you at the docks.
Don't forget, we have a date.

542
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,913
Officer, I'm so glad you're here.

543
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:51,300
So what you doing at school
this hour, Julie-san? Studying?

544
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,804
I was trying to feed Angel.

545
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:59,391
Angel. Rather you act like angel.

546
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,644
Angel's a hawk, Mr Miyagi.

547
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,688
Hawk?

548
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,939
Yes.

549
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,774
It's a long story.

550
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,278
Miyagi ready to listen to long story.

551
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,363
Get in car, please.

552
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,496
You're mad at me, aren't you?

553
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:30,088
Julie-san, try to protect hawk is okay, good.

554
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,467
But should have told Miyagi.

555
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,805
Dugan talked with the principal.

556
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,974
They kicked me out of school for two weeks.

557
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,977
Now I'll never catch up with my classes.

558
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,189
Maybe I should just forget about school,

559
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,233
forget about my life.

560
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,071
Why can't I just lock myself in my
room and listen to music all day?

561
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,822
No, no, no, please.

562
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,909
Too hard on Miyagi ear.

563
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,495
Have better idea.

564
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,873
Tomorrow we go special place.

565
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,585
Go visit longtime Miyagi friend.

566
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:11,964
Julie.

567
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,008
-Hi, Eric.
-What are you doing here?

568
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,595
Well, something happened at school,
and I got suspended for a little while,

569
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,347
so we're going out of town
for a couple weeks,

570
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,058
and I came by to ask if
you could feed the hawk for me?

571
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,185
What'd you get suspended for?

572
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,356
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.
Can you feed the hawk?

573
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,066
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

574
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,235
Good. It's raw meat every other day

575
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,903
and keep the water bottle filled.

576
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,116
Well, I'm gonna miss you.
You gonna miss me?

577
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,036
Maybe.

578
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,748
Maybe? I'm not accepting any maybes today.

579
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,333
Eric, watch out.

580
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,252
I want an answer. You gonna miss me?

581
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,878
Not if you break your leg.

582
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,547
That's not the answer I want.

583
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,048
Eric.

584
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,633
I want an answer.

585
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,136
Yes.

586
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,887
What?

587
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,890
Yes, I'll miss you.

588
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:05,892
Bye.

589
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:40,218
Julie-san, you get
five gallon unleaded regular,

590
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:43,013
and some chocolate bar with almonds.

591
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,849
Right.

592
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,271
-Where are you?
-Two.

593
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,482
-Hi.
-How are you?

594
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:57,569
Can I get five gallons of gas and some
chocolate bars with almonds, please?

595
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,247
Ted, what are you doing?

596
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,791
I'm not doing anything.

597
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,847
Hello, dog.

598
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,642
Nice puppy.

599
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,314
Joey.

600
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,942
Very nice dog.

601
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,903
How'd you do that, Mr Miyagi?
That dog was about to attack me.

602
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,197
Anything possible if not afraid.

603
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,907
I wish I had your courage.

604
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,451
-Wish I had chocolate bar with almond.
-I got 'em.

605
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:50,664
Hey, what the hell you think you're doing?
Look at my dog.

606
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,793
You turned him into a damn chicken.

607
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,380
Sometime animal
have more sense than human.

608
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,841
Yeah? Well, you watch your mouth, old man.

609
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,175
Come on, let's just get outta here.

610
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,344
You ain't going nowhere until I say so.

611
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,389
Hey, let girl go.

612
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,435
-Watch it, Ted.
-What are you gonna do, old man?

613
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,186
You gonna fight?

614
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,021
Fighting not good.

615
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:26,992
Mr Miyagi!

616
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,881
Fighting not good.
Somebody always get hurt.

617
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,300
Right. I totally agree.

618
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,720
That was great, Mr Miyagi.

619
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,098
No, not great.

620
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,977
Miyagi always look for way not to fight.

621
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:58,064
Miyagi hate fighting. Was most unfortunate.

622
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,985
"Unfortunate"? Come on.
Aren't you glad you kicked some guy's butt?

623
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,864
Not want to kick anything.

624
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:10,994
Was most unfortunate their
butts attached to small brain.

625
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,760
Now what?

626
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,514
Now we wait.

627
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,292
Julie-san.

628
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,654
Mr Miyagi.

629
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,990
Mr Miyagi.

630
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,784
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

631
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,954
Mr Miyagi.

632
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,461
Mr Miyagi.

633
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,255
There's this loud bong going off,

634
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,048
and I couldn't sleep any longer.

635
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:53,722
So I thought we'd get some breakfast.

636
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,100
Earth to Miyagi.

637
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,646
Come in, Mr Miyagi.

638
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,075
Good morning, Julie-san.

639
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:21,958
Rock garden is very sacred place.

640
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,544
Is example of inner peace.

641
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,590
Sand represent the ocean.

642
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,884
Big rock, Japan.

643
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,472
Small rock Okinawa, where Miyagi born.

644
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,223
So?

645
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,769
-So, go visit Japan.
-What?

646
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,562
Hurry up. Get on big rock.

647
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,818
All right, I'm on Japan.

648
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,820
Think I could buy a TV set
or something while I'm here?

649
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,740
No, no, no. No TV set.

650
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:58,411
First, you fake front kick at opponent.

651
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:03,208
Roll hip, come around, make round
kick, land on Okinawa.

652
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,169
-That sounds hard.
-Try.

653
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,975
That's impossible.

654
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:25,855
Anything try first time impossible,
but must try. Do again.

655
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,525
Is there a trick to this,
something I haven't figured out?

656
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,611
-Pray.
-Pray?

657
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,071
Hai.

658
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,991
Great. Wonderful. That's a big help.

659
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,508
Very good, Julie-san. Try again.

660
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:59,097
You know when little girl growing up,

661
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,517
parents always say, "Be good,

662
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:05,645
"wear pretty dress, no fight."

663
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,773
Then, when same girl grow up,

664
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,861
anytime in dangerous situation, she hesitate.

665
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:17,532
Oh? So when is it okay?
I mean, how do you know when to...

666
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:22,078
When you have full respect for self,

667
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:25,457
respect for others, that answer come.

668
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:33,131
What are we supposed to do here?
Pitch some hay?

669
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,968
Julie-san must learn be alert.

670
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:40,889
Must know all times where is trouble.

671
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,975
All right, I'm alert.

672
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,852
Open eyes.

673
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,230
My eyes are already open.
What am I supposed to do?

674
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,358
Hey.

675
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:56,863
Focus, Julie-san.

676
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,077
Boy, am I hungry. I could eat a big juicy...

677
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,187
Mr Miyagi.

678
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,016
What?

679
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,271
What?

680
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,609
What?

681
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,154
What's the problem?

682
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,199
What'd I do wrong?

683
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,662
Julie-san try to kill cockroach.

684
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:31,875
What? Like you've never tried
to kill a cockroach before?

685
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,502
Monks here believe...

686
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:39,382
Negative action cause suffering and pain.

687
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,805
So, therefore, within monastery walls,

688
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,726
nothing is ever killed.

689
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,769
Well, that's a stupid rule.

690
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,612
Where you going?

691
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,914
Is stupid when neighbourhood gangs

692
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,957
kill each other with no reason.

693
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:21,716
Is stupid when countries fight wars.

694
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:27,555
Not stupid to respect all living things.

695
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,935
Yeah, I bet you've killed a cockroach.

696
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,023
Miyagi don't live in monastery, Julie-san,

697
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,735
but still respect all living things.

698
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,286
Attention!

699
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,415
By the time I'd left the army,

700
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,459
I had learned one thing.

701
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,713
When you go into battle, you must be strong.

702
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,383
-Eric McGowen?
-Yeah.

703
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,844
-Eyes forward.
-Your mother's on the phone.

704
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,808
You're not finished here, McGowen.
You don't leave here until I say so.

705
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,690
You leave here, and you can
forget about that recommendation

706
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,733
to the Air Force Academy.

707
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,402
That'll be it for you McGowen.

708
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:25,238
You'll end up flipping burgers
the rest of your life.

709
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:31,869
Mom, what's wrong?

710
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,371
Eric, it's me, Julie.

711
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,208
Julie. What's going on?

712
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,002
Sorry I had to call you at school,

713
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,004
but the place I'm staying at
doesn't have a phone,

714
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,755
and I wanted to make sure Angel's okay.

715
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:47,427
She's lonely. I think she misses you.

716
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,263
I hope this phoney call
doesn't get you in trouble.

717
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,765
So when are you coming back?

718
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,350
I don't know.

719
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,894
Well, you better make it soon, okay?

720
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,148
See ya.

721
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:18,244
I'm sorry I tried to kill the cockroach. Look.

722
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,012
Good.

723
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:48,774
This time I'm not
gonna get taken by surprise.

724
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,277
That very good to hear, Julie-san.

725
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:56,073
You're in here. I know you are.

726
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,620
-Feel alert, Julie-san?
-Totally.

727
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,290
-Ready to defend self?
-No problem.

728
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,958
Good.

729
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,003
Then do with blindfold.

730
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,798
Come on, Mr Miyagi.
How can I block an attack if I can't see?

731
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,720
Then you use ear,

732
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,556
nose, skin, feet.

733
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,435
Learn to use all senses.

734
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:40,284
I did it! I was focused! Totally focused!

735
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:45,957
Hey!

736
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:49,919
Must open senses wider, Julie-san.

737
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,525
I'm really sorry.
I thought you guys were asleep.

738
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,361
I'm outta here. I'll get outta here right away.

739
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:07,330
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr Miyagi.

740
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,169
What's going on?

741
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,506
Nothing.

742
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,593
Just monks having good time.

743
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,973
I thought they
were supposed to be spiritual leaders.

744
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,394
Never trust spiritual leader
who cannot dance.

745
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:02,134
Mr Miyagi, I can't do this.
I've tried a thousand times.

746
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:06,222
You remember what I say
first time we do this?

747
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,348
Pray?

748
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:12,144
Praying mantis always
drop to one knee before strike.

749
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,072
Hai.

750
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,835
Yes! Yes!

751
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,295
Yes! Yes! Yes!

752
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:43,300
Yes, I did it! I did it! Yes!

753
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,052
I did it! Yes! Yes!

754
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,847
Yes!

755
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,685
-Congratulations, Julie-san.
-"Congratulations"?

756
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,062
That's all you're gonna say,
is congratulations?

757
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,315
-Don't I get a belt or something?
-Buy belt mall.

758
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,775
No.

759
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,028
I mean a karate belt, brown belt, black belt.

760
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,323
-Why need belt?
-So everyone knows I'm good.

761
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,035
You know you good.
That the important thing.

762
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:13,372
Oh, come on.
Even Elvis Presley got a black belt.

763
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:16,250
Borrow from Elvis next time see him.

764
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:22,047
Wax on, wax off.

765
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,675
Very good, Julie-san.

766
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,385
Wax off.

767
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:28,762
Uh-oh. Miss spot.

768
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,287
This called footwork kata.

769
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,507
Footwork, footwork, footwork! That's it!

770
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,429
One more time! Whoa! Boom!

771
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,658
Tomorrow we go home.

772
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,326
Time go back school.

773
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,954
Yeah, I know.

774
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,707
I kind of wish the monks had
had dinner with us tonight.

775
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,292
I would have liked to say good-bye.

776
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:51,428
Monks discover something about Julie-san.

777
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,685
Think they like tell you something. Come.

778
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:03,315
Okay. Okay, I confess. I killed a spider
in my bedroom, but it was an accident.

779
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,317
I even buried him and said a little prayer.

780
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:15,536
Happy birthday to you

781
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,957
Happy birthday to you

782
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,461
Happy birthday, dear Julie-san

783
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:28,674
Happy birthday to you

784
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,259
This is great.

785
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,970
It's the first cake
I'm ever gonna eat with chopsticks.

786
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:35,764
Blow candle, make wish.

787
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,182
Maybe you get it.

788
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,360
Monks agree

789
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:53,198
to give Julie-san one wish and one gift.

790
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:58,579
Well, my one wish was that
you guys would come visit us in Boston.

791
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,874
Oh, this is difficult.

792
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:06,545
We have not left monastery for many years.

793
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,220
Wish granted.

794
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,016
Now receive gift.

795
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:31,111
Your gift is demonstration of Zen archery.

796
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,573
So, where's the target?

797
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,410
You're looking at it.

798
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,455
Excuse me?

799
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,750
Abbot will shoot one arrow...

800
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,502
Not for points.

801
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,838
If master small thing,

802
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,258
anything become possible.

803
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,929
Miyagi volunteer for this honour.

804
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,028
-Sayonara.
-Sayonara.

805
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,113
Sayonara.

806
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,324
Thanks for the arrow.

807
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,845
Hi, Julie!

808
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,599
Good morning, Julie. Welcome back.

809
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:27,186
Good morning, Mr Wilkes.
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened.

810
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,062
Well, I guess you learned something.

811
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,232
Ambition without knowledge
is like a boat on dry land.

812
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:34,651
I don't quite understand your answer.

813
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:37,988
The answer's only important
if you ask the right question.

814
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,535
-Hey.
-Hi, Eric.

815
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,205
-How you doing?
-Great. How are you?

816
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,624
Just fine. Welcome back.

817
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,167
Thanks.

818
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:54,797
So, tell me, where did you go?

819
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,634
I can't tell you.

820
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,804
-What do you mean, you can't tell me?
-You'd never believe me.

821
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:04,139
Hey, I haven't been up to see Angel yet.
How is she?

822
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:05,808
-She's fine. She's doing good.
-Is she?

823
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,267
-Yeah. We're best friends.
-Really?

824
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,061
-You want some milk?
-Thanks.

825
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,898
Look who's back in school.

826
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,237
Looks like Ned and his friends
are still mad at me.

827
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:21,281
Yeah, well, you're not the
only one they're mad at.

828
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:24,409
I quit Dugan's group.

829
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,828
You what?

830
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,081
Come on. I'll tell you about it.

831
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,752
So, tell me about the Air Force Academy.

832
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,546
I thought Dugan could get you in.

833
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,881
I don't need Dugan. I can do it on my own.

834
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:41,510
He's been giving people orders for
so long, he's got their brains fried.

835
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:44,096
I want to be like Angel.

836
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,098
I don't want to be someone...

837
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,269
Where is she?

838
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,146
She was in here yesterday. I fed her.

839
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,816
She had a broken wing.

840
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,025
She couldn't fly away.

841
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,318
I don't know.

842
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,444
What's the matter, Julie?

843
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,281
Did you lose your little birdie?

844
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:03,907
What did you do with her?

845
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,909
The one that can't fly?

846
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,287
It might end up in a dumpster.

847
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,747
What are you, a tough guy?

848
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,500
-Tougher than you. Yeah?
-Stop it, Eric. Don't.

849
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,751
Eric!

850
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:17,504
-Where's the hawk?
-I called Animal Control, McGowen.

851
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,007
A man came, and he put it in a cage.

852
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,218
Stop it!

853
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:24,511
I bet you he's gonna kill it,

854
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,221
and then he's gonna stuff it.

855
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:27,472
Yeah!

856
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:30,893
-Eric, stop. Will you stop?
-Come on, man!

857
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,729
Stop, Eric. Forget about him.

858
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:36,189
Oh, I'm not done with you yet, McGowen.

859
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,025
One way or another,

860
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:40,152
we're gonna finish this thing.

861
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,949
Hi. Hi.

862
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,412
Hi, Angel.
How'd they treat you in there, huh?

863
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,332
Angel ready to fly.

864
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,669
That's impossible, Mr Miyagi.
She's got a broken wing.

865
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:00,714
Take chance. See what happen.

866
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,841
Nothing's going to happen.

867
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,929
Angel decide, not Julie-san.

868
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,224
Come on.

869
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:19,691
I told you, Mr Miyagi, she can't fly away.
She has a broken wing.

870
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,735
We don't know that yet.

871
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:44,049
Now, let wind touch bird.

872
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,343
Mr Miyagi.

873
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,388
Julie-san.

874
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,807
Maybe if you believe,

875
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,142
Angel believe too.

876
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:00,315
Now release.

877
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,364
Okay. Fly away, Angel.

878
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:28,010
What's wrong, Angel?
You're free. Go on. Fly away.

879
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,596
Sometimes, when live in cage too long,

880
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,350
whole world seem like very big place.

881
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,940
You're strong, Angel. You're strong.

882
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,028
I know you are.

883
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,781
Fly away. Fly free.

884
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:59,875
You healed her, Mr Miyagi.

885
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,795
No. Angel heal self.

886
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:08,508
But your faith give her courage to fly.

887
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,266
Come. We go.

888
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:26,401
I'm really going to miss Angel.

889
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,072
I used to talk to her a lot.
I told her everything.

890
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:35,077
You lucky you have Angel talk to.

891
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,204
She no talk back.

892
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,583
Maybe now you talk Miyagi,

893
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,460
or your friend, Eric.

894
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,504
Eric?

895
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:50,133
He asked me to the senior prom.
I didn't know what to say.

896
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,346
What problem? You no like boy?

897
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,015
Yeah, I like him...

898
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:00,685
But it's a formal dance,
and I don't have a dress.

899
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:04,648
Even if I did go, I probably wouldn't fit in.

900
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,566
What would happen if they started doing

901
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,485
an old-fashioned waltz
or something like that?

902
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,487
I don't know how to waltz.

903
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,865
All things possible, Julie-san.

904
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:19,538
I have to admit, though,
it was nice to get asked.

905
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,767
May I help you, sir?

906
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,103
Oh, yes.

907
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,480
Want to buy dress.

908
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,942
Formal dance, very important.

909
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:52,362
Of course.
Well, as you see, we have all sorts of styles.

910
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:56,366
Do you like an A-line,
or do you like a tea length?

911
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,410
Do you like off-the-shoulder?

912
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:02,581
Miyagi like everything, but dress not for me.

913
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,666
Dress for teenage girl.

914
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:09,504
Of course.
Well, what kind of a girl is she? Is she trendy,

915
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:11,381
or conservative?

916
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:14,676
We can do a silk charmeuse
or a crepe de Chine.

917
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:19,014
Girl have good spinning back kick,

918
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:21,766
but need work on sword-hand block.

919
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:25,187
Yes, that's very helpful.

920
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,522
Is she tall?

921
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:33,111
Not too tall, but not short.

922
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,280
Not fat.

923
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,491
Not skinny. Slender.

924
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,119
Like this.

925
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,464
Hi, Mr Miyagi.

926
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,300
What are you doing?

927
01:15:56,677 --> 01:16:01,514
Today we practise karate inside house.

928
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,476
-Here, in the parlour?
-Hai.

929
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:07,520
Ready?

930
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:09,606
Sure.

931
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,152
Hai.

932
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:18,406
Today Miyagi show you new kata.

933
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,367
Okay?

934
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:24,788
First, lead with left foot, right punch.

935
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:26,998
Okay.

936
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,459
Then Julie-san follow.

937
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:30,877
Okay.

938
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:36,883
Side step, punch.

939
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,513
Punch, side step.

940
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,473
Feet together.

941
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,519
This time, Miyagi move, you counter.

942
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:50,063
Go.

943
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:55,068
Feet together.

944
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,114
Side.

945
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,700
Once more.

946
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,369
-Right?
-Hai.

947
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:07,998
-Counter.
-Okay.

948
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,422
Feet together. Just a minute.

949
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,302
Go.

950
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:31,396
One, two, three. One, two, three.

951
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,857
One, two, three.

952
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,568
One, two, three.

953
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:42,073
I can't believe it. I'm dancing.

954
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,117
Where'd you learn this?

955
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:48,496
Miyagi invent new kata
called "Karate Waltz."

956
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:53,335
Actually, Julie-san grandpapa teach.

957
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,670
Was in World War ll, France.

958
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:58,256
He tell Miyagi, "You can dance.

959
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:01,843
"You can fight, you can dance,
you have good footwork."

960
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,932
I still don't know
what I'm going to wear to this thing.

961
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,561
Oh, yes. Miyagi forget something.

962
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,897
You stay, practise. I be right back.

963
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:31,206
Hai, Julie-san.

964
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,667
Late birthday present from Miyagi.

965
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,171
Mr Miyagi.

966
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:40,965
Oh, it's beautiful.

967
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,135
Miyagi want you to go dance.

968
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,179
How'd you know my size?

969
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,474
That was very difficult part.

970
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,812
It's too bad
you never had a daughter, Mr Miyagi.

971
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,313
You would have been a good parent.

972
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,315
Thank you.

973
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,361
One minute.

974
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:11,204
As a new parent, may I have this dance?

975
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:37,439
So, you call Eric, you tell him we go dance.

976
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,025
What do you mean, "we"?

977
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:43,903
Miyagi drive car.

978
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:49,117
Mr Miyagi, it doesn't exactly work that way.

979
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:54,831
Okay, then Mr Miyagi stay home,
wait like anxious parent.

980
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:56,040
Okay.

981
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,711
One...

982
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,382
One...

983
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:22,066
Hi.

984
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,077
Hi.

985
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,710
Come on.

986
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,130
-Hi.
-Hi.

987
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,634
I'm Eric. I'm here for Julie Pierce.

988
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,095
Julie-san.

989
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:51,030
Miyagi-san, Julie-san date is here.

990
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,910
-Hi.
-Hi.

991
01:21:58,539 --> 01:21:59,914
I'm Eric McGowen.

992
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:03,459
Oh, yes. Honoured to meet you. Miyagi here.

993
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:06,337
I'm taking Julie to the dance tonight.

994
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:09,257
Oh, yes. Of course,

995
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:13,011
you bring her home by 10:00?

996
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:16,389
Well, see, the dance goes to midnight.

997
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,185
So, why don't I bring her back around 1:00?

998
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:27,692
What you do for extra hour?

999
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:31,821
Well...

1000
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,366
Treat her with respect.

1001
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:37,535
Right.

1002
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:40,538
Treat her with respect for one hour.

1003
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,499
Good.

1004
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,545
Julie-san.

1005
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:49,422
Friend Eric here.

1006
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:54,385
You can come in, Mr Miyagi.

1007
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,739
I wish my parents could see this.

1008
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,076
Your parents watching.

1009
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:22,705
I still remember
what you said to me at the monastery,

1010
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:25,708
about keeping them in my heart.

1011
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:32,090
It's a way to love someone
even if they're not with you.

1012
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:36,344
Parents very proud...

1013
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,763
Like Miyagi...

1014
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:40,932
Very happy.

1015
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:49,941
Oh, Julie-san,
tonight you are beautiful woman.

1016
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:01,869
Go.

1017
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:12,964
Enjoy dance.

1018
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,593
Maybe Miyagi celebrate too.

1019
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:20,012
Take monks for ride on town.

1020
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,615
See you later, guys.

1021
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,498
Who are those people?

1022
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,125
Friends.

1023
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,669
I like them.

1024
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,505
I like them too.

1025
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:25,578
That is a nice dress.

1026
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,539
You better watch the road, Eric.

1027
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:33,127
You know, you look like you,
but you don't look like you.

1028
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:36,297
One way.

1029
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,132
You are so beautiful.

1030
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:41,010
It's a one-way street, Eric!

1031
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:48,059
Do you really want to do this?

1032
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,448
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1033
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:06,244
Don't touch this ball, all right?
This ball cost serious money.

1034
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:09,163
Sorry. Don't understand English.

1035
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:11,332
Look, don't talk either.

1036
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:12,875
What the problem?

1037
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,587
Don't breathe, don't move.
I don't want any distractions.

1038
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:20,341
Perhaps we can make a small contest.

1039
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,636
Oh, say, buck a point?

1040
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,763
Just a minute.

1041
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,104
Do you believe these guys?
It'll be a piece of cake.

1042
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:39,861
Hai, contest covered.

1043
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:15,855
Why do they keep their eyes closed?

1044
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:19,400
It's called Zen bowling.

1045
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:24,572
No have to see pins,
only have to think about target.

1046
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,644
What are you doing?

1047
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,229
Nothing.

1048
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:45,277
I'm sorry.

1049
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:47,738
Sorry for what?

1050
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,492
For getting you in trouble
with Ned and his friends.

1051
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:55,746
You're worth it.

1052
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:30,990
Yeah!

1053
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:32,783
Yeah!

1054
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:40,624
Yeah!

1055
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:02,396
Look!

1056
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:25,169
Help me get him down.

1057
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:27,630
You all right?

1058
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:29,799
-I hit my arm.
-Yeah?

1059
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:33,552
Whose idea was this?

1060
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,764
Ned's. Dugan said it would be all right.

1061
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:38,182
Leave him alone, McGowen.

1062
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:40,810
This is real smart, Ned.
I think you broke your buddy's arm here.

1063
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:43,187
At least he was brave enough to try it.

1064
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,147
Why don't you just mind your business?

1065
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:48,484
-You're okay, right?
-Yeah.

1066
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,127
-Those guys are idiots.
-Right here, McGowen.

1067
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:07,711
-Oh, yeah?
-Look at you buddy.

1068
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,004
Don't fight.

1069
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,049
Jerk.

1070
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,385
McGowen just challenged me.

1071
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:17,763
I'm not letting him get away with this.

1072
01:31:17,848 --> 01:31:19,014
Absolutely.

1073
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,240
None of this would have happened
if it hadn't been for me.

1074
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:41,245
What? What are you talking about?

1075
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,956
Hey, listen, I'm glad this happened.

1076
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:46,959
Forget about Dugan. Forget about him.
I don't need him.

1077
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:49,420
I'm gonna live my life my way.

1078
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:53,090
Sometimes that's difficult.

1079
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,051
Not when I'm with you.

1080
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:08,272
So, Mr Miyagi is teaching you karate, huh?

1081
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:11,567
-Yeah, a little. Yeah.
-Yeah?

1082
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:19,241
So, if I try to kiss you, will you use it?

1083
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:22,119
The sun is warm. The grass is green.

1084
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,788
What?

1085
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,125
Nothing.

1086
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:42,181
What was that?

1087
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:43,933
Let's go, McGowen.

1088
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:50,856
Are you all right?

1089
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:01,492
I'll see you at the docks, McGowen...

1090
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:03,827
If you're brave enough to go.

1091
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:09,917
-You all right? Look at this.
-Yeah. Let's call the police.

1092
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,378
Why? What's the point? They're
just going to lie about what happened.

1093
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:14,630
-Well, what are we going to do?
-We are not doing anything.

1094
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:17,258
I'm going to settle this thing once and for all.

1095
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:18,717
Mr Miyagi.

1096
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:56,839
Hey McGowen.

1097
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,384
Where's your little buddies, Ned?

1098
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,219
I didn't think you were gonna show.

1099
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:03,554
Yeah?

1100
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,764
It's one on one.

1101
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:08,642
One on one, man.
Now I'm gonna teach you how to fight.

1102
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:11,770
You want a piece of me? Now's the time.

1103
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:13,731
Let's go.

1104
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:20,654
Remember the bullring, McGowen?

1105
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:26,285
As I recall, you didn't think
much of that particular exercise.

1106
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:28,579
Maybe now you wish you'd
paid more attention.

1107
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,122
I got a piece of you, didn't I?

1108
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:34,168
Yes, you did. Now it's payback time.

1109
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:38,756
Well, son, this time you've
bitten off more than you can chew.

1110
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:41,759
-Let me have him, Ned.
-Not now, Charlie.

1111
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,095
We're a team. We're gonna do this together.

1112
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:46,972
Come on. Come on!

1113
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:48,807
Light it.

1114
01:35:00,487 --> 01:35:02,404
Come on, McGowen, let's go.

1115
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:15,209
Come on, Eric. Come on, Eric.

1116
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,044
Pick him up.

1117
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,137
We haven't even started yet, McGowen.
Come on.

1118
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,181
Come on. Come on.

1119
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,560
You wanted me, McGowen.
You wanted a piece of me, right?

1120
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:37,898
Well, you got it.

1121
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:39,691
Get up!

1122
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:45,948
You're not that tough. Come on.

1123
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:47,491
Come here! Come here! Come on!

1124
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,208
You're not gonna quit. Come on, quitter.

1125
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:05,092
Oh, come on, McGowen.

1126
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,428
I thought you were tougher than that, pal.

1127
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:12,516
Higher. I want to see his eyes.

1128
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:14,768
Thanks for showing up, McGowen.

1129
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,103
Anytime.

1130
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:19,064
Pick him up.

1131
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,027
Come here. Come here.

1132
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:27,281
Finish him off.

1133
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:33,245
What are you all looking at?

1134
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,539
What do you think I've been training you for?

1135
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:37,875
Ned, kick him.

1136
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,711
Do it!

1137
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:45,549
-Dugan, he's down.
-Pick him up!

1138
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:47,801
-Do it.
-Please.

1139
01:36:51,598 --> 01:36:52,931
Eric?

1140
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,567
Eric.

1141
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,200
Eric?

1142
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:13,243
Eric?

1143
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:14,912
What?

1144
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,082
Eric.

1145
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,543
-Get out of here.
-Come on. Come on.

1146
01:37:21,628 --> 01:37:23,253
Come. I call police.

1147
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:25,172
McGowen was speeding around in his car.

1148
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:27,132
Obviously he had a car accident.

1149
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:28,717
That's a lie, man.

1150
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:33,013
Is no accident when fight is five against one.

1151
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:36,099
Ned here could have beaten McGowen
with his arms behind his back.

1152
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:38,268
Come. We go.

1153
01:37:38,937 --> 01:37:40,437
Julie... What?

1154
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:42,314
What, are you kidding me?

1155
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,317
-Let me fight him.
-No.

1156
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:46,485
You want to fight me?

1157
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:50,155
Julie-san, no fighting.

1158
01:37:51,282 --> 01:37:53,867
-Please.
-Colonel, she wants to fight me.

1159
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:55,536
Mr Miyagi.

1160
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:58,413
If I'm ever going to respect myself,
I have to do this.

1161
01:37:58,498 --> 01:37:59,831
No, no.

1162
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,543
Mr Miyagi, please tell her
she's gonna get hurt.

1163
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:05,504
Eric. No.

1164
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,881
Julie-san right.

1165
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:10,467
Now is time.

1166
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:21,311
Just remember,
true strength come from inside.

1167
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:26,400
If you're gonna do this,

1168
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:28,860
you put her away.

1169
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:32,072
Do you understand me?

1170
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:36,076
Yes, sir.

1171
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,161
All right.

1172
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:53,343
Guys, this is really embarrassing.

1173
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:56,013
But okay.

1174
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,765
Give me your best shot.

1175
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:15,866
Slow down!

1176
01:39:16,326 --> 01:39:18,035
Use your strength.

1177
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,469
That was really good, Julie. It really was.

1178
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:42,142
-Stop this!
-Eric, no.

1179
01:39:42,894 --> 01:39:46,063
But it wasn't good enough. Come on!

1180
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:48,899
Come on, Julie.

1181
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:57,366
Focus, Julie-san.

1182
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:30,565
All over, Julie-san. We go.

1183
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:32,609
What are you talking about?

1184
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:35,028
The war is not over because one battle's lost.

1185
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:37,364
Charlie... Charlie'll fight her.

1186
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:38,740
No, sir.

1187
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:42,494
-Come on, Charlie. I said, fight her!
-What are you doing? No!

1188
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:46,039
You're crazy, man.

1189
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:50,419
-Morgan, you fight her.
-Colonel, it's over.

1190
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:55,298
Ned, get up and finish the job.

1191
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:59,469
I said, get up and finish the job!

1192
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,304
-No more.
-What?

1193
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:04,641
Enough!

1194
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:08,687
-It's not over.
-Then we finish.

1195
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:21,491
Absolutely.

1196
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:26,288
I'm gonna put your lights out.

1197
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:11,750
Time put your lights out.

1198
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:38,902
You said you had all the answers, Colonel.

1199
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:51,998
-Mr Miyagi.
-Hai.

1200
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:54,251
You were great.

1201
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:55,836
Not great.

1202
01:42:58,506 --> 01:43:00,757
-Mr Miyagi.
-Hai.

1203
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:03,301
You kicked some butt.

1204
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:09,432
Julie-san, how many times
Miyagi say fighting not good?

1205
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:12,352
I know. Somebody always gets hurt.

1206
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:16,773
Mr Miyagi, come on, admit it.

1207
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,526
-We kicked some butt.
-Julie-san.

1208
01:43:20,778 --> 01:43:22,571
Fighting not good...

1209
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:26,491
But if must fight, win.

1210
01:43:27,305 --> 01:44:27,924
