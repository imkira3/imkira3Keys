1
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,160
- What kind is it?
- I don't know.

2
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,481
White?

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,330
<i>And the frame?</i>

4
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,245
- Dark.
- Postmark?

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,528
<i>Same as last time.</i>

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,689
And no note.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,251
<i>No.</i>

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,601
<i>I'm so sorry, Henrik.</i>

9
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,964
Will you appeal?

10
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,407
What is this?
The media event of the year?

11
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,921
Don't try to play it down, Mikael.
It won't work.

12
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,367
Don't try to play it up.
That won't work either.

13
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,927
Mikael, can we get a quote?

14
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,847
Mikael, will you appeal?

15
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,322
Yes. I'll appeal to you, Viggo.

16
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,410
<i>Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist
was able to play the victim...</i>

17
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,961
<i>...the brave journalist going up
against the bad guy.</i>

18
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,606
<i>I don't know why malicious intent
couldn't be proven.</i>

19
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,923
<i>- When you call a guy a criminal--
- If you want to say these things--</i>

20
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,809
<i>Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.</i>

21
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,924
<i>There's really no greater disgrace
for a journalist than libel.</i>

22
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,243
<i>-- Was found guilty today on 16 counts
of aggravated libel.</i>

23
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,007
Can I get that sandwich there?
And a black coffee.

24
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,084
<i>In an article published earlier
this year, Blomkvist claimed...</i>

25
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,483
<i>Wennerström, founder and president
of the Wennerström Group...</i>

26
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,281
<i>...used state funds intended
for industrial development in Poland...</i>

27
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,404
<i>...in an arms deal with the right-wing
Ustase in Croatia.</i>

28
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,530
<i>I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist.
He's a fine journalist...</i>

29
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,967
<i>...who I don't believe
is guided by malice.</i>

30
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,202
<i>But what he wrote was inaccurate.</i>

31
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,966
<i>And inaccuracies
can't go unanswered.</i>

32
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,448
<i>All journalists have to accept,
like the rest of us...</i>

33
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,649
<i>...actions have consequences.</i>

34
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,530
<i>Blomkvist was ordered to pay...</i>

35
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,331
<i>...600,000 Swedish kronor
in damages and all court costs.</i>

36
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,882
Can I get a packet of Marlboro Red
and a lighter?

37
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,041
Yeah.

38
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,691
- Where have you been?
- Walking. Thinking.

39
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,365
- Smoking?
- Yeah. Just one.

40
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,562
TV4 called.
I told them no statement...

41
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,961
...until we've read
the judgment in its entirety.

42
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,407
Well, I have. Anyone else?

43
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,449
Everyone who wants
to see you humiliated.

44
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,046
- Been on the phone all morning?
- I'm as much to blame.

45
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,481
- You are? You wrote it?
- I read it. I ran it.

46
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,802
- Not the same.
- Our credibility isn't dead yet.

47
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,610
Mine is.

48
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,090
I'm tired.

49
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,923
I'm gonna go home,
crawl under the duvet for a week.

50
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,811
I'll call Greger,
tell him I'm not coming home.

51
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,200
Thank you.

52
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,042
It's possible we could wait forever.

53
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,966
- You called her and spoke to her?
- I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.

54
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,848
<i>No one here particularly likes her.</i>

55
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,367
I find it's much better
if she works from home.

56
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,246
But you told her
I wanted to meet with her.

57
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,085
I've told her many times
I prefer her not to meet clients.

58
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,408
<i>- You like her?
- Very much.</i>

59
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,803
<i>She's one of the best investigators
I have, as you saw from her report.</i>

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,766
- But?
- I'm concerned you won't like her.

61
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,960
- She's different.
- In what way?

62
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,087
In every way.

63
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,128
<i>Miss Salander is here.</i>

64
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,525
Lisbeth.

65
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,921
Mr. Dirch Frode.

66
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,923
How do you do?

67
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,844
Something wrong with the report?

68
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,570
No, it was quite thorough.

69
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,644
But I'm also interested
in what's not in it.

70
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,844
- There's nothing not in it.
- Your opinion of him isn't.

71
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,841
- I'm not paid to give my opinion.
- So you don't have one?

72
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,970
He's clean, in my opinion.

73
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,691
You mean he's hygienic?

74
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,841
He's who he presents himself to be.
In his business, that's an asset.

75
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,129
Well, there's less in his asset column
after his conviction today.

76
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,163
True. He made a fool of himself.

77
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,810
If it happened that way.

78
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,962
Are you suggesting
that he was set up?

79
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,729
That was never part
of my assignment.

80
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,609
But you're right.

81
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,331
He did make a fool of himself
professionally.

82
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,848
How much of a fool did he make
of himself financially?

83
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,731
The judgment will just about
empty his savings.

84
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,046
- May I go?
- Moment.

85
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,360
Your report is light in another area.

86
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,249
His personal life.

87
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,243
Anything you chose not to disclose?

88
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,045
Nothing that warranted inclusion.

89
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,929
Does that mean yes or no?

90
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,210
I think what Miss Salander means, and
I agree, is that everyone has a right...

91
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,688
...to a certain amount of privacy,
even if they're being investigated.

92
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,411
Not in this case.
I need to know anything about him...

93
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,167
...I might find unsavory,
even if she doesn't.

94
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,002
He's had a longstanding
sexual relationship...

95
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,245
...with his co-editor of the magazine.
It wrecked his marriage but not hers.

96
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,641
Sometimes he performs cunnilingus.

97
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,161
Not often enough, in my opinion.

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,968
No, you're right not to include that.

99
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,485
I know.

100
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,524
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.

101
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,966
- She offered.
- He declined.

102
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,685
- As she hoped.
- Never a good idea.

103
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,320
- Mixing family and business.
- I would've lost anyway.

104
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,007
It wasn't about Mikael. It was about
Wennerström sending a message...

105
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,323
...to the press and the FSA,
saying, "Don't ask questions."

106
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,607
Cheer up.

107
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,847
Dad.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,526
Nilla, you don't have
to worry about me.

109
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,484
- Mom's worried.
- About me?

110
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,686
About the money.

111
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
Good evening.

112
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,246
Nilla? What are you doing?

113
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,526
Nothing.

114
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,886
Are you serious?

115
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,601
I don't wanna talk about it
since I know you won't approve.

116
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,881
Of...?

117
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,731
- Nilla.
- Light of Life.

118
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,245
Light of what?

119
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,686
- Hello?
- Herr Blomkvist.

120
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,922
<i>- Yeah.
- Forgive me for intruding on Christmas.</i>

121
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,491
<i>My name is Dirch Frode.</i>

122
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,611
I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik
Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of him?

123
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,886
Yeah, of course I have.

124
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,481
<i>He'd love to talk to you
about a private matter.</i>

125
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,689
This is an awkward moment.

126
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,969
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down
to a Christmas dinner myself.</i>

127
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,202
No, that's not exactly what I meant.

128
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,761
You're referring
to your recent legal problems.

129
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,809
That has provided us
with much amusement.

130
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,007
I'm sorry?

131
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,731
<i>Herr Vanger has little love
for Herr Wennerström either.</i>

132
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,451
- Have him call me.
- But he would love to speak to you...

133
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,211
...in person, if possible. Up north.

134
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,362
<i>- In Hedestad.
- That's not gonna be possible.</i>

135
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,404
<i>Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old
to go to Stockholm. Please.</i>

136
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,767
Be so kind as to consider.

137
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,730
<i>Hedestad is lovely in the winter.</i>

138
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,930
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?

139
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,965
Usually when I wake up in a cold bed
it's at home.

140
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,884
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

141
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,044
- I'm writing a press release.
- Saying?

142
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,726
You're taking over as publisher,
you're very sorry...

143
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,167
...for any nuisance
Mr. Wennerström was caused...

144
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,369
...and I can't be reached for comment.
- Are you giving up?

145
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,806
Stepping aside.

146
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,889
This makes me sick.

147
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,527
- First time in Hedestad?
- And the last.

148
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,047
Oh, don't say that.
It's lovely in the spring.

149
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,965
You said it would be lovely
in the winter.

150
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,088
Well, this is unseasonable.

151
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,806
Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train
back to Stockholm.

152
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,246
Unless we get snowed in.

153
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,286
I'm joking-

154
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,330
You'll be home tonight,
if that's what you wish.

155
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,281
Welcome.

156
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,527
Come inside.

157
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,130
It's warm.

158
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,725
How do you do?

159
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,685
So...

160
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,371
...what do you know about me?

161
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,043
You used to run one of the largest
industrial firms in the country.

162
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,646
- "Used to." That's correct.
- Oh, I didn't mean that.

163
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,609
- Should I stay?
- No.

164
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,363
My grandfather forged the tracks...

165
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,682
...that the 4:30 train
will take you home on.

166
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,282
We stitched this country together.

167
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,162
We made the steel, milled the lumber
that built modern Sweden.

168
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,563
And what do you think
our most profitable product now is?

169
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,006
Fertilizer.

170
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,925
I'm not obsessed by
the declining health of the company.

171
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,686
But I am with
the settling of accounts.

172
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,201
And the clock is ticking.
I need your help.

173
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,805
I'm-- Doing what?

174
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,406
Officially, assisting
with my memoirs.

175
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,168
But what you'll really be doing...

176
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,370
...is solving a mystery
by doing what you do so well.

177
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,961
Your recent legal mishap
notwithstanding.

178
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,523
You will be investigating thieves,
misers, bullies...

179
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,210
...the most detestable collection
of people that you will ever meet.

180
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,891
My family.

181
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,283
Would you like to sit? I could possibly
clear a place if necessary.

182
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,602
- Did you make it?
- Have you something for me?

183
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,529
I am on welfare, I do not administer it.
This is not enough.

184
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,211
No, thank you.

185
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,600
<i>This is Harriet.</i>

186
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,010
The granddaughter
of my brother Richard.

187
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,564
Richard was a Nazi
of the first order...

188
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,205
...joining the Nationalist Socialist
Freedom League when he was 17.

189
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,968
Isn't it interesting how fascists
always steal the word "freedom"?

190
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,844
Oh, the 4:30. Yes, I know. Okay.

191
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,847
Anyway, Richard died a martyr
to the Nazi cause in 1940.

192
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,651
Missed all the real excitement.

193
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,130
But not the opportunity to regularly
beat his wife, Margareta...

194
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,049
...and their son, Gottfried.

195
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,924
Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father...

196
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,811
...was what they used to call
a good-time Charlie.

197
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,611
- They still call them that.
- Do they? Okay.

198
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,161
He was a charmer,
a ladies' man and a drunk.

199
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,290
In other words, a born salesman.
Which he did for the company...

200
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,171
...traveling around
and taking clients out to dinner.

201
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,641
- Well, somebody's gotta do it.
- That's right.

202
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,844
Anyway, he died in 1965.

203
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,002
Drowned, drunk, here on the island.

204
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,609
His wife, Isabella, who had been pretty
much useless as a parent before...

205
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,127
...became even more so
after his death...

206
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,965
...which is when I began
looking after the children.

207
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,124
Martin, who runs Vanger Industries,
now that I'm retired.

208
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,930
That's right, I Googled him.

209
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,286
And Harriet.

210
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,451
She was bright, curious...

211
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,884
...a winning combination
in any person.

212
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,484
- And beautiful.
- Yeah.

213
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,682
Something happened to her?

214
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,081
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet...

215
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,728
...and for the past 40 years...

216
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,003
...has been trying
to drive me insane.

217
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,443
<i>It was September 24th, 1966.</i>

218
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,404
A Saturday.

219
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,284
Harriet was 16.

220
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,601
My brothers...

221
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,445
<i>...and their wives and their children
and grandchildren...</i>

222
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,886
<i>...were all gathered here...</i>

223
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,089
<i>...for our loathsome annual
board meeting and dinner.</i>

224
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,325
<i>It was also the day the yacht club
held their autumn parade.</i>

225
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,643
<i>Harriet, with one or two school
friends, went into town to see it.</i>

226
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,883
She returned a little after 2:00.

227
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,971
<i>She came into the parlor.
She asked if she could talk to me.</i>

228
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,361
I honestly don't remember
what I was doing...

229
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,409
...that I thought
was more important...

230
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,040
<i>...but I told her
to give me a few minutes.</i>

231
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,561
It was during those few minutes
that something else occurred.

232
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,807
<i>The accident had nothing to do
with Harriet...</i>

233
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,086
...and yet everything.

234
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,285
<i>It was chaos as everybody
put down what they were doing.</i>

235
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,801
<i>Police, ambulance, fire brigade...</i>

236
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,885
<i>...reporters, photographers, onlookers
all quickly arrived from town...</i>

237
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,568
<i>...just as we on the island, the family,
hurried to the bridge from our side.</i>

238
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,165
<i>The driver of the car...</i>

239
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,890
...a man named Aronsson...

240
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,401
<i>...was pinned and severely injured.</i>

241
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,484
<i>We tried desperately
to pry him loose with our hands...</i>

242
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,041
<i>...since metal tools might spark.</i>

243
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,170
<i>It was an hour after the crash
that Harriet was in the kitchen.</i>

244
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,448
Anna herself saw her.

245
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,481
<i>Well, we finally got poor Aronsson
out of his car and off to the hospital.</i>

246
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,163
<i>Just as we from our side...</i>

247
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,364
<i>...slowly drifted back to the house.</i>

248
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,561
<i>The sun was down,
the excitement over.</i>

249
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,082
<i>We sat down to dinner.</i>

250
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,844
<i>It was then that I noticed...</i>

251
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,805
<i>...Harriet wasn't there.</i>

252
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,008
<i>And she wasn't there
the next morning.</i>

253
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,967
<i>Or the next.</i>

254
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,091
Or the next 40 years.

255
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,529
<i>What was she going to tell me?</i>

256
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,963
Why didn't I make time for her?
Why didn't I listen?

257
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,522
- And she couldn't have just run away?
- No. Not without being seen.

258
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,330
The firemen stayed out all night...

259
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,488
<i>...on the bridge
pumping up gasoline.</i>

260
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,484
<i>No one swam across
or took a boat.</i>

261
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,371
All the boats were still tied up
on this side Sunday.

262
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,126
Believe me, I checked.

263
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,123
She couldn't have just fallen
and drowned?

264
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,047
No. The currents aren't strong here.
Anything that falls in the water turns up.

265
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,486
Like her father.

266
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,041
His body didn't drift
more than 10 meters...

267
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,601
...when he drowned the year before.

268
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,923
Oh, no. Someone killed her.

269
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,731
Someone on the island that day.

270
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,882
Someone close enough to know...

271
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,443
...what she used to give me
each year on my birthday.

272
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,562
Those are from her.

273
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,522
And the rest, from her killer.

274
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,686
Who knows about these?

275
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,367
There's me, the police, the killer...

276
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,767
...and now you.

277
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,246
<i>After the police investigation
evaporated...</i>

278
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,210
<i>...I kept at it, studying
all the information there was.</i>

279
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,611
I have spent half my life
examining the events of a single day.

280
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,922
I understand your frustration...

281
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,924
...but what you're asking me to do,
it's a waste of money.

282
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,243
- But we haven't discussed your fee.
- We don't need to.

283
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,845
Thank you.

284
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,641
I can't find something
you've been unable to find in 40 years.

285
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,646
You don't know that. You have
a very keen investigative mind.

286
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,731
Here's what I propose:

287
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,644
You come stay on the island.

288
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,043
I have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use.

289
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,123
You study the material I send you.

290
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,521
You find something I've missed
or you don't.

291
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,803
What you're asking me to do
is set aside my life and career for--

292
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,008
Think of this
as a well-deserved holiday

293
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,722
A way of avoiding all those people
that you might want to avoid right now.

294
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,451
As for compensation,
I'll pay you double your salary...

295
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,284
...for as many months as it takes.

296
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,290
- Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
- Herr Vanger--

297
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,602
I'm not done.
I will throw in one more thing...

298
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,922
...even though
you're a terrible negotiator.

299
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,686
It's something you want
more than anything else...

300
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,322
...and it can't be bought at any price.
So let me give it to you.

301
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,930
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

302
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,121
He began his career
working for me...

303
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,966
...and I have followed it with interest,
shall we say, ever since.

304
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,371
You were right about him.

305
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,368
You just couldn't prove it.

306
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,362
We're in the middle of the worst crisis
ever, and you're writing a memoir.

307
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,206
- You fired me. I need something to do.
- You fired you.

308
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,402
I need you here, not the North Pole.

309
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,001
Mikael, you know
what this is going to look like.

310
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,242
Like I've been gutted.
I'm running away. I am.

311
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,290
Wennerström wants to see me
wave a white flag, not a red flag.

312
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,643
If it looks like there's a problem
between us, it'll satisfy him.

313
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,165
There is a problem between us.

314
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,931
He won't be satisfied
until he shuts us down.

315
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,565
- You're leaving me to fight him alone.
- It's four hours by train.

316
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,961
It's not the North Pole.

317
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,164
Hey, he)'-

318

<i>Network busy.
Please try again later.</i>

319

<i>Network busy.
Please try again later.</i>

320
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,485
What?

321
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,166
Some milk?

322
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,562
<i>Network busy.
Please try again later.</i>

323
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,091
Oh, yeah. These as well.

324
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,048
- You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
- His ward. He doesn't have a daughter.

325
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,445
Please.

326
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,525
<i>He's had severe
cerebral hemorrhaging...</i>

327
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,241
<i>...either from the fall itself
or from a stroke that led to the fall.</i>

328
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,329
<i>His blood pressure is still high.</i>

329
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,484
<i>I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness,
but that's not assured.</i>

330
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,961
<i>And it's possible, even if he does...</i>

331
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,930
<i>...that there will be
neurological damage.</i>

332
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,209
Oh, jeez.

333
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,284
Hi. I'm Gunnar.

334
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,447
The caretaker.

335
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,967
- Oh, hey, Gunnar. Come in.
- Okay.

336
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,171
- You want to put it in there?
- Okay.

337
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,969
You're an author.

338
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,205
Well, I'm doing a biography
of Herr Vanger.

339
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,323
- I saw you on television.
- That's unfortunate.

340
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,289
Bit of trouble, I guess.

341
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,771
- No jail time though. That's good.
- No.

342
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,926
Cost you a lot of money
though, yeah?

343
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,291
There.

344
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,002
The entire island
is owned by my family.

345
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,726
Your closest neighbor
is my brother Harald...

346
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,921
...another Nazi, if you can believe.

347
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,650
Two in the family.

348
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,964
Oh, yes, he's quite detestable,
to put it nicely.

349
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,567
But you'll probably never see him.
He's a recluse.

350
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,530
- He was there that day?
- Indeed, he was.

351
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,162
His daughter, Cecilia,
lives over there.

352
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,011
They don't speak.

353
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,771
Does anybody speak
to anybody on this island?

354
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,605
Actually, Isabella, Harriet's mother,
who lives there...

355
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,651
...she speaks to Harald, which is one
of the reasons I don't speak to her.

356
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,926
Right.

357
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,289
Cecilia's brother, Birger,
lives over there.

358
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,086
Who doesn't he speak to?

359
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,366
You, probably.

360
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,047
But you wouldn't want him to. He can
be just as unpleasant as Harald.

361
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,009
Quickly losing track
of who's who here.

362
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,167
How you'll wish it were always so.

363
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,291
Soon you will know us all
only too well. With my apologies.

364
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,646
Now, out there, my grandnephew
Martin's house, Harriet's brother.

365
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,531
- Who speaks to him?
- I speak to him.

366
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,729
He runs the company now,
as I think I told you.

367
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,604
Someone's shooting his dinner.
Gunnar, probably.

368
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,125
Oh, yes, I met him earlier.

369
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,887
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.

370
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,209
Well, he lives over there.

371
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,884
- And you live there.
- Sorry?

372
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,565
Your house.

373
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,008
Oh, yes.

374
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,244
Yes, you're right.

375
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,084
The man who hires the detective...

376
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,562
...should always be kept
on the suspects list.

377
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,810
Her mother.

378
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,967
But what about the search? Please.

379
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,010
Please. I beg you.

380
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,807
<i>The fact that I never found a body
was not surprising.</i>

381
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,884
<i>You can't dig up an entire island.</i>

382
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,361
But neither could I find the motive.

383
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,205
Was it spontaneous?
Was it calculated?

384
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,727
Did she know something
someone wished she didn't?

385
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,441
- Was it about business?
- Business? Well, she was 16.

386
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,364
And very bright.

387
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,251
Henrik told me and many others
he could easily see her...

388
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,084
...running the company one day.

389
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,325
She was with some friends
that day at a parade.

390
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,201
She told them she was feeling unwell.
She left early.

391
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,887
But they also told me
she kept secrets from them too.

392
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,647
The main thing I learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.

393
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,087
- I have one.
- Then you know.

394
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,328
I wanted to...

395
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,449
...ask you about this.

396
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,726
She received that from Henrik
the Christmas before.

397
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,170
I've studied it more times
than I can say.

398
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,885
I know every page of it.

399
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,401
- It's the last page I was curious about.
- As was I.

400
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,485
It's a list of names, numbers
and it must have some significance.

401
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,130
All local phone numbers.

402
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,567
The first belonged
to a woman, Margot...

403
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,684
...whose mother was Magda,
who denied knowing Harriet.

404
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,889
The fourth, R.L.,
belonged to Rosmarie Larsson...

405
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,931
...an elderly woman who died
some years before.

406
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,483
The other three were not connected
in any way that I could find.

407
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,323
I reminded you of things
you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry.

408
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,522
I can't forget.

409
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,644
It's my Rebecka case.

410
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,891
I don't know what that is.

411
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,282
Every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over.

412
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,486
Back then we had an
Officer Torstensson.

413
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,530
Year after year, he kept
going back to this Rebecka case.

414
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,968
Taking out the files,
studying them over and over.

415
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,168
We were young.
We laughed at him.

416
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,288
And that was also
a missing-girl case?

417
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,205
No, no, no,
that's not why I mention it.

418
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,284
I'm talking about
the soul of a policeman.

419
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,730
<i>Poor old Torstensson
never solved it.</i>

420
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,247
<i>And he never let it go.</i>

421
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,368
So how's Mr. Palmgren doing?

422
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,684
I heard he had a stroke
of some kind?

423
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,887
It's terrible.

424
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,124
Now, what exactly do you do
at this security company?

425
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,044
Make coffee, sort mail.

426
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,884
But not full-time.

427
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,084
Not even part-time consistently.

428
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,201
They somehow got along without
coffee or mail in July and August?

429
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,042
- How much do you make there?
- Enough.

430
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,881
How much is your rent?

431
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,565
I Pay my rent.

432
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,043
And when was the last time
you were late?

433
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,281
Never.

434
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,967
You think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive?

435
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,401
Here's the problem.

436
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,090
There's a discrepancy
between the obligation...

437
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,370
...of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship
and the management of your finances.

438
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,763
There's no discrepancy. It was clear
I could manage my own finances.

439
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,081
That is not clear to me.

440
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,402
- I'm not a child.
- You are not. But you were.

441
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,767
And between then and now,
you were committed...

442
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,764
...to the locked ward of St. Stefan's
where you continued...

443
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,048
...to display violent aggression.

444
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,445
And you failed to adapt
to four foster homes...

445
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,922
...were arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics...

446
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,130
...again for assault,
smashing a bottle into a man's face.

447
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,607
And it's not even that long ago.

448
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,129
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren
into thinking that you have changed...

449
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,123
...but when I'm looking at this...

450
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,251
...not to mention the way
you're looking at me now...

451
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,209
...I don't think you have.

452
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,325
So the good old
Mr. Palmgren days are over.

453
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,484
Starting now, you will be given
a monthly allowance.

454
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,961
You'll provide me with receipts
for your expenses.

455
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,329
If the numbers don't balance, I assume
the difference is going to drugs.

456
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,369
I've taken care of myself
since I was 10.

457
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,005
The state has taken care of you.

458
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,891
Miss Salander, please, look at me,
this is important.

459
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,408
Since your behavior
is elaborately documented in here...

460
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,126
...it will shock no one
if I chose an alternative...

461
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,688
...to the very lenient arrangement
I have just outlined.

462
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,324
Would you prefer
institutionalization?

463
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,321
- Mikael?
- Yes.

464
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,090
- I'm Liv.
- Oh, hi.

465
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,890
We're going to the same place.
Hop in.

466
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,451
Oh, good, thank you.

467
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,883
I found him at death's door,
halfway up the hill.

468
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,050
- I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.
- It's a climb for anyone.

469
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,601
- I should've warned you. Come in.
- Thank you, Martin.

470
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,762
Henrik says great things about you.

471
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,965
- No, no. Leave your shoes on.
- Martin? Smells wonderful.

472
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,046
- What are we drinking?
- What a place. Look at that view.

473
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,886
I used to work in the company's
petrochemical division in Göteborg.

474
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,610
When it was sold, I went with it.

475
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,046
A dark day.

476
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,643
I live in Hong Kong, but come back
to Stockholm for family events.

477
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,201
And I drive up to spend
a couple of days with Martin.

478
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,200
- It's just the moose steak she wants.
- Who can blame her? It's wonderful.

479
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,084
Something's left open.
Do you like this wine...

480
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,046
...or you want to try something else?
- No, no, it's fine.

481
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,562
You're writing a book now,
Martin said.

482
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,371
- Henrik's biography.
- I love Henrik. He's fascinating.

483
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,851
Martin too.

484
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,209
Together they are the old Sweden
and the new.

485
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,600
Yes, they are.

486
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,767
You know about Harriet, right?

487
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,449
- You don't?
- Yes, I do.

488
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,446
The family doesn't want to talk about it,
but it can't be swept under the rug.

489
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,523
- What can't?
- Harriet.

490
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,763
We can talk about it later.

491
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,090
We can talk about it now.

492
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,522
Liv knows everything
about my crazy family.

493
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,160
- That's why she'll never marry me.
- That's one reason.

494
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,322
I don't want to read
about that in the book.

495
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,767
Everything else is fine.
Harriet certainly.

496
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,801
You know,
everything changed after that.

497
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,321
Not just the family
but the company as well.

498
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,562
- How so?
- We're not Ericsson or Nordea.

499
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,247
But we're still the largest
family-owned company in the country.

500
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,608
At our height we had
40,000 employees.

501
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,040
We have half of that now.

502
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,125
And that downward slide
began after my sister's death.

503
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,969
It broke Henrik's
entrepreneurial spirit...

504
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,401
...and his heart.

505
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,962
- You were here that day?
- I came in later...

506
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,885
...after the accident on the bridge,
with the 4:30 train.

507
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,010
- I know it well.
- A terrible day.

508
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,763
And the days after, you know?

509
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,209
Searching, not finding. Even worse.

510
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,005
This event, Mikael, it has to have
a big part in your book.

511
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,326
I got a call from social welfare.

512
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,327
I've been assigned a new guardian.

513
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,765
- Hi.
- Hello.

514
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,366
I thought I'd come over
and say hello.

515
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,087
- I'm Cecilia.
- Oh, yes. Please, come in.

516
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,448
Can I get you some coffee?

517
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,887
No, thank you.

518
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,842
We are all uncomfortable with the idea
of a chronicle of our family.

519
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,805
It's not about the family.
It's about Henrik and the company.

520
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,201
Like I said.

521
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,803
It's not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone.

522
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,564
Unlike the one
that landed you in court.

523
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,969
Unlike that one, yes.

524
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,443
So you're not really here to find out
what happened to Harriet.

525
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,486
I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
but, no, that's by no means my focus.

526
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,608
Those boxes that Gunnar
carted down here...

527
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,129
...which are where, in the closet now?
Those weren't Henrik's investigation?

528
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,451
I wonder sometimes who's crazier,
my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.

529
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,650
Since we're talking about her...

530
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,007
...since you brought her up,
what was she like?

531
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,321
What was Harriet like?

532
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,165
- I'm sure Henrik has told you.
- He was my age back then.

533
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,483
He couldn't know what was
really going on with a teenager.

534
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,846
You were the same age.

535
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,923
My sister Anita
was closer to her in age.

536
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,845
She knew Harriet better than anyone.
You should talk to her.

537
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,685
- I'd love to. Where is she?
- If I had to guess, London.

538
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,163
You don't know
where your sister lives?

539
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,529
I haven't seen her in years.
We never really got along.

540
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,162
- I'm getting used to that comment.
- She hates this place more than I do.

541
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,164
She left.
Moved to London, that was it.

542
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,404
You couldn't pay her to send
a Christmas card, much less visit.

543
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,369
I'll track her down for you.

544
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,683
If you do, and try talking
to her about us...

545
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,049
...don't be surprised
if she tells you to fuck oh'.

546
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,682
You're backed up, aren't you?

547
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,686
Hard drive at home, yeah.

548
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,724
Okay. That's good,
because this one's done.

549
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,810
<i>Have you ever had any
sexually transmitted diseases?</i>

550
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,360
<i>And when was the last time
that you were tested for HIV?</i>

551
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,887
<i>How many partners have you had
in the last month?</i>

552
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,721
And how many of those were men?

553
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,289
It's regulation, I have to ask
these things. It's a health matter.

554
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,566
Write what you want.

555
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,121
And why do you need
such an expensive computer?

556
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,567
- For work.
- Making coffee, sorting mail.

557
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,724
- I should have control of my money.
- And you will.

558
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,565
Once you learn to be sociable,
get along with people.

559
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,524
Can you do that?

560
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,170
Why don't we start
with that now, huh?

561
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,886
Why don't we start with me?

562
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,564
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

563
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,763
That's what normal people do.

564
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,961
I want you to have that computer.

565
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,291
Feel that.

566
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,804
That's gabardine.

567
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,004
Unzip it.

568
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,404
And...

569
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,604
And...

570
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,128
I like the reticence.

571
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,365
It's almost convincing.

572
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,651
<i>Anita Vanger.</i>

573
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,446
- Through there.
- Thank you.

574
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,847
Excuse me.

575
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,488
I probably should have made
an appointment.

576
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,322
No, it's fine.

577
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,807
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

578
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,964
- Mikael.
- Mikael. How do you do?

579
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,645
How do you do?

580
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,326
So you're looking
for investment counseling?

581
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,323
Well, I would be if I had any money.

582
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,325
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

583
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,524
I'm writing a biography of your
Uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.

584
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,087
I haven't seen him in over 20 years.

585
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,521
Actually it's a lot more than that.

586
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,684
Haven't seen my sister,
haven't seen anyone in that family.

587
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,043
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that...

588
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,168
...so your recollections are valid.

589
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,210
I wouldn't know where to start,
if that was a question.

590
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,330
Well, then let me narrow it down.
I've gotten up to the 1960s...

591
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,087
...to the event that, you know,
changed everything in Henrik's life.

592
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,691
Harriet.

593
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,888
Everything that I know about that
I told to whatever his name was.

594
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,121
Morell.

595
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,209
My recollections
were a lot better then.

596
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,409
I'm not really speaking
about the event itself.

597
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,848
I just want to get a clearer sense
of what Harriet was like.

598
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,083
She was very messed up.

599
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,089
Well, just like all us Vanger kids,
really, but...

600
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,368
Crazy mother.

601
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,443
Drunken father.

602
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,204
At least her father wasn't a Nazi.

603
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,089
- Was he abusive?
- Mine?

604
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,651
No, hers.

605
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,488
Not that I ever saw, but you could tell
that something was going on.

606
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,891
Some days
she'd be very withdrawn.

607
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,884
And then the next minute
she'd be putting on makeup...

608
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,840
...and wearing the tightest sweater
that she had to school.

609
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,447
And then she'd be studying
her Bible like a nun.

610
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,922
No Vanger was ever religious.
Can you imagine?

611
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,726
She was obviously very unhappy.

612
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,722
- What do you think happened to her?
- Everyone knows what.

613
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,250
You don't have any thoughts
about who or why?

614
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,563
All that I know
is that I felt really sorry for her.

615
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,921
I got away when I was 18
and I never went back.

616
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,401
And she'd have done the same.

617
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,962
But she never made it to 18.

618
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,767
<i>Mr. Bjurman, please.
It's Lisbeth Salander.</i>

619
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,002
<i>Hold for a moment, please.</i>

620
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,242
<i>Lisbeth, I haven't seen you
Are you well?</i>

621
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,609
I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our
appointment, I had a lot of work.

622
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,886
<i>Something the matter?</i>

623
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,691
No, no, nothing to be
concerned about.

624
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,844
Actually, I need another advance
on my allowance.

625
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,361
Can I come to your office tonight?

626
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,649
<i>I don't work at night, Lisbeth.</i>

627
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,610
<i>Why don't you come to my house,
huh? Do you have a pen?</i>

628
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,643
I don't need a pen.
What's the address?

629
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,330
<i>It's...</i>

630
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,411
<i>- Hello?
- It's me.</i>

631
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,003
Lisbeth.

632
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,525
Come on in.

633
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,244
- You like it?
- It's nice.

634
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,766
It's home.

635
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,324
What do you need money for
this time?

636
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,561
Food.

637
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,126
How are you?

638
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,250
I'm so glad you decided
to come and visit.

639
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,444
I just want my money.

640
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,285
Well, let's see if we can
help you out with that.

641
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,010
Wait.

642
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,647
Is there a problem?

643
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,808
I just want to know...

644
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,964
...am I going to have to do this
every time I need money to eat?

645
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,925
You're so cute when you're surly.

646
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,842
I forgot to ask you:

647
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,961
You like anal sex?

648
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,043
<i>Faith is the assurance
of things hoped for...</i>

649
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,444
<i>...the evidence of things not seen.
Through faith we understand...</i>

650
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,082
<i>...that the world was created
by the word of God.</i>

651
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,926
- I'll drive you home.
- I can get home on my own.

652
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,204
Are you sure?

653
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,971
- Is it any warmer inside?
- No.

654
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,490
I apologize if you've been having
financial problems...

655
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,881
...at the magazine
during Mikael's absence.

656
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,247
- We'll work through them.
- Are you sure?

657
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,164
How long do you think
you can hang on?

658
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,486
Six months?

659
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,606
That sounds about right.

660
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,603
I used to be
in the newspaper business.

661
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,684
- We owned six dailies back in the '50s.
- We still own one.

662
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,009
<i>- The Courier, here in town.
- Which I let my nephew, Birger, run...</i>

663
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,561
...because he can't run
anything else.

664
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,206
So, what would you say
to taking on a partner?

665
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,849
Well, we've never had
to consider it before.

666
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,724
We value our independence
very much.

667
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,451
Independence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers.

668
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,002
However much you have, you retain.
We don't care about content.

669
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,323
Excuse me? Did I miss something?

670
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,084
Talking about investing
in the magazine.

671
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,205
- I gathered that. But why?
- Not out of greed, that's for sure.

672
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,604
I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away
from you at the worst possible time.

673
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,766
But now I am convinced that this is
the right thing to do. The moral thing.

674
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,004
That's one reason. And...

675
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,046
And...?

676
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,205
The enemies of my friends
are my enemies.

677
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,047
How long have you been
discussing this with them?

678
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,851
I haven't. They called yesterday
and asked me to come up.

679
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,207
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You live in the woods.

680
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,922
- I deserve to be treated like an idiot?
- I wanted to hear what they had to say.

681
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,409
You would've said no
before they could.

682
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,449
Well, I'm saying it now.
It's a bad idea.

683
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,963
You heard me tell them
we had six months. I lied.

684
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,088
We will be out of business in three.

685
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,965
But you don't know this family
like I do. They're crazy.

686
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,446
We're not marrying into it.

687
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,729
If we do this,
that's exactly what we're doing.

688
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,201
So you wanna say no, let's say no.

689
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,405
Instead of 50 percent of something,
let's own 100 percent of nothing.

690
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,005
- Mikael?
- What?

691
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,527
I'm leaving this godforsaken island
in the morning.

692
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,610
- So?
- So are you coming to bed or not?

693
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,484
How much do one of those cost?

694
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,360
Around 3000.

695
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,968
This is really gonna hurt.

696
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,721
Your call.

697
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,930
<i>Vanger Industries took a controlling
interest in Millennium magazine...</i>

698
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,163
<i>...which, according to analysts,
has been in financial trouble...</i>

699
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,722
<i>Millennium is an excellent magazine
We think it's undervalued right now.</i>

700
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,325
<i>Which is good business for us.</i>

701
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,847
Well, there's another reason.
I don't like bullies.

702
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,684
Are you referring
to Mr. Wennerström?

703
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,686
I'm referring to anyone who tries
to sue his enemies into submission.

704
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,286
<i>If Herr Wennerström
would like to try it again...</i>

705
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,848
<i>...he will find himself fighting a
company that can afford to fight back.</i>

706
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,721
<i>I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
He's a titan and a gentleman.</i>

707
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,769
<i>But he's also quite old now...</i>

708
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,527
<i>...which may explain how he could be
taken in by a convicted liar.</i>

709
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,727
Three-twenty.

710
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,009
Shit.

711
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,207
<i>The current archive is on CDs.</i>

712
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,727
<i>The older stuff, still negatives.</i>

713
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,247
What general period
are you interested in?

714
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,004
September, 1966.

715
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,330
Thank you.

716
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,491
Is this about Harriet Vanger?

717
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,964
You're too young
to know about that.

718
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,010
Everyone here grows up
knowing about her.

719
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,927
It's how we're taught
about strangers.

720
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,210
- Lisbeth.
- I need to pay my rent.

721
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,486
I need some money.

722
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,602
Oh, come on in.

723
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,887
I feel a bit badly
how we left it last time.

724
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,451
Me too.

725
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,048
Good. You're alive.

726
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,208
You recognize this? I had it with me
last time. I set it here, remember?

727
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,441
And this snap, you see it?
It's not a snap.

728
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,331
It's a wide-angle fiber-optics lens.

729
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,287
I thought it was going to be
another blow job...

730
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,249
...which is disgusting enough.

731
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,650
But I misjudged
just how sick you are.

732
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,450
Okay. Here's what's going to happen.

733
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,569
Pay attention.

734
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,041
Look at me.

735
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,049
Once you can sit again...

736
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,283
...which could be a while, I admit,
we're going to go to my bank...

737
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,051
...and tell them that I alone
have access to my money.

738
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,522
Nod. After that
you will never contact me again.

739
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,646
Each month you will prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have.

740
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,808
In it, you'll describe
how well I'm doing.

741
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,806
How "sociable" I'm becoming.
Then you will negotiate with the court...

742
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,486
...to have my declaration
of incompetence lifted.

743
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,645
If you fail, this video will spread
across the internet like a virus.

744
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,211
Nod.

745
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,961
And if anything should happen to me,
if I get run over by a car...

746
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,841
...if you run me over with a car,
this will upload automatically.

747
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,009
Nod that you understand.

748
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,643
Gabardine.

749
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,806
I'm taking the keys to this apartment
because I'll be checking on you.

750
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,841
If I find a girl in here with you, whether
she came of her own free will or not...

751
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,763
No, not the video.

752
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,084
I'll kill you.

753
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,688
Do you doubt anything I've said?

754
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,331
Do you doubt what's in the reports that
have followed me around all my life?

755
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,007
What do they say?
If you had to sum it up.

756
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,286
They say I'm insane.

757
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,923
No, it's okay,
you can nod because it's true.

758
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,610
I am insane.

759
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,891
Nod!

760
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,328
I know it's going to be hard for you
to abide by my rules.

761
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,448
The abstinence part most of all.

762
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,928
So I'm going to make it
easier for you.

763
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,481
Lie still.

764
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,608
I've never done this before.

765
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,802
And there will be blood.

766
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

767
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,761
What are you doing here?

768
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,129
On my way to Skelleftea.
I can only stay a couple of hours.

769
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,128
What's in Skelleftea?

770
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,087
Bible camp.

771
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,490
Oh, yeah.

772
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,046
I'm not dangerous.

773
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,205
It's fine, Nilla.
Whatever you want to do is fine.

774
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,044
Everybody needs something.

775
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,645
Just as long as it's not God.

776
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,649
I didn't say that.

777
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,449
I haven't been around enough to
really know what's going on with you.

778
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:29,608
And I apologize for that. But I'd never
want you not to tell me something...

779
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,127
...because you think
I might not want to hear it.

780
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,770
That's what I'm doing.

781
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,690
<i>It should've been me visiting you.</i>

782
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,729
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

783
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,002
It was nice seeing you.

784
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,851
Bye-bye

785
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,810
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

786
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,126
Thanks.

787
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,968
Oh, don't go too hard
on the Catholics.

788
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,088
- The what?
- The article you're writing.

789
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,402
Oh, I'm not writing
an article about Catholics.

790
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,444
The Bible quotes by your desk.

791
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,086
<i>I love you.</i>

792
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,160
<i>A woman who is a medium
or a sorcerer...</i>

793
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,483
<i>...shall be put to death by stoning.</i>

794
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,521
<i>If a dove is the sinner's offering...</i>

795
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,247
<i>...the priest shall wring off its head,
cleave its wings...</i>

796
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,363
<i>...and burn it upon the altar.</i>

797
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,044
- Hello?
- Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist.

798
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,565
<i>Yes, hello. How are you?</i>

799
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,371
<i>Not still freezing in Hedestad,
I hope, for your sake.</i>

800
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,490
You know that Rebecka case
you mentioned.

801
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,244
<i>Would you recall her last name?</i>

802
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,046
Of course I do.
But what has that to do with anything?

803
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,806
<i>- Nothing, probably.
- Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson.</i>

804
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,325
<i>And how was she killed?</i>

805
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,363
She was decapitated.

806
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,040
<i>Her arms were cutoff
and she was burned.</i>

807
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,522
<i>But all that happened in the 1940s.</i>

808
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,321
<i>- What have you found?
- I have to call you back.</i>

809
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,561
<i>Why--?</i>

810
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,285
- Is it Henrik?
- We were talking.

811
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,124
He rubbed his arm,
then he collapsed.

812
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,090
- Think he's gonna be okay?
- I honestly don't know.

813
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,083
- You go. Talk to you later.
- I'm sorry.

814
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,841
Evening.

815
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,282
So how is he?

816
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,920
Well, the good news is he survived.

817
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,044
How he does now, we'll have to see.

818
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,286
- He's in intensive care.
- Right.

819
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,041
- May I have one of those?
- You want a sandwich?

820
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,244
- Small Scotch.
- Sure.

821
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,805
Thank you.

822
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,802
I hate to be indelicate,
but Henrik promised me something...

823
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,167
...when I agreed to do this.
- Wennerström.

824
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,290
I need to know what he has on him.
Now. In case...

825
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,930
In case he dies?

826
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,924
- Well, that is indelicate.
- And I apologize.

827
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,651
I don't know what he has on him,
if you're asking me.

828
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,089
And he can't tell you
in the condition he's in, so...

829
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,805
We also didn't discuss who I'd report
to if something should happen to him.

830
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,803
Oh, well, you'd report to me,
of course.

831
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,962
But we both know that nothing's
going to come of this, don't we?

832
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,282
- No. No, we don't know that.
- What do you mean?

833
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,966
- I may have found something.
- You're joking.

834
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,641
What have you found?

835
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,167
The last time I reported on something
without being absolutely sure...

836
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,163
...I lost my life savings.

837
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,326
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?

838
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,683
Yes. Do you have one in mind?

839
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,002
- I can find someone.
- I know an excellent one.

840
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,844
She did the background check
on you.

841
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,001
The what?

842
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,760
Well, you don't think we can
hire just anyone...

843
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,002
...without doing
a background check.

844
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,165
I want to read that.

845
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,803
Herr Frode was kind enough
to share your report with me.

846
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,247
The investigator's name.
That is her name, yes?

847
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,211
See, I can't find any record of her,
and I'm pretty good at that.

848
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,923
- Would it matter what her name is?
- If I wanted to speak to her, yes.

849
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,122
- It's against policy.
- You sure?

850
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,362
Just like your sources.
You understand.

851
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,521
Okay.

852
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,967
Here's a name for you.

853
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,201
My sister.

854
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,010
She's also my lawyer.

855
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,571
She'll be contacting you.

856
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:11,406
There are things in here that can
only have come from one place.

857
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:18,691
The reason you can find no record of
her is because her records are sealed.

858
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,367
- She's a ward of the state.
- What's that gotta do with anything?

859
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,885
She's had a rough life.

860
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,290
Can we please
not make it any rougher?

861
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,009
Who is it?

862
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,964
It's Mikael Blomkvist.

863
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,721
- Actually, I'm not really up yet.
- May I come in?

864
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,325
Please?

865
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,327
Hi. You and I need to talk.
I've got us some breakf--

866
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,041
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you had some company.

867
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,049
Who do you think you are?

868
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,170
I'm the guy you know better
than my closest friends do.

869
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,008
Why don't you put some clothes on,
get rid of your girlfriend.

870
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,321
We need to talk.

871
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,248
I'm sorry, you have to go.

872
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,129
Okay.

873
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,208
Do you need me to stay?

874
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,927
No.

875
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,049
- Bye.
- Bye.

876
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,161
Bye.

877
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,367
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

878
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,481
I guess I must have alarmed you,
turning up like that.

879
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,961
If you touch me,
I'll more than alarm you.

880
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,610
That won't be necessary.

881
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,570
Your report, very detailed.

882
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,764
- But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.
- It wasn't meant to be.

883
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,606
When I write about people,
I try to entertain the reader.

884
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,762
Wennerström wasn't
entertained much.

885
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,163
Your boss, Armansky...

886
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,762
...yeah, he tells me you only do jobs
that interest you...

887
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,446
...so I suppose I should be flattered.

888
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,929
You gonna sit down?

889
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:56,568
He also says that you're the one
he goes to when the job is sensitive.

890
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,645
That's the word he used, "sensitive."
I'm gonna use "illegal"...

891
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,969
...because that's what it was
when you hacked into my computer.

892
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,090
No, I'm not gonna do anything
about that. I could, but I won't.

893
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,891
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna tell you a story...

894
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,806
...and if it entertains you, maybe you'll
decide to help me research further.

895
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:17,123
And if not, I'll do the washing up
and you'll never see me again.

896
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,208
Here, you should eat that.

897
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,445
What kind of research?

898
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,088
Lisbeth-- Oh, can I call you Lisbeth?

899
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,167
I want you to help me catch
a killer of women.

900
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,967
<i>I've got R.J.</i>

901
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,606
Rebecka Jacobsson.
I've got absolutely no idea...

902
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,366
...who the rest of these are
or how they're connected...

903
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,524
...to the death of a 16-year-old girl,
but they must be somehow.

904
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,002
What we've gotta do is find out who
they are, what happened to them...

905
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,164
...and what these Leviticus verses
have to do with anything.

906
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,324
- What are you doing?
- Getting started.

907
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:56,041
- You can keep talking if you want.
- Don't you need to look over these?

908
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,930
I got it.

909
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,884
Cat!

910
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,488
How'd you get in?

911
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,801
No one has asked me about
Magda in over 40 years.

912
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,450
Why would a lady like you want
to know about an awful murder?

913
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,080
- It interests me.
- Does it?

914
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,288
<i>Her husband was the first suspect.</i>

915
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,649
<i>The husband is always
the first suspect and usually the last.</i>

916
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,282
But not this time.
We moved on to a neighbor.

917
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,283
Then a vagrant.

918
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,046
Once you get to strangers,
it's only a matter of time...

919
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,761
...before you get to gypsies and you
know you're never going to solve it.

920
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,207
How exactly was she killed?

921
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,166
- Miss...?
- Salander.

922
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,166
Miss Salander. I hope you don't mind
me asking, but when did you last eat?

923
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,846
I have a high metabolism.
I can't put on weight.

924
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,642
I'm asking because it is better to look
at what I am about to show you...

925
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,131
...on an empty stomach.

926
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:21,128
<i>If a man's offering is a lamb,
it shall be a female without blemish.</i>

927
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,328
<i>He should lay his hand
upon its head...</i>

928
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,689
<i>...slaughter it, empty its blood
on the base of the altar...</i>

929
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,888
<i>...and he shall be forgiven.</i>

930
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,803
- How is he?
- He needs surgery...

931
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:39,681
...but there's no DNR in place.
So it's up to the family to decide...

932
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,684
...should the occasion arise,
whether to resuscitate or not.

933
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,010
And they're not good at decisions.

934
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,730
So how was it with Miss Salander?

935
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,884
She said yes. Do you think
I might be able to see him?

936
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:54,004
He was asleep the last time I looked,
but let me check.

937
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,685
- Thank you.
- Don't check.

938
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,162
Tell him to pack his things
and leave.

939
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,687
- Mother, please.
- Don't use that tone with me.

940
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,525
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist
works for Henrik.

941
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,365
- We should put this to a vote.
- Don't be an idiot, Birger.

942
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,841
We all know what Henrik wants.
Can we just do that?

943
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,487
Henrik is fighting for his life in there.
This is the last thing he needs.

944
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,325
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger,
there is no smoking in here.

945
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,365
Go back to Stockholm.

946
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,650
When we need a family chronicle
written by a libelist...

947
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,929
...we know who to call.

948
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,206
All right. Thanks.

949
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,888
This way, miss.

950
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,087
<i>If a woman approaches any beast...</i>

951
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,722
<i>...and lies with it, you shall kill
the woman and the beast.</i>

952
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,087
<i>Their blood shall be upon them.</i>

953
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,449
<i>My family's impossible.</i>

954
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,768
That's why the company's
such a mess.

955
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,284
I apologize for my
mother's behavior.

956
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,287
I'm used to it.

957
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,802
It has nothing to do with you.
It's between her and Henrik.

958
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,282
She lost it when my father died,
and her drinking and her...

959
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:23,040
Got so bad Henrik took me
and my sister away from her...

960
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,642
...and left her excommunicated
in the old house...

961
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,564
...on the other side of the island.

962
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,290
She hasn't forgiven him.

963
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,970
You must stay.

964
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:38,441
You're the last chance Henrik has
at some kind of resolution.

965
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,489
Put this to rest one way or another.

966
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,006
I'll keep my mother away.

967
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,442
But please, hurry.

968
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,086
Of course.

969
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,290
Lisbeth.

970
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,124
- I'll get that.
- It's okay.

971
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,365
- Martin Vanger.
- How do you do?

972
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,760
Fine.

973
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,331
- It's a girlfriend, or...?
- Assistant.

974
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,121
Thank you so much.

975
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,007
- Good night.
- Good night.

976
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,611
Problems finding the place?

977
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,882
Everyone in town knows
who and where you are.

978
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,964
That's comforting. Are you hungry?
I can make you a sandwich.

979
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,326
No.

980
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,048
I used to have a motorbike,
a Triumph.

981
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,531
I know.

982
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,887
The five cases from Harriet's list.

983
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,646
And five more she missed.
Three I'm sure of.

984
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,841
Rebecka was the first,
just as you thought.

985
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,322
The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg,
a prostitute in Kalmar...

986
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,324
...murdered in 1954,
matching Leviticus 20:18.

987
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,211
Right. "if a man lies with a woman
having her sickness...

988
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,045
...he has made naked her fountain
and she has uncovered...

989
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,611
...the fountain of her blood."

990
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,367
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death
was suffocation by sanitary napkin.

991
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,684
- Okay.
- R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957.

992
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,320
A cleaning woman
and part-time palm reader.

993
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:11,041
Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped.
Head crushed with a rock.

994
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,725
Leviticus 20:27.

995
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,723
"A woman who is a medium
or sorceress...

996
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,042
...shall be put to death by stoning."

997
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,205
- I usually like to smoke outside.
- Sara Witt, 1964.

998
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,323
Daughter of a pastor.
Tied to her bed.

999
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,086
Raped. Charred in the fire
that burned down her house.

1000
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,731
Leviticus 21:9.

1001
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:31,202
"The daughter of a priest who profanes
herself by playing the harlot...

1002
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,806
...profanes her father
and shall be burned with fire."

1003
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,684
Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960.

1004
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,241
Found in a barn.
Stabbed and raped with farm tools.

1005
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,528
The cow in the next stall
had its throat slit.

1006
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,728
Its blood was splashed on her
and hers on it.

1007
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,446
Leviticus 20:16.
"If a woman lies with any beast...

1008
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,002
...you shall kill the woman and the
beast. Their blood is upon them."

1009
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,366
Lea Persson, 1962.

1010
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,444
Found by her sister in their pet shop.
Raped, beaten.

1011
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,246
The killer uncaged the animals,
smashed the aquariums.

1012
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,249
There was a parakeet inside her.

1013
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,967
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960.

1014
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,444
A runaway. Raped, strangled.
A burnt pigeon tied around her neck.

1015
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,765
Lena Andersson, 1967. A student.
Raped, stabbed, decapitated--

1016
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,287
- Okay.
- I'm not finished.

1017
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,283
We're looking for
a serial murderer...

1018
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:17,762
...but what could that have to do
with a teenager living on an island?

1019
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,762
She was looking for him too.

1020
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,245
<i>Rape. Torture. Fire.</i>

1021
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,323
Animals. Religion.

1022
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,802
- Am I missing anything?
- The names.

1023
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,281
They're all Biblical.

1024
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,966
The first woman, the whore,
the Virgin Mary.

1025
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,841
Rebecka, Sara,
all from the Old Testament.

1026
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,082
Which means they're all Jewish.

1027
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:45,289
One thing the Vangers have more than
their fair share of, it's anti-Semites.

1028
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,645
There's one right there.

1029
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,562
I can sleep on a couch.

1030
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,044
Okay.

1031
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,801
Right.

1032
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,326
Oh, yeah, there might be
a cat somewhere.

1033
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,925
- Good night.
- Night.

1034
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,361
Harriet's name isn't.

1035
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,161
Isn't what?

1036
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,124
- Jewish.
- No.

1037
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,049
- What are you doing?
- Reading your notes.

1038
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,690
They're encrypted.

1039
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,611
Please. Have some coffee.

1040
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:50,881
Okay.

1041
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,441
Then we're gonna have
a very serious conversation...

1042
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,881
...about what's yours
and what's mine.

1043
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,406
It's amazing what you figured out
with the parade photos.

1044
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,250
Thank you.

1045
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,248
- It's too bad you don't have hers.
- Whose?

1046
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,050
Her.

1047
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,369
Can I--? Sorry.

1048
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,881
Yeah, all right.

1049
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,525
Close that.

1050
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,045
No. Not that.

1051
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,008
That's the one. Yep.

1052
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:27,722
Where the fuck's that? That's down
there, isn't it? Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah.

1053
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,570
And...

1054
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,329
What does that say there?

1055
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:37,642
- "N" something "R-S-J."
- That's "Norsjö," yeah.

1056
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,969
Then something
Something "R-I-F."

1057
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,770
"Carpentry."

1058
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,971
Well, we need to find a carpenter.

1059
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,720
Fuck!

1060
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,802
The carpentry shop is gone. I don't
even know if he worked there or not...

1061
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,163
...but if he did, maybe he used
to come in here for hardware.

1062
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,448
I don't recognize him. Sorry.

1063
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,285
Well, I had to start somewhere.

1064
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,325
I'm no detective, but 1966, I would
have started at a retirement home.

1065
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,805
This is Brannlund's kid.

1066
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,167
Do you know where I might find him?
The son?

1067
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,727
Next to his father at the cemetery.

1068
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:20,209
He was killed in an accident
on a construction site, years ago.

1069
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,604
But...

1070
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,521
...she might still be alive.
His widow.

1071
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,647
Do you know where
I might find her?

1072
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,569
<i>Please drive to highlighted route.</i>

1073
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,083
In 1966, you were in Hedestad
with your husband.

1074
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,205
Who took these?

1075
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,646
A local photographer.

1076
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,689
You were taking pictures
too that day...

1077
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,969
...and I'd love to look at them
if by some miracle you have them.

1078
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,487
It wouldn't be a miracle.
We were on our honeymoon.

1079
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,569
But Why?

1080
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:04,805
This girl here. Here, you can see
her better in the enlargement.

1081
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,440
See, that's you there.
Just after this was taken...

1082
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,082
...after she'd seen something
across the street, she was murdered.

1083
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,128
How awful.

1084
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,607
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1085
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,443
Would you mind if I made
a copy of this?

1086
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,601
No.

1087
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:54,607
I can't give you any of this stuff without
authorization from Mr. Armansky.

1088
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,444
So call him.

1089
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,445
Next time,
fill out the proper paperwork.

1090
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,966
Which one are you?

1091
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,444
Going down.

1092
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,009
How's your sex life?

1093
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,848
I didn't care much
for your last report.

1094
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,890
It felt perfunctory,
like your heart wasn't in it.

1095
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,209
Let's see a little more enthusiasm
for my recovery in next month's.

1096
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,006
Don't speak. I don't want to hear
your voice, just nod.

1097
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,162
Start looking for a shrink
you can bribe...

1098
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:04,206
...to swear under oath he can find
absolutely nothing wrong with me.

1099
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:06,522
And stop visiting
tattoo-removal websites.

1100
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,370
Or I'll do it again...

1101
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,444
...right here.

1102
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,206
- Is that dental floss?
- Yes.

1103
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,728
You're gonna sterilize that, right?

1104
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,727
Couldn't we just use tape
or something?

1105
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,245
No.

1106
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,687
What?

1107
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,921
Thank you. Jesus!

1108
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,765
- Drink.
- Okay.

1109
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,604
Just be careful. It's my eye.

1110
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,406
- Don't move.
- You're not a doctor.

1111
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,091
- Take off your wet clothes.
- What?

1112
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,411
Yeah. Thank you.

1113
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:57,444
Yeah, I think it's stopped bleeding.

1114
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:00,371
It still fucking hurts, though.

1115
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,007
Madness.

1116
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,129
I mean, madness.
This is fucking madness.

1117
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,448
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

1118
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,971
Jesus, that hurts. Fuck.

1119
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,646
This is insane.
I mean, these people--

1120
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,169
Somebody was shooting at me.
I mean, it wasn't an accident.

1121
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,328
No one's shooting at you now.

1122
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,808
You know, I'm pretty sure
this is a bad idea.

1123
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,086
Why?

1124
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,322
I'm old and we work together--

1125
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:55,767
You work with what's-her-name
and that's worked out for you.

1126
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,288
Yeah, well, I do have some standards,
believe it or not.

1127
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,446
You need to stop talking.

1128
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,849
Oh, shit.

1129
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,682
Do you want me to open a window?

1130
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,724
- I like working with you.
- I like working with you too.

1131
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,526
- It could have been a stray shot.
- Not by Gunnar.

1132
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:29,808
If he wanted to shoot him,
he wouldn't be here.

1133
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,924
And then we have poachers.
They shoot at anything that moves.

1134
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,242
Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is?

1135
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,086
This has to stop.

1136
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:38,605
Do you want to stop, Mikael?

1137
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,802
Look, I have police reports, photos...

1138
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,406
...Henrik's notes, my notes,
Lisbeth's research.

1139
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,406
What I don't have is Vanger Industries'
records. That's what I want.

1140
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,444
- Why?
- Will you authorize it?

1141
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,206
What, the private corporate records?
Well, how far back?

1142
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,449
Henrik said I could have access
to everything. This is what I need.

1143
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:00,127
- That's not what he meant.
- I'll sign a nondisclosure statement.

1144
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,651
Just a minute.

1145
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:05,931
I think Henrik would say yes.

1146
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:10,887
That's why he has me. To protect
him from himself. It's insane.

1147
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,441
What have we got to hide?

1148
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:16,321
After 120 years of business,
probably a lot.

1149
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:19,524
If this is what he needs to finish,
he should have permission.

1150
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,648
What am I looking for?

1151
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,281
Any connections between
Vanger Industries...

1152
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:31,205
...and the towns
where the women were killed.

1153
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,802
And everything about Frode.

1154
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:29,566
Your father was taking pictures
that day that no one has seen.

1155
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,291
- I'd like to take a look at them.
- So ask him.

1156
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:35,444
- I was wondering if you could do that.
- I don't speak to him.

1157
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,443
Could you make an exception
in my case?

1158
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,048
Are you afraid to be
in the same room with him?

1159
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,009
I'm not saying you shouldn't be.

1160
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,771
So you won't help me?

1161
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,690
Sorry.

1162
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,641
Please?

1163
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:58,005
- Are you finished?
- I need to know where all factories...

1164
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:01,323
...offices and projects
were from 1949 to 1966.

1165
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:03,528
- You already have everything.
- No, I don't.

1166
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:06,849
Nothing on subsidiary corporations,
partnerships or suppliers.

1167
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,844
- You'll have to do without.
- Mr. Frode said I have access...

1168
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,163
...to whatever I need. I need this
- You have access to this floor.

1169
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,367
Call him.

1170
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,006
Thank you for seeing me.

1171
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,530
Come in.

1172
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,005
- Tea?
- Please.

1173
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:10,765
Sven Olov Lindholm.

1174
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,247
Me.

1175
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,160
Handsome.

1176
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:16,889
Birger Furugard.

1177
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,405
Me.

1178
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,850
Per Engdahl.

1179
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,324
But your interest is in my more
candid photographic work.

1180
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,687
Friends, relations, that kind of thing.

1181
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,650
Please.

1182
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,047
"Blom" or "Bloom"?

1183
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,361
Blomkvist.

1184
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:03,049
I'm not a recluse.

1185
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,361
I don't close my door to anybody.

1186
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:07,567
Thank you.

1187
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,609
They just don't visit.

1188
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:11,246
Well...

1189
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,568
...perhaps if you redecorated.

1190
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:17,485
Hide the past like they do?

1191
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,642
Under a thin, shiny veneer?

1192
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,171
Like an IKEA table?

1193
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,121
I am the most honest of all of them.

1194
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:26,647
- The family?
- Sweden.

1195
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,763
Landscape?

1196
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,489
Some nice landscapes there?

1197
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,166
Who is this?

1198
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,249
The blurry one.

1199
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,805
I can't tell.

1200
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,530
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy.

1201
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,571
- That's Martin.
- Yeah.

1202
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:55,451
Handsome but useless young man.
Like his father.

1203
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,681
Like his father.

1204
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,522
- We're closing.
- Nowhere near finished.

1205
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,646
- I'm not authorized to stay late.
- I am.

1206
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,361
And I need access to everything,
including anything that's locked.

1207
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:24,205
Call Frode.

1208
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,244
Leave the keys with the guard.

1209
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,803
Come on.

1210
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,124
Shit!

1211
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:49,121
Martin?

1212
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,361
Mikael.

1213
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,570
Hi there.

1214
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,282
Your evening stroll?

1215
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,689
Yes, that's right, I...

1216
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:23,043
- How are you?
- Good.

1217
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:27,570
I stopped by the hospital
on my way home.

1218
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,484
Henrik asked me
to ask you something.

1219
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,281
What was that?

1220
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:35,364
Come on in. I'll make you a drink.

1221
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:24,971
Hello, Martin.

1222
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,205
Shut the door. It's quite windy.

1223
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,083
- What happened to you?
- When?

1224
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:37,611
Just now.

1225
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,127
I fell in the dark.

1226
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:42,851
You don't have a flashlight?
I'll get you one.

1227
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,691
I just wasn't being careful, that's all.

1228
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:54,607
How's the investigation going?

1229
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:57,287
- Nothing new to report.
- No?

1230
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:02,124
Dirch says the girl is really clever.

1231
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,564
Maybe she'll turn something up.

1232
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:09,926
Maybe.

1233
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,650
Thank you for that.

1234
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:19,802
- So, what did he say?
- What?

1235
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:22,042
You said Henrik asked you
to ask me something.

1236
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:24,242
- Well, I just did.
- What?

1237
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,880
- How's the investigation?
- Oh, yeah.

1238
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:29,003
That was his question.

1239
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,444
Do you hunt?

1240
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,244
We should go hunting
together sometime.

1241
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,845
Sure.

1242
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:48,126
Nothing at all new to report?

1243
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:49,406
No. Nothing.

1244
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,448
- I can see you're anxious.
- No.

1245
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,762
No, I mean to get home
after the walk.

1246
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,843
Yeah, well, I suppose I am.

1247
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,367
To have dinner with your girlfriend.

1248
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:00,806
Assistant.

1249
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,369
We'll have better luck with a gun.

1250
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:09,166
- I'm sorry?
- When we go hunting.

1251
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:13,210
A gun. Rather than a knife.

1252
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:18,850
I want to show you something.

1253
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:21,725
Bring your drink.

1254
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:23,450
Leave my knife.

1255
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,404
To the right.

1256
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,245
<i>Hi, leave a message. I'll call--</i>

1257
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,244
You know what's harder
than shooting someone?

1258
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,720
Just missing him.

1259
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,006
That was a very good shot
up at the cabin.

1260
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,640
It didn't work. I'm here.

1261
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,162
Mikael, it did work. You're here.

1262
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,246
Inside.

1263
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:16,728
You spilled your drink.

1264
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:30,328
Why didn't you just go home?

1265
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,490
May I?

1266
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,170
How did you do it?

1267
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,205
What did you find?

1268
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:48,121
We can talk
or we can just get on with it.

1269
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:51,207
I found a photograph...

1270
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:53,210
...no one has seen.

1271
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,521
- Of?
- You.

1272
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:57,049
In an Uppsala prep school blazer.

1273
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:59,129
What does that prove?

1274
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,248
You lied about
where you were that day.

1275
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,368
- Did I?
- Or rather, when.

1276
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:06,361
So what? People lie all the time.

1277
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:10,161
It also says that you and Lena
Andersson were schoolmates.

1278
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,049
Lena

1279
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,407
That was a long time ago.

1280
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:19,683
Where's this photo now? Is it with
all the other crap on your desk?

1281
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,411
There's a copy on my laptop.
There's another copy...

1282
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,211
...on a secure website.
- Secure website.

1283
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,409
That's a lie.

1284
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,565
How much does the girl know?

1285
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:33,564
I hope it's as much as you do.

1286
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,563
That'll make it fun.

1287
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,567
Where is she?

1288
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:39,922
Stockholm. She went this morning.

1289
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,570
That's a lie.

1290
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:44,769
She's at our offices
looking at more old crap.

1291
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:47,088
I got a call
from our archives manager.

1292
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:50,289
She was very perturbed
with this girl Lisbeth.

1293
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:52,090
I like that name.

1294
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:54,009
Lisbeth.

1295
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:58,605
So when Lisbeth leaves,
I will get a call from security...

1296
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:02,043
...so I can be at your cottage
to greet her.

1297
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:06,968
I can't thank you enough
for bringing her to me.

1298
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:09,090
Hey, he)'-

1299
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,807
So, what do you wanna know?

1300
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,601
You're a journalist,
ask me questions.

1301
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:49,728
What do I do with the girls?

1302
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:50,961
That's a good question.

1303
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,769
Well, before, I do what we're doing:

1304
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:56,281
Sit down, relax, have a drink.

1305
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,606
I like that part a lot.

1306
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:01,287
Having a chat when both of you know
that one of you is going to die.

1307
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:05,921
And afterwards, I just get rid of them,
far out at sea.

1308
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,726
Unlike my father,
who left them scattered...

1309
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:12,402
...all over the place, like trophies.
That's not very smart, if you ask me.

1310
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,929
Well, he was a loud
and garish man.

1311
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:18,167
Frankly, he got what he deserved.

1312
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:21,527
You can't be a sloppy technician
like that.

1313
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:23,921
You can't drink to excess
like he did.

1314
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:25,605
This takes discipline.

1315
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:28,686
It's a science of a thousand details.

1316
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,725
The planning, the execution.

1317
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:33,609
It's the cleanup.

1318
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:36,004
I guess I don't have to tell you...

1319
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,363
...but you're going to create
quite a mess here.

1320
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:44,043
Let me ask you something.

1321
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,806
Why don't people
trust their instincts?

1322
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:49,245
They sense something is wrong...

1323
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:51,880
...someone is walking too close
behind them.

1324
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,527
You knew something was wrong.

1325
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,524
But you came back into the house.

1326
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:59,883
Did I force you?
Did I drag you in? No.

1327
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:04,122
All I had to do was offer you a drink.

1328
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:07,127
It's hard to believe that
the fear of offending...

1329
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:12,286
...can be stronger than the fear
of pain, but you know what? It is.

1330
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:15,723
And they always come willingly.

1331
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,486
And then they sit there.

1332
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:20,166
They know it's all over,
just like you do.

1333
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:23,210
But somehow,
they still think they have a chance.

1334
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:25,328
"Maybe if I say the right thing.

1335
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:27,323
Maybe if I'm polite.

1336
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,721
If I cry, if I beg."

1337
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:32,721
And when I see the hope
draining from their face...

1338
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:35,366
...like it is from yours right now...

1339
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:37,244
...I can feel myself...

1340
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:39,086
...getting hard.

1341
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:44,969
But, you know, we're not that different,
you and I. We both have urges.

1342
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:46,770
Satisfying mine...

1343
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:49,448
...requires more towels.

1344
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:13,209
It might amuse you to know...

1345
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:18,208
...that while you were upstairs
having moose with me and Liv...

1346
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,964
...who, by the way,
finds me very conventional...

1347
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,723
...I had Irina down here in that cage.

1348
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:28,920
Who is Irina, you might ask?

1349
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:30,923
Just another girl.

1350
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:34,563
Just another immigrant whore.

1351
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,009
- Who misses them?
- Your sister wasn't.

1352
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:38,801
What?

1353
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:43,443
Your sister Harriet
wasn't just another girl.

1354
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:45,483
You found her?

1355
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,845
What happened to her?

1356
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,526
You killed her.

1357
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:01,043
You useless fucking detective.

1358
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:09,924
This too tight to talk?
Good. I'm tired of talking to you.

1359
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:49,203
I've never had a man in here before.

1360
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,329
In fact, I've never touched a man...

1361
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:59,403
...except my father.

1362
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:03,008
That was our duty.

1363
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:06,322
Harriet's and mine.

1364
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:21,406
Hey.

1365
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,331
There's a gun.
There's a gun on the television.

1366
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:49,368
- May I kill him?
- Yeah.

1367
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:01,683
How come a 23-year-old...

1368
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,571
...is a ward of the state?

1369
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:11,810
I'm mentally incompetent
and can't manage daily life.

1370
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:17,011
Since when have they said that?

1371
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:19,885
Since I was 12.

1372
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,169
What happened when you were 12?

1373
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:30,920
I'm sorry,
that's none of my business.

1374
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:35,129
I tried to kill my father.

1375
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,362
Burned him alive.

1376
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,130
Got about 80 percent of him.

1377
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,683
I made some coffee.

1378
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:59,730
- Who's that?
- It's Harriet.

1379
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:03,566
I found it in Martin's basement
among his souvenirs.

1380
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:06,849
No, Martin didn't deny
killing anyone.

1381
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:11,362
But when I mentioned Harriet,
he was confused.

1382
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:15,889
He got angry at me because I couldn't
tell him what had happened to her.

1383
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,804
He didn't kill her.

1384
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:22,725
His father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.

1385
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:27,486
What if she did somehow manage
to get away?

1386
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:29,561
I mean, if...

1387
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:33,521
...she is still alive...

1388
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:38,964
...then there's only one person in this
family who'd know where she is.

1389
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:08,440
Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.

1390
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:30,324
Your turn.

1391
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,290
Right.

1392
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:34,485
Here.

1393
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:54,883
Hi. Look, I'm sorry to bother you.

1394
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:56,121
What do you want?

1395
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,685
- Has no one called you?
- About?

1396
02:12:58,120 --> 02:12:59,645
Your cousin Martin.

1397
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:04,489
- What about him?
- He died in a car accident...

1398
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,484
...last Thursday. There's going
to be a memorial in Hedestad.

1399
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:10,291
I'm not interested in any memorial.

1400
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:12,727
- Well, I understand.
- What do you understand?

1401
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:15,571
Well, that you don't care
very much for your family.

1402
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:19,088
- Look, I just thought you should know.
- Now I know.

1403
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,411
How'd it go?

1404
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:32,443
Okay, I think.

1405
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:33,931
She's on.

1406
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:43,810
And she's shopping.

1407
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,922
She's still playing solitaire?

1408
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:58,282
- And she hasn't called anyone?
- No.

1409
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:00,721
We have her cell phone too?

1410
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:04,327
I was so sure
she was gonna lead us to her.

1411
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:06,881
Put your hand back in my shirt.

1412
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:12,241
There's only one reason
she hasn't called Harriet.

1413
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:15,808
She can't. Because Harriet is dead.

1414
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:19,090
I was just thinking that--

1415
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:21,442
- Just one second.
- Okay.

1416
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:37,322
What were you going to say?

1417
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:41,322
I was just thinking,
there could be one other possibility.

1418
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:49,771
Well, we could, absolutely.

1419
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:53,246
What is it now?

1420
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:56,051
Before he died,
your brother hung me from a hook...

1421
02:14:58,640 --> 02:15:00,085
...Harriet.

1422
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:04,805
So you sent the flowers.

1423
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,008
Yes, I did.

1424
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:10,886
We found in the Swedish Family
Registry that Anita was married.

1425
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:14,129
- But the family never knew, did they?
- No.

1426
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:17,727
So I'm guessing she then came here
on her married-name passport...

1427
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:20,161
...and you followed
on her maiden-name passport.

1428
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,687
No, actually,
it was the other way around.

1429
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:27,044
She thought that it was safer
if I traveled with Spencer myself.

1430
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:29,487
Well, what did he think about that?

1431
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:32,684
Nothing. Only that he loved her.

1432
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:37,285
She said, "if you love me,
you'll do this and not ask why."

1433
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:39,050
And he never did.

1434
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:40,929
And they both died 20 years ago.

1435
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:42,320
Car accident.

1436
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:44,881
You found that out too.

1437
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,610
Is that you?

1438
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:02,041
I was 14 the first time he raped me.

1439
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,326
Martin.

1440
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:05,130
No, my father.

1441
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:09,764
Martin only started after he had died.

1442
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:13,811
- Well, why didn't you tell somebody?
- I did. My mother.

1443
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:17,043
- Henrik would've done something.
- I almost told him.

1444
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:19,567
But I was afraid
because of what I'd done.

1445
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:23,847
- I...
- You still don't understand, do you?

1446
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:27,685
A year after the first time...

1447
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:32,368
...and there were many times
during that year...

1448
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:36,642
...my father got drunker
than usual one night...

1449
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:43,682
...and he started bragging
about the women he'd killed.

1450
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:47,043
He quoted from the Bible
as he tore my clothes off.

1451
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:50,445
<i>He tied a belt around my neck.</i>

1452
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:53,046
He wanted to kill me.

1453
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:57,247
I got out of the house.

1454
02:16:58,520 --> 02:16:59,646
<i>I went down to the dock.</i>

1455
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:02,884
He came staggering after me.

1456
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:06,682
I could never fight him off
in a small space...

1457
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:09,726
<i>...but out in the open...</i>

1458
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:13,250
...I was strong enough
to deal with an old drunk.

1459
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:18,882
When it was over...

1460
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:25,007
<i>...I looked up and Martin was
standing there, staring at me.</i>

1461
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:30,640
And all I'd accomplished was
substitute one for another.

1462
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:37,842
<i>A couple of months later, Henrik
sent Martin to school in Uppsala.</i>

1463
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:43,166
And I thought that maybe, just maybe,
the nightmare was finally over.

1464
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:47,962
<i>And then I saw him
the day of the parade...</i>

1465
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:50,090
<i>...across the street.</i>

1466
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:55,568
<i>And I knew
that it would never be over.</i>

1467
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,445
So how did you escape?

1468
02:17:57,720 --> 02:18:00,121
Anita. She...

1469
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:03,325
She insisted
that I leave everything behind.

1470
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:08,444
If I took anything the police might have
suspected that I was still alive.

1471
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:14,366
<i>As everyone ate dinner, I was no more
than 20 meters away from them.</i>

1472
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:19,046
<i>I spent the night there.
That's when the search started.</i>

1473
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:22,366
<i>In the morning, she came to get me.</i>

1474
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:27,241
<i>I'd grown up with that bridge
as my link to home...</i>

1475
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,490
<i>...but all I could think is...</i>

1476
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:32,887
...if I could just
get away from them...

1477
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:36,641
<i>...just get past the police...</i>

1478
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:39,282
<i>...then I might be safe.</i>

1479
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:43,641
<i>And I was.</i>

1480
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:46,683
Until you showed up.

1481
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:49,526
You're safe now.

1482
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:54,004
How did you get away?

1483
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:57,842
Someone saved me too

1484
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,165
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

1485
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:13,930
Thank you, Anna.

1486
02:19:15,440 --> 02:19:18,523
I made you a promise...

1487
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:23,287
...whether you found anything or not.

1488
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:29,646
So, what do you have to tell me?

1489
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:43,089
What's this?

1490
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:02,408
Hello, Henrik.

1491
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:24,767
I barely remember Wennerström
working here, much less being fired

1492
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:27,048
How could you?
It was such a long time ago...

1493
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:30,727
...which is kind of more to the point than
the money he embezzled from you.

1494
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:33,360
You're referring
to the statute of limitations...

1495
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:36,569
...but I had no idea this is what
Henrik was holding out.

1496
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:39,405
If I had, I never would've let him
bring you up here.

1497
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:41,125
He wasn't trying to deceive you.

1498
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:43,965
He knows you can't try somebody
35 years after the event.

1499
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:47,687
- I like Henrik, but he knows that.
- A man's reputation means something.

1500
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,764
He believes that. He thought
you could destroy Wennerström...

1501
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:54,043
...in the court of public opinion.
- The court of public opinion...

1502
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:57,204
...celebrates people's bad behavior.
- He's an elderly man.

1503
02:20:57,360 --> 02:20:59,931
He promised me
Wennerström's carcass on a plate.

1504
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:01,969
This isn't even the plate.

1505
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:05,363
- I can't do anything with this.
- Yes, of course.

1506
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:11,121
What happened with Wennerström?

1507
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:12,641
How did he get you?

1508
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:18,122
I was stupid. I heard something.
I got it from an anonymous source...

1509
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:21,449
...who I'm now sure
was one of Wennerström's lackeys.

1510
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:24,165
It was fake.

1511
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:26,801
Which he easily proved in court.

1512
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:29,645
You were emphatic
that the way I looked into your life...

1513
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:33,168
...was illegal and immoral. Would you
feel the same about Wennerström?

1514
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:36,164
- Go on.
- I did some work on my own on him...

1515
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:38,846
...before you hired me.
I haven't looked at it all...

1516
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,207
...because you
and Harriet-fucking-Vanger...

1517
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:42,486
...have kept me busy.

1518
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,924
But I may have something.

1519
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:48,009
You may have something?

1520
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:50,526
Maybe.

1521
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:52,842
They launder money
from arms and drug sales...

1522
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,843
...and crime syndicates in Russia.

1523
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,169
And that money accounts for all
but 5 percent of his holdings.

1524
02:21:58,360 --> 02:22:00,727
The rest ends up in accounts
in the Cayman Islands.

1525
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:03,844
- And how do you know this?
- This time you don't want to know.

1526
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,162
This time I do want to know.

1527
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:08,245
I have access to his computer.

1528
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:12,049
- And his accountant's and lawyer's.
- And how do you have that?

1529
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:14,043
I could've gotten it from a source
inside the company.

1530
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:16,043
- You didn't.
- But that's what you'll say.

1531
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:18,009
And what will you say to me?

1532
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:20,242
Well, that depends
if you really want to know.

1533
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:23,370
I do.
Mikael, how did you get access?

1534
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,562
<i>Financial journalist
Mikael Blomkvist...</i>

<i>...the company that sued him,
the Wennerström Group...</i>

1541
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:53,561
The shit hits the fan.

1542

<i>...Of criminal activities

What happens now?

1544
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:01,363
Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta,
which won't wash.

1545
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:04,091
The police will investigate,
Fl will investigate.

1546
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:06,720
It'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.

1547
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:09,209
You think?

1548
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:10,407
Probably not.

1549
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:12,929
These guys never do.

1550

1551
02:23:26,440 --> 02:23:28,841
- It's embarrassing.
- Tell me.

1552
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,570
I need to borrow some money.

1553
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,125
Fifty thousand.

1554
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:38,488
I have a chance to make an investment.
It's a smart, safe investment.

1555
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:41,962
- I really don't think I've got 50,000.
- Yes, you do.

1556
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:45,522
You have 65,000
in your two accounts.

1557
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:47,882
I'm sorry that I know that.

1558
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:51,169
You'll get the money back,
I promise.

1559
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:54,164
Okay.

1560

Okay.

from this so-called journalist...</i>

1566

a securities investigation...</i>

1570
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:28,847
<i>...but an organized-crime inquiry
as well.</i>

1571

<i>Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.</i>

1572

- Those closest to Mr. Wennerström.</i>

- At home, I imagine</i>

1579
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:50,887
<i>No, he's not.
Has he left the country?</i>

1580
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:52,605
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1581

- Thank you.

Thank you.

1593
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:26,964
- Naturally, you have the clearing codes.
- Naturally.

1594
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:29,884
How many accounts
will you transfer?

1595
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:31,121
Thirty.

1596
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,288
- This will take some time.
- You will receive 4 percent commission.

1597
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:39,441
- I will.
- Then it won't be a waste of it.

All 50, into five accounts.
