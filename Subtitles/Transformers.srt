1
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,485
<i>Before time began, there was the Cube.</i>

2
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,151
<i>We know not where it comes from,</i>

3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,495
<i>only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.</i>

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,094
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

5
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,671
<i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i>

6
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:19,336
<i>but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.</i>

7
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,577
<i>And so began the war,</i>

8
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,710
<i>a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,</i>

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,953
<i>and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.</i>

10
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,360
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,</i>

11
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>searching every star, every world.</i>

12
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us</i>

13
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,980
<i>to an unknown planet called Earth.</i>

14
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,255
<i>But we were already too late.</i>

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,795
Oh, God, five months of this.

16
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,397
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,534
<i>A plate of mama's alligators étouffée.</i>

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,805
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,076
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

20
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,482
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,644
I understand.

22
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,521
English, please. English.

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,323
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

24
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,625
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,663
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,798
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,638
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,780
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,375
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

31
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,454
Shut up!

32
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,375
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

34
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,570
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,878
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,147
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,149
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

38
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,521
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,220
- Water?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,895
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,371
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

42
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,606
<i>Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.</i>

43
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,516
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,453
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,393
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

46
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:33,037
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,267
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,577
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,239
<i>Tail 4500 X-ray.</i>

50
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,748
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,912
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

53
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,990
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,591
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

55
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,027
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,265
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

57
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,268
<i>- My ladies!
- Look.</i>

58
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,373
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,606
<i>Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.</i>

60
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,439
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,677
I know that people say that all the time,

62
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,152
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,018
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,717
<i>- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.</i>

65
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,761
<i>You sure she didn't just fart?</i>

66
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,659
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,255
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

68
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,670
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,405
<i>Bogie's on the deck.</i>

70
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,014
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,682
<i>- Will?
- Sarah?</i>

73
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,623
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,322
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

75
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,398
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

76
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,765
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

77
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,619
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

78
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,855
My God.

79
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,143
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

80
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,344
Go! Move! Move!

81
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,983
It's going after the files!

82
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,454
Cut the hard lines!

83
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
I need a key! It's locked!

84
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,022
Move! Move!

85
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,735
Here, come here! Come here!

86
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,781
Here, hide in here!

87
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,986
Oh, my God. Okay.

88
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,647
No!

89
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,428
Oh!

90
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,236
What the...

91
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,947
Epps, let's go!

92
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,403
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

93
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,140
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

94
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,437
Watch.

95
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,545
Okay.

96
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,242
For my family...

97
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,785
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

98
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,056
Okay.

99
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,183
So, for my family genealogy report,

100
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,422
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

101
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,766
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
Very famous explorer.

103
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:35,796
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

104
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:43,104
<i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.</i>

105
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

106
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,723
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

107
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,656
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

108
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,164
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

109
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,364
So that's the story, right?

110
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,665
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

111
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,603
used by 19th-century seamen.

112
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,910
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

113
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,308
It's all for sale, by the way.

114
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:18,111
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

115
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,683
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

116
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,516
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

117
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,853
Are you going to sell me his liver?

118
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,552
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

119
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,753
I don't think your grandfather would be

120
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,090
particularly proud of what you're doing.

121
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,428
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

122
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,592
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

123
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,033
Cold hard cash works, too.

124
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,435
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

125
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,870
- Sam!
- Sorry.

126
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,803
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

127
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,744
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

128
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,008
drawing these strange symbols

129
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,584
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

130
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,346
that he thought he'd discovered.

131
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,287
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

132
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,689
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

133
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,125
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

134
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,789
Okay. Pretty good, right?

135
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
I'd say a solid B-.

136
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,826
A B-?

137
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,963
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

138
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,234
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

139
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,570
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

140
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,009
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

141
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,670
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

142
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,409
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

143
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
And a man's promise to that boy.

144
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,218
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

145
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

146
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,818
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

147
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,987
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

148
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,891
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

149
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,633
Yes! Yes, yes.

150
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,140
So?

151
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,441
A-. It's an A, though.

152
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

153
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,105
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

154
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,110
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

155
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
Yeah, a little surprise.

156
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,081
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

157
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,547
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

158
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,594
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

159
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,959
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

160
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

161
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,297
a Porsche for your first car?

162
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

163
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,199
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

164
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,815
- Manny!
- What?

165
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,377
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

166
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,577
He's having a heat stroke again.

167
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,744
Scaring white folks.

168
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,754
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

169
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,184
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

170
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,850
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

171
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,326
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

172
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,897
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

173
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
<i>- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.</i>

174
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,527
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

175
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,399
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

176
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

177
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,069
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

178
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,233
Gentlemen.

179
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,110
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

180
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,306
How can I help you?

181
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,179
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

182
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,179
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

183
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,657
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

184
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,125
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

185
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,090
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

186
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

187
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,232
The car'll pick the driver.

188
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,137
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

189
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,143
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

190
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,773
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

191
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,544
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

192
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,714
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

193
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:52,353
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

194
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,897
This ain't bad.

195
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,226
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

196
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,667
It got racing...

197
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,170
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

198
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,036
I don't know nothing about this car.

199
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,370
- Manny!
- What?

200
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,070
What is this? This car! Check it out!

201
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,670
<i>I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!</i>

202
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,273
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

203
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,908
Feels good.

204
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,483
- How much?
- Well,

205
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,453
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

206
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,359
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

207
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,525
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

208
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
It's custom faded?

209
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,533
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

210
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,437
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

211
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,434
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

212
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

213
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,409
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

214
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,678
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

215
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

216
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,615
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

217
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,749
This is a classic engine right here.

218
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,191
I sold a car the other day...

219
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,663
Gee. Holy cow.

220
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,198
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

221
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,066
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

222
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,831
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

223
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,066
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

224
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,109
<i>...greater than man...</i>

225
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,304
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

226
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,530
$4,000.

227
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,336
Steve.

228
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,345
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

229
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,941
They're so young.

230
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,178
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

231
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,550
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

232
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,022
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

233
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,123
I am so underdressed.

234
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

235
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,761
Please be seated.

236
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,798
I'm John Keller.

237
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,170
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

238
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,443
<i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i>

239
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,742
<i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.</i>

240
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,213
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

241
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,918
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

242
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,149
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

243
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,693
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

244
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,662
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

245
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

246
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,161
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

247
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

248
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,010
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

249
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,587
and intercept further communications,

250
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,486
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

251
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,789
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

252
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,492
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

253
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,192
The President has dispatched
battle groups

254
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,464
<i>to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.</i>

255
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,198
<i>Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.</i>

256
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,207
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

257
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,833
Good luck to us all.

258
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,723
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

259
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,422
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

260
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,654
Zero bids.

261
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,430
Great. Broke.

262
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,901
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

263
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,203
No. Premature.

264
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,638
Good. What's up?

265
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,575
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

266
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
It's like clockwork.

267
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,774
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

268
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,943
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

269
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

270
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,552
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

271
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,854
This one is wobbly.

272
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,057
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

273
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,291
- Sam...
- What?

274
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
I do not like footprints on my grass.

275
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,264
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

276
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,066
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

277
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,300
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

278
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,502
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

279
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,704
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

280
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,974
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

281
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,640
That's his bling.

282
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,951
I want you home at 11:00!

283
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,918
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

284
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,148
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

285
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,485
Seat belt on!

286
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,458
Wow. You are so cheap.

287
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,569
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

288
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,973
<i>At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.</i>

289
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,484
Oh, my God.

290
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,</i>

291
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,647
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

292
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,685
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

293
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
that we have not come across before.

294
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
<i>But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...</i>

295
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,226
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

296
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,059
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

297
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,032
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

298
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

299
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

300
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,906
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

301
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,311
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

302
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,574
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

303
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,653
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

304
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,717
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

305
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

306
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,019
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

307
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,496
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

308
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,464
It looked right at me.

309
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

310
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,007
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

311
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

312
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,538
<i>- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

313
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,615
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

314
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

315
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,012
All right, let's hit it.

316
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,788
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

317
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,760
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

318
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh, my God.

319
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,329
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

320
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,994
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

321
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,071
Okay.

322
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,740
Hey, guys, check it out.

323
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,213
Oh, hi.

324
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,409
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

325
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,615
So, what are you guys doing here?

326
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,225
We're here to climb this tree.

327
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

328
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,397
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

329
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,467
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

330
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,333
Let's go call your mom.

331
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,339
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

332
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,137
I was researching a book I was writing.

333
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,541
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

334
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

335
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,145
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

336
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,483
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

337
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,752
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

338
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,419
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

339
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,222
That's funny.

340
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,024
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

341
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,099
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

342
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,263
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

343
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,967
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

344
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
What are you doing?

345
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,270
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

346
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,814
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

347
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,181
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

348
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,255
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

349
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,348
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

350
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,694
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

351
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,299
Okay.

352
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,200
You'll call me.

353
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,509
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

354
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,101
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

355
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,113
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

356
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,843
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

357
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

358
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,948
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

359
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,453
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

360
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,183
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

361
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,088
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

362
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,524
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

363
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
Bros before hos.

364
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,692
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

365
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,786
You can't do this to me.

366
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,991
You got to get out of my car right now.

367
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,274
<i>Who's gonna come around
when you break?</i>

368
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,242
Mikaela! It's Sam.

369
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,368
Witwicky.

370
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,040
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

371
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,115
You sure?

372
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,979
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

373
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,542
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

374
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,783
There you go.

375
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,897
So...

376
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,168
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

377
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,234
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

378
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,367
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

379
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,710
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

380
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,808
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

381
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,446
for tight abs and really big arms.

382
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,117
Big arms?

383
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,857
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

384
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,453
Like, I just put in that light there.

385
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,991
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

386
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
Yeah.

387
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,510
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

388
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,443
Oh, no, no.

389
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

390
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

391
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,582
Yeah, a long time.

392
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,586
Well, do we have any classes together?

393
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,246
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?

394
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,848
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

395
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,222
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

396
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,764
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

397
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,526
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

398
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,328
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

399
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,869
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

400
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,870
No, no, no. No. Come on.

401
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,677
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

402
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,240
<i>When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing</i>

403
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,079
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

404
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,880
<i>Sexual healing</i>

405
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,217
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

406
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,292
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

407
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,792
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

408
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,590
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

409
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,028
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

410
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,463
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

411
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,627
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

412
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,231
<i>I feel good</i>

413
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,738
Just pop the hood.

414
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,370
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

415
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,041
Whoa, nice headers.

416
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,705
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

417
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,216
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

418
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,546
Double-pump?

419
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,349
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

420
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,119
I like to go faster.

421
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:32,160
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

422
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,093
Yeah? How'd you know that?

423
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:40,227
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

424
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,774
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

425
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,070
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

426
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,166
Oh, my God.

427
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,837
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

428
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,973
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

429
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,711
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

430
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,686
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

431
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,347
I prefer it, actually.

432
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,323
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

433
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,622
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.

434
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,165
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

435
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,028
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

436
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,799
Good luck with your car.

437
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,266
All right.

438
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,310
Walking's healthy, right?

439
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,674
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

440
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,346
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

441
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,284
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

442
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,855
<i>Baby come back
any kind of fool could see</i>

443
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,219
Hey!

444
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,256
<i>There was something
in everything about you</i>

445
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,458
<i>Baby come back
you can blame it all on me</i>

446
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,900
Hey!

447
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,167
Wait a second!

448
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,800
<i>I was wrong
and I just can't live without you</i>

449
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,971
There it is.

450
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,450
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

451
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,184
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

452
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,485
I think you're... No, no, no.

453
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,195
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

454
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,135
Okay.

455
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,104
Yeah.

456
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,730
All right, I'll see you at school.

457
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,899
All right.

458
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,281
That's stupid.

459
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,640
That was a stupid line.

460
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,549
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

461
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,321
Oh, God.

462
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,317
Oh, my God. I love my car.

463
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:58,867
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

464
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,640
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

465
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,513
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

466
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,213
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

467
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,722
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

468
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,885
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,</i>

469
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,190
<i>we'll know just what to do with them.</i>

470
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,893
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

471
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,309
<i>Apparently, there are
very few survivors.</i>

472
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,612
Yes, Mr. President?

473
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,655
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

474
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,862
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

475
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,198
Shoot.

476
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,903
Gross.

477
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,769
Do you hear that?

478
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,304
Are you getting this?

479
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,942
I think they're hacking
the network again.

480
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,293
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

481
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,233
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

482
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,328
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.

483
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,748
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

484
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,377
We need a senior analyst.

485
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,352
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

486
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,981
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

487
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,289
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

488
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,919
Code Red. We have a breach.

489
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,760
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

490
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,631
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

491
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,640
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

492
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,870
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

493
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,675
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

494
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,774
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

495
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,204
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

496
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,776
What the...

497
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,650
<i>Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

498
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,586
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

499
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
I want our President in that bunker.

500
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,803
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

501
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,007
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

502
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,242
Air Force One is on the ground.

503
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,977
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

504
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,376
That's my car!

505
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,152
No!

506
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,383
No, no, no, no.

507
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,026
Dad, call the cops!

508
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,932
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

509
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,772
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

510
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,336
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

511
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,246
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

512
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,013
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

513
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,211
Oh, my God.

514
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,036
My name is Sam Witwicky.

515
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,075
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

516
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,906
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

517
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,378
<i>and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.</i>

518
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,473
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

519
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,212
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

520
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,288
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

521
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,094
No! No! No! No!

522
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,004
Oh, my God.

523
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,099
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

524
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,402
Oh, my God.

525
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:55,414
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

526
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,687
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

527
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,123
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

528
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,363
Listen, listen, listen.

529
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,796
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

530
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,458
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

531
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,628
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

532
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,302
Put your head on the hood.

533
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,318
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

534
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,949
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

535
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,687
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

536
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,923
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

537
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,660
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

538
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,759
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

539
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,395
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

540
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,564
It's become the system.

541
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,837
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

542
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,536
The only countries
with this kind of capability

543
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,943
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

544
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,983
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

545
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,314
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

546
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,251
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

547
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,483
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

548
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,622
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

549
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,356
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

550
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,126
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

551
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,963
would take 20 years to do that.

552
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,537
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

553
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,970
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

554
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,566
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

555
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,044
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

556
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,411
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

557
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,711
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

558
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,151
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

559
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,746
What about an organism?
A living organism?

560
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,257
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

561
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,023
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

562
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,057
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

563
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,498
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

564
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,093
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

565
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,141
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

566
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,050
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

567
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,318
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

568
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,551
Wow. That's really neat.

569
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,786
Okay, chiefie.

570
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,957
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

571
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,862
What are you rolling?

572
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

573
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,767
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

574
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,368
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

575
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,235
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

576
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,973
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

577
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,213
What was that?

578
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,051
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

579
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,683
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

580
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,993
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

581
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,629
Are you on drugs?

582
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,440
Let's hope this telephone line works.

583
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,449
Hey, heads up!

584
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,180
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

585
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
What the heck was that?

586
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,098
English, dude. English.

587
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,634
Whoa!

588
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,800
Watch out!

589
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,552
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!

590
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,711
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

591
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,948
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

592
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,462
Get up! Get up! Come on!

593
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,371
Go! Move it!

594
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,782
Take cover!

595
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,151
Fig! Cover the rear!

596
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:36,699
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

597
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,827
Come on! Give me a mag!

598
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,663
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

599
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,865
Papa!

600
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,738
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

601
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,210
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!

602
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,905
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

603
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,277
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

604
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,350
Fire!

605
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,145
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

606
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,745
It's an emergency Pentagon...

607
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,752
I don't have a credit card!

608
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,959
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

609
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,761
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

610
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:15,168
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

611
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,804
Ammo!

612
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,537
I need a credit card!

613
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,277
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

614
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,646
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

615
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:32,950
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

616
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,952
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

617
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,051
Okay, it's Visa.

618
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,557
Also, sir, have you heard about

619
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,756
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

620
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:46,997
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

621
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,269
Give me a status.

622
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,236
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

623
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,040
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

624
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,113
Survivors?

625
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,612

Man, if you seen this shit...

Hey! Make way!

632
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,111
- What is that?
- I don't know.

633
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,088
We need air support
and we need it now.

634

- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.

671
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,834
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

672
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,606

- Glen! Who is it?

673
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,840
Shut up, Grandma!

- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?

675
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,578
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,083
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.

Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

678
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,036
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?

679
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,971
Yeah. Get low.

680
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:22,244
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

681
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,177
Hey. I need a moment.

682
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,513

- Sorry.

Hey, man, save my game.

684
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,651
How classified?

685
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,050
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

686
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,294
Yes! One quick peek.

687
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:42,259
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

688
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,891
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

689
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,560
The rangers are en route
with the imager,

690
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,570
but we also have a security issue.

691
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,936
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

of the network intrusion signal.

693
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:59,011
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

694
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,448
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

695
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,110
in less than a minute.

696
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,415
- No way.
- Yeah.

697
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:11,327
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

698
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,025
"Project Iceman"?

699
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,537
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

700
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,406
Are you playing
those video games again?

701
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,601
Cops! Cops!

702
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,408

703
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,344

705
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,448
Lock it down.

706
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,048
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

707
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,722
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

708

<i>towards North Korea.</i>

716
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,317
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

717
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,686
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

718
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,817
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?

719
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,829
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

720
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,729
Stop!

721
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,569
No, no, no, no, no, no.

Hi.

725
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,654
That was... That was really awesome.

726
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,852
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?

727
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,952
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

728
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,928
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

729
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,262
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,725
Oh, great. Cops.

Okay.

Oh, God, no! No!

744

Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

- I don't want to.

760
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,485
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

761
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,963
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

762
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,908
Go, go, go, go!

763
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,313
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

764
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,976
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

765
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,384
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

766
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,421
Oh, my God! No!

767
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,821
We're gonna die!

768
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,230
Oh, my God!

769
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,776
We're locked in.

770
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,723
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

771
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,722
Okay.

772
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,765
Time to start.

773
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,428
He's got me! Oh, God!

774
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,838
He's going to kill me!

775
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,639
No. No, no, no!

776
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,421
Get off!

777
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,100
Kill it! Kill it!

778
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,769
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

779
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,587
Not so tough without a head, are you?

780
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,993
Here, come on.

781
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,310
What is it?

782
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,146
It's a robot.

783
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,846
But like a...

784
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,476
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

785
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,288
It's probably Japanese.

786
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,790
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

787
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,089
What are you doing?

788
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,893
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

789
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,298
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

790
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,803
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

791
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,337
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

792
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,935
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

793
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,578
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

794
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,245
<i>- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...</i>

795
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,914
<i>Digital cable brings you...
... Columbia Broadcasting System...</i>

796
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,786
So you... You talk through the radio?

797
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,792
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.</i>

798
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,885
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

799
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,463
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain...</i>

800
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,624
<i>Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...</i>

801
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,702
<i>Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!</i>

802
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,929
Visitors from heaven? What...

803
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,165
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

804
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,470
<i>Any more questions you want to ask?</i>

805
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,310
He wants us to get in the car.

806
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,819
And go where?

807
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,584
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

808
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,783
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

809
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,985
This car's a pretty good driver.

810
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,251
I know.

811
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,896
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

812
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,191
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

813
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,357
Yeah.

814
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,269
You're right.

815
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,774
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

816
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,708
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

817
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,180
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

818
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,841
- Yeah.
- Okay.

819
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,311
There, see? That's better.

820
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,021
- Okay.
- Okay.

821
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,094
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

822
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,132
Thank you.

823
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,328
You know what I don't understand?

824
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,496
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

825
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,200
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

826
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,940
Whoa! Whoa!

827
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,809
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

828
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:05,972
Move it, you moron!

829
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,107
Great, now... See?

830
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,645
Fantastic.

831
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,618
Now you pissed him off.

832
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,389
That car is sensitive.

833
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,686
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

834
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,931
What?

835
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,069
This is you...

836
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,110
Oh, my God!

837
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,048
Come on, let's go.

838
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,157
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

839
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,721
<i>This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!</i>

840
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,061
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

841
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,676
Whoa! Sweet!

842
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,911
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

843
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,282
'cause he is so boned!

844
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,523
What is that?

845
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,652
There's something in the tree, dude.

846
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,889
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

847
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,329
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

848
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,225
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

849
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,838
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

850
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,432
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

851
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,168
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

852
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,105
They know your name.

853
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,011
Yeah.

854
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,546
My name is Optimus Prime.

855
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:09,709
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

856
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:13,186
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

857
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:18,656
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

858
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:22,288
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

859
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,730
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

860
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:28,429
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

861
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,407
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

862
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,870
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

863
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,210
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

864
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,611
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

865
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:47,849
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

866
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,592
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

867
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,491
Bumblebee, right?

868
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,293
<i>Check on the rep
Yep, second to none</i>

869
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,766
So you're my guardian, huh?

870
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:05,068
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

871
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,277
Why are you here?

872
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:16,613
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

873
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,386
Mega-what?

874
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:33,561
<i>Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,</i>

875
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:39,472
<i>until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.</i>

876
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,841
<i>All who defied them were destroyed.</i>

877
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:50,044
<i>Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.</i>

878
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:57,016
<i>Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.</i>

879
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,889
My grandfather.

880
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:04,194
<i>It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.</i>

881
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,961
Come back!

882
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,067
I think the dogs have found something.

883
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,907
The ice is cracking!

884
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,315
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

885
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,050
I'm all right, lads!

886
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,857
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

887
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:48,336
<i>Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.</i>

888
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:55,372
Men! We've made a discovery!

889
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,887
<i>He accidentally activated
his navigation system.</i>

890
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:19,305
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

891
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,433
How'd you know about his glasses?

892
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,774
- eBay.
- eBay.

893
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:27,042
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

894
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:32,985
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

895
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:36,490
And the human race
will be extinguished.

896
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:42,053
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

897
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,236
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

898
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,610
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

899
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,702
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

900
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,075
Melted right through.

901
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,378
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

902
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,713
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

903
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,015
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

904
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,415
- Heads up!
- Oh!

905
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,821
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

906
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,960
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

907
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,397
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

908
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,765
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

909
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,337
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

910
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:29,267
You want that piece?

911
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:32,673
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

912
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,837
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

913
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:38,279
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

914
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:40,943
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

915
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:43,520
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

916
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:47,456
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

917
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:48,719
It's me and you.

918
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:51,660
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

919
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,736
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

920
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,474
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

921
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:12,573
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

922
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:13,651
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

923
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:15,982
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

924
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:20,786
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

925
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:21,859
Okay, so what?

926
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,053
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

927
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:25,857
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

928
01:08:25,964 --> 01:08:26,931
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

929
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:30,866
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

930
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,264
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

931
01:08:35,373 --> 01:08:36,965
See? So can I go home now?

932
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,305
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

933
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:43,108
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

934
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:45,547
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

935
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,245
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

936
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,083
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

937
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:53,487
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

938
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,425
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...</i>

939
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:58,120
- What did he say?
- What?

940
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,697
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

941
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:02,358
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

942
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:03,866
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

943
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:11,072
<i>Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...</i>

944
01:09:11,176 --> 01:09:12,370
<i>- Yeah!
- Call Sam.</i>

945
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:14,035
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

946
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:15,442
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

947
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:18,072
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

948
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:19,810
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

949
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,523
I need you to stay here, all right?

950
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,785
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

951
01:09:27,893 --> 01:09:28,860
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

952
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,949
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

953
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:31,028
Five minutes, all right?

954
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,699
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

955
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,767
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

956
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:38,495
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

957
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:40,901
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

958
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:44,669
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

959
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:46,334
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

960
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:49,311
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

961
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:51,974
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

962
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,175
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

963
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:54,752
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

964
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:56,320
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

965
01:09:56,421 --> 01:09:57,786
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

966
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,117
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

967
01:09:59,224 --> 01:10:01,124
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

968
01:10:01,226 --> 01:10:05,094
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

969
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:07,562
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

970
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,633
The...

971
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:13,070
I love you. God, I love you

972
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,900
just so much right now.

973
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,439
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

974
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,065
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

975
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,007
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

976
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:21,476
because you're such a swell guy.

977
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,706
One more thing, huh?

978
01:10:22,814 --> 01:10:25,874
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

979
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,078
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

980
01:10:28,219 --> 01:10:31,484
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

981
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,457
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

982
01:10:34,559 --> 01:10:36,993
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

983
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:39,063
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

984
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:41,997
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

985
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:47,261
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

986
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,365
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

987
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:55,043
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

988
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:58,172
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

989
01:10:58,283 --> 01:11:01,047
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

990
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:03,950
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

991
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:07,024
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

992
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,319
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

993
01:11:08,426 --> 01:11:10,587
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

994
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:13,892
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

995
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:16,695
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

996
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:22,367
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

997
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:23,964
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

998
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,633
That's all it is.

999
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,542
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1000
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,946
Okay, okay.

1001
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,778
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1002
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,547
Autobots, recon.

1003
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:44,087
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1004
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,958
Got some ice on his nose.

1005
01:11:46,064 --> 01:11:48,498
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1006
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,965
You did not.

1007
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:53,363
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

1008
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,665
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1009
01:11:58,743 --> 01:12:00,370
Come on, come on.

1010
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:08,277
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1011
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:10,980
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1012
01:12:11,089 --> 01:12:12,750
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1013
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,848
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1014
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:18,218
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

1015
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:19,353
My glasses were in the bag.

1016
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,295
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1017
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:22,957
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1018
01:12:23,068 --> 01:12:24,126
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1019
01:12:24,235 --> 01:12:26,430
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1020
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:29,473
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1021
01:12:29,574 --> 01:12:32,008
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1022
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,543
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1023
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:34,612
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

1024
01:12:34,713 --> 01:12:36,078
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1025
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:38,877
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1026
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:40,917
I'm already stressed out enough.

1027
01:12:41,019 --> 01:12:42,509
Okay. What now?

1028
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:48,359
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1029
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:52,419
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1030
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,519
Oh, God. Oh!

1031
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:57,761
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.</i>

1032
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:00,167
<i>My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

1033
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:03,368
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1034
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:06,410
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1035
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,103
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1036
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:09,271
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1037
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,608
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1038
01:13:10,715 --> 01:13:12,706
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1039
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:14,284
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1040
01:13:14,385 --> 01:13:15,943
We must have the glasses.

1041
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:17,612
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1042
01:13:17,722 --> 01:13:19,952
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1043
01:13:20,058 --> 01:13:21,150
Keep searching.

1044
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:22,920
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1045
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,255
Ten minutes. Okay?

1046
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:26,125
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1047
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:28,222
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1048
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:29,357
Calm down, calm down.

1049
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:31,162
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1050
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:33,931
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1051
01:13:34,038 --> 01:13:35,903
Good? Good? Okay.

1052
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:37,167
- Move!
- Get away!

1053
01:13:37,275 --> 01:13:38,970
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1054
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:40,977
He wants us to be quiet.

1055
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:48,616
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1056
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,583
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1057
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,521
How did you get over there so fast?

1058
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:57,356
Wow! That was tingly!

1059
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:00,863
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

1060
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:07,728
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1061
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:12,837
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1062
01:14:13,642 --> 01:14:15,371
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1063
01:14:15,511 --> 01:14:17,206
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

1064
01:14:17,312 --> 01:14:19,872
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1065
01:14:19,982 --> 01:14:21,040
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1066
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:23,050
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1067
01:14:23,152 --> 01:14:24,312
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

1068
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:25,477
How come the door's locked?

1069
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:29,216
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1070
01:14:29,324 --> 01:14:30,518
You know he'll start counting

1071
01:14:30,626 --> 01:14:32,025
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1072
01:14:32,127 --> 01:14:33,116
Oh, dear.

1073
01:14:33,228 --> 01:14:34,957
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

1074
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:36,462
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

1075
01:14:36,565 --> 01:14:37,532
- Oh, my.
- Two.

1076
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:39,692
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1077
01:14:40,202 --> 01:14:43,865
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1078
01:14:43,972 --> 01:14:46,964
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1079
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:48,667
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1080
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:51,007
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1081
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:52,978
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1082
01:14:53,081 --> 01:14:54,878
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1083
01:14:54,983 --> 01:14:56,473
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1084
01:14:56,585 --> 01:14:57,847
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1085
01:14:57,953 --> 01:14:59,978
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1086
01:15:00,088 --> 01:15:01,453
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1087
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:02,579
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1088
01:15:02,691 --> 01:15:04,056
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1089
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,626
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

1090
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:07,160
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1091
01:15:07,262 --> 01:15:09,628
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1092
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:14,191
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1093
01:15:16,071 --> 01:15:17,129
- Judy.
- Was I...

1094
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:18,206
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

1095
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:19,638
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

1096
01:15:19,741 --> 01:15:20,765
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1097
01:15:20,876 --> 01:15:22,400
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

1098
01:15:22,511 --> 01:15:25,344
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1099
01:15:25,447 --> 01:15:29,076
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1100
01:15:29,184 --> 01:15:31,175
- Happy time?
- ...my special alone time...

1101
01:15:31,286 --> 01:15:32,253
- Stop.
- Mom.

1102
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:33,343
- Judy, stop.
- ...with myself.

1103
01:15:33,455 --> 01:15:34,479
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

1104
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,888
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1105
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:39,017
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1106
01:15:39,127 --> 01:15:40,890
Oh, parents.

1107
01:15:41,797 --> 01:15:44,595
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1108
01:15:45,734 --> 01:15:49,295
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1109
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:52,037
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1110
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,129
Oh, I hate these.

1111
01:15:53,242 --> 01:15:54,504
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

1112
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:55,634
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

1113
01:15:55,744 --> 01:15:57,268
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

1114
01:15:57,379 --> 01:15:58,710
Can't you take safety seriously?

1115
01:15:58,814 --> 01:16:02,079
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1116
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:05,085
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1117
01:16:10,192 --> 01:16:13,684
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1118
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:16,286
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1119
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:18,628
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1120
01:16:18,734 --> 01:16:20,429
Trashed. Gone.

1121
01:16:20,736 --> 01:16:22,203
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1122
01:16:22,304 --> 01:16:24,329
The parents are very irritating.

1123
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:26,134
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

1124
01:16:26,241 --> 01:16:28,971
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1125
01:16:29,077 --> 01:16:30,271
What is with you?

1126
01:16:30,379 --> 01:16:33,712
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1127
01:16:33,815 --> 01:16:35,476
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

1128
01:16:35,584 --> 01:16:37,984
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

1129
01:16:38,086 --> 01:16:39,883
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1130
01:16:40,656 --> 01:16:42,920
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1131
01:16:44,393 --> 01:16:47,123
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1132
01:16:47,229 --> 01:16:50,096
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

1133
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:53,258
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1134
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:54,858
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1135
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,130
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1136
01:17:13,488 --> 01:17:16,821
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1137
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,916
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1138
01:17:19,027 --> 01:17:19,994
I want you to distract my parents

1139
01:17:20,095 --> 01:17:22,393
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

1140
01:17:28,337 --> 01:17:30,897
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1141
01:17:31,006 --> 01:17:33,031
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1142
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:35,268
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1143
01:17:35,377 --> 01:17:37,902
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1144
01:17:38,013 --> 01:17:39,139
It's Witwicky.

1145
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:42,478
May I enter the premises, sir?

1146
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:45,519
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1147
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,587
What the heck is going on here?

1148
01:17:46,688 --> 01:17:48,815
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1149
01:17:48,924 --> 01:17:51,188
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1150
01:17:51,293 --> 01:17:52,726
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1151
01:17:52,828 --> 01:17:53,886
That's right. National security.

1152
01:17:53,996 --> 01:17:55,588
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1153
01:17:55,697 --> 01:17:58,063
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1154
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,963
Could you stay off the grass?

1155
01:18:00,068 --> 01:18:01,501
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1156
01:18:01,603 --> 01:18:03,230
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1157
01:18:03,338 --> 01:18:06,569
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1158
01:18:06,675 --> 01:18:08,142
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1159
01:18:08,243 --> 01:18:09,574
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1160
01:18:09,678 --> 01:18:11,009
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1161
01:18:11,113 --> 01:18:13,274
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1162
01:18:13,382 --> 01:18:16,408
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1163
01:18:16,518 --> 01:18:18,577
- No!
- What is this?

1164
01:18:18,687 --> 01:18:21,417
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

1165
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:22,990
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

1166
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:24,319
Whoa, way out of line.

1167
01:18:24,426 --> 01:18:28,453
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1168
01:18:28,563 --> 01:18:30,463
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1169
01:18:30,565 --> 01:18:31,623
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1170
01:18:31,733 --> 01:18:32,927
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1171
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:35,230
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1172
01:18:35,337 --> 01:18:38,033
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

1173
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:42,099
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1174
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,440
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1175
01:18:44,546 --> 01:18:47,106
I think direct contact.

1176
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:54,112
- Son?
- Yeah.

1177
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,091
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

1178
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:05,332
Fourteen rads.

1179
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:08,402
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1180
01:19:09,137 --> 01:19:11,037
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1181
01:19:11,139 --> 01:19:12,834
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1182
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:14,465
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1183
01:19:14,576 --> 01:19:16,441
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1184
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:21,875
So,

1185
01:19:23,318 --> 01:19:26,776
LadiesMan217.

1186
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:30,324
That is your eBay username, right?

1187
01:19:30,425 --> 01:19:32,757
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1188
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:33,828
What do you make of this?

1189
01:19:33,929 --> 01:19:36,489
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...</i>

1190
01:19:36,598 --> 01:19:37,724
Is that you?

1191
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:40,028
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1192
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:44,970
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1193
01:19:46,308 --> 01:19:48,640
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

1194
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:53,203
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1195
01:19:53,315 --> 01:19:55,442
- Really?
- ...from me, from my home,

1196
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:58,519
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1197
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,349
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1198
01:20:00,455 --> 01:20:03,891
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1199
01:20:07,028 --> 01:20:08,620
That's funny. That is so funny.

1200
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,221
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1201
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,164
<i>Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T? No.</i>

1202
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,760
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1203
01:20:16,872 --> 01:20:17,998
You see this?

1204
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:20,700
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1205
01:20:20,809 --> 01:20:23,573
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1206
01:20:23,678 --> 01:20:24,906
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1207
01:20:25,013 --> 01:20:27,413
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1208
01:20:27,516 --> 01:20:30,576
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1209
01:20:30,685 --> 01:20:32,778
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1210
01:20:32,888 --> 01:20:34,287
What? Parole?

1211
01:20:34,389 --> 01:20:37,722
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1212
01:20:37,826 --> 01:20:39,817
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1213
01:20:39,928 --> 01:20:41,657
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1214
01:20:41,763 --> 01:20:42,855
You stole cars?

1215
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:44,659
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1216
01:20:44,766 --> 01:20:46,563
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1217
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:48,966
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1218
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:51,698
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1219
01:20:52,841 --> 01:20:57,471
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1220
01:20:57,579 --> 01:20:59,877
It is time to talk!

1221
01:21:06,621 --> 01:21:08,054
Big! It's big!

1222
01:21:12,794 --> 01:21:14,762
Go, go, go, go!

1223
01:21:15,197 --> 01:21:17,825
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1224
01:21:17,933 --> 01:21:19,366
All right! All right!

1225
01:21:33,949 --> 01:21:36,247
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1226
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:42,881
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1227
01:21:45,126 --> 01:21:48,892
Taking the children was a bad move.

1228
01:21:48,997 --> 01:21:52,398
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1229
01:21:56,004 --> 01:21:57,733
Freeze!

1230
01:21:58,373 --> 01:21:59,772
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1231
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:00,932
Whoa!

1232
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:03,435
Whoa!

1233
01:22:14,222 --> 01:22:15,553
Hi, there.

1234
01:22:15,857 --> 01:22:20,590
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1235
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:26,233
Look, there are
Seven protocols, okay?

1236
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:28,132
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1237
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:30,466
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1238
01:22:30,572 --> 01:22:33,166
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1239
01:22:33,808 --> 01:22:34,934
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1240
01:22:35,043 --> 01:22:36,533
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1241
01:22:36,645 --> 01:22:40,012
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1242
01:22:40,115 --> 01:22:43,607
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1243
01:22:43,718 --> 01:22:45,242
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1244
01:22:45,353 --> 01:22:46,342
How you doing?

1245
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:48,183
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

1246
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:50,451
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1247
01:22:50,558 --> 01:22:53,721
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

1248
01:22:53,828 --> 01:22:57,594
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1249
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:02,363
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1250
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,599
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1251
01:23:05,707 --> 01:23:08,574
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1252
01:23:08,677 --> 01:23:11,168
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

1253
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,509
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1254
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:15,606
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1255
01:23:15,717 --> 01:23:17,582
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1256
01:23:17,686 --> 01:23:19,415
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1257
01:23:19,521 --> 01:23:22,354
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1258
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:25,654
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1259
01:23:30,932 --> 01:23:31,899
Hey!

1260
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,935
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1261
01:23:35,036 --> 01:23:37,095
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1262
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,739
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1263
01:23:41,843 --> 01:23:44,539
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

1264
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,611
For threatening my dad.

1265
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:56,590
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1266
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,021
You're a criminal.

1267
01:24:00,695 --> 01:24:03,493
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1268
01:24:04,966 --> 01:24:07,799
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1269
01:24:07,902 --> 01:24:08,891
All right.

1270
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:11,096
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1271
01:24:13,141 --> 01:24:15,041
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

1272
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:17,337
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1273
01:24:17,445 --> 01:24:18,707
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1274
01:24:18,813 --> 01:24:23,250
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1275
01:24:29,791 --> 01:24:31,725
Optimus! Incoming!

1276
01:24:39,434 --> 01:24:40,662
Roll out.

1277
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:50,908
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.</i>

1278
01:24:53,782 --> 01:24:57,183
<i>Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.</i>

1279
01:24:57,285 --> 01:24:58,616
Up you get.

1280
01:25:03,324 --> 01:25:05,292
<i>Okay, we're dropping in.</i>

1281
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:11,924
<i>Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.</i>

1282
01:25:12,033 --> 01:25:14,194
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

1283
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,898
<i>That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.</i>

1284
01:25:18,006 --> 01:25:21,271
<i>Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.</i>

1285
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:23,368
<i>I got it. 12:00.</i>

1286
01:25:27,449 --> 01:25:28,882
<i>Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.</i>

1287
01:25:31,853 --> 01:25:34,048
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

1288
01:25:37,659 --> 01:25:42,221
<i>Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?</i>

1289
01:25:42,564 --> 01:25:44,725
<i>Okay, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

1290
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,291
<i>Okay, we're coming around.</i>

1291
01:26:09,991 --> 01:26:11,515
Easy, you two.

1292
01:26:20,902 --> 01:26:24,133
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1293
01:26:24,806 --> 01:26:27,798
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1294
01:26:29,043 --> 01:26:31,102
- Hold on!
- No!

1295
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:36,044
Sam!

1296
01:26:41,656 --> 01:26:44,784
<i>All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.</i>

1297
01:26:44,893 --> 01:26:46,155
<i>I'm in for the shot.</i>

1298
01:26:46,261 --> 01:26:47,694
Stop! Stop!

1299
01:26:48,897 --> 01:26:50,694
Wait! No!

1300
01:26:54,068 --> 01:26:56,662
<i>- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.</i>

1301
01:26:57,238 --> 01:26:58,432
No!

1302
01:27:14,522 --> 01:27:16,615
No! Stop!

1303
01:27:17,225 --> 01:27:18,522
Stop!

1304
01:27:19,127 --> 01:27:22,563
<i>Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!</i>

1305
01:27:23,565 --> 01:27:24,896
What? Okay.

1306
01:27:26,768 --> 01:27:28,929
Look, he's not fighting back!

1307
01:27:29,537 --> 01:27:31,732
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1308
01:27:38,112 --> 01:27:39,670
Stop hurting him!

1309
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:50,785
Don't let him move!

1310
01:27:51,526 --> 01:27:53,084
I got him here!

1311
01:28:16,284 --> 01:28:17,342
No!

1312
01:28:21,356 --> 01:28:23,153
Happy to see me again?

1313
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:27,389
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1314
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:36,327
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1315
01:28:44,512 --> 01:28:46,776
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1316
01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:51,016
Optimus,

1317
01:28:53,354 --> 01:28:55,822
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1318
01:28:55,923 --> 01:28:59,620
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1319
01:28:59,727 --> 01:29:02,525
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1320
01:29:14,542 --> 01:29:16,908
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1321
01:29:17,011 --> 01:29:18,137
in the western Pacific.

1322
01:29:18,246 --> 01:29:20,441
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1323
01:29:20,548 --> 01:29:23,312
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1324
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:30,522
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1325
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:31,956
of cruise missile range.

1326
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:35,587
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1327
01:29:35,697 --> 01:29:37,665
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

1328
01:29:40,068 --> 01:29:45,131
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1329
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:48,436
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

1330
01:29:51,579 --> 01:29:54,070
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1331
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:00,381
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1332
01:30:00,488 --> 01:30:02,888
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

1333
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:04,651
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1334
01:30:04,759 --> 01:30:07,193
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1335
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:09,196
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1336
01:30:09,297 --> 01:30:12,289
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1337
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,492
The blackout's global.

1338
01:30:13,601 --> 01:30:16,434
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1339
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:21,065
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1340
01:30:27,014 --> 01:30:31,314
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1341
01:30:33,321 --> 01:30:35,687
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1342
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,318
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1343
01:30:40,428 --> 01:30:42,521
you won't understand right away.

1344
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:45,963
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1345
01:30:46,067 --> 01:30:49,468
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1346
01:30:50,338 --> 01:30:54,434
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1347
01:30:55,543 --> 01:30:59,809
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1348
01:31:00,281 --> 01:31:02,681
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1349
01:31:03,284 --> 01:31:05,809
This was classified above top secret.

1350
01:31:20,802 --> 01:31:23,430
<i>EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.</i>

1351
01:31:23,538 --> 01:31:26,166
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1352
01:31:27,441 --> 01:31:29,534
This is the image from Mars.

1353
01:31:30,378 --> 01:31:33,142
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1354
01:31:33,247 --> 01:31:35,010
from the base attack.

1355
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:38,877
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1356
01:31:39,754 --> 01:31:42,518
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1357
01:31:42,924 --> 01:31:45,586
Are we talking about an invasion?

1358
01:31:45,693 --> 01:31:48,787
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1359
01:31:48,896 --> 01:31:52,229
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1360
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:54,062
That's why the virus shut us down,

1361
01:31:54,168 --> 01:31:57,467
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1362
01:31:57,572 --> 01:32:02,066
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1363
01:32:05,947 --> 01:32:08,279
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1364
01:32:08,382 --> 01:32:11,783
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1365
01:32:11,886 --> 01:32:15,219
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1366
01:32:15,323 --> 01:32:18,292
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1367
01:32:28,502 --> 01:32:31,767
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1368
01:32:31,873 --> 01:32:32,840
Let's go!

1369
01:32:37,879 --> 01:32:39,369
She's in here.

1370
01:32:39,747 --> 01:32:41,408
What's going on?

1371
01:32:41,949 --> 01:32:43,780
You're coming with me.

1372
01:32:44,218 --> 01:32:46,914
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?

1373
01:32:47,922 --> 01:32:49,253
Who's this?

1374
01:32:50,024 --> 01:32:53,118
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.

1375
01:33:04,405 --> 01:33:06,896
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1376
01:33:07,975 --> 01:33:12,241
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1377
01:33:12,346 --> 01:33:13,313
Wow.

1378
01:33:13,981 --> 01:33:15,107
Who knew?

1379
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:33,799
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1380
01:33:44,612 --> 01:33:47,342
Please, let this work.

1381
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:50,649
Fire it up, Optimus.

1382
01:33:51,619 --> 01:33:53,109
The code.

1383
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:58,624
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1384
01:34:00,428 --> 01:34:04,228
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1385
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:07,162
They must know it's here, as well.

1386
01:34:07,268 --> 01:34:08,599
What about Bumblebee?

1387
01:34:08,703 --> 01:34:12,764
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1388
01:34:12,873 --> 01:34:16,866
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1389
01:34:16,978 --> 01:34:21,210
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1390
01:34:21,315 --> 01:34:24,250
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1391
01:34:25,653 --> 01:34:29,020
<i>They're a primitive and violent race.</i>

1392
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:33,350
Were we so different?

1393
01:34:34,261 --> 01:34:38,630
<i>They're a young species.
They have much to learn.</i>

1394
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:41,531
<i>But I've seen goodness in them.</i>

1395
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:45,799
<i>Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.</i>

1396
01:34:45,906 --> 01:34:50,138
<i>You all know there's only one way
to end this war.</i>

1397
01:34:50,244 --> 01:34:52,940
<i>We must destroy the Cube.</i>

1398
01:34:53,748 --> 01:34:58,310
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1399
01:34:58,419 --> 01:34:59,750
That's suicide.

1400
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:03,654
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1401
01:35:03,758 --> 01:35:08,218
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1402
01:35:08,329 --> 01:35:11,628
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1403
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,796
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1404
01:35:15,903 --> 01:35:19,703
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

1405
01:35:31,752 --> 01:35:34,915
Team attention! Present arms!

1406
01:35:35,589 --> 01:35:39,821
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1407
01:35:39,927 --> 01:35:41,622
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1408
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:43,856
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1409
01:35:43,964 --> 01:35:45,226
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1410
01:35:45,332 --> 01:35:48,426
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1411
01:35:49,937 --> 01:35:51,165
Hey, kid.

1412
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,901
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1413
01:35:55,443 --> 01:35:56,535
You must be hungry?

1414
01:35:56,644 --> 01:35:58,635
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1415
01:35:58,746 --> 01:36:00,373
Where's my car?

1416
01:36:00,481 --> 01:36:04,042
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1417
01:36:04,552 --> 01:36:06,247
People can die here.

1418
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:09,316
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1419
01:36:09,423 --> 01:36:10,617
Okay.

1420
01:36:10,724 --> 01:36:14,455
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1421
01:36:14,562 --> 01:36:19,261
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1422
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:23,870
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1423
01:36:23,971 --> 01:36:25,268
Thank you.

1424
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,469
The man's an extortionist.

1425
01:36:30,211 --> 01:36:31,542
All right, here's the situation.

1426
01:36:31,645 --> 01:36:34,045
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1427
01:36:34,148 --> 01:36:35,240
NBEs?

1428
01:36:35,349 --> 01:36:38,944
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1429
01:36:39,053 --> 01:36:42,682
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1430
01:36:51,866 --> 01:36:53,695
Dear God. What is this?

1431
01:36:55,269 --> 01:36:58,534
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1432
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,075
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1433
01:37:02,176 --> 01:37:06,169
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1434
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,545
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1435
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:12,050
We call him NBE One.

1436
01:37:12,153 --> 01:37:14,519
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1437
01:37:14,622 --> 01:37:17,022
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1438
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:20,123
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1439
01:37:20,227 --> 01:37:23,560
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1440
01:37:23,664 --> 01:37:27,122
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1441
01:37:27,234 --> 01:37:28,667
in the history of mankind.

1442
01:37:28,769 --> 01:37:31,704
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1443
01:37:31,805 --> 01:37:38,643
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1444
01:37:38,746 --> 01:37:42,546
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1445
01:37:43,117 --> 01:37:45,745
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1446
01:37:45,853 --> 01:37:48,219
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1447
01:37:48,322 --> 01:37:52,315
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1448
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:54,291
Well, you got one now.

1449
01:37:55,229 --> 01:37:57,629
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1450
01:37:57,731 --> 01:37:59,255
All Spark? What is that?

1451
01:37:59,366 --> 01:38:01,926
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1452
01:38:02,036 --> 01:38:06,803
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

1453
01:38:06,907 --> 01:38:09,341
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1454
01:38:09,443 --> 01:38:12,537
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1455
01:38:12,646 --> 01:38:14,170
That's their plan.

1456
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:16,681
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1457
01:38:19,019 --> 01:38:21,283
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1458
01:38:22,723 --> 01:38:23,849
Follow me.

1459
01:38:27,494 --> 01:38:29,985
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1460
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:42,500
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1461
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:47,039
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1462
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:51,749
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1463
01:38:51,852 --> 01:38:53,376
as well as NBE One.

1464
01:38:53,487 --> 01:38:56,047
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1465
01:38:56,156 --> 01:38:58,522
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1466
01:38:58,626 --> 01:39:01,959
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1467
01:39:02,062 --> 01:39:05,657
or any alien species on the outside.

1468
01:39:44,471 --> 01:39:48,271
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1469
01:39:48,909 --> 01:39:51,400
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1470
01:39:55,983 --> 01:39:58,850
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1471
01:40:04,758 --> 01:40:06,419
Oh, wow.

1472
01:40:06,527 --> 01:40:08,552
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1473
01:40:08,662 --> 01:40:09,856
Oh, no, man.

1474
01:40:09,997 --> 01:40:14,457
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1475
01:40:14,568 --> 01:40:17,503
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1476
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,065
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1477
01:40:22,176 --> 01:40:23,609
I got a phone.

1478
01:40:26,814 --> 01:40:29,408
Nokias are real nasty.

1479
01:40:29,516 --> 01:40:33,953
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1480
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:36,882
Nokia's from Finland.

1481
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:41,552
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1482
01:40:44,331 --> 01:40:49,894
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1483
01:41:03,584 --> 01:41:06,883
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

1484
01:41:06,987 --> 01:41:10,650
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1485
01:41:21,668 --> 01:41:23,533
He's breaking the box.

1486
01:41:41,522 --> 01:41:42,648
Go! Go! Go!

1487
01:41:42,756 --> 01:41:43,848
Move!

1488
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:55,027
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1489
01:41:55,803 --> 01:41:57,134
Banachek. What's going on?

1490
01:41:57,237 --> 01:41:59,068
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1491
01:41:59,173 --> 01:42:00,231
<i>- What?
- ... and the backup generator</i>

1492
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:02,308
<i>- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?</i>

1493
01:42:08,715 --> 01:42:10,478
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1494
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:11,983
I'll bring security to the...

1495
01:42:12,085 --> 01:42:14,610
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1496
01:42:14,721 --> 01:42:16,313
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1497
01:42:16,423 --> 01:42:17,788
Let's go!

1498
01:42:17,891 --> 01:42:19,654
They're popping our generators!

1499
01:42:31,672 --> 01:42:33,037
Megatron melting!

1500
01:42:33,674 --> 01:42:36,734
<i>16502. We're losing pressure.</i>

1501
01:42:36,844 --> 01:42:39,039
Stand by! Set!

1502
01:42:39,146 --> 01:42:41,205
<i>We're losing pressure!</i>

1503
01:42:41,315 --> 01:42:44,751
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!</i>

1504
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:52,186
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1505
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:56,285
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1506
01:43:01,835 --> 01:43:04,463
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1507
01:43:04,571 --> 01:43:05,595
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1508
01:43:05,706 --> 01:43:07,640
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1509
01:43:07,741 --> 01:43:09,470
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1510
01:43:09,576 --> 01:43:10,838
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1511
01:43:10,944 --> 01:43:12,309
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1512
01:43:12,412 --> 01:43:14,403
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1513
01:43:14,515 --> 01:43:16,244
Take him to his car!

1514
01:43:17,985 --> 01:43:19,179
Drop it.

1515
01:43:20,954 --> 01:43:22,615
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1516
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:25,882
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1517
01:43:26,393 --> 01:43:28,122
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1518
01:43:28,228 --> 01:43:29,252
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1519
01:43:29,363 --> 01:43:31,558
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1520
01:43:31,665 --> 01:43:32,825
Seven don't exist.

1521
01:43:32,933 --> 01:43:34,696
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1522
01:43:34,801 --> 01:43:38,066
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1523
01:43:40,674 --> 01:43:42,301
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

1524
01:43:42,409 --> 01:43:46,470
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1525
01:43:50,984 --> 01:43:52,952
All right. Okay.

1526
01:43:53,053 --> 01:43:57,683
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1527
01:44:01,128 --> 01:44:02,390
No, no!

1528
01:44:03,363 --> 01:44:06,025
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1529
01:44:06,133 --> 01:44:09,694
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1530
01:44:10,904 --> 01:44:12,303
Are you okay?

1531
01:44:14,174 --> 01:44:16,267
They didn't hurt you, right?

1532
01:44:25,018 --> 01:44:28,818
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1533
01:44:31,224 --> 01:44:33,317
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1534
01:44:33,427 --> 01:44:35,657
They're not gonna hurt you.

1535
01:44:35,762 --> 01:44:39,289
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1536
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:42,664
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1537
01:44:42,769 --> 01:44:44,259
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1538
01:45:06,326 --> 01:45:09,818
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1539
01:45:29,950 --> 01:45:31,281
Oh, my God.

1540
01:45:36,089 --> 01:45:37,488
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

1541
01:45:37,591 --> 01:45:38,990
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

1542
01:45:39,092 --> 01:45:42,118
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1543
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:43,628
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1544
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:45,027
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1545
01:45:45,132 --> 01:45:46,531
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1546
01:45:46,633 --> 01:45:47,600
Good! Right.

1547
01:45:47,701 --> 01:45:50,431
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1548
01:45:50,537 --> 01:45:52,596
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1549
01:45:52,706 --> 01:45:54,571
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

1550
01:45:54,675 --> 01:45:57,269
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1551
01:45:57,377 --> 01:45:58,810
In the alien archive, sir!

1552
01:45:58,912 --> 01:46:00,903
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1553
01:46:01,014 --> 01:46:02,538
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1554
01:46:02,649 --> 01:46:05,083
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1555
01:46:05,185 --> 01:46:06,948
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1556
01:46:07,054 --> 01:46:08,681
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1557
01:46:08,789 --> 01:46:10,757
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1558
01:46:10,857 --> 01:46:12,381
Affirmative!

1559
01:46:12,492 --> 01:46:16,326
<i>Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.</i>

1560
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:19,195
Check that backup system!

1561
01:46:19,299 --> 01:46:23,463
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1562
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:25,060
Come on! Get out of here!

1563
01:46:25,172 --> 01:46:26,696
Heads up! Look out!

1564
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:30,108
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1565
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:33,646
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

1566
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:46,416
I am Megatron!

1567
01:47:05,245 --> 01:47:06,644
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1568
01:47:06,747 --> 01:47:07,736
Well, put the seat belt on.

1569
01:47:07,848 --> 01:47:09,008
Pour it on him!

1570
01:47:22,763 --> 01:47:24,754
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1571
01:47:24,865 --> 01:47:27,265
Where is the Cube?

1572
01:47:27,367 --> 01:47:29,426
The humans have taken it.

1573
01:47:32,806 --> 01:47:36,674
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1574
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:38,577
Come on, Mags!

1575
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:41,169
Over here, sir!

1576
01:47:43,517 --> 01:47:45,576
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1577
01:47:45,685 --> 01:47:48,119
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1578
01:47:50,023 --> 01:47:53,481
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1579
01:47:54,528 --> 01:47:55,517
Mikes?

1580
01:47:55,629 --> 01:47:56,891
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1581
01:47:56,997 --> 01:47:58,555
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1582
01:47:58,665 --> 01:48:00,189
Let's find them.

1583
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,767
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1584
01:48:01,868 --> 01:48:04,029
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

1585
01:48:04,137 --> 01:48:07,197
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1586
01:48:07,307 --> 01:48:08,604
- Glen?
- Huh?

1587
01:48:08,708 --> 01:48:12,200
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1588
01:48:12,312 --> 01:48:13,301
What good is that?

1589
01:48:13,413 --> 01:48:15,813
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1590
01:48:15,916 --> 01:48:19,477
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1591
01:48:19,586 --> 01:48:21,417
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1592
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,724
There's Optimus.

1593
01:48:52,686 --> 01:48:54,153
Almost done.

1594
01:48:55,989 --> 01:48:57,889
What the hell was that?

1595
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:02,656
Barricade the door!

1596
01:49:05,398 --> 01:49:07,764
- Get something.
- Watch out!

1597
01:49:07,868 --> 01:49:09,961
Six, five, four, six, three.

1598
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:17,007
Here! Put some rounds in!

1599
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,313
Master search.

1600
01:49:22,215 --> 01:49:24,206
I got it! We're transmitting!

1601
01:49:24,317 --> 01:49:25,443
Send exactly what I say!

1602
01:49:25,552 --> 01:49:29,682
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1603
01:49:29,789 --> 01:49:33,816
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1604
01:49:33,927 --> 01:49:35,451
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1605
01:49:37,163 --> 01:49:38,187
What was that?

1606
01:49:38,298 --> 01:49:41,131
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1607
01:49:43,303 --> 01:49:45,498
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1608
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:12,198
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1609
01:50:12,299 --> 01:50:15,735
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

1610
01:50:36,957 --> 01:50:37,946
Oh, my God.

1611
01:51:06,519 --> 01:51:07,850
Cool, Mom!

1612
01:51:33,747 --> 01:51:35,738
This is so not good.

1613
01:51:54,234 --> 01:51:56,099
He's behind the pillar!

1614
01:52:01,975 --> 01:52:05,069
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

1615
01:52:08,214 --> 01:52:10,546
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1616
01:52:14,421 --> 01:52:16,389
Sucker, burn!

1617
01:52:22,162 --> 01:52:23,493
Oh, shit!

1618
01:52:23,830 --> 01:52:25,855
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1619
01:52:27,067 --> 01:52:29,092
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.</i>

1620
01:52:30,303 --> 01:52:32,567
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

1621
01:52:34,908 --> 01:52:36,375
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

1622
01:52:37,277 --> 01:52:39,438
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

1623
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:50,581
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1624
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:52,885
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1625
01:52:53,426 --> 01:52:55,621
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1626
01:52:55,728 --> 01:52:58,026
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1627
01:52:58,431 --> 01:53:01,423
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1628
01:53:01,534 --> 01:53:04,469
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1629
01:53:04,571 --> 01:53:07,267
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1630
01:53:07,874 --> 01:53:09,466
F-22 at 12:00.

1631
01:53:09,576 --> 01:53:12,272
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1632
01:53:12,378 --> 01:53:14,243
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1633
01:53:16,749 --> 01:53:19,149
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1634
01:53:19,452 --> 01:53:21,079
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1635
01:53:22,355 --> 01:53:23,515
<i>We have you visual.</i>

1636
01:53:25,191 --> 01:53:26,522
<i>Green smoke is the mark.</i>

1637
01:53:26,626 --> 01:53:30,084
<i>Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.</i>

1638
01:53:34,734 --> 01:53:36,702
It's Starscream!

1639
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,831
Please tell me you copy.

1640
01:53:39,172 --> 01:53:41,470
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1641
01:53:45,278 --> 01:53:47,246
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1642
01:53:47,347 --> 01:53:50,510
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1643
01:53:50,617 --> 01:53:51,845
Incoming!

1644
01:54:16,943 --> 01:54:18,740
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1645
01:54:18,845 --> 01:54:20,312
Clear the area!

1646
01:54:26,119 --> 01:54:27,643
Oh, my God.

1647
01:54:28,521 --> 01:54:31,388
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1648
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:33,155
Your legs.

1649
01:54:34,727 --> 01:54:38,356
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1650
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:42,333
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1651
01:54:43,903 --> 01:54:45,097
Ratchet!

1652
01:54:46,973 --> 01:54:48,440
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1653
01:54:48,541 --> 01:54:50,475
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

1654
01:54:50,577 --> 01:54:52,943
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1655
01:54:53,046 --> 01:54:55,207
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1656
01:54:55,315 --> 01:54:58,113
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1657
01:54:59,385 --> 01:55:00,409
Come on!

1658
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,647
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.</i>

1659
01:55:04,424 --> 01:55:06,551
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1660
01:55:06,659 --> 01:55:08,991
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1661
01:55:27,213 --> 01:55:28,646
Move out! Let's go!

1662
01:55:35,088 --> 01:55:36,783
Let's go! Move!

1663
01:55:43,396 --> 01:55:45,057
I'm not gonna leave you.

1664
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:26,195
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1665
01:56:32,512 --> 01:56:34,036
Oh, my God!

1666
01:56:46,592 --> 01:56:48,526
Concentrate your fire!

1667
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:00,633
Come on. Come on.

1668
01:57:03,209 --> 01:57:04,904
Megatron!

1669
01:57:09,615 --> 01:57:13,278
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1670
01:57:17,557 --> 01:57:19,149
Fall back!

1671
01:57:25,164 --> 01:57:27,359
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1672
01:57:27,467 --> 01:57:29,492
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1673
01:57:29,602 --> 01:57:31,866
We need air cover down here now!

1674
01:57:37,877 --> 01:57:39,276
Sam, help me with this.

1675
01:57:43,449 --> 01:57:47,783
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

1676
01:57:47,887 --> 01:57:49,980
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1677
01:57:50,089 --> 01:57:52,387
No! I want two!

1678
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:55,359
What's going on?

1679
01:57:57,163 --> 01:57:59,791
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1680
01:58:00,666 --> 01:58:02,930
Oh, these things just don't die.

1681
01:58:06,506 --> 01:58:07,996
Oh, we're so dead.

1682
01:58:08,107 --> 01:58:10,439
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1683
01:58:10,743 --> 01:58:11,732
Where's the Cube?

1684
01:58:11,844 --> 01:58:12,811
- Right there.
- Okay.

1685
01:58:12,912 --> 01:58:13,901
And take that and wrap it around

1686
01:58:14,013 --> 01:58:14,980
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1687
01:58:15,081 --> 01:58:17,743
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1688
01:58:19,185 --> 01:58:20,652
That building.

1689
01:58:24,424 --> 01:58:26,221
- Okay.
- What?

1690
01:58:26,325 --> 01:58:29,294
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1691
01:58:29,395 --> 01:58:31,659
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

1692
01:58:31,764 --> 01:58:33,959
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1693
01:58:34,066 --> 01:58:36,000
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

1694
01:58:36,102 --> 01:58:40,505
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1695
01:58:40,606 --> 01:58:42,836
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1696
01:58:42,942 --> 01:58:45,001
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1697
01:58:45,144 --> 01:58:46,634
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

1698
01:58:46,746 --> 01:58:47,906
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

1699
01:58:48,014 --> 01:58:50,710
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1700
01:58:52,185 --> 01:58:53,243
Army Black Hawk requested.

1701
01:58:53,352 --> 01:58:55,877
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1702
01:58:55,988 --> 01:58:58,513
<i>Headed to rooftop marked by flare.</i>

1703
01:58:58,624 --> 01:59:01,718
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

1704
01:59:03,329 --> 01:59:06,662
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

1705
01:59:10,636 --> 01:59:14,766
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1706
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:20,638
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1707
01:59:20,746 --> 01:59:23,977
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

1708
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:28,812
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1709
01:59:35,261 --> 01:59:36,558
Watch out!

1710
01:59:42,168 --> 01:59:45,194
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

1711
01:59:45,304 --> 01:59:46,965
Get out of here now!

1712
02:00:14,834 --> 02:00:15,801
Megatron!

1713
02:00:16,102 --> 02:00:17,069
Prime.

1714
02:00:43,029 --> 02:00:45,088
Humans don't deserve to live.

1715
02:00:45,197 --> 02:00:47,859
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1716
02:00:48,301 --> 02:00:50,667
Then you will die with them!

1717
02:00:56,342 --> 02:00:58,742
Join them in extinction!

1718
02:01:17,964 --> 02:01:19,625
Keep moving, Sam!

1719
02:01:20,633 --> 02:01:21,998
Don't stop!

1720
02:01:38,017 --> 02:01:39,006
No!

1721
02:01:54,233 --> 02:01:56,326
Sam, get to the building!

1722
02:02:04,243 --> 02:02:06,370
Give me that Cube, boy!

1723
02:02:19,025 --> 02:02:21,118
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1724
02:02:42,481 --> 02:02:45,939
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1725
02:02:51,257 --> 02:02:54,385
I smell you, boy!

1726
02:03:06,605 --> 02:03:07,765
Maggot!

1727
02:03:26,792 --> 02:03:28,384
Oh, no!

1728
02:03:52,952 --> 02:03:54,783
I'll drive! You shoot!

1729
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:17,038
This isn't going well!

1730
02:04:17,143 --> 02:04:18,542
Shoot! Shoot!

1731
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:05,618
Nice shot.

1732
02:05:05,724 --> 02:05:09,182
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

1733
02:05:19,672 --> 02:05:20,730
Hey!

1734
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:27,646
Hey! I'm over here!

1735
02:05:39,992 --> 02:05:41,687
We've got the boy.

1736
02:05:46,298 --> 02:05:47,731
Watch out!

1737
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:49,294
Missile!

1738
02:05:59,778 --> 02:06:01,211
Hang on, Sam!

1739
02:06:09,955 --> 02:06:11,286
No! No!

1740
02:06:16,996 --> 02:06:22,024
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1741
02:06:35,581 --> 02:06:37,048
Where do I go?

1742
02:06:38,384 --> 02:06:42,343
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1743
02:06:43,656 --> 02:06:45,283
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1744
02:06:49,461 --> 02:06:51,895
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1745
02:06:52,031 --> 02:06:54,829
Oh, so unwise.

1746
02:07:06,779 --> 02:07:08,269
I got you, boy.

1747
02:07:10,082 --> 02:07:11,879
Hold on to the Cube!

1748
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:34,437
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

1749
02:07:39,445 --> 02:07:40,469
Sam?

1750
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:47,981
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1751
02:07:48,721 --> 02:07:50,188
No sacrifice,

1752
02:07:51,557 --> 02:07:54,617
- no victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron,

1753
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,451
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1754
02:07:57,863 --> 02:08:01,060
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1755
02:08:01,533 --> 02:08:03,000
Get behind me.

1756
02:08:04,703 --> 02:08:07,263
It's you and me, Megatron.

1757
02:08:07,373 --> 02:08:10,308
No, it's just me, Prime.

1758
02:08:12,745 --> 02:08:17,876
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1759
02:08:23,288 --> 02:08:28,123
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1760
02:08:47,279 --> 02:08:49,679
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1761
02:08:49,782 --> 02:08:52,250
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1762
02:08:52,351 --> 02:08:53,375
Hey.

1763
02:08:54,586 --> 02:08:56,747
Bring the rain. All right?

1764
02:08:57,156 --> 02:08:59,147
All right, let's kill these things.

1765
02:09:01,126 --> 02:09:02,684
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

1766
02:09:02,795 --> 02:09:04,786
Armor's weak under the chest.

1767
02:09:14,873 --> 02:09:16,431
Target marked. Still waiting.

1768
02:09:16,542 --> 02:09:18,567
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

1769
02:09:25,517 --> 02:09:27,610
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1770
02:09:32,858 --> 02:09:34,291
Move out!

1771
02:09:37,529 --> 02:09:38,757
Incoming!

1772
02:09:47,306 --> 02:09:49,399
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

1773
02:10:08,060 --> 02:10:09,891
Run! Move!

1774
02:10:17,402 --> 02:10:18,926
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

1775
02:10:22,441 --> 02:10:24,033
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

1776
02:10:24,143 --> 02:10:26,611
<i>- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...</i>

1777
02:10:35,354 --> 02:10:37,515
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

1778
02:10:41,593 --> 02:10:43,686
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

1779
02:10:44,062 --> 02:10:45,359
Take him out!

1780
02:10:59,578 --> 02:11:00,909
Two's down!

1781
02:11:10,355 --> 02:11:12,289
I'll kill you!

1782
02:11:12,391 --> 02:11:15,155
Mine! All Spark!

1783
02:11:16,128 --> 02:11:18,995
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1784
02:11:19,698 --> 02:11:20,722
Sam!

1785
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:22,794
No, Sam!

1786
02:11:48,627 --> 02:11:49,787
Hold up.

1787
02:11:52,898 --> 02:11:55,867
You left me no choice, brother.

1788
02:12:05,477 --> 02:12:08,344
Sam, I owe you my life.

1789
02:12:09,481 --> 02:12:11,210
We are in your debt.

1790
02:12:30,736 --> 02:12:33,136
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1791
02:12:34,006 --> 02:12:35,303
Jazz.

1792
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:40,705
We lost a great comrade

1793
02:12:42,047 --> 02:12:43,912
but gained new ones.

1794
02:12:44,182 --> 02:12:46,480
Thank you, all of you.

1795
02:12:46,818 --> 02:12:49,184
You honor us with your bravery.

1796
02:12:50,222 --> 02:12:52,190
Permission to speak, sir?

1797
02:12:52,691 --> 02:12:55,558
Permission granted, old friend.

1798
02:12:55,661 --> 02:12:57,128
You speak now?

1799
02:12:58,063 --> 02:13:00,156
I wish to stay with the boy.

1800
02:13:01,033 --> 02:13:02,864
If that is his choice.

1801
02:13:07,806 --> 02:13:08,830
Yes.

1802
02:13:29,494 --> 02:13:34,227
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1803
02:13:34,766 --> 02:13:37,792
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1804
02:13:38,437 --> 02:13:41,736
<i>The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,</i>

1805
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:43,933
<i>deepest place on our planet.</i>

1806
02:13:44,176 --> 02:13:47,703
<i>The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,</i>

1807
02:13:47,813 --> 02:13:50,008
<i>would crush and entomb them,</i>

1808
02:13:51,817 --> 02:13:53,546
<i>leaving no evidence.</i>

1809
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:04,595
<i>With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

1810
02:14:06,331 --> 02:14:08,925
<i>And fate has yielded its reward,</i>

1811
02:14:10,469 --> 02:14:13,370
<i>a new world to call home.</i>

1812
02:14:19,644 --> 02:14:23,842
<i>We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,</i>

1813
02:14:23,982 --> 02:14:26,746
<i>but watching over them in secret,</i>

1814
02:14:26,985 --> 02:14:29,545
<i>waiting, protecting.</i>

1815
02:14:30,956 --> 02:14:33,982
<i>I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.</i>

1816
02:14:34,593 --> 02:14:37,585
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

1817
02:14:37,696 --> 02:14:42,633
<i>like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.</i>

1818
02:14:44,169 --> 02:14:46,660
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

1819
02:14:47,072 --> 02:14:50,439
<i>and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots</i>

1820
02:14:50,542 --> 02:14:53,534
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

1821
02:14:54,579 --> 02:14:56,308
<i>We are here.</i>

1822
02:14:56,882 --> 02:14:58,907
<i>We are waiting.</i>

1823
02:15:18,203 --> 02:15:23,231
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1824
02:15:26,244 --> 02:15:31,739
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1825
02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:34,250
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1826
02:15:34,619 --> 02:15:37,053
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1827
02:15:37,155 --> 02:15:38,816
The government would let us know.

1828
02:15:38,990 --> 02:15:40,582
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

1829
02:15:40,692 --> 02:15:43,126
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1830
02:15:43,228 --> 02:15:44,855
because there's no secrets.

1831
02:15:44,963 --> 02:15:47,056
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1832
02:15:57,108 --> 02:16:00,407
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
