No! No! No! No! No!

4
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:08,855
- No! No!
- Die!

5
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,733
<i>Colonel Redding.
Now there's a piece of work.</i>

6
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,405
<i>I can't believe he's having us
wire up this hellhole.</i>

7
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,383
<i>He's obsessed with something.
What's he expecting to find down there?</i>

8
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,749
Ghosts of old miners?

9
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,916
They're here!
Hey.

10
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,289
You ready to test 'em?

11
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,294
All right. You got everybody?

12
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,263
Number one's dead.

13
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,493
Oh.

14
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:26,294
How about now?

15
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,933
<i>- Whoa. Good there.
- How about the security dummies?</i>

16
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,240
They're dead too.

17
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,606
Hold on.

18
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,044
<i>What the hell?</i>

19
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,746
<i>What you got?</i>

20
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,020
<i>- I got a shitload of false readings. Stand by.
- Again?</i>

21
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,028
<i>- What's going on in here?
- Damn it!</i>

22
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:56,127
- We just lost our feed.
- I'll go check the main junction.

23
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:01,035
<i>Spooky down there, isn't it?</i>

24
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:05,271
<i>We were the first ones
in there since the '50s.</i>

25
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:09,007
<i>Maybe it is haunted.
Glad it's you and not me in there.</i>

26
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,682
Aw, fuck!

27
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,313
<i>- What's with the junction box?
- It's history.</i>

28
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,914
Our friends the rats again.

29
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,256
They love the taste
of the insulation.

30
00:04:55,328 --> 00:05:00,766
All right, I'll call base. Should be able
to get a backup here in an hour or so. Shit.

31
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,097
Dr. Wilson,
have you seen Foster?

32
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,699
Calibrating the infrared sensor
up top the mountain.

33
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,676
- Dumb sons of bitches.
- Sorry, Colonel Redding.

34
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,942
<i>Guys aren't supposed to be here
without a goddamn escort!</i>

35
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,181
Wilson.

36
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,061
Wilson?

37
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,654
<i>Wilson, come in.</i>

38
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,375
<i>Where are these guys?</i>

39
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:47,708
<i>Han, do you read me? It's Foster.</i>

40
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,777
<i>Han, come in.</i>

41
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,245
<i>Han, it's Foster.</i>

42
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:01,119
Hi.

43
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,760
Are you... lost?

44
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,936
My name is Dr. Foster.
Uh-

45
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,166
Do you- Do you have a name?

46
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,643
- "Roonawee."
- "Roonawee"?

47
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,343
- Run away!
- Run away?

48
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,647
Foster?

49
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,524
Foster!

50
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,001
<i>Now, where are you?
Come on.</i>

51
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,904
Come out of your holes.

52
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,637
Come on, you cocksucker
motherfucker sons of bitches!

53
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,310
Foster!

54
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:46,195
- Go! Go! Move out! Move out! Go!
- Keep moving! Keep mov-

55
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,564
<i>Go!</i>

56
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,603
- Oh, shit!
- Take cover!

57
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,196
<i>Come on, Crank!</i>

58
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,731
- Whoa!
- Ow!

59
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,712
- Leave it!
- I gotta get my helmet.

60
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,443
<i>Spitter, forget your fucking helmet!
Get back here!</i>

61
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,945
- It's not supposed to be this bad!
- Die!

62
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,513
<i>- America's mothers suck cock!
- What the fuck did you say?</i>

63
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,752
<i>- Your American mothers suck cock!
- Uh, Crank?</i>

64
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,388
<i>Fuck you!
America number one, bitch!</i>

65
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,955
<i>Crank, no! No!</i>

66
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,501
- Crank!
- Let's move, pussies!

67
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,905
Crank, you dumb motherfucker!
Don't freak out!

68
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,008
<i>- I know what to do. Get out of the way.
- Give him some cover!</i>

69
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,176
<i>- I got this. I got this.
- You get out!</i>

70
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,981
<i>- This is fortress of Allah!
- Napoleon, get the door.</i>

71
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,988
<i>- What?
- Get the door, man!</i>

72
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,025
- I can't hear you!
- Get the fuckin' door!
- Fuck!

73
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,789
<i>- This is the mother of all doors!
- Fall back!</i>

74
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,194
- Shit! Take cover!
- Run!

75
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:55,097
Shit!

76
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:03,099
Mama!

77
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,803
<i>You killed my babies!</i>

78
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,673
<i>- You killed my babies! You killed my babies!
- Watch out.</i>

79
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,946
<i>- Watch her.
- We didn't mean to.</i>

80
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:17,386
- No! Napoleon!
- Kaboom!

81
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,516
Oh, you're dead.

82
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,561
Idiot!

83
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:28,123
A stunning display of
individual and group stupidity.

84
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,193
Seventeen civilians killed,
and yourselves.

85
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,865
I'm in fucking awe!

86
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,036
Cole! Never leave cover
to retrieve your helmet!

87
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,908
You won't have a head
to put it on anyway.

88
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,542
<i>Johnson, do not drop your weapon
to protect your ears.</i>

89
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,848
You are better off
deaf than dead.

90
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,219
Medina, since you are not
Rambo resurrected...

91
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,088
do not charge while
your head is securely up your ass.

92
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,755
That's how innocent people get killed.
And you, Napoleon.

93
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,199
- It's Napoli, Sarge.
- You're quite the killer, aren't you, Napoleon?

94
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,896
Almost got your whole squad
blown to hell in six seconds.

95
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,098
<i>That's a mighty impressive body count
for somebody who's against the war.</i>

96
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,166
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Your brother didn't tell you?

97
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,438
Pretty mouth here's
got himself a bumper sticker.

98
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,004
It says,
"Conversation, not confrontation."

99
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:20,609
- What's up with that shit?
- You against the war, Doonesbury?

100
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,917
Not all wars, Sarge. I just think
that the president lies too much.

101
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:27,117
All presidents lie, asshole!
That's their fucking job.

102
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:31,186
- Yes, sir.
- No president has told the truth since Truman.

103
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,288
- And do you know what he said?
- No, Sarge.

104
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:37,233
<i>He said that
the buck stops here!</i>

105
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,238
Now, you have all
failed combat...

106
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,240
and are therefore
officially dead.

107
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,708
Congratu-fucking-lations.

108
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,211
Fall in at that deuce and a half
with all gear.

109
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,907
<i>We will deploy to the
Agave Ridge rifle range.</i>

110
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,746
There, you can complete your
failure of these exercises...

111
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,844
by blowin' each other's
dead heads off!

112
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,822
And on our way,
we're stopping at Sector 16...

113
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,792
to deliver equipment to scientists
who are working there.

114
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,560
This is a top secret area,
so do not wander off or talk to anybody.

115
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,398
Now, get your sorry rookie butts
in the back of that truck, now!

116
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,403
Let's go! Let's go!

117
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,271
Let's go, Spitter! If I had some steak
on a string, you'd move real fast!

118
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,927
Jesus!
How big is this place?

119
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:48,599
It's about 1,300 square miles.
They used to test nuclear weapons here.

120
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:52,110
Well, isn't it radioactive then?

121
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:55,806
- Not according to the army.
- Fuck.

122
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,441
<i>Maybe I should thank Napoleon.</i>

123
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,954
<i>If we're all officially dead
like Sarge said...</i>

124
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,752
<i>I won't be tried
for war crimes.</i>

125
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:08,850
The killing of innocent mannequins
is serious shit.

126
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,453
<i>- Where I come from, it's never good to be dead.
- Aw, Crank.</i>

127
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,964
You're takin' all the fun
out of the afterlife.

128
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,558
Shove the afterlife up your ass.

129
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,798
<i>- That's cold, man.
- Clyde, huh?</i>

130
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:24,172
Made the same mistake when I was a kid.
So is Clyde still your dude?

131
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,041
Uh, yeah, Stump.
Clyde's still my dude.

132
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,476
Stump, that's her son.
He's, like, four years old.

133
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,179
That is so fucked up.

134
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,018
<i>One good thing
about being dead-</i>

135
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,024
Wouldn't have to listen
to all your bullshit.

136
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,858
- Oh.
- That's all there is out here.
Just a bunch of bullshit.

137
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,863
This bullshit's
got a crazy past.

138
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,957
You guys know they used to use this
as a test ground for A-bombs?

139
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,060
<i>You guys know
this used to be a test ground for A-bombs?</i>

140
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:55,265
<i>- Who the fuck asked you, peace-ass shit boy?
- Oh, right.</i>

141
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,435
I'm sorry. I forgot I was
dealing with Rambo resurrected.

142
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,707
You Rambo resurrect my balls, bitch.

143
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,444
You with the-

144
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:09,078
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Come on, Crank!</i>

145
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,622
<i>- You wanna die young, cabrón?
- You guys, stop!</i>

146
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,215
- I'll kill you right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Crank!

147
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,258
I killed somebody once.

148
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,735
It was easy.
That's why it's so dangerous.

149
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,111
I don't fuckin'
like that guy.

150
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:37,376
Well, I don't like bein' out here havin'
to put up with you, but I deal with it.

151
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,316
<i>So deal with it.</i>

152
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,486
<i>- Thanks.
- Don't mind Crank.</i>

153
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,222
He's just
a cranky motherfucker.

154
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:40,669
<i>- They're so top secret, they're invisible, huh?
- You got that right.</i>

155
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,120
Hello!

156
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,856
- Oh, leg's asleep.
- Dick's asleep.

157
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,529
- You wanna wake it up?
- Nah, that's your daddy's job.

158
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,538
Hey, you two, cut the bullshit.

159
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,700
Off-load that crate.
Put it in the tent. Spitter, get me base.

160
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:14,177
National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base. Over.

161
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:18,878
<i>National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner

162
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,748
Over.

163
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,879
<i>- Nothing, sir. It's the hills.
- Keep trying.</i>

164
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:33,864
<i>National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
to Yuma Flats Base. Over.</i>

165
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,270
Hello?

166
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,872
- Private Crackhead.
- Sarge?

167
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:46,035
See if you can find Colonel Redding.
He's supposed to be the security over here.

168
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:51,743
See these cables? They run into that old bunker
over there. Check it out. Watch your step.

169
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,115
- Yes, sir, Sergeant.
- Private Mickey Mouse.

170
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,986
See if you can find some gas. There's gotta
be some cans around here somewhere.

171
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,183
Yes, Sergeant.

172
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:07,060
Napoleon,
where the fuck are you goin'?

173
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,600
- I was just gonna use the facility.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

174
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:13,399
You are in mountain assault training.
There are no port-a-potties in Kandahar.

175
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,703
You will take your dumps
behind the cactus with the scorpions.

176
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,266
- Do you understand me?
- What do I use for T.P., sir?

177
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:22,142
Use your fuckin' hand.

178
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,148
Yes, Sarge.

179
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,293
<i>Yo!</i>

180
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,826
Colonel Redding?

181
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,728
Stupid bats!

182
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,107
No gas, sir,
but I found this.

183
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,979
Satellite phone.
Must've been how they contacted base.

184
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,314
<i>- I don't think it's working.
- Man, somebody's got a temper.</i>

185
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,049
Mine's all buttoned up, Sarge.
Nobody's home.

186
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,648
Whose radio's that?

187
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:45,129
<i>- Must be one of theirs.
- Wilson? Han? You there?</i>

188
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:53,168
- Hello?
- Who the fuck is this?

189
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,672
This is Sergeant Jeffrey Millstone
of the U.S. National Guard.

190
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,800
<i>Who is this,
and what's your position?</i>

191
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,470
<i>I need help.</i>

192
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,406
<i>I'm up the hill.</i>

193
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,145
<i>Are you in distress?</i>

194
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,188
Fuck! Spitter, what's
the range on these things?

195
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,223
Couple miles.
Line of sight.

196
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,818
- Sarge.
- Looks like a signal mirror.

197
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,863
<i>It's gotta be him.</i>

198
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,331
- We're on a search and rescue mission.
- That's right, we are!

199
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,335
Shut the fuck up!

200
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,736
I said search and rescue,
not fuckin' spring break.

201
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:31,742
I want you back here with weapons
and gear for a climbing assault in five.

202
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,371
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Sarge.

203
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,280
No disrespect, but do you
really think it's a good idea...

204
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,284
goin' up there without
contacting headquarters?

205
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,617
Do you like
fucking with me, Napoleon?

206
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,589
I think you do.
You know what?

207
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,353
You're officially in charge
of guarding the latrine.

208
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,292
Not using it,
but guarding it.

209
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,388
I want you to stand on one leg
and hold your rifle over your fucking head...

210
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,060
and make sure that no one
steals or molests that port-a-potty...

211
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:00,161
or I will have your Gomer Pyle ass
court-martialed immediately.

212
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:03,036
Do you understand what I'm saying
to you? Do you understand me?

213
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,338
Yeah, I'll go.
I just think that it's a bad idea.

214
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,379
- Get over there and guard
that fuckin' latrine, now!
- Sir, yes, sir!

215
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,149
- Live ammo or blanks?
- One live mag each weapon. It's heavier.

216
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:18,747
Flashlights and hydration packs too.
The more weight, the better for you clowns.

217
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,419
<i>You're halfway through your training,
and you look like a bunch of raw recruits.</i>

218
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,430
<i>You're a disgrace to the U.S. National Guard,
and you wouldn't last five minutes in combat.</i>

219
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,831
One leg, Gomer Pyle!

220
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:32,165
<i>The rest of you,
get your asses up that hill.</i>

221
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:36,571
<i>And wipe those silly smiles
off your faces now!</i>

222
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,671
Let's move!
One leg, Pyle!

223
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,843
<i>One leg!</i>

224
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,351
- You're so bad.
- Company, halt! Johnson!

225
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,449
- Sir?
- You stay here.

226
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,962
<i>Spitter's coming with us. Get on
the main radio and try to raise somebody.</i>

227
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:01,260
If you can get through to a medevac,
the guy'll have a hell of a better chance.

228
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,769
- Now, move.
- Yes, Sarge.

229
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,770
Don't forget to write.

230
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:12,208
Get goin'! Turn around!
One leg!

231
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,200
<i>One leg, Gomer Pyle!</i>

232
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:41,436
<i>Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...</i>

233
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,974
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

234
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,306
Over.

235
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,712
Hello?

236
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,745
<i>Shit.</i>

237
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,425
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

238
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,962
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

239
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,895
Over.

240
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,559
What the hell are scientists
doing way the hell out here?

241
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,568
There's nothing but
rocks and rattlesnakes.

242
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:14,605
Army business, dumb ass,
and definitely none of your business.

243
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,834
But, Sarge,
I am in the army.

244
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,502
Which gives you the right
to shut the fuck up!

245
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,910
Okay. I'll just
shut the fuck up then.

246
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,914
How many people
are supposed to be here?

247
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,712
I have no idea.
Maybe we can ask him up there.

248
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,185
<i>What are we supposed
to do when we find this dude?</i>

249
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,188
Well, it depends
on how bad he is.

250
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,690
We wait for a medevac,
or we'll hump him down by hand.

251
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:37,524
I know I'm not supposed to talk,
Sarge, but I hope-

252
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,429
<i>Shit, man!</i>

253
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,697
Come on, pull!
I got you, Mickey!

254
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,536
<i>Hello?</i>

255
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,543
<i>- Shit.
- You saved my life, Sarge.</i>

256
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,341
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

257
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,347
<i>How far down does that thing go?</i>

258
00:21:57,415 --> 00:22:00,009
<i>China?</i>

259
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,380
Could be a hundred feet deep
or a hundred years old.

260
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,222
Just waitin' to suck
your ass in.

261
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:13,060
So keep your eyes open.
There's a lot of old mines around here.

262
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,895
- How's your ankle, Mickey?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's go.

263
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:22,397
- We cannot afford to slow down.
- Come on, Sarge. Let's go.

264
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,240
- Ow!
- Head back to base camp.

265
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,439
- Oh, come on, Sarge.
- Mick, back to camp.

266
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,950
Now.
That's an order.

267
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,583
What the fuck is everybody
lookin' at? Let's keep movin'!

268
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,839
Screw it.

269
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:04,275
- Hey! You're not supposed to do that.
- Duty calls.

270
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,512
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

271
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,920
<i>calling the Yuma Flats Base

00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,484
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

274
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,963
<i>This is the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner

275
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,223
- Oh, fuck! Fuck!
- What?

276
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,289
- There's a hand in the shitter!
- What?

277
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:59,827
Check it out!
Oh, fuckin'-

278
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,740
Oh!

279
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:11,145
There's nobody in there.

280
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,810
Down... there.

281
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:34,569
- Who was that guy?
- Shit-Man the Barbarian! I have no idea!

282
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,834
Help me!

283
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:43,740
<i>- Oh, man.
- Oh, God!</i>

284
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,418
<i>I can't tell one rock from another.</i>

285
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:53,617
It was between those three.

286
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:58,391
Seems like that's
the only way up right there.

287
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,454
- That ain't so bad.
- Nah, man.

288
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,625
Not so bad at all...

289
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,601
if you're
a fuckin' squirrel.

290
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:19,210
- What's with all these cuts?
- I don't know.

291
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,427
Who did this to you?

292
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,592
They're... here.

293
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,470
Who's they?

294
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,175
None of the cuts
were that deep.

295
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,583
- Massive infection.
- What?

296
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:59,453
Shit stinks because it's full of pathogens.

297
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:03,517
Whoever did this to him
wanted him to die slowly.

298
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,688
What kind of person
could do that to someone?

299
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,426
I honestly don't know.

300
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,934
Let's go, Delmar.

301
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,033
<i>There you go.</i>

302
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,839
<i>Pick your spots.</i>

303
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,687
Find the creases.

304
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,115
<i>You got it.
You got it!</i>

305
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,099
<i>- Ow!
- Keep goin', soldier.</i>

306
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:48,637
There you go. That's what
I'm talkin' about, Delmar.

307
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:52,073
<i>- Whoo! Nice!
- All right. All right!</i>

308
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,646
<i>- All right!
- Yeah! Spider-Man!</i>

309
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:01,981
You are officially
a bad motherfucker.

310
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:06,513
<i>Stump, you're up next.
The rest of you, get your asses ready.</i>

311
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,738
Love you, Mommy.

312
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,187
<i>Take your time and pick your spots, Stump.</i>

313
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,554
Asshole!

314
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,596
Oh, easy.
Sarge says we're moving out.

315
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,597
Well, make some noise
next time you come up behind me!

316
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,533
Yeah, whatever.
Look, I'm just the messenger.

317
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,429
<i>Chicks, man.</i>

318
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,283
Hello? Hello?

319
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,811
<i>Over. Hello?
Hello? Over.</i>

320
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,791
<i>- Hello? Hello? Over.
- You get through to 'em?</i>

321
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,058
This radio sucks!

322
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,263
Hello? Sarge?
Anybody?

323
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,609
Holy shit!

324
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,272
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, no, no!

325
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,839
- No!
- Oh, my God!

326
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,288
- Shit!
- What are you doin'?

327
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,325
- Fuck!
- What?

328
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,089
Where's your rifle?

329
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,359
<i>Oh, God, it's gone!</i>

330
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,995
Oh, God!

331
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,367
- Let's just get up there.
- No, no, no, no, no. We're not goin' up that hill.

332
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,003
I'm not hiding down here
waiting for them to come down!

333
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,445
What? You scared?

334
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:15,111
It's not about being scared. It's about not
making idiotic and possibly fatal decisions.

335
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,620
Right. I forgot
who I was speaking to.

336
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,783
The same genius
who got his whole squad blown to hell.

337
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:26,194
Didn't you hear what he said?
Someone is here. You wanna die like him?

338
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,529
Let's just get up
with the others.

339
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:37,569
Hello, Sarge?
Hello, Sarge?

340
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,879
<i>Hello? Sarge?
Anyone?</i>

341
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,750
Can anybody out there read me?

342
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,627
Napoleon!

343
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:34,722
- What?
- I don't know-

344
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,736
Amber!

345
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,296
Hey!

346
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,312
Hey!

347
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:58,950
Napoleon!

348
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,661
Did I hit him?

349
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,667
Mickey! Mickey!

350
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:23,009
- Hey, who was that?
- Mickey, something's going on!
Oh, God. Are you all right?

351
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,573
Yeah, I just twisted my ankle-

352
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,017
Hold on!

353
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:33,251
Holy shit! Fuck!

354
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,589
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you!

355
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,652
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

356
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:40,663
- Shit!
- Hold on! I got you!

357
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:44,326
Shoot the fucker! Shoot him!

358
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,530
<i>- Shoot him!
- I can't see in there!</i>

359
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,101
I don't have a shot!

360
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,873
Fucking help me, man!

361
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,018
<i>Don't let go! Mickey!</i>

362
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,521
Oh, God!
Oh!

363
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,690
Mickey!

364
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:22,163
<i>- Oh, God!
- Mickey!</i>

365
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,168
Man, this is some bullshit.

366
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,714
- What?
- Thought I heard something.

367
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,223
<i>- A shot.
- This is a military base.</i>

368
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,817
People are shootin'
all over the place.

369
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,888
I think it came from camp. Has anybody
checked in with Amber recently?

370
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:51,093
Mickey's down there by now.
You know he's got her in a tent...

371
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,467
and they're doin'
a whole nother kind of training.

372
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,563
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

373
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,733
<i>- Sarge, up there!
- I see it!</i>

374
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:01,869
- Another one.
- You two, get your asses up here!

375
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,039
Come on.

376
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,606
<i>Hello!</i>

377
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,816
Hello!

378
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:20,396
Oh, no.

379
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,702
The red and black high-top forces.
What?

380
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,969
- And it's my size too?
- What the fuck's it doing way up here?

381
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,636
Now, if we could only find
the other ones, we'd be in business.

382
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,737
<i>Sarge, over here!</i>

383
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,981
<i>Sarge!</i>

384
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,117
<i>What the fuck is in his head?</i>

385
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,928
<i>- Private Crackhead, fish it out.
- Huh?</i>

386
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,627
<i>Shit.</i>

387
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:10,969
"Dr. Paul Foster.
Department of Defense."

388
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,984
Looks like we found
one of our scientists.

389
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,189
- Lock and load.
- This isn't supposed to happen
on an army base, man.

390
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,953
<i>- In the middle of a U.S. military facility.
- The size of Rhode Island.</i>

391
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,484
Look, if some asshole wants to go nuts,
this is a damn good place to do it.

392
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,827
<i>Spitter, get Amber on the radio.</i>

393
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,994
Stark Nine. Stark Nine. Amber,
this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

394
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:39,600
Stark Nine. Stark Nine.
Amber, this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

395
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,776
There's too much interference.

396
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,184
<i>- Sarge, we should go back down-
- Amber's fine. She's got Mick and Napoleon.</i>

397
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,245
<i>- Help me.
- That their radio?</i>

398
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:56,020
Let me have it.
Colonel Redding, is this you?

399
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,693
Hello?
Can you hear me?

400
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,405
<i>That wasn't
the same voice as before.</i>

401
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:11,839
<i>Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.
But if somebody's hurt, we're gonna help him.</i>

402
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,309
<i>And if somebody is fucking with us,
we're gonna find out who it is.</i>

403
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,370
- Sarge-
- I told you before, this isn't spring break.

404
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,212
One way or the other,
lives are at stake.

405
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,412
That's how it is.

406
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,421
<i>Crank, Spitter,
you stay with me on lead.</i>

407
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:28,856
Missy, Stump, Delmar,
you bring up the rear. Watch our backs.

408
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,589
Stay alert and stay alive.
Let's move.

409
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,472
You hear somethin'?

410
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,576
I don't know.
Maybe a bird?

411
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:32,121
- Keep your eyes open.
- Okay.

412
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,925
What the fuck was that?

413
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,906
Aw, shit!

414
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,410
- What the fuck-
- No!

415
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,503
<i>Sarge!</i>

416
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,516
- Spitter! Fuck!
- Oh, fuck, man! Sarge!

417
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:03,280
That was Spit, man.

418
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,322
<i>Sarge!</i>

419
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,357
<i>- Sarge!
- I didn't mean to do that!</i>

420
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,087
<i>Sarge!</i>

421
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,762
You hurt? You hurt?

422
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,800
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Do what?

423
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,961
Sarge!
Sarge! Sarge!

424
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,005
Sarge!

425
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:24,632
- What do we do?
- Go get me the medi-pack.

426
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:28,474
Medi-pack? D!
Medi-pack! Bring it over here!

427
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,486
Fuck, man! Fuck.

428
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,825
- What happened?
- I swear, man, this dude
just popped out of nowhere.

429
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,054
<i>- He stabbed Spit in the back.
- Hey, man.</i>

430
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,154
<i>I didn't mean to.
Fuck, man.</i>

431
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,223
<i>- Is he okay? Is he okay?
- Sarge?</i>

432
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,466
Sarge?
Come on, breathe.

433
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,735
Breathe, Sarge.

434
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,003
Sarge, stay with us.

435
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,011
<i>- Sarge!
- What do we need?</i>

436
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,013
What do you need?

437
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,174
<i>Crank!</i>

438
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,184
Missy,
what do you need?

439
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,346
<i>Crank! Crank!
Tell them, man! Tell them!</i>

440
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,721
<i>It was an accident.
It was a fucking accident.</i>

441
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:21,591
They're fucking with us.
These guys are smart.

442
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,569
<i>Amber?
Where's Mickey?</i>

443
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,798
Watch between the rocks.
Under your feet too.

444
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,599
- That's how they got Mickey?
- That's how they did it.

445
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,663
God.

446
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:10,510
What is it?

447
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,710
<i>What do you see, Delmar?</i>

448
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,879
It's nothin'.
We're almost there.

449
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:34,166
All right, guys.
Let's rig a line and get Sarge down.

450
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:38,436
- I'm going down with him.
- Sorry, Spit. I don't know how
to rig for a two-man.

451
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,443
<i>- Yeah, me either, man.
- I can do it.</i>

452
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:46,509
All right. All right.
Let's make it happen.

453
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,123
- You need two, right?
- Yeah.

454
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,921
<i>Oh, and a couple
of those carabiners.</i>

455
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,291
<i>Prop him up.</i>

456
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,766
Yo, prop him up.

457
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,804
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Double bowline.

458
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,862
<i>- Right knot for the job.
- You sure about that?</i>

459
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,001
- I was an Eagle Scout.
- It better fuckin' hold.

460
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,273
Come on, Spit.
Let's do it.

461
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:28,315
You ready?
All right.

462
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,292
I'm sorry, Spitter.
It's the only way.

463
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,995
If he's loose, he'll fall out of his harness.
Okay?

464
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,003
Mm-hmm.

465
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,835
Okay.

466
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:48,071
<i>- See you down there, cabrón.
- Okay, man.</i>

467
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,875
Okay?

468
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,746
Easy. Easy.

469
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:56,752
<i>Okay.</i>

470
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,015
<i>You got it, Spitter.</i>

471
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,023
All right, man.
Plant your feet.

472
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,150
Take it easy.

473
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,320
<i>Right there, Spitter.
You got it. Plant your feet, man.</i>

474
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,455
<i>- You're doin' good, Spitter.
- Little more. Little more.</i>

475
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,021
Right there.

476
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,068
<i>Napoleon, get your thumb
out of your ass and help us out!</i>

477
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,001
<i>- You comfortable?
- Yeah.</i>

478
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,199
<i>You're looking good, man.
Keep it right there.</i>

479
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,401
<i>- All right, slow down. I'm about to lose visual.
- Slow down a little.</i>

480
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:22,775
<i>Keep it slow, Spitter.</i>

481
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:24,780
<i>Yo, slow down.
Slow down.</i>

482
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:29,751
<i>Spitter! Spitter! Spit-</i>

483
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,551
- Spitter!
- What happened?

484
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,092
<i>What- What happened?</i>

485
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,958
<i>- What happened?
- He's fuckin' dead, man.</i>

486
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,089
<i>- What the fuck happened?
- He's fuckin' dead.</i>

487
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:52,034
Your fuckin' knot didn't hold,
you lying faggot!

488
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,873
<i>- The rope must've broke.
- The rope didn't break.</i>

489
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,879
<i>- Exactly.
- It was cut.</i>

490
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,946
Oh, man, we're gettin' picked off
one by one here.

491
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,716
You motherfuckers!

492
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,758
You motherfuckers are dead!

493
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,987
<i>You hear me?</i>

494
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,258
Dead!

495
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,299
Aw, shit!

496
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,459
Where are the ropes?

497
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:22,437
<i>- Hey, who's got the rest of the ropes?
- I put 'em up there.</i>

498
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,339
They're gone.
They're not here.

499
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,071
We can't get down
without the ropes.

500
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,672
<i>Who the hell is doing all of
this fuckin' bullshit to us?</i>

501
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,912
<i>Whoever these fuckers are,
they want us dead.</i>

502
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:38,819
<i>No, that's where they want us-
thinkin' we got no chance.</i>

503
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,653
We're gonna get out
of this together.

504
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,784
Let's think about that.

505
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,692
<i>- How do we get down?
- There's gotta be a way.</i>

506
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,163
They got up here.
We'll take the same way down.

507
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,641
<i>Watch your step. It's a long way down.</i>

508
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,778
Damn!

509
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,800
<i>You're not gonna like this.</i>

510
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,707
What?

511
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,302
Oh, fuck, man!

512
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,042
Another dead end!

513
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,017
No way we're gettin' down
without ropes. I told you!

514
00:43:42,085 --> 00:43:44,019
We go back and find another way.

515
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,624
Oh, shit!

516
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,024
D., why the fuck are we
moving towards the weird noises?

517
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:53,028
<i>- Just shut the hell up!
- You shut the hell up!</i>

518
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:55,087
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

519
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,937
- D...!
- Shh!

520
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:06,575
Holy shit.

521
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:12,880
- Go ahead and shoot.
- Let's get some first aid.

522
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,043
- Coming up.
- Napoleon, watch our backs.

523
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:18,178
<i>- Got it.
- Colonel Redding.</i>

524
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,088
Just hang on, sir, okay?
We're gonna get you out of here.

525
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,719
Where's your C.O.?
Where's your commanding officer?

526
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,229
We lost him.

527
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:31,097
- Better let me see those wounds, sir.
- You don't have a fucking clue!

528
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:37,401
Shit!

529
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:43,803
Sir, if you know something
we should know, now's the time.

530
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:48,443
<i>I just needed a little proof.</i>

531
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,782
- Proof of what?
- What's going on here, Colonel?

532
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,381
It's not the fucks
in caves...

533
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,427
halfway around the world
that keep me up at night.

534
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,155
<i>Mm-mmm.</i>

535
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:03,290
They're right here in the middle
of our own goddamn base.

536
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,494
<i>People still living
in the mines.</i>

537
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,834
<i>They thought they got rid of them,
but I knew they didn't.</i>

538
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:12,103
- You knew about these fuckers?
- One or two more nights...

539
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:16,134
I-I-I-I could've had 'em
blown back to the Stone Age.

540
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:20,081
Tell us what to do, Colonel.
How do we get out of here?

541
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,084
<i>That's a good fuckin' question, isn't it?</i>

542
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:26,350
You could-You could
go down through the mines...

543
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,256
<i>except they'd kill you
for sure.</i>

544
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,794
All except the girls.

545
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:35,025
You ladies, they'll keep you alive
for breeding...

546
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:37,532
<i>and trying to get
their numbers back up.</i>

547
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,535
What?

548
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:43,699
Yeah, whatever, asshole.
How do we get down this hill?

549
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,335
Simple.

550
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,710
What the fuck?
What the fuck was that, man?

551
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:35,551
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

552
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:41,421
- I'm so fucking scared.
- We're gonna get through this.

553
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,489
<i>We're gonna make it
out of here, okay?</i>

554
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,535
You think?

555
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:49,561
Have to.
I'm the only real family Clyde's got.

556
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:52,233
Give anything just to
smell his hair again.

557
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,744
You never talk about him.

558
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:01,851
Work's work. Family is-
I don't know- sacred.

559
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:04,045
I always tried
keeping the two separate.

560
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,790
I guess that's all bullshit now.

561
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,726
He's beautiful.

562
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,293
Now!

563
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,811
<i>Yeah!</i>

564
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,749
<i>Biatch!</i>

565
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,315
<i>Is he dead?</i>

566
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,290
Fuckin'-A!

567
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,884
Got him.

568
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:48,089
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:51,464
That's the piece of shit
that jumped me back at camp.

570
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,595
<i>I think he killed Mickey too.</i>

571
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,907
Damn.
He's fuckin' ugly.

572
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:05,607
<i>- Fuckin' stinks.
- He's fucking big, man.</i>

573
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:09,243
Still, nothing a little
hot lead can't fix.

574
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,982
<i>Hot lead?
Listen to you, man.</i>

575
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,957
Yeah, well, it's just one.
How many are left?

576
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,994
Hey, bring 'em on, man.

577
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,993
Hey.
You guys did good.

578
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,329
- Thanks.
- Smells like shit.

579
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,529
<i>Yeah! We got this.</i>

580
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,695
Where's Missy?

581
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:58,700
<i>Hey, Missy?</i>

582
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:01,532
- Shit!
- It's Missy!

583
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,800
There!

584
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,240
Watch yourselves.

585
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,720
<i>Missy!</i>

586
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:22,553
Missy!

587
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,390
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on.
Delmar, you heard what that dude said.

588
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,403
We should climb down, man.

589
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,599
<i>- What are you talkin' about?
- I'm talkin' about you and me.</i>

590
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:41,440
We don't need ropes. We can
make it down freestyle no sweat, man.

591
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,411
- Let's just do it.
- What about the rest of us?

592
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,278
- What about Missy?
- We can get down fast, and you know it.

593
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:49,750
The rest of you guys, just-just hang tough,
and we're gonna bring back some help.

594
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:53,186
- Fuck that!
- We stick together. It's the best way.

595
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:54,780
<i>- We separate-
- We're dead.</i>

596
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,588
<i>You got that right.</i>

597
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:02,291
- Stump.
- I'm gonna take my chances, man.

598
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:07,965
<i>Stump. Stay with us, man. Come on.</i>

599
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:12,031
- When I get down, I'm gonna bring back help.
- This is stupid, man!

600
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:14,838
<i>Crank, that is
fuckin' stupid, man.</i>

601
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,007
I'm gonna bring back help.

602
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:23,811
Shit.

603
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:32,117
You guys ready for this?

604
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,254
We got your back.

605
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,178
<i>It stinks in here.</i>

606
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:00,746
<i>- You see anything?
- There's only
one way they could've gone.</i>

607
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,104
Dead end?
Where the fuck are they?

608
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,739
<i>Guys.</i>

609
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,850
Down here.

610
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,639
I can't see shit.

611
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:03,182
I'll check it out.
Wait for my signal.

612
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,167
<i>- You good?
- Clear!</i>

613
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,949
Shit!

614
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:48,623
Oh, God.

615
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:53,067
Oh, my God!

616
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,900
Get 'em off me!

617
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,568
You're fine.
It's all right.

618
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:09,416
Jesus Christ.

619
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,750
<i>You cool, Napoleon?</i>

620
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:15,951
Yeah, I think so.
Aw, Jesus!

621
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:19,290
- Come on, Crank.
- Where the hell are we?

622
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,353
Next level down.

623
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,730
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

624
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,992
Fuck!

625
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,358
It's just fuckin' rocks.

626
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,958
You're not gonna-

627
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,464
I'm not gonna let
you bastards get me.

628
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,499
Not me, not today.
It's not gonna happen.

629
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,508
Hey, guys.

630
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,575
There's a breeze.

631
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:32,357
<i>Hey.</i>

632
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:45,043
Shit.

633
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,253
This is where the fuckers hid
to cut the ropes.

634
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,993
We can't just leave them
down there.

635
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:02,191
<i>There's nothing we can do for 'em now except
find Missy and get the fuck out of here.</i>

636
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,699
Missy's probably
dead too.

637
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:07,998
<i>You're not doing anybody
any good talking like that.</i>

638
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,489
Come on.

639
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,262
<i>Delmar!</i>

640
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,305
Delmar.

641
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:45,427
Help me! Oh, God!

642
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:47,833
Oh, no!

643
00:56:57,246 --> 00:57:00,443
<i>Is it a dead end?</i>

644
00:57:00,516 --> 00:57:04,418
<i>No. No, it goes through.</i>

645
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,081
- How deep is it?
- Let's see.

646
00:57:38,821 --> 00:57:41,119
How many do you think
there are?

647
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,715
Who knows?
Too many.

648
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,661
- What are you doing?
- Saving one for myself.

649
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,064
Hey!

650
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,069
Do you remember
what Crank said?

651
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,264
"Dead is never better."

652
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,364
We're gonna get
out of here.

653
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,277
It's just-

654
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:05,280
- Amber!
- Napoleon!

655
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,078
Hang on! Shit!

656
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:12,351
<i>Fuck!</i>

657
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:15,789
- What the hell?
- Shit!

658
00:58:15,858 --> 00:58:17,985
Come on.

659
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,024
<i>You guys all right?</i>

660
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:27,859
Amber.

661
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,139
<i>Napoleon!</i>

662
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,982
Where's my rifle?

663
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,041
You okay? Shit.

664
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,053
<i>Amber!</i>

665
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:46,748
You guys all right?

666
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,485
Yeah. We're all right.

667
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:53,561
We're gonna find
a way down.

668
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:56,928
- No problem.
- Hang on.

669
00:58:56,999 --> 00:58:58,990
Shit!

670
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,514
Napoleon.

671
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,582
What are you doing?

672
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,527
Napoleon.

673
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,442
I thought I heard something.

674
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,018
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

675
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:54,821
I think that's the level
they're on.

676
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:58,520
<i>- Do you think we could climb down without gear?
- See that beam?</i>

677
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:00,960
<i>If we can make it across,
we slide down that.</i>

678
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,794
I think I can make
that jump.

679
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,697
What are you doing?

680
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,999
Crank? Crank? Wait!

681
01:00:09,071 --> 01:00:11,039
<i>- Crank!
- Fuck!</i>

682
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:15,009
Shit!

683
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:18,410
Delmar, your arm!

684
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,210
<i>Your arm!</i>

685
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:24,881
Hang on!

686
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:40,435
Thanks.

687
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,869
Let's keep it moving.

688
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,838
Let's go.

689
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,393
Oh, God.

690
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,998
Want.

691
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:52,436
Mama.

692
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:55,841
Pretty.

693
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,775
Dirty cunt!

694
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,345
- No!
- Come here.

695
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:07,985
Mine!

696
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,829
So sweet.

697
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:46,118
No. Was her. Papa. No.

698
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,236
- No.
- You give me baby.

699
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:10,282
- Shit.
- Goddamn it. Come on.

700
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:12,753
Motherfucker!

701
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,293
<i>Missy!</i>

702
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,023
<i>Help me!</i>

703
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,998
<i>Somebody, help me!</i>

704
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,928
Shit. It's Stump's headband.

705
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,938
What?

706
01:04:07,943 --> 01:04:09,774
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

707
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:12,211
Oh, shit.

708
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,752
Where is he?

709
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,952
There!

710
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:31,433
<i>There!</i>

711
01:04:45,347 --> 01:04:47,941
- Okay!
- Got you.

712
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:07,160
Mine!

713
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,914
Enough!

714
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,626
<i>Kill them all.</i>

715
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,861
Napoleon.
We gotta go.

716
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:39,526
He's got a gun.
Come on.

717
01:06:18,073 --> 01:06:19,802
Napoleon?

718
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:28,382
The hatch. Get the hatch.
Get the hatch!

719
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,247
Shh! Shh.

720
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,123
<i>Missy? Missy?</i>

721
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,182
<i>Which way?</i>

722
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,691
You safe here.

723
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,890
<i>Safe.</i>

724
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,902
<i>I'm right behind you. Let's go.</i>

725
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,063
Goddamn.

726
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:03,511
What the hell happened here?

727
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:17,795
Come on, bitch!

728
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,905
Yeah, baby!
It's all about volume!

729
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:26,635
<i>- Gotta have volume!
- It's Crank.</i>

730
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,438
- You okay?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

731
01:07:31,513 --> 01:07:35,609
Lone Ranger shoulder wound.
Missed the bone completely.

732
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,675
Damn.

733
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,584
- You good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

734
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:49,291
Who you fucking with, huh?
Who you fucking with?

735
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:52,766
Crank? Crank?

736
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,269
<i>You got any ammo left?</i>

737
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,469
Fuck.

738
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:03,704
<i>I'm out too.</i>

739
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:15,119
Delmar. Your bayonet.

740
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:22,160
- Crank. Delmar.
- Shit.

741
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,222
Down here.

742
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,790
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

743
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:28,632
Oh, shit.
You guys are alive!

744
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:33,471
What happened to you?
Delmar, are you all right?

745
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:36,636
- Be a hell of a lot better when we get out of here.
- Were you shot?

746
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:39,180
<i>- I'm fine. It's nothing.
- You sure?</i>

747
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,876
- Hi.
- Shit!

748
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:44,384
What the hell is that?

749
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,013
- He's okay.
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
He's one of them.

750
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:50,991
<i>- No, he just saved our lives.
- No fear. You come.</i>

751
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,494
<i>Follow me.</i>

752
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:00,160
Come.

753
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,922
<i>This way.</i>

754
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,504
- Whoa, whoa. You good?
- I'm all right.

755
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:41,042
Don't worry.
I'm all right.

756
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:43,271
We gotta get him outta here.

757
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,472
Missy's not that far.
You heard her screams.

758
01:09:45,547 --> 01:09:48,141
How are we gonna get her outta
here without any goddamn ammo?

759
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:51,584
<i>- We can fight 'em with rocks and rifle butts if we have to.
- Who's Rambo resurrected now?</i>

760
01:09:51,653 --> 01:09:53,951
- I just wanna get everyone outta here.
- Yeah?

761
01:09:54,022 --> 01:09:57,321
- Well, tell that to Mickey and Spitter and Stump!
- Crank! Shut the hell up!

762
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:00,920
- You trust that guy?
- He hid us from them. He didn't give us up.

763
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,658
- We don't have any choice. We have to trust him.
- Bullshit!

764
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:06,963
<i>- God knows where he's taking us.
- To be honest with you...</i>

765
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:11,233
I'm not sure God knows
anything about this place.

766
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,437
Through here.

767
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,141
Must through here.

768
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,102
Jesus.

769
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,371
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

770
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:54,677
<i>- Holy shit!
- Oh, man!</i>

771
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,947
Oh, God.

772
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,620
<i>- Geez!
- What the fuck!</i>

773
01:11:19,107 --> 01:11:20,734
