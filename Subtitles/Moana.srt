2
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,690
In the beginning...

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,684
there was only ocean...

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,811
until the mother island emerged.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,809
Te Fiti.

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,206
Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,330
It could create life itself.

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,724
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,366
But in time...

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,564
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,848
They believed if they could possess it...

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,641
the great power of creation
would be theirs.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,167
And one day...

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,326
the most daring of them all...

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,849
voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.

16
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,041
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,084
He was a warrior.

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,565
A trickster.

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,123
A shapeshifter who could change form...

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,045
with the power of his magical fish hook.

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,166
And his name...

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,202
was Maui.

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,364
But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,002
Maui tried to escape...

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,846
but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,250
Te Kā!

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,450
A demon of earth and fire.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,085
Maui was struck from the sky...

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,681
never to be seen again.

31
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,968
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

32
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,930
were lost to the sea.

33
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,251
Where, even now...

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,368
1,000 years later...

35
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,126
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,123
still hunt for the heart.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,645
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

38
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,247
chasing away our fish...

39
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,489
draining the life
from island after island...

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,049
until every one of us is devoured...

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,891
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

42
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,646
of inescapable death!

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,645
But one day...

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,643
the heart will be found...

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,084
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,446
find Maui...

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,842
deliver him across the great ocean...

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,162
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

49
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,369
and save us all.

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,570
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

51
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,608
Papa.

52
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,683
No one goes outside the reef.

53
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,923
We are safe here.
There is no darkness.

54
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,844
There are no monsters.

55
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,687
Monsters!

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,843
- There's no monsters, no monsters...
- It's the darkness!

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,206
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

58
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,486
I'm gonna throw up.

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,484
As long as we stay
on our very safe island...

60
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,801
...we'll be fine.

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,360
The legends are true.

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,205
Someone will have to go.

63
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,363
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,371
Who would want to go anywhere else?

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,728
Shoo, shoo!

66
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,721
Moana!

67
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,691
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

68
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,530
What? I wanna's go back.

69
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,162
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.

70
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,321
It's dangerous.

71
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,521
Moana, come on.

72
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,563
Let's go back to the village.

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,762
You are the next great chief
of our people.

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,924
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

75
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,281
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

76
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,324
Moana

77
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,847
Make way, make way

78
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,929
Moana, it's time you knew

79
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,721
The village of Motunui is all you need

80
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,923
The dancers are practicing

81
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,521
They dance to an ancient song

82
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,571
Who needs a new song
This old one's all we need

83
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,649
This tradition is our mission

84
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,406
And Moana, there's so much to do

85
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,966
Don't trip on the taro root

86
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,248
That's all you need

87
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,409
We share everything we make

88
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,449
We joke and we weave our baskets

89
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,762
The fishermen come back from the sea

90
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,570
I wanna see

91
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,449
Don't walk away

92
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,404
Moana, stay on the ground now

93
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,444
Our people will need a chief

94
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,484
- And there you are
- There you are

95
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,729
There comes a day

96
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,601
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is

97
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,450
Where you are

98
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,370
Consider the coconut

99
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,648
- The what
- Consider its tree

100
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,128
We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need

101
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,883
We make our nets from the fibers

102
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,844
The water is sweet inside

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,125
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

104
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,124
Consider the coconuts

105
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,884
The trunks and the leaves

106
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,567
The island gives us what we need

107
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,644
And no one leaves

108
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,291
That's right, we stay

109
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,010
We're safe and we're well-provided

110
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,129
And when we look to the future

111
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,403
There you are

112
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,648
You'll be okay

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,604
In time you'll learn just as I did

114
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,321
You must find happiness
right where you are

115
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,009
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves

116
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,165
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves

117
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,166
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far

118
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,929
But once you know what you like
Well, there you are

119
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,970
You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride

120
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,370
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside

121
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,691
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

122
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,648
Moana, that voice inside is who you are

123
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,607
Dad!

124
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,009
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

125
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,487
Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

126
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,842
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

127
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,528
This is a sacred place.

128
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,729
A place of chiefs.

129
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,570
There will come a time...

130
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,601
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

131
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,406
Like I did. Like my father did.

132
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,406
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

133
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,685
And on that day...

134
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,969
when you add your stone...

135
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,642
you will raise this whole island higher.

136
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,851
You are the future of our people, Moana.

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,571
And they are not out there.

138
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,530
They are right here.

139
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,924
It's time to be who they need you to be.

140
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,160
- We make our nets from the fibers
- We weave our nets from the fibers

141
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,560
- The water is sweet inside
- A real tasty treat inside

142
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,802
- We use the leaves to build fires
- We sing these songs in our choirs

143
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,810
- To cook up the meat inside
- We have mouths to feed inside

144
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,924
- The village believes in us
- That's right

145
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,610
The village believes

146
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,922
The island gives us what we need

147
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,088
And no one leaves

148
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,601
So here I'll stay

149
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,601
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow

150
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,842
There we are

151
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,810
I'll lead the way

152
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,963
I'll have my people to guide me

153
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,770
We'll build our future together

154
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,968
Where we are

155
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,850
'Cause every path leads ya back to

156
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,446
Where you are

157
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,929
You can find happiness right

158
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,970
Where you are

159
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,124
Where you are

160
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,481
And every storm, this roof leaks,
no matter how many fronds I add.

161
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,482
Fixed!

162
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,926
Not the fronds.

163
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,645
Wind shifted the post.

164
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,924
That's good pork!

165
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,483
I didn't mean... I wasn't...

166
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,645
What? They're calling me, so I gotta...
Bye!

167
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,686
You're doing great.

168
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,251
Is it done yet?

169
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,764
So close.

170
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,562
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

171
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,641
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

172
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,724
Should we maybe just cook him?

173
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,123
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

174
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,007
Far beneath in some cases.

175
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,642
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei
than meets the eye.

176
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,761
It's the harvest.

177
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,329
This morning,
I was husking the coconuts and...

178
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,127
Well...

179
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,160
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.

180
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,241
There.

181
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,046
Thanks, Moana.

182
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,202
She's doing great.

183
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,566
This suits you.

184
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,761
Chief?

185
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,604
There's something you need to see.

186
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,610
Our traps in the east lagoon...

187
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,968
they're pulling up less and less fish.

188
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,767
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

189
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,088
We have. There's no fish.

190
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,443
Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.

191
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,487
We tried.

192
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,086
The windward side.

193
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,767
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

194
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,605
We've tried the whole lagoon.

195
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,122
They're just gone.

196
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,409
Have you tried using a different bait?

197
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,971
I don't think it's the bait.

198
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,606
There's no fish.

199
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,485
It seems like
it's getting worse and worse.

200
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,604
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

201
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,851
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,890
What if we fish beyond the reef?

203
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,123
No one goes beyond the reef.

204
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,760
I know. But if there are no fish
in the lagoon...

205
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,849
- Moana.
- And there's a whole ocean.

206
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,645
We have one rule.

207
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,962
An old rule, when there were fish.

208
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,084
- A rule that keeps us safe...
- But Dad, I...

209
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,171
...instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.

210
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,411
Every time I think you're past this...

211
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,281
No one goes beyond the reef!

212
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,003
Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.

213
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,170
Standing on a boat.

214
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,164
I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.

215
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,322
But you still do.

216
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,206
- He's hard on you because...
- Because he doesn't get me.

217
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,971
Because he was you.

218
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,649
Drawn to the ocean.

219
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,165
Down by the shore.

220
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,964
He took a canoe, Moana.

221
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
He crossed the reef...

222
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,847
and found an unforgiving sea.

223
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,084
Waves like mountains.

224
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,363
His best friend begged to be on that boat.

225
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,121
Your dad couldn't save him.

226
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,528
He's hoping he can save you.

227
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,370
Sometimes...

228
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,445
who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...

229
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,248
it's just not meant to be.

230
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,404
I've been staring at the edge of the water

231
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,723
Long as I can remember

232
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,845
Never really knowing why

233
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,564
I wish I could be the perfect daughter

234
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,570
But I come back to the water

235
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,967
No matter how hard I try

236
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,003
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

237
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,046
Every path I make
Every road leads back

238
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,761
To the place I know
Where I cannot go

239
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,366
Where I long to be

240
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,000
See the line where the sky meets the sea

241
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,448
It calls me

242
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,444
And no one knows

243
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,446
How far it goes

244
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,727
If the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind me

245
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,447
One day I'll know

246
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,844
If I go, there's just no telling
how far I'll go

247
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,050
I know everybody on this island

248
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,806
Seems so happy on this island

249
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,531
Everything is by design

250
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,002
I know everybody on this island

251
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,244
Has a role on this island

252
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,967
So maybe I can roll with mine

253
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,210
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong

254
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,887
I'll be satisfied
If I play along

255
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,323
But the voice inside
Sings a different song

256
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,369
What is wrong with me

257
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,126
See the light as it shines on the sea

258
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,931
It's blinding

259
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,209
But no one knows

260
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,849
How deep it goes

261
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,082
And it seems like it's calling out to me

262
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,051
So come find me

263
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,761
And let me know

264
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,404
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line

265
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,603
The line where the sky meets the sea

266
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,531
It calls me

267
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,331
And no one knows

268
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,723
How far it goes

269
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,688
If the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind me

270
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,531
One day I'll know

271
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,005
How far I'll go

272
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,721
Whoa.

273
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,886
We're okay, Pua.

274
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,600
I can do this.

275
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,885
There's more fish beyond the reef.

276
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,807
There's more beyond the reef.

277
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,690
Not so bad.

278
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,248
Pua!

279
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,804
Whatever just happened...

280
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,246
blame it on the pig.

281
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,527
Gramma.

282
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,130
Are you gonna tell Dad?

283
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,723
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.

284
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,726
He was right.

285
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,482
About going out there.

286
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,003
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

287
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,164
Okay.
Well, then, head on back.

288
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,684
Put that stone up there.

289
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,284
Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?

290
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,127
You said that's what you wanted.

291
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,081
It is.

292
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,842
When I die...

293
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,529
I'm going to come back as one of these.

294
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,810
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

295
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,644
Why are you acting weird?

296
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,328
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

297
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,641
If there's something you want to tell me,
just tell me!

298
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,649
Is there something you wanna tell me?

299
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,044
Is there something you want to hear?

300
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,884
You've been told
all our people's stories...

301
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,404
but one.

302
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,845
What is this place?

303
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,490
Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?

304
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,810
What's in there?

305
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,483
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

306
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,651
Who are you meant to be?

307
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,684
Go inside...

308
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,410
bang the drum...

309
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,888
and find out.

310
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,968
Whoa.

311
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,882
Oh.

312
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,005
Bang the drum.

313
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,650
We read the wind and the sky

314
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,650
When the sun is high

315
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,610
We sail the length of the seas

316
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,451
On the ocean breeze

317
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,127
At night we name every star

318
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,448
We know where we are

319
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,811
We know who we are
Who we are

320
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,768
We set a course to find

321
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,489
A brand new island everywhere we roam

322
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,249
We keep our island in our mind

323
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,406
And when it's time to find home

324
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,449
We know the way

325
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,442
We are explorers reading every sign

326
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,647
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

327
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,850
We know the way

328
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,449
We were voyagers.

329
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,686
We were voyagers!

330
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,721
We were voyagers!
We were voyagers!

331
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,649
We were voyagers!

332
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,605
Why'd we stop?

333
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,806
Maui.

334
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,007
When he stole from the mother island,
darkness fell.

335
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,484
Te Kā awoke.

336
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,403
Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.

337
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,840
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...

338
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,845
and now we have forgotten who we are.

339
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,926
And the darkness
has continued to spread...

340
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,204
chasing away our fish...

341
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,130
draining the life...

342
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,888
from island after island.

343
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,123
Our island.

344
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,563
But, one day...

345
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,850
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...

346
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,924
deliver him across the great ocean...

347
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,447
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

348
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,203
I was there that day.

349
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,210
The ocean chose you.

350
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,128
I thought it was a dream.

351
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,764
Nope!

352
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,446
Our ancestors believed Maui lies there...

353
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,364
at the bottom of his hook.

354
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,650
Follow it, and you will find him.

355
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,247
But why would it choose me?

356
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,483
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

357
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,248
But I know who does!

358
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,405
- The crops are turning black.
- What about the fish?

359
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,360
This is happening all over the island.

360
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,880
- Please, please settle down.
- What are you going to do?

361
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,800
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...

362
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,406
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!

363
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,125
There's a cavern of boats.

364
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,811
Huge canoes.

365
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,561
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

366
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,203
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

367
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,044
You told me to help our people.

368
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,441
This is how we help our people.

369
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,960
Dad?

370
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,962
What are you doing?

371
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,641
I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!

372
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,847
No! Don't!

373
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,571
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!

374
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,927
There is no heart!

375
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,043
This is just a rock!

376
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,968
No!

377
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,482
Chief! It's your mother!

378
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,166
Mother...

379
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,805
What can be done?

380
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,121
Go.

381
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,010
Gramma.

382
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,727
Go.

383
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,726
Not now. I can't.

384
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,201
You must!

385
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,763
The ocean chose you.

386
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,400
Follow the fish hook.

387
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,601
Gramma...

388
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,842
And when you find Maui...

389
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,841
you grab him by the ear.
You say...

390
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,244
"I am Moana of Motunui.

391
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,848
"You will board my boat...

392
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,402
"sail across the sea...

393
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,565
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

394
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,727
I can't leave you.

395
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,411
There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.

396
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,771
Go!

397
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,405
There's a line where the sky meets the sea

398
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,410
And it calls me

399
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,481
But no one knows

400
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,326
How far it goes

401
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,448
All that time wondering where I need to be
Is behind me

402
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,565
I'm on my own

403
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,601
To worlds unknown

404
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,844
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

405
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,720
Is a choice I make

406
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,485
Now I can't turn back
from the great unknown

407
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,049
Where I go alone
Where I long to be

408
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,807
See her light up the night in the sea

409
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,646
She calls me

410
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,441
And yes, I know

411
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,087
That I can go

412
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,247
There's a moon in the sky
And the wind is behind me

413
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,808
Soon I'll know

414
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,407
How far I'll go

415
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,723
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...

416
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,290
sail across the sea
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

417
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,010
I am Moana...

418
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,487
of Motu...

419
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,246
...nui.

420
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,881
Heihei?

421
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,450
It's okay. You're all right.

422
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,241
See?

423
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,450
There we go. Nice water.

424
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,126
The ocean is a friend of mine.

425
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,446
Heihei?

426
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,761
Heihei!

427
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,841
Stay.

428
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,684
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

429
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,371
I am Moana of Motunui.

430
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,690
You will board my boat...

431
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,683
sail... across the sea...

432
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,968
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

433
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,123
I am Moana of Motu...

434
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,531
Board my boat!

435
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,561
Oh, no.

436
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,569
No, no, no!

437
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,006
Ocean...

438
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,091
can I get a little help?

439
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,686
No, no.

440
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,082
Please.

441
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,481
Come on!

442
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,291
Help me!

443
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,761
Please!

444
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,006
What?

445
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,970
I said help me!

446
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,282
And wrecking my boat?

447
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,449
Not helping!

448
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,044
Fish pee in you all day!

449
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,326
So...

450
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,282
Maui?

451
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,840
Maui!

452
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,606
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

453
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,489
I am Moana of Motunui.

454
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,210
You will board my boat.

455
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,283
No. You will board my boat.

456
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,205
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

457
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,126
You will board my...

458
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,360
Boat! A boat!

459
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,250
The gods have given me a...

460
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,164
Maui, shapeshifter...

461
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,483
demigod of the wind and sea...

462
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,600
- I am Moana of...
- Hero of men.

463
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,200
What?

464
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,806
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

465
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,161
hero of men.

466
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,244
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

467
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,201
I am...

468
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,521
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

469
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,002
And women. Men and women.

470
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,002
Both. All.

471
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,925
Not a guy, girl thing.

472
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,844
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

473
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,126
You're doing great.

474
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,846
What? No! I'm here to...

475
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,321
Of course.

476
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,920
Yes, yes, yes.

477
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,648
Maui always has time for his fans.

478
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,208
When you use a bird to write with...

479
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,365
it's called tweeting.

480
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,965
I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.

481
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,844
You are not my hero.

482
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,566
And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!

483
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,166
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

484
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,568
And you will board my boat...

485
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,929
and sail across the sea and put it back!

486
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,640
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

487
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,120
which is impossible because...

488
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,080
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

489
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,520
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

490
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,649
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

491
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,449
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

492
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,487
is "thank you."

493
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,041
- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.

494
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,242
What? No, no, no!

495
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,721
I didn't... I wasn't...

496
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,888
Why would I ever say that?

497
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,486
Okay, okay.

498
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,328
I see what's happening
Yeah

499
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,405
You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange

500
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,091
You don't even know how you feel

501
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,125
It's adorable

502
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,926
Well it's nice to see that humans
never change

503
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,290
Open your eyes
Let's begin

504
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,727
Yes, it's really me

505
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,650
It's Maui
Breathe it in

506
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,840
I know it's a lot

507
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,570
The hair
The bod

508
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,562
When you're staring at a demigod

509
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,602
What can I say except

510
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,285
You're welcome

511
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,291
For the tides, the sun, the sky

512
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,603
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

513
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,610
You're welcome

514
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,411
I'm just an ordinary demiguy
Hey!

515
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,645
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky

516
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,929
When you were waddling yay high?

517
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,246
This guy

518
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,724
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?

519
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,129
You're looking at him yo

520
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,966
Oh, also I lassoed the sun

521
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,322
You're welcome

522
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,967
To stretch your days and bring you fun

523
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,930
Also I harnessed the breeze

524
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,321
You're welcome

525
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,807
To fill your sails and shake your trees

526
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,926
So what can I say except
You're welcome

527
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,560
For the islands I pulled from the sea

528
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,361
There's no need to pray
It's okay

529
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,851
You're welcome

530
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,806
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me

531
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,847
You're welcome

532
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,290
You're welcome

533
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,040
Well come to think of it

534
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,244
Kid, honestly I could go on and on

535
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,130
I could explain every natural phenomenon

536
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,484
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around

537
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,485
I killed an eel, I buried its guts

538
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,005
Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts

539
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,970
What's the lesson?
What is the take away?

540
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,765
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway

541
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,164
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win

542
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,965
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

543
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,328
Look at that
Mean Mini-Mauijust tickety tappin'

544
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,930
Ha ha
Ha ha

545
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,203
Ha ha
Hey

546
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,480
Well anyway let me say
You're welcome

547
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,760
You're welcome

548
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,491
For the wonderful world you know

549
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,530
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

550
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,681
You're welcome

551
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,526
Well come to think of it I gotta go

552
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,570
Hey it's your day to say
You're welcome

553
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,881
You're welcome

554
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,520
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

555
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,800
I'm sailing away away
You're welcome

556
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,847
You're welcome

557
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,280
'Cause Maui can do everything but float

558
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,249
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

559
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,728
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

560
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,881
Huh?

561
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,202
And thank you!

562
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,042
Hey!

563
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,728
Let me out!
You lying, slimy son of a...

564
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,403
You're welcome

565
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,446
You're so welcome.

566
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,360
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

567
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,441
I'm going to get my hook.

568
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,689
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

569
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,888
Okay, talk to the back.

570
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,081
Boat snack.

571
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,727
Good riddance, you filthy pile of pebbles.

572
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,561
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

573
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,291
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

574
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,089
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

575
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,608
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

576
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,127
I could watch that all day.

577
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,964
Okay. Enjoy the island.

578
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,486
Maui, out.

579
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,971
No! Stop!

580
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,164
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

581
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,410
Did not see that coming.

582
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,603
I am Moana of Motunui.

583
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,921
This is my canoe...

584
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,850
and you will journey to...

585
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,684
All right, get over it.
We gotta move.

586
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,807
And she's back.

587
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,329
I am Moana of Motunui...

588
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,440
It was Moana, right?

589
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,203
Yes.

590
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,807
And you will restore the heart!

591
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,087
All right. I'm out.

592
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,886
Oh, come on!

593
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,444
What is your problem?

594
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,890
Are you afraid of it?

595
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,725
No! No.

596
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,242
I'm not afraid.

597
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,242
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

598
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,401
You, stop it.

599
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,245
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

600
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,528
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

601
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,886
and I lost my hook.

602
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,201
Get it away from me.

603
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,051
Get this away?

604
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,164
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

605
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,004
Stop that. I will smite you!

606
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,844
You wanna get smote?

607
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,001
Smotten?

608
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,686
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

609
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,569
it's a homing beacon of death.

610
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,007
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

611
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,169
Come for this? The heart?

612
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,440
You mean this heart right here?

613
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,000
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

614
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,888
Come and get it!

615
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,520
You are gonna get us killed!

616
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,129
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
so you can put it back.

617
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,281
Thank you.

618
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,601
You're welcome.

619
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,601
Kakamora.

620
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,046
Kaka-what?

621
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,611
Murdering little pirates.

622
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,211
Wonder what they're here for.

623
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,962
They're kinda cute.

624
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,522
Ocean!

625
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,524
Do something! Help us!

626
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,247
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

627
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,811
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

628
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,847
You can't sail?

629
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,250
I am self-taught.

630
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,848
Can't you shapeshift or something?

631
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,887
Do you see my hook?

632
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,884
No magic hook, no magic powers!

633
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,727
Their boat is turning into more boats!

634
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,686
Yep, I just did that.

635
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,521
No, no!

636
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,682
Heihei!

637
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,921
Maui!

638
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,162
They took the heart!

639
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,488
That's a chicken.

640
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,046
The heart is in the...

641
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,764
We have to get him back!

642
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,840
Maui!

643
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,124
Cheeeehoooo!

644
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,884
There! Right there!

645
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,768
You're turning?

646
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,042
What are you doing?

647
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,606
Escaping!

648
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,967
The heart!

649
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,924
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

650
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,880
Besides, you got a better one.

651
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,802
Hey!

652
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,969
What am I gonna steer with?

653
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,085
They're just gonna kill ya!

654
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,561
Coconuts.

655
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,646
Got it!

656
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,402
Hey!

657
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,401
Yeah!

658
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,362
We did it!

659
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,929
Congratulations on not being dead, girlie.

660
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,481
You surprise me.

661
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,042
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

662
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,365
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

663
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,802
Not to mention Te Kā.

664
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,851
Lava monster?

665
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,930
Ever defeat a lava monster?

666
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,882
No. Have you?

667
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,649
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

668
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,050
You can't restore the heart without me...

669
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,964
and me says no.

670
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,251
I'm getting my hook.

671
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,401
End of discussion.

672
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,402
You'd be a hero.

673
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,802
That's what you're all about, right?

674
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,804
Little girl, I am a hero.

675
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,450
Maybe you were.

676
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,726
But now...

677
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,804
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

678
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,281
The guy who cursed the world.

679
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,727
You're no one's hero.

680
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,328
No one?

681
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,008
But...

682
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,051
put this back...

683
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,044
save the world...

684
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,209
you'd be everyone's hero.

685
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,129
Maui! Maui! Maui!

686
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,450
You're so amazing!

687
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,771
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

688
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,046
Then we get your hook.

689
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,887
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

690
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,691
Unless you don't wanna be...

691
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,969
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

692
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,571
Hero to...

693
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,241
all.

694
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,410
First, we get my hook.

695
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,211
Then save the world.

696
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,400
Deal?

697
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,322
Deal.

698
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,888
Worth a shot.

699
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,447
Okay, we go east.

700
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,006
To the lair of Tamatoa.

701
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,687
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

702
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,565
Teach me to sail.

703
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,249
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

704
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,401
I should...

705
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,683
I should be sailing.

706
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,889
It's called wayfinding, princess.

707
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,409
And it's not just sails and knots...

708
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,167
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

709
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,409
Knowing where you are...

710
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,006
by knowing where you've been.

711
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,681
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

712
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,287
I am the daughter of the chief.

713
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,641
- Same difference.
- No.

714
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,451
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

715
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,647
you're a princess.

716
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,081
You are not a wayfinder.

717
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,683
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

718
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,247
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

719
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,365
You are a bad person.

720
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,245
If you can talk, you can teach.

721
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,401
Wayfinding.

722
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,364
Lesson one. Hit it.

723
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,121
Pull the sheet.

724
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,640
Not the sheet.

725
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,600
No.

726
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,408
Nope.

727
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,929
Nope. No.

728
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,644
Tried that one already.

729
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,920
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

730
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,210
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

731
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,610
It's cold.

732
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,762
Wait, it's getting warmer.

733
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,529
That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

734
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,480
We're here?

735
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,647
See, told you I could do it!

736
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,400
Motunui?

737
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,204
I'm home?

738
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,484
- Moana!
- Dad?

739
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,924
Moana!

740
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,242
Mom?

741
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,886
Help!

742
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,483
No!

743
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,406
Moana!

744
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,969
Enjoy your beauty rest?

745
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,846
You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps...

746
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,651
so they actually get
where they need to go.

747
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,566
Muscle up, buttercup.

748
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,810
We're here.

749
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,448
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

750
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,843
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

751
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,086
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

752
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,769
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

753
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,486
my hook is the coolest collectible.

754
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,361
And he lives up there?

755
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,288
No, no, no.

756
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,171
That's just the entrance...

757
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,527
to Lalotai.

758
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,722
Lalotai?

759
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,884
Realm of monsters?

760
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,363
We're going to the realm of monsters?

761
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,047
We? No. Me.

762
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,000
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

763
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,010
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

764
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,681
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

765
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,002
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

766
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,890
I know she's human, but that's not the...

767
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,605
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

768
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,250
I'm not explaining it to you.

769
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,004
'Cause then it's not funny.

770
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,882
So, daughter of the chief...

771
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,530
I thought you stayed in the village.

772
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,250
You know, kissing babies and things.

773
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,400
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

774
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,881
why your people decided to send...

775
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,963
How do I phrase this? You.

776
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,569
My people didn't send me.

777
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,881
The ocean did.

778
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,280
The ocean?

779
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
Makes sense.

780
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,280
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

781
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,282
Obvious choice.

782
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,122
It chose me for a reason.

783
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,850
If the ocean's so smart...

784
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,123
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

785
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,884
Or bring me my hook?

786
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,408
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

787
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,369
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

788
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,407
You're the Chosen One!

789
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,408
The ocean chose you for a reason.

790
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,086
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

791
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,008
So, not seeing an entrance.

792
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,328
Yes, because it only appears...

793
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,323
after a human sacrifice.

794
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,691
Kidding.

795
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,120
So serious.

796
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,687
Don't worry...

797
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,128
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

798
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,204
Cheeeehoooo!

799
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,570
I am still falling!

800
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,966
You can do this.

801
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,687
Go!

802
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,451
And he sticks the landing.

803
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,121
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

804
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,567
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...

805
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,688
Huh?

806
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,003
Well, she's dead.

807
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,683
Okay, let's get my hook.

808
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,802
Maui's fishhook!

809
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,961
Yeah!

810
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,241
Sorry!

811
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,287
I thought you were a monster...

812
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,801
But I found your hook.

813
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,122
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

814
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,281
Stay.

815
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,647
What? No.
I'm the one who found...

816
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,326
Listen. For a thousand years...

817
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,687
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

818
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,921
getting my hook...

819
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,650
and being awesome again.

820
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,047
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...

821
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,087
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...

822
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,325
Except...

823
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,527
maybe as bait.

824
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,887
Huh?

825
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,841
Wow!

826
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,048
The shiny, glittery cave.

827
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,531
And just like me...

828
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,247
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

829
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,409
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

830
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,846
You're not selling it!

831
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,003
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

832
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,444
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

833
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,242
When he shows up, keep him distracted.

834
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,890
Make him talk about himself.

835
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,048
He loves bragging about how great he is.

836
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,850
You two must get along swell.

837
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,851
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

838
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,170
You ripped off his...

839
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,362
Maui?

840
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,361
What have we here?

841
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,048
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

842
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,567
It's a human!

843
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,327
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...

844
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,960
Just pick an eye, babe.

845
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,360
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

846
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,965
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

847
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,800
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

848
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,291
Don't! That's my gramma's!

849
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,562
"That's my gramma's!"

850
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,801
I ate my gramma!

851
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,447
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

852
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,045
Why are you here?

853
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,805
'Cause you're amazing!

854
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:06,371
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

855
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,888
And I just had to know...

856
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,602
how you became so...

857
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,481
crabulous?

858
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,002
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

859
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,125
Because if you are...

860
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,322
I will gladly do so.

861
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,243
Huh?

862
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,761
In song form!

863
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,762
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam

864
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,083
I was a drab little crab once

865
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,087
Now I know I can be happy as a clam

866
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,602
Because I'm beautiful, baby

867
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:43,962
And did your granny say

868
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,850
Listen to your heart

869
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,971
Be who you are on the inside

870
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,363
I need three words
To tear her argument apart

871
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,807
Your granny lied

872
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,849
I'd rather be shiny

873
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,890
Like a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreck

874
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,328
Scrub the deck
And make it look shiny

875
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,525
I will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neck

876
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,043
Just a sec
Don't ya know

877
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,081
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters

878
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,846
Beginners

879
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,481
Oh, and here they come, come, come

880
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,920
To the brightest thing that glitters

881
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,960
Mm, fish dinners

882
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,202
I just love free food

883
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,890
And you look like seafood

884
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,049
Hey, crab cake!

885
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,365
I'm back.

886
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,762
It's Maui Time!

887
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,801
What do you say, little buddy?

888
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,569
Giant hawk? Coming up!

889
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,085
Cheeeehoooo!

890
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,129
Cheeeehoooo!

891
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,403
Well, well, well.

892
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,640
Little Maui's having trouble with his look

893
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,882
Ya little semi-demi-mini-god

894
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,601
Ouch
What a terrible performance

895
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,211
Get the hook
Get it?

896
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,091
You don't swing it
Like you used to, man

897
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,730
Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start

898
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,884
And your tattoos on the outside

899
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,284
For just like you
I made myself a work of art

900
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,483
I'll never hide, I can't

901
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,767
I'm too shiny

902
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,890
Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough

903
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,408
Strut my stuff
My stuffis so shiny

904
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,001
Send your armies
But they'll never be enough

905
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,643
My shell's too tough
Maui, man

906
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,160
You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod

907
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,447
To beat a decapod
Look it up

908
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,405
You will die, die, die

909
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,450
Now it's time for me to take apart

910
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,884
Your achin' heart

911
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:55,320
Far from the ones who abandoned you

912
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,520
Chasing the love of these humans

913
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,683
Who made you feel wanted

914
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,446
You tried to be tough

915
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,730
But your armor's just not hard enough

916
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,360
Maui, now it's time to kick your heinie

917
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,444
Ever seen someone so shiny

918
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,644
Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see

919
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,326
C'est la vie
Mon ami

920
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,051
I'm so shiny

921
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,125
Now I eat you so prepare your final plea

922
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,327
Just for me

923
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,081
You'll never be quite as shiny

924
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,287
You wish you were nice and shiny

925
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,321
- Hey!
- Huh?

926
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,803
I got something shiny for ya!

927
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,327
The heart of Te Fiti.

928
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,721
You can't run from me!

929
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,566
Oh, you can.
You keep surprising me.

930
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,404
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

931
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,484
The power of creation...

932
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,205
for a crustacean.

933
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,890
Where is it? Where is it?

934
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,164
We gotta go!

935
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,841
What about the heart?

936
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,480
He can have it.
I've got a better one.

937
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,171
Yes, I have the...

938
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,321
Wait a minute.

939
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,331
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

940
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,683
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

941
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,002
Come back here!

942
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,841
Cheeeehoooo!

943
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,881
Hey!

944
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,690
Did you like the song?

945
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,726
We're alive!

946
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,681
Listen...

947
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,963
- I appreciate what you did down there.
- Mm-hmm.

948
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,082
- Took guts.
- Mm-hmm.

949
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,521
- But...
- Mm-hmm.

950
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,767
I'm sorry.

951
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,969
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

952
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,044
No, no. No way!

953
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,481
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

954
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,487
shark head.

955
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,804
What? Do you have a shark head?

956
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,730
Look, the point is...

957
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,804
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

958
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,486
who had no business being down there...

959
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,405
you did me a solid.

960
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,688
But you also almost died.

961
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,000
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

962
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,242
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

963
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,561
Bupkis.

964
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,963
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

965
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,407
It's not cursed.

966
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,962
Shark head.

967
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,006
It is not cursed.

968
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,082
Cursed.

969
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,442
What can I say except

970
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,443
We're dead soon

971
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,165
We're dead soon

972
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,083
Can you at least try?

973
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,489
Giant hawk.

974
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,360
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon

975
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,044
All right, break time's over.

976
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,362
Get up.

977
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,887
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

978
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,806
Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

979
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,641
Take a hike, Tiny.

980
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,120
How do you get your tattoos?

981
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,807
They show up. When I earn them.

982
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,564
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

983
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,008
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

984
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,247
What's Nunya?

985
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,801
Nunya business.

986
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,641
I'll just keep asking.

987
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:57,882
What's it for?

988
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,842
You need to stop doing that.

989
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,011
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

990
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,851
I said back off.

991
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,684
Is it why your hook's not working?

992
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,490
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

993
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,922
You wanna throw me off the boat...

994
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,964
throw me off.

995
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,442
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

996
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,564
I know I don't.

997
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,729
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

998
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,609
You're right.

999
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,205
But my island is dying...

1000
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,123
so I am here.

1001
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,087
It's just me and you.

1002
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,925
And I want to help...

1003
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,369
but I can't if you don't let me.

1004
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,286
I wasn't born a demigod.

1005
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,128
I had human parents.

1006
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,451
They took one look and decided...

1007
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,001
they did not want me.

1008
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,648
They threw me into the sea...

1009
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,129
like I was nothing.

1010
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,082
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1011
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,925
They gave me the hook.

1012
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,806
They made me...

1013
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,601
Maui.

1014
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,725
And back to the humans I went.

1015
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,971
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1016
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,201
Anything they could ever want.

1017
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,287
You took the heart for them.

1018
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,890
You did everything for them.

1019
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,489
So they'd love you.

1020
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,249
It was never enough.

1021
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,728
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1022
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,043
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1023
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:24,330
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1024
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,167
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1025
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,080
You are.

1026
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,363
Okay, okay.

1027
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,846
I love you, too, buddy.

1028
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,920
Cheeeehoooo!

1029
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:52,643
Yeah!

1030
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,651
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1031
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,242
What?

1032
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,130
I figured it out.

1033
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,201
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1034
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:18,160
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1035
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,764
All those new lands, new villages.

1036
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,561
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1037
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,650
And if I were the ocean...

1038
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,885
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1039
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,483
to start that again.

1040
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:38,043
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1041
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,208
Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti.

1042
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,921
I did.

1043
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,888
Moana of Motunui...

1044
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:54,770
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1045
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,360
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1046
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,569
You're so amazing!

1047
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,367
It's time.

1048
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,210
Go save the world.

1049
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,523
Cheeeehoooo!

1050
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,161
Maui!

1051
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,846
What are you doing?

1052
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,804
Finding you a better way in!

1053
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,209
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

1054
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,482
- Turn around!
- No!

1055
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,766
Moana, stop!

1056
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:32,768
No!

1057
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,644
Are you okay?

1058
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,201
Maui?

1059
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,929
I told you to turn back.

1060
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,924
I thought we could make it.

1061
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,242
We?

1062
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,962
I thought I could make it.

1063
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,046
We can fix it.

1064
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,328
It was made by the gods.

1065
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,204
You can't fix it!

1066
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,728
Next time we'll be more careful.

1067
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,088
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

1068
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,686
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1069
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,842
We can find a way around.

1070
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,843
I'm not going back.

1071
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,530
We still have to restore the heart.

1072
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,245
My hook is cracked.

1073
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,050
One more hit, and it's over.

1074
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,283
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1075
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,364
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1076
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,681
That's not true!

1077
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,326
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1078
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,160
We are only here...

1079
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,490
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

1080
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,411
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...

1081
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,403
and you believed it.

1082
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,080
I am Moana of Motunui.

1083
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,487
- You will board my boat...
- Goodbye, Moana.

1084
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,727
...sail across the sea...

1085
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,048
I'm not killing myself...

1086
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,480
so you can prove
you're something you're not!

1087
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,926
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1088
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,001
The ocean chose me!

1089
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,644
It chose wrong.

1090
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,441
Maui!

1091
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,920
Why did you bring me here?

1092
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,808
I'm not the right person.

1093
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,444
You have to choose someone else.

1094
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,331
Choose someone else.

1095
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,451
Please.

1096
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,800
No.

1097
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,001
You're a long ways past the reef.

1098
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,361
Gramma?

1099
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,370
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1100
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,405
Gramma!

1101
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,568
I tried, Gramma.

1102
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,164
I couldn't do it.

1103
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,446
It's not your fault.

1104
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,366
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

1105
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,248
If you are ready to go home...

1106
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,682
I will be with you.

1107
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,924
Why do you hesitate?

1108
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,964
I don't know.

1109
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,927
I know a girl from an island

1110
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,605
She stands apart from the crowd

1111
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,044
She loves the sea and her people

1112
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,722
She makes her whole family proud

1113
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,565
Sometimes the world seems against you

1114
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,130
The journey may leave a scar

1115
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,090
But scars can heal and reveal just

1116
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,846
Where you are

1117
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,764
The people you love will change you

1118
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,010
The things you have learned will guide you

1119
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,608
And nothing on earth can silence

1120
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,889
The quiet voice still inside you

1121
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,443
And when that voice starts to whisper

1122
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,251
Moana, you've come so far

1123
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,764
Moana, listen

1124
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,608
Do you know who you are?

1125
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,285
Who am I?

1126
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,767
I am a girl who loves my island

1127
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,687
And the girl who loves the sea

1128
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,169
It calls me

1129
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,170
I am the daughter of the village chief

1130
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,644
We are descended from voyagers

1131
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,361
Who found their way across the world

1132
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,729
They call me

1133
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,131
I've delivered us to where we are

1134
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,291
I have journeyed farther

1135
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,201
I am everything I've learned and more

1136
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,484
Still it calls me

1137
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,801
And the call isn't out there at all

1138
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,770
It's inside me

1139
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,163
It's like the tide

1140
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,644
Always falling and rising

1141
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,487
I will carry you here in my heart

1142
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,723
You remind me

1143
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,850
That come what may

1144
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,004
I know the way

1145
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:06,768
I am Moana

1146
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,521
I am Moana of Motunui.

1147
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,480
Aboard my boat...

1148
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,403
I will sail across the sea...

1149
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,730
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1150
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,002
Te Kā can't follow us into the water.

1151
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,250
We make it past the barrier islands...

1152
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,320
we make it to Te Fiti.

1153
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,080
None of which you understand...

1154
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,365
because you are a chicken.

1155
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,881
No!

1156
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,640
Heihei! No, no, no!

1157
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,321
Nice work!

1158
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,767
Te Fiti.

1159
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,805
Maui!

1160
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,847
You came back.

1161
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,046
But your hook.

1162
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,725
One more hit and...

1163
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,045
Te Kā's gotta catch me first.

1164
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,242
I got your back, Chosen One.

1165
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,880
Go save the world.

1166
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,768
Maui.

1167
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,681
Thank you.

1168
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,966
You're welcome.

1169
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,284
Cheeeehoooo!

1170
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,166
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!

1171
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,130
Hey, Te Kā!

1172
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:32,842
Shark head!

1173
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,487
Cheeeehoooo!

1174
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,121
Moana!

1175
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,203
Get the heart to the spiral!

1176
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,122
Te Fiti...

1177
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,725
it's gone.

1178
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,044
Te Kā!

1179
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,166
Let her come to me.

1180
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,127
I have crossed the horizon to find you

1181
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,681
I know your name

1182
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:16,411
They have stolen the heart from inside you

1183
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,283
But this does not define you

1184
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,811
This is not who you are

1185
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:38,731
You know who you are

1186
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,211
Who you truly are.

1187
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,487
Te Fiti!

1188
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,365
The chicken lives.

1189
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,202
I'm sorry about your hook.

1190
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,724
Well, hook, no hook...

1191
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,804
I'm Maui.

1192
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,484
Te Fiti!

1193
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,563
Hey, I mean, how you been?

1194
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,246
Look, what I did was...

1195
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,845
wrong.

1196
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,048
I have no excuse.

1197
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,766
I'm sorry.

1198
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,242
You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

1199
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,243
Cheeeehoooo!

1200
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,127
Thank you.

1201
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,840
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.

1202
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,921
Cheeeehoooo.

1203
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,085
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1204
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,287
You could come with us, you know.

1205
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,807
My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.

1206
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,243
They already have one.

1207
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,766
See you out there, Maui.

1208
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,047
See you out there, Moana.

1209
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,846
Cheeeehoooo!

1210
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,890
Mom! Dad!

1211
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,201
Moana!

1212
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:31,762
I may have gone
a little ways past the reef.

1213
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,730
It suits you.

1214
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:35,688
She's back!

1215
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,081
Moana!

1216
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,241
Pua!

1217
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,402
Moana!

1218
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,845
Welcome home!

1219
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,967
We set a course to find

1220
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:41,364
A brand new island everywhere we roam

1221
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:46,041
We keep our island in our mind

1222
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,884
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

1223
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,450
We are explorers reading every sign

1224
01:35:56,120 --> 01:36:01,524
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

1225
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:12,522
We know the way

1226
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:08,931
Shiny

1227
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,966
I'm so shiny

1228
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,369
Didn't help me though, did it?

1229
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,488
Still upside down here.

1230
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,921
Just need a little push.

1231
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,081
Can we be real?

1232
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:25,642
If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...

1233
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,006
you'd totally help me.

1234
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,810
You would. You know you would.

1235
01:46:29,305 --> 01:47:29,433
