1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:16,705
Nick, this was a
tragedy, but it's not why we're here.

4
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:19,041
What, are we fighting
the weather now?

5
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:21,877
Locals say the cyclone
had a face.

6
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,479
People see things
when they're under stress.

7
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,482
That does not mean
that this is the start

8
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:28,153
to some other
big world-ending...

9
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:35,457
Who are you?

10
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:42,433
You don't want
any part of this.

11
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:00,909
Gone,
but not forgotten.

12
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,045
Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy

13
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:05,414
for their help with that
touching video tribute.

14
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,550
This year has been
nothing short of...

15
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,885
is crazy.
It's, like, insane.

16
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:10,885
- Jason.
- What?

17
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,222
No swearing.

18
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,091
It's the last day of school.
We're good.

19
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:16,224
Historic.

20
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:17,627
Over five years ago,

21
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,829
half of all life
in the universe,

22
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:21,664
<i>including our own
Midtown High...</i>

23
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,099
<i>...was wiped from existence.</i>

24
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,669
Then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes

25
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:27,903
<i>brought us back.</i>

26
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,873
They called it "the Blip."

27
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,576
<i>Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...</i>

28
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,545
<i>But our classmates
that didn't Blip</i>

29
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:39,213
<i>had grown five years older.</i>

30
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:41,516
Yeah, my little brother
is now older than me.

31
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:43,351
Yeah, it's math.

32
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:46,487
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

33
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,591
and had already taken midterms,

34
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,260
the school made us
start the year

35
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,593
over from the beginning.

36
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:54,230
It's totally unfair.
It's not right.

37
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,865
Tigers...

38
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,700
...it's been
a long, dramatic,

39
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:59,434
somewhat
confusing road.

40
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,970
<i>As we draw this year
to a close,</i>

41
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:03,841
<i>it's time to move on...</i>

42
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,909
<i>to a new phase
of our lives.</i>

43
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,510
<i>Pray nothing crazy
happens again</i>

44
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:10,612
<i>because are the Avengers
a thing anymore?</i>

45
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:12,115
<i>Does anyone even have a plan?</i>

46
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:13,616
I have a plan.

47
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:16,051
First, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

48
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:18,453
Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual headphone adapter

49
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:20,455
and watch movies with her
the whole time.

50
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:21,757
- Okay.
- Three,

51
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,625
when we go to Venice,
Venice is famous

52
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:25,428
- for making stuff out of glass.
- True.

53
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,296
I'm gonna buy her
a black dahlia necklace

54
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:29,265
because her favorite flower
is the black dahlia

55
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,765
- because of, well...
- The murder.

56
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,734
The murder.
Four, when we go to Paris,

57
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:35,171
I'm gonna take her
to the top of the Eiffel Tower,

58
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,772
- give her the necklace.
- Oh.

59
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,776
Then, five,
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

60
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,943
Then, six,
hopefully she tells me

61
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,212
she feels
the same way.

62
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,613
Oh, don't forget
step seven.

63
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,618
- Step seven?
- Don't do any of that.

64
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,118
Why?

65
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,986
We're gonna be
bachelors in Europe.

66
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:51,986
- Ned.
- Look,

67
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:53,055
I may not know much,

68
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:54,390
but I do know this:

69
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:57,260
Europeans love
Americans.

70
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,426
Really?

71
00:04:58,428 --> 00:04:59,796
More than half
are women.

72
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:01,464
Okay. Sure.

73
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,366
But... I really like MJ,
man, okay?

74
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:07,102
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

75
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:08,837
Sometimes I catch her
looking at me,

76
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,305
I feel like
I've stood up...

77
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:12,140
- She's coming.
- What up, dorks?

78
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:13,775
Excited about
the science trip?

79
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:16,111
Hey, yeah. We're just
talking about the trip.

80
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,246
Yeah,
and Peter's plan.

81
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:18,613
You have a plan?

82
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:21,616
I don't...
I don't have a plan.

83
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:24,253
He's... He's just gonna
collect tiny spoons

84
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,322
when we're traveling
to other countries.

85
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:27,890
Like a...
Like a grandmother?

86
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,724
I'm not collecting
tiny spoons.

87
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,325
He's collecting
tiny spoons.

88
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:32,863
Oh, okay, well...

89
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,830
that was a real
roller coaster.

90
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,832
By the way, travel tip:

91
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,068
You should download a VPN
on your phone,

92
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,436
so the government can't
track you while abroad.

93
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:44,875
Smart... Will do.

94
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:53,084
Dude, I think
that went really great.

95
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,685
When I Blipped
back to my apartment,

96
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:00,589
the family that was living there
was very confused.

97
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,325
The wife thought
that I was a mistress.

98
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:05,226
The grandma thought
that I was a ghost.

99
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:07,563
It was... It was really a mess.

100
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:09,231
Thank you all for coming out

101
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,868
to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.

102
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,169
And, of course,
thanks to our very own

103
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,705
Spider-Man!

104
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:29,551
Thank you, Miss Parker,
for having me.

105
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:31,957
And thank you, you guys,
for having me.

106
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,924
And thank you,
Spider-Man.

107
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:38,926
He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos.

108
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:39,928
Thank you!

109
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,602
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

110
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:49,337
That was so cool.
I was so nervous.

111
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,541
I was a little stiff.
I wasn't in the pocket.

112
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,409
- No, I thought you did great.
- You were a little stiff.

113
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:57,046
Uh, yeah, I felt that too.
I felt that too.

114
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,281
- It's fine, fine.
- Okay.

115
00:06:58,283 --> 00:06:59,882
- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:01,317
- Mini toothpaste?
- Yeah, I did.

117
00:07:02,753 --> 00:07:04,321
Hey, sorry I'm late.

118
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:06,654
Happy. Hey.

119
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,823
Oh, you look lovely.

120
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,892
- Thanks. You too.
- Thank you.

121
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:11,930
- New dress?
- Yeah, yes, it is.

122
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:14,162
It's a new beard.

123
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,397
It's my... My Blip beard.

124
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,133
'Cause I grew it
in the Blip.

125
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,933
It's a Blip beard.

126
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:20,568
I see. Yeah.

127
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,638
The reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced.

128
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,308
Can you believe it?
It's enormous.

129
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,609
Not the amount,
the size.

130
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:29,411
The amount's nice too.
They're generous.

131
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:31,948
Pepper Potts said, sorry
she couldn't be here.

132
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,916
I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno

133
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:36,454
under the vegan lasagna.

134
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,488
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

135
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,159
Will do.

136
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:47,630
What just happened?

137
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:50,099
Heads up,
Nick Fury's calling you.

138
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:52,168
- Nick Fury's gonna call me? Why?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,070
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

140
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,238
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

141
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,640
If it was that important,

142
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:00,642
he'd probably call
someone else, not me.

143
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:03,347
Apparently not.

144
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:08,484
No caller ID.
That's him.

145
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,818
I don't wanna
talk to Fury.

146
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,885
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

147
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:12,188
If you don't talk to him,

148
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,688
I have to and I don't want to.

149
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,493
- Why not?
- I'm scared. Answer the phone.

150
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:18,661
- You sent Fury to voicemail?
- Yeah.

151
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,296
You don't send Fury
to voicemail.

152
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:21,529
They're calling me.

153
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:23,332
- I gotta go.
- You gotta talk to him.

154
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:26,202
I'm gonna call him. I promise,
I'm gonna call him. I will.

155
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,169
You do not ghost
Nick Fury.

156
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:29,873
I promise you, I'll call him.

157
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,808
After my trip.

158
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,076
Hey!

159
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:38,213
Yeah, hi.
No, no, he's not ghosting you.

160
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,318
Okay, one question at a time.

161
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,153
Are you
the head Avenger?

162
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,587
Are you
the head Avenger now?

163
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,054
Uh, no, I'm not.

164
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:49,192
If aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

165
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:51,226
If aliens come back,
what will you do?

166
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:53,098
Does anyone have
neighborhood questions?

167
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:55,898
Sean Winford,
<i>Queens Tribune.</i>

168
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,067
What's it like to take over
from Tony Stark?

169
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,434
Those are
big shoes to fill.

170
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,472
I'mma...

171
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,574
I'm gonna go.
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

172
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,752
Okay.

173
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:55,392
Hungry?

174
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:59,327
So sorry.

175
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,664
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

176
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,100
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

177
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:08,236
So, what's up? You can dodge
bullets but not bananas?

178
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,237
No, I just really
need this vacation.

179
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,909
I need a break.

180
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:14,478
You deserve it. Mm.

181
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:17,313
Yeah.

182
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,948
You know what?

183
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,083
You should pack your suit,
just in case.

184
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,253
I have a tingle about it.

185
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:27,124
Please stop saying
"tingle," May.

186
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,324
No.

187
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,236
No. No, I'm not.

188
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:44,640
Vacation, yeah!

189
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:46,540
Can you help
me get my stuff up?

190
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,812
- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.

191
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,481
Give me a tablet.

192
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:54,149
Do you want first shift
or second?

193
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:55,518
I could take either.

194
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,620
Give me the third shift.
I took an Ambien.

195
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:59,053
I can't chaperone
kids alone.

196
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:00,288
Yo, Parker.

197
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,689
This is called
an airplane.

198
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,324
It's like buses
you're used to,

199
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:05,226
except it flies over
poor neighborhoods

200
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,827
instead of driving
through them.

201
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,463
- Ma'am?
- Hmm?

202
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:11,667
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

203
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,501
I'll take that.

204
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,706
She's lying.
I don't even know this girl.

205
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:20,745
Classic MJ, right?

206
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,480
Did you know Brad
was coming?

207
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,481
It... It's so weird.

208
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,451
Like, one day,
he's that kid who cried

209
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:30,052
and got nosebleeds
all the time,

210
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:31,553
and suddenly, we Blip back,

211
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,621
and he's totally ripped
and super nice

212
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:35,290
and all these girls
are after him.

213
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:36,857
Not all the girls
are after him.

214
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,693
No, man,
they're all after him.

215
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:40,428
- Yeah.
- Here.

216
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,497
Anyway, on to more important
things. It's a nine-hour flight.

217
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,402
We can play <i>Beast Slayers</i>
the whole time.

218
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:47,471
Are you excited?

219
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,375
I need help
to sit next to MJ.

220
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,174
Seriously?

221
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,175
Yes, seriously.

222
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,409
What about our plan?

223
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:57,078
American bachelors
in Europe.

224
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,914
That's your plan.
That's a solo plan.

225
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,984
Come on, this is my plan.

226
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,553
Please.

227
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,424
Uh, hey, guys.

228
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,425
Uh, there's an old lady

229
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:12,660
sitting in front of us

230
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,529
wearing a crazy amount
of perfume,

231
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:17,732
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

232
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:20,101
Um, you know, Betty,
if you could just

233
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:22,002
switch seats with him,
that would be...

234
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:23,140
He's allergic
to perfume?

235
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,342
Yeah, yeah,
because, um, it...

236
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,943
It makes his eyes water,

237
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,413
- and he can't really...
- Peter has a perfume allergy?

238
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:31,579
Oh, uh...

239
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:32,581
From experience,

240
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,881
allergies are no joke.

241
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:35,851
I can feel hives
breaking out already.

242
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,251
MJ, stand up.

243
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,121
Ned, take MJ's spot.

244
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,023
MJ, you take my spot.

245
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,658
Peter,
let's get you out of there.

246
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,592
- Sorry.
- Zach, Sebastian,

247
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,995
you take Ned and Peter's seats.

248
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,497
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

249
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:51,132
Your safety is my
responsibility.

250
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:53,334
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

251
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,837
I got it for now.
Let's go, Peter!

252
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,675
Let's go!

253
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,517
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

254
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,154
So did you wanna
play <i>Beast Slayer?</i>

255
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:15,323
Nope.

256
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,793
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or...?

257
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:20,228
- No.
- Got it. Ahem.

258
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,098
Did I tell you my wife
pretended to Blip out?

259
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,836
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

260
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,403
We had a fake funeral
for her...

261
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:29,739
Well, the funeral
was real

262
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:31,438
because I thought
she was dead.

263
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,774
Do you wanna
see the video?

264
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,442
Oh, I got
a dual headphone adapter

265
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:35,843
if you wanna
watch a movie.

266
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:38,347
Only if it's depressing.
Or hilarious.

267
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:40,280
Oh, you have
a dual headphone adapter.

268
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:41,415
We can watch together.

269
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,951
<i>Good afternoon,</i>

270
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,687
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>

271
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,788
<i>Our flight time today will
be eight hours,</i>

272
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,890
<i>49 minutes
to Venice, Italy.</i>

273
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,940
Oh! Oh!

274
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,893
Hey man, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

275
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:00,595
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

276
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:02,364
Dude, don't worry,
okay?

277
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,531
I'm sure
that's nothing.

278
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:04,533
Hey, babe.

279
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:05,799
Can you hold this for me?

280
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:07,471
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

281
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,446
What was that?

282
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,380
Uh, well,

283
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,884
we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,

284
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:23,452
we have a lot in common.

285
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:26,087
So, uh, we're boyfriend
and girlfriend now.

286
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,957
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

287
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,726
Peter, those were the words
of a boy.

288
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:34,261
And that boy met a woman.

289
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:37,097
A very strong
and powerful woman.

290
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:40,034
And now,
that boy's a man.

291
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:42,303
- Babe?
- Coming, babe.

292
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:49,410
There's nothing in there.
I swear.

293
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:06,928
These, no.

294
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:18,506
Sorry. Sorry.

295
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:20,775
- I'm here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

296
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:22,944
- I'm here.
- Thank goodness.

297
00:16:56,814 --> 00:16:58,480
Looks like we're here.

298
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,515
They're doing renovations
to the place.

299
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:03,150
- Getting some upgrades.
- Oh, this is trash.

300
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,752
- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.

301
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:06,487
Come on, man.

302
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:09,024
Everyone, here we are.

303
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:11,259
Whoa!

304
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,726
- Wow!
- Come on in.

305
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:14,362
This place
is sinking.

306
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:16,563
- You mean, "charming."
- It stinks.

307
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:19,033
Okay, everybody,
drop your bags off.

308
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:21,902
We're gonna meet at the
da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

309
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:24,072
<i>- ¡Vámanos!</i>
- It's <i>"andiamo."</i>

310
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:25,372
<i>Andiamo!</i>

311
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:27,007
When in Rome,
do as Romans do.

312
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:29,076
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

313
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:37,084
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

314
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:38,719
I'm here in
St. Marco Polo's...

315
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,390
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah?

316
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,274
Oh!

317
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,216
Three, two, one...
say pizza!

318
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,552
Pizza! Pizza time!

319
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:31,739
<i>- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.</i>

320
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,240
Hi. Uh...

321
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,809
I'm looking for a, uh...

322
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,389
It's perfect.

323
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,999
What?

324
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:00,302
The most perfect word.

325
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,137
Italians created it,
I discovered it.

326
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,339
- What does it mean?
- It means a million things.

327
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:06,175
I don't know.
Get out of my face.

328
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:08,110
I don't know
and get out of my face.

329
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:10,879
It's the best thing Italy
created, except for espresso.

330
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:13,648
Oh, so you've been
drinking espresso?

331
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,517
Hey. German?
American.

332
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,021
A rose for you.

333
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:20,955
Whoa.

334
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:22,523
<i>"Boh"</i> is my
new superpower.

335
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,228
It's like the anti- "aloha."
I was born to say this word.

336
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:27,629
So, what's in the bag?

337
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,596
Oh, uh...

338
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:32,501
Nice.

339
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:41,711
Whoa, cool.

340
00:19:58,562 --> 00:19:59,562
What was that?

341
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:24,555
- Betty! You okay?
- Yeah.

342
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:27,188
- Oh, my God!
- Come on.

343
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,558
Guys, we gotta go!

344
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:33,928
- What is that?
- I don't know.

345
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,862
- What'll you do?
- My suit's in the hotel.

346
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,398
- Why?
- I'm on vacation, Ned!

347
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,399
Everyone will see my face.
Get them out.

348
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:40,401
Go! Just go!

349
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:51,882
Get out of here. Go!

350
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:55,753
Oh, my God.

351
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:04,826
Come on.

352
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:19,074
Oh, no, you don't.

353
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:32,256
You okay?
Get out of here. Go!

354
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,406
Excuse me, sir!

355
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,207
I... I can help.
Let me help.

356
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,976
I'm really strong,
and I'm sticky.

357
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:30,113
I need to lead it away
from the canals.

358
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:56,905
The da Vinci Museum.

359
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:59,207
This is why
we're here in Venice.

360
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,807
Oh, this is it.

361
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:02,043
It's closed.

362
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:03,911
What do you mean?
Till when?

363
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,012
November.

364
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:06,581
You didn't check
the website?

365
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:07,785
Oh, that's
a good idea.

366
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,168
Oh, come on.

367
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,470
Stay low, kids.
We'll be safe here.

368
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:31,099
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know,

369
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:32,766
but he's kicking
that water's ass.

370
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:06,135
Yeah! Yeah!

371
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:23,551
It's aliens.
It has to be.

372
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:25,754
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor,
Morris Bench,

373
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:27,421
who was exposed
to an experimental

374
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:29,524
underwater generator
and got hydro powers.

375
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:31,092
You should
definitely believe

376
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,694
everything
on the Internet.

377
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:35,197
- Spider-Man could take him.
- What do you think it is?

378
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:39,236
You know,
being a man of science...

379
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:41,869
witches.

380
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:43,838
No, no, no.
We wanna stay.

381
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,573
Good thing
I packed your suit, huh?

382
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,073
<i>I can't believe you forgot it.</i>

383
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:48,508
Yeah.

384
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,076
Who was that guy
you were with?

385
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:51,345
Was that Mr. Strange?

386
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:54,247
Doctor Strange, May.
Doctor Strange.

387
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:55,983
And, no, I don't know
who that was.

388
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:57,351
<i>It was a new guy.</i>

389
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:59,486
- I was trying to help him...
- That's my lunch.

390
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:00,721
Don't eat
that one.

391
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:01,721
Happy's there?

392
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,858
Yeah, it's Happy.

393
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,092
He's here.
He came by to volunteer.

394
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:08,362
<i>And he's hanging
around the office.</i>

395
00:26:08,364 --> 00:26:10,864
- And he wants to say hi.
- I don't want... Hi, Peter.

396
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:12,301
Hey, Happy.

397
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:17,938
Sorry, I'm working hard here.
I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.

398
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,274
- What are you...?
- <i>Glad you're having a good time.</i>

399
00:26:20,276 --> 00:26:22,278
Don't worry, I'm taking
care of your aunt.

400
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:27,750
So how's
the plan going?

401
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,919
There's been setbacks,
for sure.

402
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:34,421
Trust your instincts,
you'll be fine.

403
00:26:34,423 --> 00:26:37,258
I know. Love you.
Bye.

404
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:40,093
Who is that guy?

405
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:41,996
He's Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

406
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:44,932
He's all right.
He's no Spider-Man.

407
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:46,769
What is it with you
and Spider-Man?

408
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:49,937
What?
He's just awesome, okay?

409
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:53,373
He protects the neighborhood
and, you know, he's inspiring.

410
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,575
He inspires me
to be a better man.

411
00:26:55,577 --> 00:26:57,978
What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.

412
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:02,950
Sounds like
his name's Mysterio.

413
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:04,785
<i>"L'uomo del misterio"</i>

414
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:06,987
is Italian
for "man of mystery."

415
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:08,555
They don't know
who he is.

416
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:10,093
Mysterio.

417
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,429
Cool name.

418
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:14,996
Babe.

419
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:17,031
So how much of that
did you actually see?

420
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,100
Not much. I was running.

421
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:22,003
Right. Me too.
I was also running...

422
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:23,140
away.

423
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:27,374
So Paris tomorrow.

424
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:30,111
Go to the Eiffel Tower.
Should be great.

425
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:33,046
Yeah, I read it was secretly
built as a mind control antenna

426
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:34,782
to create an army
of the insane.

427
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,182
Oh.

428
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:37,185
It's my favorite

429
00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:38,386
destination on the trip.

430
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:44,057
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

431
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:45,994
Nothing. It's dead.

432
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:48,428
Besides, that Mysterio guy's
all over it.

433
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,297
Look, I just wanna
spend time with MJ.

434
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,300
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

435
00:27:53,302 --> 00:27:54,636
That's nice.

436
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:56,838
Reminds me of when
Betty and I fell in love.

437
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,042
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, and...

438
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:08,051
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

439
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:13,053
You're Nick Fury.

440
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:14,622
And you just shot Ned.

441
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:16,123
It's a mild tranquilizer.

442
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,123
He'll be all right.

443
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:20,261
So good to finally meet you.

444
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:21,928
I saw you at the funeral,

445
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,698
I didn't think that was
a good time to exchange numbers.

446
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,735
No, that would've
been inappropriate.

447
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:28,870
- That's what I just said.
- Right.

448
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:31,339
The important thing is,
you're here.

449
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:32,740
I tried to bring you here.

450
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:35,709
You avoided me,
and now you're here.

451
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:37,512
What a coincidence.

452
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:39,746
Wait. Was this
a coincidence?

453
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:43,117
I used to know everything.

454
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,953
Then I come back
five years later,

455
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,887
and now I know nothing.

456
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:49,689
No intel, no team.

457
00:28:49,691 --> 00:28:51,993
And a high school kid

458
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:55,028
is dodging my calls.

459
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,599
Here's what I do know:

460
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:04,572
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

461
00:29:04,574 --> 00:29:08,075
Witnesses say
that cyclone had a face.

462
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,417
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

463
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:18,055
A village was...

464
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:20,588
Just making the rounds.

465
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,390
See if anyone needs
any counseling

466
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:24,057
after today's
traumatic events.

467
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,659
No, we'll be okay.
We're fine. Thank you.

468
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:30,230
Great because I'm...
I'm not qualified to actually...

469
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:31,631
Oh, he's passed out.

470
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:34,704
I'm not qualified to
do it anyway, so good night.

471
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:38,605
That was my teacher.
Sorry about that.

472
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:39,841
You were saying?

473
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:41,342
A village was
destroyed by what

474
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,277
may well be
another world-threatening...

475
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,678
Babe, you still awake?

476
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,514
You're not answering
any of my texts.

477
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:48,282
Um, he's asleep, Betty.

478
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:49,749
Oh, already?

479
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:51,585
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay.

480
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:53,454
That's why
it's imperative...

481
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:55,823
Hey, boys.
So that canal water today

482
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,993
was filled
with dangerous bacteria...

483
00:29:57,995 --> 00:29:59,794
Another person
touches that door,

484
00:29:59,796 --> 00:30:01,829
we are going
to attend another funeral.

485
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:03,464
- Suit up.
- Let me know if

486
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:04,966
either of you
develop vomiting.

487
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:10,638
Stark left these for you.

488
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,309
Really?

489
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:27,688
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

490
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,355
Stark said
you wouldn't get that

491
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:31,859
because it's not
a <i>Star Wars</i> reference.

492
00:30:35,664 --> 00:30:37,165
You can lose the mask.

493
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,034
Everyone here
has seen you without it.

494
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:40,700
You'd only be
feigning anonymity

495
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:43,773
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

496
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,879
Come on.

497
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,882
Yeah.

498
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:57,253
Over there,
we have Maria Hill.

499
00:30:58,554 --> 00:31:01,854
That is Dimitri.

500
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:05,327
And this is Mr. Beck.

501
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,696
Mysterio?

502
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:09,865
What?

503
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:12,966
Doesn't matter.
It's what my friends

504
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:14,168
have been calling you.

505
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,507
Well, you can
call me Quentin.

506
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,876
You handled yourself well
out there today.

507
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:23,544
I saw what you did
with the tower.

508
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:25,612
We could use someone like you
on my world.

509
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,348
Thanks.

510
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,850
I'm sorry. Your world?

511
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:31,619
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

512
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:33,187
Just not yours.

513
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:35,055
There are multiple realities.

514
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:38,258
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

515
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,461
I'm sorry, you're saying
there's a multiverse?

516
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:43,430
'Cause I thought
that was theoretical.

517
00:31:43,432 --> 00:31:45,431
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

518
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,802
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

519
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:50,138
How does that even work
with all the quantum...?

520
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
It's insane.

521
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:56,677
S-sorry. It's really cool.

522
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:00,348
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

523
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,949
Anyway...

524
00:32:05,054 --> 00:32:08,089
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

525
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:10,358
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

526
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,960
Air, water, fire, earth.

527
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:15,596
The Science Division had
a technical name.

528
00:32:15,598 --> 00:32:17,765
We just called them
Elementals.

529
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:20,266
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

530
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:22,136
Turns out,
the myths are real.

531
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:24,036
Like Thor.

532
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:27,175
Thor was a myth, now I study him
in my physics class.

533
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:29,676
These myths are threats.

534
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:32,446
They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.

535
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:33,913
We mobilized
and fought them,

536
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:36,516
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

537
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:39,586
I was part of the last battalion
left trying to stop them.

538
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:41,855
All we did was
delay the inevitable.

539
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:45,024
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

540
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:46,494
Our satellites
confirm it.

541
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:49,296
So thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

542
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:51,130
There's only one left:
fire.

543
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:53,501
The strongest
of them all.

544
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:55,005
The one that destroyed
my Earth.

545
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:59,073
It's the one
that took my family.

546
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:03,977
I'm sorry.

547
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:06,514
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

548
00:33:06,516 --> 00:33:09,417
We have one mission:
kill it.

549
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:10,653
And you're coming with us.

550
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,422
I'm sorry,
did you say Prague? Heh.

551
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:17,524
Mr. Fury,
this all seems like bigtime,

552
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:20,259
you know, huge superhero
kind of stuff.

553
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:23,831
And, I mean, I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

554
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:25,698
Bitch, please.
You've been to space.

555
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,333
I know,
but that was an accident.

556
00:33:27,335 --> 00:33:29,338
There's gotta be someone else
you can use.

557
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:32,406
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

558
00:33:32,408 --> 00:33:34,207
Okay, um, Doctor Strange.

559
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:35,842
- Unavailable.
- Captain Marvel.

560
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:37,343
Don't invoke her name.

561
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:39,178
Sir, look,
I really wanna help. I do.

562
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,049
If my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

563
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,651
If I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

564
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:46,853
my class will figure out
who I am, and then...

565
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:48,589
Then the whole world
will figure out

566
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,392
who I am,
then I'm done.

567
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:52,360
Okay.

568
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:53,729
I understand.

569
00:33:54,663 --> 00:33:56,330
I'm sorry, what?

570
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:59,099
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

571
00:33:59,101 --> 00:34:01,669
and become suspicious.

572
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:03,170
Dimitri.

573
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:05,505
Take him back to the hotel,
please.

574
00:34:05,507 --> 00:34:06,506
Yes.

575
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:08,575
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

576
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:10,643
And, uh, good luck.

577
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,080
See you, kid.

578
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:15,751
Yeah, see you.

579
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,589
- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.

580
00:34:24,227 --> 00:34:25,692
Okay, drink lots
of water.

581
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:27,594
I'm gonna get you
a vitamin C pill.

582
00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:30,563
- You cannot get sick, okay?
- Okay. Thanks, baby.

583
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,433
Hey, man, are you sure
you're good?

584
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:33,967
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

585
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,469
- Okay. Nice.
- Don't worry.

586
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:38,071
Seriously, getting tranq'd
in the neck by Nick Fury,

587
00:34:38,073 --> 00:34:40,440
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me.

588
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:41,808
- It is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

589
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,743
I'm happy I don't have
to go to Prague.

590
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:45,045
- Seriously.
- Good news.

591
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:47,580
We're going to Prague. Huh?

592
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:49,149
- What?
- Prague?

593
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:51,585
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

594
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:53,821
You should've heard me
on the phone with them.

595
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:55,288
I really gave them hell.

596
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,757
All I heard was
crying.

597
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,259
Look at
our upgraded ride. Huh?

598
00:34:58,261 --> 00:34:59,458
Whoa, bro,
you see that?

599
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,728
It's pretty sick.

600
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,696
I'm impressed,
Mr. Harrington.

601
00:35:02,698 --> 00:35:04,364
Oh, come on.

602
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:07,868
Peter, what...?
What's going on?

603
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,304
I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.

604
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:14,741
I'm, uh, Mr. Harrington
to the kids...

605
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:16,476
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

606
00:35:16,478 --> 00:35:17,681
Awesome.

607
00:35:18,881 --> 00:35:21,281
Yeah. Awesome.

608
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,339
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

609
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:49,144
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

610
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,433
"For the next Tony Stark,
I trust you.

611
00:36:13,435 --> 00:36:15,038
Say EDITH."

612
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:20,341
<i>Stand by for
retinal and biometric scan.</i>

613
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:22,509
<i>Retinal and biometric scan
accepted.</i>

614
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:24,844
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i>

615
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:26,813
<i>I am EDITH, Tony Stark's</i>

616
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:30,016
<i>augmented-reality
security and defense system.</i>

617
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:32,819
- So he made you for me?
<i>- No. But you have access</i>

618
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:35,022
- <i>to all of Tony's protocols.</i>
- Cool.

619
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:37,091
<i>Would you like
to see what I can do?</i>

620
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:46,500
<i>EDITH stands for
"Even dead, I'm the hero."</i>

621
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:48,067
<i>Tony loved his acronyms.</i>

622
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:50,705
- Yeah, he did.
<i>- I have access to</i>

623
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,940
<i>the entire
Stark Global Security network,</i>

624
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:55,009
<i>including multiple
defense satellites,</i>

625
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:56,576
<i>as well as back doors</i>

626
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:58,448
<i>to all major
telecommunication networks.</i>

627
00:36:59,415 --> 00:37:00,450
Whoa.

628
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:06,589
Is MJ texting?

629
00:37:09,392 --> 00:37:11,324
No. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

630
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:13,393
That's wrong. That's wrong.

631
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:33,379
Petrol and toilets.
Ten minutes!

632
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:35,549
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

633
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,917
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

634
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,618
Ten minutes,
everyone.

635
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,758
Dimitri,
where exactly are we?

636
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:46,125
Okay.
I'll figure it out.

637
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:47,426
Oh, my gosh,
it's so sick.

638
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:49,629
It's beautiful.

639
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:50,933
What?

640
00:38:03,678 --> 00:38:04,911
Hello.

641
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:06,149
Close the door.

642
00:38:10,118 --> 00:38:12,118
Um...

643
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,487
I'm Peter Parker.

644
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,325
Take off your clothes.

645
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:18,091
- Excuse me?
- You told Fury

646
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:20,560
Spider-Man
cannot be seen in Europe.

647
00:38:20,562 --> 00:38:22,531
So I made you this,
another suit.

648
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:26,667
Oh, uh, thank you.

649
00:38:26,669 --> 00:38:28,902
I'm sure it fits fine.
I don't need to try...

650
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:31,341
- Take off your clothes.
- Okay.

651
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,344
Sure.

652
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:38,078
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Now. Hurry up.

653
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,049
This is weird. Heh.

654
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:44,650
No, no, no. Don't...

655
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:45,888
Whoa.

656
00:38:46,855 --> 00:38:48,154
Uh...

657
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:50,190
Sorry. I thought
this was the bathroom.

658
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:51,792
This is not
what it looks like.

659
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,159
- Just...
- Yeah.

660
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:55,196
- What are you doing?
- I'll leave you alone.

661
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:56,964
Oh, my God.
Don't shoot anybody.

662
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:59,065
Brad? It's not what
it looks like, buddy.

663
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:01,067
- Hey, man, look, that's...
- Look, Peter,

664
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,335
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

665
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:06,038
If you want to hook up with
some random European chick,

666
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,009
- that's on you.
- That's not what that was.

667
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:09,975
I can't pretend
I didn't see what I saw.

668
00:39:09,977 --> 00:39:12,446
I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.

669
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:14,614
- But I like her too.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

670
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:16,650
You cannot show her
that photo, dude.

671
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:18,518
I'm sorry, man.
I have to.

672
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,821
She deserves the truth.

673
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:23,391
Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,

674
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,324
and, everybody,
back on the bus.

675
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:27,330
It's been 10 minutes.
Let's go!

676
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:34,533
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

677
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:36,303
- EDITH?
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i>

678
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:38,304
- <i>How can I help you?</i>
- Hey. There's this guy

679
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:40,306
in my class who's gonna
ruin everything...

680
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:42,641
<i>Peter,
I'm having difficulty hearing you.</i>

681
00:39:42,643 --> 00:39:44,078
<i>Can you please speak up?</i>

682
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,580
Um, Brad Davis.
He has a photo of me.

683
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:48,716
<i>Brad Davis. Is he a target?</i>

684
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:50,053
Is Brad a target? Um...

685
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,424
Yeah. He's a target.
He's a target.

686
00:39:57,426 --> 00:39:59,025
<i>Copy that.</i>

687
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:01,728
<i>Target is Brad Davis.
Initiating strike.</i>

688
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,096
Initiating what, now?

689
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:04,797
<i>Intercept point determined.</i>

690
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:06,366
- <i>Releasing kill vehicle.</i>
- EDITH.

691
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:31,958
- Oh, my God.
- Dope glasses, Parker.

692
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,294
- How'd you pay for these?
- Flash, give them back.

693
00:40:34,296 --> 00:40:37,464
- I'm paying you a compliment.
- Please give me...

694
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:38,668
I'm so sorry.

695
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:42,234
EDITH, don't kill Brad.

696
00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:43,737
<i>Do you want me to cancel</i>

697
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:45,237
<i>the drone strike
on Brad Davis?</i>

698
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,640
- Did you just punch Flash?
- No.

699
00:40:46,642 --> 00:40:47,642
<i>Firing.</i>

700
00:40:50,513 --> 00:40:52,178
Oh, look out!

701
00:40:55,785 --> 00:40:57,417
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

702
00:40:57,419 --> 00:40:58,984
- EDITH.
- Harrington!

703
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:01,289
- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.

704
00:41:02,924 --> 00:41:04,591
<i>Commencing second strike.</i>

705
00:41:04,593 --> 00:41:06,493
Peter. Plant your fanny
and buckle up.

706
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:08,094
Look at
the baby mountain goats!

707
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,797
- Baby mountain goats?
- Ooh, I see them.

708
00:41:24,312 --> 00:41:26,614
I don't see
any mountain goats.

709
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:28,147
You missed them.

710
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:30,650
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

711
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:32,085
What?

712
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:34,654
...but your new look,
I love it.

713
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:36,656
- Right, babe?
- Thanks.

714
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:39,627
Yeah. Sophisticated,
classy, very European.

715
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:40,759
Oh, man.

716
00:41:41,997 --> 00:41:43,964
Let's try that again.

717
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:47,333
Uh, this is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

718
00:41:47,335 --> 00:41:50,372
- I-I...
- Yeah. Weird.

719
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,210
Ow.

720
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:22,335
- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.

721
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:24,839
Wow, this place
is so classy.

722
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:26,406
Yeah, so why
are we here?

723
00:42:26,408 --> 00:42:28,208
Speak for yourself.

724
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,842
I'm home.

725
00:42:29,844 --> 00:42:31,511
What can I say?

726
00:42:31,513 --> 00:42:33,846
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

727
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:37,551
Everyone get settled in, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

728
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:40,152
is Prague's annual...

729
00:42:40,154 --> 00:42:41,754
- ...Carnival of Lights.
- Yeah!

730
00:42:41,756 --> 00:42:43,357
- Hello?
<i>- Parker, it's Hill.</i>

731
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,058
<i>There's an earpiece
with your suit.</i>

732
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,060
<i>Put it on and await
further instructions.</i>

733
00:42:47,062 --> 00:42:48,395
- <i>Understood?</i>
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

734
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:49,763
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Hey, man.

735
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:52,098
- Hey.
- Look, I am so sorry

736
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,734
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

737
00:42:54,736 --> 00:42:56,303
I'm still your guy
in the chair.

738
00:42:56,305 --> 00:42:58,304
No, it's all good.
Don't worry about it.

739
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:00,940
- Okay. Great, great.
- It's fine.

740
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:03,375
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

741
00:43:03,377 --> 00:43:05,911
- Where's it gonna happen?
- Uh, here in the city.

742
00:43:05,913 --> 00:43:08,315
- Peter, we're here.
- I know, I know. It's not good.

743
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:09,716
It's... I'm figuring it out.

744
00:43:09,718 --> 00:43:11,784
You have to do something,
Peter, please.

745
00:43:11,786 --> 00:43:13,152
We're all counting on you.

746
00:43:13,154 --> 00:43:15,121
- Ned.
- Yeah. Yeah, babe.

747
00:43:15,123 --> 00:43:17,958
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

748
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,759
- It's about time.
- Serious?

749
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,261
<i>- Parker? Parker!</i>
- Yes, sir.

750
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:24,630
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

751
00:43:24,632 --> 00:43:26,598
- Are we boring you?
- He's not bored.

752
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,701
He's thinking about
how you kidnapped him.

753
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:30,303
He had obstacles.

754
00:43:30,305 --> 00:43:32,272
I removed them.

755
00:43:32,274 --> 00:43:34,207
They still won't
evacuate the city.

756
00:43:34,209 --> 00:43:36,877
Idiots.

757
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:38,745
So, what's the plan,
Parker?

758
00:43:38,747 --> 00:43:41,248
I will be in
the cathedral tower,

759
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,949
keeping watch
for the fire monster.

760
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:45,551
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

761
00:43:45,553 --> 00:43:48,990
- and then Mr. Beck and I will...
- My name is Mysterio.

762
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:54,259
That's when Mysterio and I
will move in.

763
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:55,661
Peter, listen to me.

764
00:43:55,663 --> 00:43:58,332
The best hope you have,
the only hope,

765
00:43:58,334 --> 00:44:01,868
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

766
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,004
Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,

767
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:06,973
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

768
00:44:06,975 --> 00:44:08,942
If it gets too big,
it'll be able to

769
00:44:08,944 --> 00:44:10,611
draw power
from the Earth's core.

770
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:13,850
After that,
there's no way to stop it.

771
00:44:17,652 --> 00:44:19,319
Hey, my friends are here.

772
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:21,888
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

773
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,091
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

774
00:44:25,093 --> 00:44:30,196
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

775
00:44:30,198 --> 00:44:33,632
Stark gave you
a multibillion-dollar

776
00:44:33,634 --> 00:44:35,969
A.R. tactical
intelligence system,

777
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:37,638
and the first thing
you do with it

778
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,205
is try and blow up
your friends.

779
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:44,180
It's clear to me that
you were not ready for this.

780
00:44:50,152 --> 00:44:53,219
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

781
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,388
He just... He felt bad
about snapping at you.

782
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:56,855
Really?

783
00:44:56,857 --> 00:44:59,426
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

784
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:02,197
How you feeling?

785
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:06,900
Uh...

786
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:10,270
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

787
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:12,874
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

788
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:18,111
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

789
00:45:18,113 --> 00:45:20,950
and now it's all ruined.

790
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:30,759
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

791
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:33,826
It's a hard path.

792
00:45:33,828 --> 00:45:36,196
You see things.
You do things.

793
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:37,466
You make choices.

794
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:40,402
People look up to you...

795
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:44,473
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

796
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:47,576
I like you, Peter.
You're a good kid.

797
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:52,946
There's a part of me that
wants me to tell you, just...

798
00:45:52,948 --> 00:45:54,880
turn around,
run away from all this.

799
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:56,549
Then there's
another part of me

800
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:58,752
that knows what
we're about to fight,

801
00:45:58,754 --> 00:46:02,158
what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.

802
00:46:03,426 --> 00:46:04,725
Me too.

803
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:07,092
But you're worried about
your friends.

804
00:46:07,094 --> 00:46:08,962
Yeah.

805
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:11,899
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

806
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:14,500
Look,
just get them inside

807
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:17,002
and keep them in a safe place
for just a few hours.

808
00:46:17,004 --> 00:46:18,039
They'll be all right.

809
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:22,609
It's really nice to have
somebody to talk to

810
00:46:22,611 --> 00:46:24,547
about superhero stuff,
you know?

811
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:27,614
Anytime.

812
00:46:27,616 --> 00:46:30,283
And, hey,
we survive this,

813
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:32,317
you'll have all summer
to kill Brad.

814
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:37,323
See you out there.

815
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:38,325
All right.

816
00:46:42,564 --> 00:46:43,596
<i>Scusi.</i>

817
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:46,565
Sorry, that's Italian.

818
00:46:48,402 --> 00:46:51,737
Okay. EDITH?
Oh, come on.

819
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:53,607
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i>
- Hey, uh...

820
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:56,475
I need a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.

821
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:58,143
<i>Let's see what we can do.</i>

822
00:46:58,145 --> 00:46:59,879
Good news.

823
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:01,547
We're going to the opera!

824
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:03,216
- You're kidding me.
- The opera?

825
00:47:03,218 --> 00:47:04,384
Don't look at me.

826
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:05,886
What happened
to the carnival?

827
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:07,620
This is upgrade living, guys.

828
00:47:07,622 --> 00:47:11,458
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

829
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,493
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

830
00:47:14,495 --> 00:47:18,964
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

831
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:22,000
Uh, I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

832
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:23,569
Thank you, Ned.

833
00:47:23,571 --> 00:47:26,672
Everyone,
this is gonna be, maybe,

834
00:47:26,674 --> 00:47:29,542
the best four hours
of our whole trip.

835
00:47:29,544 --> 00:47:31,044
Four hours?

836
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:33,647
Guys, I think this
is gonna be fun. Seriously.

837
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:39,152
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

838
00:47:39,154 --> 00:47:41,821
Yeah, because we'd much
rather go to a four-hour opera

839
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,890
instead of the biggest party
in the world.

840
00:47:43,892 --> 00:47:46,493
Again,
don't look at me.

841
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:48,328
<i>Parker, do you copy?</i>

842
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,598
<i>Comm check, one, two.</i>

843
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:53,966
Okay, here we are.

844
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:55,669
Beat the rush.

845
00:47:55,671 --> 00:47:57,304
Yeah, the rush out.

846
00:47:57,306 --> 00:48:00,509
Lucky for us, we got
the best seats in the house.

847
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:02,676
Let's go.

848
00:48:04,346 --> 00:48:06,114
Hey.
I'll save you a seat.

849
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:14,955
You look really pretty.

850
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:16,788
And therefore,
I have value?

851
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,759
No. No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just...

852
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:21,226
I'm messing with you.

853
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:24,263
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

854
00:48:24,265 --> 00:48:27,299
- You look pretty too.
- Thank you.

855
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:29,902
- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
- So cute.

856
00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:31,737
- Can I...?
- Yeah.

857
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:34,007
Want to go in on a pair?

858
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:35,607
You mean,
sit next to each other?

859
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:36,942
Yeah.

860
00:48:36,944 --> 00:48:38,779
<i>Are you in position?</i>

861
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:40,346
- No.
- Okay. No...

862
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:41,882
<i>Why the hell not? Parker?</i>

863
00:48:41,884 --> 00:48:43,516
You don't want to
sit next to me,

864
00:48:43,518 --> 00:48:45,451
or, no, you just
don't want the glasses?

865
00:48:45,453 --> 00:48:47,187
I didn't mean that.
Uh, uh...

866
00:48:47,189 --> 00:48:49,558
If you go ahead,
I'll go grab us a pair.

867
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:52,592
I'll save you
a seat next to me.

868
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:53,861
Awesome.

869
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:56,129
A lot of seats,
so I'll be up there.

870
00:48:56,131 --> 00:48:57,330
Okay.

871
00:48:57,332 --> 00:49:00,132
<i>- Parker.</i>
- No, I'm coming. I'm...

872
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:02,601
Hey, I gotta go.
Could you tell MJ

873
00:49:02,603 --> 00:49:04,504
that I'm sick
or something?

874
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,440
Okay. Be careful.

875
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:08,107
And Peter,
whatever you do,

876
00:49:08,109 --> 00:49:10,609
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

877
00:49:10,611 --> 00:49:12,411
Yeah, Ned, I know.

878
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:13,446
- Okay.
- Okay?

879
00:49:13,448 --> 00:49:14,983
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

880
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:33,132
<i>Parker!
You better be on your way.</i>

881
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:34,266
Coming.

882
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:42,775
Where do you think she's going?
To the carnival?

883
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:45,245
- Oh, I... I don't...
- We should go. Yes, we should go.

884
00:49:45,247 --> 00:49:48,647
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

885
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:05,665
All right. I'm in position.

886
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,466
Uh, as soon as
I see something,

887
00:50:07,468 --> 00:50:09,634
Beck, I'll, uh...
I'll let you know.

888
00:50:09,636 --> 00:50:11,804
<i>- Roger that.
- How's the suit?</i>

889
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:14,040
Ah, the suit's great.
It's awesome.

890
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:16,375
It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

891
00:50:16,377 --> 00:50:18,411
<i>- Parker!</i>
- Okay, I'll shut up.

892
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:21,013
Oh, my God, babe,
isn't this beautiful?

893
00:50:21,015 --> 00:50:23,417
Yeah, it's real beautiful,
babe.

894
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:26,752
- What's wrong?
- You know, honestly, I just...

895
00:50:26,754 --> 00:50:29,388
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should...

896
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,658
I have the perfect thing.
Come on.

897
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,027
Heh.

898
00:50:40,701 --> 00:50:42,335
Don't worry, babe.

899
00:50:42,337 --> 00:50:44,837
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

900
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:46,542
You'll feel
a thousand times better.

901
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:52,879
Energy spiking.

902
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:54,214
We have seismic activity.

903
00:51:05,826 --> 00:51:08,694
Okay, he's here! Beck, are you
ready? You know what to do.

904
00:51:08,696 --> 00:51:11,099
On your lead, Spider-Man.

905
00:51:16,538 --> 00:51:17,603
No, come back!

906
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:19,174
Come back and help us!

907
00:51:25,913 --> 00:51:27,116
You're up, kid.

908
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:41,426
Wait, wait. Is that...?

909
00:51:41,428 --> 00:51:42,962
Do you think
that's Spider-Man?

910
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:44,230
Uh-uh.
No, no, no.

911
00:51:44,232 --> 00:51:46,199
It's a European
rip-off version of him.

912
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:48,070
I actually read about him.
It's not him.

913
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:03,783
No, Beck!
He's got the carousel!

914
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:05,618
He's getting bigger!

915
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,453
What's his name?
What's his name?

916
00:52:07,455 --> 00:52:09,121
Uh, it's Night...
Night Monkey.

917
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:10,623
- Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

918
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:12,257
- Yeah.
- Night Monkey!

919
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:14,326
- Yeah. Night Monkey.
- Night Monkey, help!

920
00:52:14,328 --> 00:52:15,594
- Save us!
- What?

921
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:17,263
Night Monkey, we're stuck!

922
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:19,033
- Oh, no, no.
- Help us! Help!

923
00:52:33,348 --> 00:52:34,348
Are you okay?

924
00:52:37,886 --> 00:52:39,618
On to Plan B?

925
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,288
Yeah! We gotta hit him
with something he can't absorb!

926
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,757
I go left,
you go right! Now!

927
00:53:00,607 --> 00:53:01,873
Okay, shoot him!

928
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:03,275
Yeah!

929
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:07,582
That hurt him.
Keep it coming.

930
00:53:15,656 --> 00:53:17,591
<i>Spider-Man,
keep your distance.</i>

931
00:53:17,593 --> 00:53:19,491
<i>I'm trying!</i>

932
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:21,828
<i>Can't let him get
near the Ferris wheel.</i>

933
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,429
<i>Okay. I'm on it!</i>

934
00:53:34,075 --> 00:53:35,743
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

935
00:53:46,254 --> 00:53:48,223
Whoa, what is that?!

936
00:53:55,663 --> 00:53:57,065
Betty! Betty!

937
00:54:17,752 --> 00:54:20,622
That's it! Nice!
Nice! You got him!

938
00:54:26,928 --> 00:54:28,931
No, no, no.

939
00:54:35,337 --> 00:54:36,505
It's too late.

940
00:54:37,906 --> 00:54:39,971
Whatever happens...

941
00:54:39,973 --> 00:54:41,674
I'm glad we met.

942
00:54:41,676 --> 00:54:43,444
Beck,
what are you doing?

943
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:47,114
What I should have done
last time.

944
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:53,121
Beck, don't do it!

945
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:58,991
Beck!

946
00:55:19,214 --> 00:55:20,748
Mr. Beck?

947
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:24,852
Oh, thank God.

948
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,993
I would totally kiss you,

949
00:55:34,995 --> 00:55:37,365
but I think I just threw up
in my mouth a little.

950
00:55:41,002 --> 00:55:42,437
I might have a mint.

951
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:45,370
So it's over?

952
00:55:45,372 --> 00:55:47,205
That was the last of them.

953
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:50,375
But not the last threat
we'll ever face.

954
00:55:50,377 --> 00:55:54,045
We need to stay vigilant.

955
00:55:54,047 --> 00:55:56,649
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

956
00:55:56,651 --> 00:56:00,620
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

957
00:56:00,622 --> 00:56:02,257
You should join us.

958
00:56:03,857 --> 00:56:06,594
Thank you. I just might
take you up on that.

959
00:56:16,203 --> 00:56:20,239
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

960
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:21,440
Mr. Fury, I...

961
00:56:21,442 --> 00:56:24,176
I'd love to have you
in Berlin too.

962
00:56:24,178 --> 00:56:29,248
But you got to decide whether
you're going to step up or not.

963
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,949
Stark chose you.

964
00:56:30,951 --> 00:56:33,786
He made you an Avenger.

965
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:35,888
I need that.

966
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,257
The world needs that.

967
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:40,996
Maybe Stark was wrong.

968
00:56:43,864 --> 00:56:45,000
Was he?

969
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:49,201
The choice is yours.

970
00:57:03,384 --> 00:57:05,286
Let's get a drink.

971
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:09,721
I'm not 21.

972
00:57:16,698 --> 00:57:18,100
Hey.

973
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:23,169
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

974
00:57:23,171 --> 00:57:24,473
Yeah.

975
00:57:25,506 --> 00:57:27,473
Fury was right.

976
00:57:27,475 --> 00:57:30,009
Tony did a lot
for me...

977
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:32,112
so I owe it to him,
to everybody.

978
00:57:32,114 --> 00:57:34,080
Do you?

979
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:36,018
Yeah. I mean...

980
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:40,620
Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

981
00:57:40,622 --> 00:57:42,453
He wanted me to be
better than him.

982
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:44,524
And Fury just wants me
to live up to that.

983
00:57:44,526 --> 00:57:46,091
What do you want, Peter?

984
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:48,828
- What do you mean?
- What do you want?

985
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,129
I don't know.

986
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:52,931
What do you want?
Peter Parker. Now.

987
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:54,500
I know you're
thinking about it.

988
00:57:54,502 --> 00:57:55,935
I wanna go on my trip,
right?

989
00:57:55,937 --> 00:57:58,138
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

990
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,306
And go to
the top of the Eiffel Tower

991
00:58:01,308 --> 00:58:04,645
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

992
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:08,614
- and give her a kiss.
- Whoa.

993
00:58:08,616 --> 00:58:10,281
Shut up, man.

994
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:11,951
You're not gonna do that,
are you?

995
00:58:11,953 --> 00:58:13,685
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

996
00:58:13,687 --> 00:58:15,790
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

997
00:58:18,192 --> 00:58:20,527
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
- What are those?

998
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:22,362
- Are those the...?
- EDITH glasses, yeah.

999
00:58:22,364 --> 00:58:24,029
They were just
on the floor?

1000
00:58:24,031 --> 00:58:25,864
Try them on.
Let's see how they look.

1001
00:58:25,866 --> 00:58:26,866
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1002
00:58:30,504 --> 00:58:32,504
I actually
really like them.

1003
00:58:32,506 --> 00:58:33,906
Can I be
completely honest?

1004
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:35,040
Please.

1005
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:36,875
They look really stupid.

1006
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:38,310
Oh.

1007
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:40,645
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

1008
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:42,181
You try them on.

1009
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:43,982
- No, come on.
- Try them on.

1010
00:58:43,984 --> 00:58:46,087
- I don't wanna try them on.
- Just put them on.

1011
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:55,697
What do you think, kid?

1012
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:03,301
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1013
00:59:03,303 --> 00:59:05,703
"For the next Tony
Stark, I trust you."

1014
00:59:05,705 --> 00:59:07,205
What?

1015
00:59:07,207 --> 00:59:09,341
Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

1016
00:59:09,343 --> 00:59:11,243
"For the next Tony Stark,
I trust you."

1017
00:59:11,245 --> 00:59:14,080
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

1018
00:59:14,082 --> 00:59:15,848
He knew every mistake
I ever made.

1019
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,583
He must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

1020
00:59:18,585 --> 00:59:19,986
Why would
he give it to you?

1021
00:59:19,988 --> 00:59:21,888
Maybe he didn't trust me
to have EDITH,

1022
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,755
he just trusted me
to pick who should.

1023
00:59:23,757 --> 00:59:26,426
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

1024
00:59:26,428 --> 00:59:28,027
He's not gonna
give them to Fury

1025
00:59:28,029 --> 00:59:29,895
because Fury would
give himself EDITH.

1026
00:59:29,897 --> 00:59:31,397
You're probably right.

1027
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:34,634
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

1028
00:59:34,636 --> 00:59:37,703
And it's not me. I'm
a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

1029
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:40,605
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

1030
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:43,643
and that's good
like Tony Stark, like you.

1031
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:46,648
No. Peter, come on. No.

1032
00:59:49,116 --> 00:59:50,449
- EDITH?
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i>

1033
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:52,984
Hi. Yeah, um...

1034
00:59:52,986 --> 00:59:56,221
I'd like to transfer your
control over to Quentin Beck.

1035
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:58,958
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Doing the right thing.

1036
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,192
<i>Any transfer will
require confirmation.</i>

1037
01:00:01,194 --> 01:00:03,096
Stark gave you
the glasses.

1038
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,462
Stark gave me a choice.

1039
01:00:04,464 --> 01:00:06,598
It's my choice to make.
I'm gonna make it.

1040
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,301
You're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

1041
01:00:09,303 --> 01:00:12,103
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

1042
01:00:12,105 --> 01:00:13,806
He'd want you to have them.

1043
01:00:13,808 --> 01:00:15,440
<i>Waiting for confirmation.</i>

1044
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:16,812
Confirm.

1045
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:21,913
Welcome to the Avengers.

1046
01:00:30,257 --> 01:00:31,326
They look good on you.

1047
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:34,127
Thank you.

1048
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:36,161
It's an honor.

1049
01:00:36,163 --> 01:00:38,763
Yeah.

1050
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:40,968
Mr. Stark would've
really liked you.

1051
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:44,536
- Where you headed?
- I'm gonna go find MJ.

1052
01:00:44,538 --> 01:00:47,373
Good luck, kid. I'll give you
a fifty-fifty chance.

1053
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:48,507
You're pretty awkward.

1054
01:00:49,843 --> 01:00:51,442
Yeah.

1055
01:00:51,444 --> 01:00:53,848
- See you later, man.
- See you.

1056
01:01:25,547 --> 01:01:27,346
See?
That wasn't so hard.

1057
01:01:27,348 --> 01:01:29,515
Yes!

1058
01:01:29,517 --> 01:01:32,417
Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!

1059
01:01:39,861 --> 01:01:42,828
Okay, we got EDITH. Get these
connected to our system.

1060
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,230
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

1061
01:01:45,232 --> 01:01:48,000
This is a big win, but we still
got a lot of work to do.

1062
01:01:48,002 --> 01:01:49,835
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

1063
01:01:49,837 --> 01:01:51,603
Yeah!

1064
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:54,073
Okay, toasts!

1065
01:01:54,075 --> 01:01:55,373
Give me that, Doug.

1066
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,509
To the man
who brought us all together,

1067
01:01:57,511 --> 01:01:59,277
our former boss,
Tony Stark.

1068
01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:00,679
Boo!

1069
01:02:00,681 --> 01:02:02,382
The jester king.

1070
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:06,984
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

1071
01:02:06,986 --> 01:02:09,020
that he was unfit to wield.

1072
01:02:09,022 --> 01:02:11,422
Like the holographic system
I designed.

1073
01:02:11,424 --> 01:02:12,859
A revolutionary breakthrough

1074
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:15,359
with limitless applications
that Tony turned

1075
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:17,429
into a self-therapy machine
and renamed...

1076
01:02:17,431 --> 01:02:21,067
Binarily Augmented
Retro-Framing, or BARF.

1077
01:02:24,238 --> 01:02:26,038
Oh, $611 million

1078
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,207
for my little
therapeutic experiment.

1079
01:02:29,944 --> 01:02:31,777
<i>He renamed my life's work...</i>

1080
01:02:31,779 --> 01:02:32,877
"BARF."

1081
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:34,379
<i>I told him it was a mistake,</i>

1082
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:37,085
that my technology
could change the world.

1083
01:02:38,118 --> 01:02:40,219
And then...

1084
01:02:40,221 --> 01:02:41,456
he fired me.

1085
01:02:42,823 --> 01:02:44,825
Said I was...

1086
01:02:45,725 --> 01:02:47,161
unstable.

1087
01:02:48,562 --> 01:02:49,627
To Tony.

1088
01:02:49,629 --> 01:02:51,330
To Tony!

1089
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:52,998
Next, to William.

1090
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
William!

1091
01:02:55,002 --> 01:02:58,837
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

1092
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:01,507
With a box of scraps!

1093
01:03:01,509 --> 01:03:03,475
The integration
of my illusion tech

1094
01:03:03,477 --> 01:03:05,611
with your weaponized drones
was brilliant.

1095
01:03:05,613 --> 01:03:08,246
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

1096
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:09,649
And it's just the beginning.

1097
01:03:09,651 --> 01:03:11,716
- Thank you, brother.
- To Guterman.

1098
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:13,051
- Guterman!
- To Guterman!

1099
01:03:13,053 --> 01:03:14,719
The story you created
of a soldier

1100
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:16,455
from another Earth
named Quentin

1101
01:03:16,457 --> 01:03:19,223
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

1102
01:03:19,225 --> 01:03:22,328
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

1103
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:23,962
I mean,
everybody bought it.

1104
01:03:23,964 --> 01:03:25,464
- Gutes!
- Guterman!

1105
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:27,400
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

1106
01:03:27,402 --> 01:03:29,835
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

1107
01:03:29,837 --> 01:03:32,237
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

1108
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:33,672
Inspired idea.

1109
01:03:33,674 --> 01:03:35,975
- To Janice.
- Janice!

1110
01:03:35,977 --> 01:03:38,844
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered that EDITH

1111
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:42,513
was being handed over not to us,
not to the Defense Department,

1112
01:03:42,515 --> 01:03:43,683
but to a child.

1113
01:03:43,685 --> 01:03:45,350
- Thank you.
- To Janice!

1114
01:03:45,352 --> 01:03:48,286
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

1115
01:03:48,288 --> 01:03:51,290
There's a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

1116
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:54,025
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

1117
01:03:54,027 --> 01:03:56,362
the most qualified,
and no one cares.

1118
01:03:56,364 --> 01:03:58,297
Unless you're flying around
with a cape

1119
01:03:58,299 --> 01:03:59,998
or shooting lasers
from your hands,

1120
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,203
no one will even listen.

1121
01:04:04,638 --> 01:04:08,107
Well, I've got a cape
and lasers.

1122
01:04:09,544 --> 01:04:11,277
With our technology
and with EDITH,

1123
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:16,181
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

1124
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:17,348
Yeah!

1125
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,854
Then everyone will listen!

1126
01:04:21,888 --> 01:04:24,690
Not to a boozy man-child.

1127
01:04:24,692 --> 01:04:26,458
No!

1128
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,027
Not to a hormonal teenager.

1129
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:31,230
No!

1130
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:32,397
To me...

1131
01:04:32,399 --> 01:04:35,701
and to my very wealthy crew.

1132
01:04:35,703 --> 01:04:36,967
To us.

1133
01:04:36,969 --> 01:04:38,036
To us.

1134
01:04:38,038 --> 01:04:39,404
To Mysterio!

1135
01:04:39,406 --> 01:04:41,105
To Mysterio!

1136
01:04:41,107 --> 01:04:42,341
To Peter Parker.

1137
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:44,045
To Peter Parker!

1138
01:04:45,346 --> 01:04:46,981
Poor kid.

1139
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:49,984
Let's get to work.

1140
01:04:53,754 --> 01:04:55,620
- Peter, oh, my God.
- Hey. Hey.

1141
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:56,754
We almost died.

1142
01:04:56,756 --> 01:04:57,955
It's fine. It's fine.

1143
01:04:57,957 --> 01:04:59,792
Hey,
I'm done with the mission.

1144
01:04:59,794 --> 01:05:02,127
- Dude, the trip's over.
- What?

1145
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:04,295
There's monsters coming out
of the ground.

1146
01:05:04,297 --> 01:05:06,098
Of course our parents
want us home.

1147
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,966
Don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

1148
01:05:08,968 --> 01:05:11,337
Oh, my God.
Yes, good. Stay here.

1149
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:13,839
Don't... Put some clothes on.
We're booking flights.

1150
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:16,507
We came for science, we're
leaving because of witches.

1151
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:18,212
Welcome
to the new Dark Ages.

1152
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,748
- What is going on?
- We're going home in the morning.

1153
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,116
No, no, no.
All the Elementals are gone.

1154
01:05:25,118 --> 01:05:27,085
- Ned.
- Coming, sweetie.

1155
01:05:27,087 --> 01:05:30,892
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

1156
01:05:31,924 --> 01:05:33,594
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1157
01:05:34,962 --> 01:05:37,096
- Hey.
- Where were you?

1158
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:39,096
Um, I got lost.

1159
01:05:39,098 --> 01:05:40,598
We were worried
about you.

1160
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,833
Oh.

1161
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:43,502
Good thing you're back.
Hm.

1162
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:44,969
Yeah.

1163
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,471
So much for Paris,
right?

1164
01:05:46,473 --> 01:05:47,806
It would've been fun.

1165
01:05:47,808 --> 01:05:49,775
Yeah. Night.

1166
01:05:49,777 --> 01:05:51,045
Night.

1167
01:05:52,013 --> 01:05:53,812
You look ni...

1168
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:01,853
Okay.

1169
01:06:03,256 --> 01:06:04,288
- Oh.
- Hey.

1170
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:05,924
Hey.

1171
01:06:05,926 --> 01:06:08,159
Uh, look, um...

1172
01:06:08,161 --> 01:06:10,696
I'm not ready for this trip
to be over yet,

1173
01:06:10,698 --> 01:06:13,065
and I kind of want
to do something fun

1174
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:15,902
that's not on the itinerary
or planned

1175
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:17,069
or with Mr. Harrington.

1176
01:06:17,071 --> 01:06:18,904
Yes.

1177
01:06:18,906 --> 01:06:21,105
"Yes," like you wanna go?

1178
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:22,209
Yes.

1179
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,245
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

1180
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:28,015
Meet me outside
in five minutes.

1181
01:06:29,116 --> 01:06:30,748
- Five is good.
- Okay.

1182
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,388
- Okay, bye.
- Bye. Heh.

1183
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:39,794
<i>Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!</i>

1184
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:49,134
- Hey.
- Hey.

1185
01:06:49,136 --> 01:06:50,569
So where do
you wanna go?

1186
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:52,404
- Who cares?
- Awesome.

1187
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:54,205
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1188
01:07:00,247 --> 01:07:02,147
I'm glad we're doing this.

1189
01:07:02,149 --> 01:07:04,549
- Yeah, me too.
- To see the city a bit.

1190
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:08,087
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1191
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:10,254
- Oh.
- They would put them in a basket,

1192
01:07:10,256 --> 01:07:12,359
and they would drown
in the water.

1193
01:07:14,094 --> 01:07:16,029
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1194
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:19,630
Uh...

1195
01:07:19,632 --> 01:07:21,966
There's this thing
I've been wanting

1196
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:24,938
to talk to you about
for a while.

1197
01:07:26,908 --> 01:07:28,076
Yeah?

1198
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:30,908
It's our last night
in Europe,

1199
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:34,813
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1200
01:07:34,815 --> 01:07:36,647
I'm just gonna tell you.

1201
01:07:36,649 --> 01:07:38,583
Uh...

1202
01:07:38,585 --> 01:07:39,817
MJ, I...

1203
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:40,819
"I'm Spider-Man."

1204
01:07:42,522 --> 01:07:44,355
- What?
- That's what you were gonna say.

1205
01:07:44,357 --> 01:07:45,859
That you're Spider-Man.

1206
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:49,795
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1207
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:52,964
I mean, I've been watching you
for a while now.

1208
01:07:52,966 --> 01:07:56,368
It's kind of obvious.
Heh.

1209
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,937
I'm not Spider-Man.
What would make you think

1210
01:07:58,939 --> 01:08:00,071
that I was Spider-Man?

1211
01:08:00,073 --> 01:08:02,208
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

1212
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:05,911
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1213
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:07,879
No, I was sick. Remember?

1214
01:08:07,881 --> 01:08:09,781
- I had my... The tummy?
- Susan Yang thinks

1215
01:08:09,783 --> 01:08:11,382
- you're a male escort.
- What?

1216
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:14,118
- Of course I'm not a male escort.
- Then you're Spider-Man.

1217
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,254
- No, I'm not Spider-Man at all.
- What about tonight?

1218
01:08:17,256 --> 01:08:19,624
You snuck off and fought
that thing. I saw you.

1219
01:08:19,626 --> 01:08:22,128
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1220
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:24,728
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1221
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,265
- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

1222
01:08:26,267 --> 01:08:28,366
That's what it said
on the news,

1223
01:08:28,368 --> 01:08:30,638
and the news never lies.

1224
01:08:31,938 --> 01:08:33,438
Night Monkey. Okay.

1225
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,809
What are you doing?

1226
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,642
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man

1227
01:08:38,644 --> 01:08:40,147
use the same webs?

1228
01:08:41,314 --> 01:08:42,714
I mean, maybe.

1229
01:08:42,716 --> 01:08:45,652
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1230
01:08:49,657 --> 01:08:51,022
Were you only watching me

1231
01:08:51,024 --> 01:08:53,193
because you thought
I was Spider-Man?

1232
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:57,995
Yeah.

1233
01:08:57,997 --> 01:08:59,901
Why else
would I be watching you?

1234
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:04,706
Doesn't matter.
Just thought that maybe...

1235
01:09:10,877 --> 01:09:12,246
What the hell was that?

1236
01:09:14,114 --> 01:09:15,880
I don't know.

1237
01:09:26,426 --> 01:09:29,027
What is it, some kind
of projector or something?

1238
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:32,431
Yeah,
but it's really advanced.

1239
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:34,798
It... It looked so real.

1240
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,136
- It...
- Yeah, really real.

1241
01:09:38,138 --> 01:09:41,339
- Wait, does that mean that...?
- The Elementals are fake?

1242
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:44,877
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1243
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:47,881
There was fire
and destruction, and...

1244
01:09:49,483 --> 01:09:51,753
Who would do something
like that?

1245
01:10:00,827 --> 01:10:02,397
Mysterio.

1246
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:09,234
I am Spider-Man.

1247
01:10:09,236 --> 01:10:10,569
And I've really messed up.

1248
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:13,204
Wait. You're b-being
serious right now?

1249
01:10:13,206 --> 01:10:15,173
- Mm-hm.
- You're 100 percent serious?

1250
01:10:15,175 --> 01:10:17,342
- Because it's not funny.
- No, I'm not joking.

1251
01:10:17,344 --> 01:10:19,610
Because I was only
like 67 percent sure.

1252
01:10:19,612 --> 01:10:21,280
- MJ...
- So why are you here?

1253
01:10:21,282 --> 01:10:22,880
Why are you
on this school trip?

1254
01:10:22,882 --> 01:10:24,649
I know you have a lot
of questions,

1255
01:10:24,651 --> 01:10:26,485
but we have to get out
of here, okay?

1256
01:10:26,487 --> 01:10:29,687
Okay. Okay. I can't believe
I figured it out!

1257
01:10:31,858 --> 01:10:34,726
You took everything from me!

1258
01:10:34,728 --> 01:10:36,931
This is for my family!

1259
01:10:42,937 --> 01:10:44,071
Pause.

1260
01:10:45,938 --> 01:10:47,004
Pause.

1261
01:10:47,006 --> 01:10:49,408
Uh... Sorry.

1262
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,410
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1263
01:10:52,412 --> 01:10:54,114
Yep. Stand by.

1264
01:10:58,117 --> 01:11:01,085
All right, fly, fly, fly,
zap, zap, zap.

1265
01:11:01,087 --> 01:11:03,655
Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography,

1266
01:11:03,657 --> 01:11:04,656
but it'll do.

1267
01:11:04,658 --> 01:11:06,223
Kill image.

1268
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:08,196
De-cloak drones.

1269
01:11:09,263 --> 01:11:10,495
All right, weapons.

1270
01:11:10,497 --> 01:11:12,830
- You want to weaponize?
- Yep.

1271
01:11:12,832 --> 01:11:15,202
Weapons only. Stand by.

1272
01:11:23,577 --> 01:11:25,075
Nice.

1273
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:26,811
Stop.

1274
01:11:26,813 --> 01:11:28,579
Something.
I don't know what it is.

1275
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:29,614
It's something...

1276
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:32,083
Just dou...
You know what?

1277
01:11:32,085 --> 01:11:34,151
Double the damage
and then run it again.

1278
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:35,753
You want me
to double it up?

1279
01:11:35,755 --> 01:11:37,222
- Yeah.
- All right.

1280
01:11:37,224 --> 01:11:39,093
Cover your ears.

1281
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,603
Whoo! That is good!
That's good.

1282
01:11:50,804 --> 01:11:52,437
- We on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.

1283
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:54,940
Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.

1284
01:11:54,942 --> 01:11:56,807
With her drones,
we'll create an event

1285
01:11:56,809 --> 01:11:58,509
big enough to cover
an entire city.

1286
01:11:58,511 --> 01:12:00,878
Well done. Make sure
every drone is weapons-hot.

1287
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,179
We need maximum damage.

1288
01:12:02,181 --> 01:12:04,716
- Gonna cause a lot of casualties.
- Oh, yeah.

1289
01:12:04,718 --> 01:12:07,718
More casualties, more coverage.
Gotta cut through the static.

1290
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,686
London's a beautiful city,
it'll suffer,

1291
01:12:09,688 --> 01:12:12,324
but they can rebuild.
If I'm the next Iron Man,

1292
01:12:12,326 --> 01:12:16,527
I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.

1293
01:12:16,529 --> 01:12:19,964
But when its new savior
descends,

1294
01:12:19,966 --> 01:12:23,168
all those casualties
will be forgotten.

1295
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,570
Janice, be in position
with my quick-change armor

1296
01:12:25,572 --> 01:12:27,204
- for the victory lap?
- Of course.

1297
01:12:27,206 --> 01:12:28,873
- You wanna try...?
- No, that's...

1298
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:31,476
What's going on with my hand?
Why is that happening?

1299
01:12:31,478 --> 01:12:34,012
Oh, one of the drones
that came back from the plaza

1300
01:12:34,014 --> 01:12:35,713
was missing a projector.
It's fine.

1301
01:12:35,715 --> 01:12:39,852
Wait, and you're...?
You're telling me this now?

1302
01:12:39,854 --> 01:12:42,887
It's one drone. The image
will be perfect, I promise.

1303
01:12:42,889 --> 01:12:44,289
That projector is evidence.

1304
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:46,191
It's gonna tell people
what we're doing

1305
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:47,625
and how we're doing it.

1306
01:12:47,627 --> 01:12:50,195
I am trying to fool
7 billion people here,

1307
01:12:50,197 --> 01:12:52,963
including Nick Fury, who happens
to be the most paranoid

1308
01:12:52,965 --> 01:12:54,899
and most dangerous person
on the planet.

1309
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:56,868
If he catches on
before I've killed him,

1310
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:58,436
he will put a bullet
in my head.

1311
01:12:58,438 --> 01:13:01,107
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1312
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:04,444
Right?

1313
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:08,114
William,
can you look at me?

1314
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:11,419
Pull up EDITH.

1315
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,518
<i>Hello, Quentin.</i>

1316
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,387
Hi, honey.
I need a level-five search,

1317
01:13:16,389 --> 01:13:18,423
full-resource protocol
for this device.

1318
01:13:18,425 --> 01:13:19,426
<i>Magnifying.</i>

1319
01:13:20,727 --> 01:13:22,192
There.
Search everything

1320
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,295
going in and out
of that building.

1321
01:13:24,297 --> 01:13:25,933
<i>Located.</i>

1322
01:13:26,966 --> 01:13:28,301
Shit.

1323
01:13:31,205 --> 01:13:33,338
You know, William,
one day,

1324
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,274
after I've had to kill
Peter Parker because of this,

1325
01:13:36,276 --> 01:13:40,781
I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!

1326
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:45,450
I can't believe
I gave Beck those glasses.

1327
01:13:45,452 --> 01:13:46,851
How could I be that stupid?

1328
01:13:46,853 --> 01:13:48,587
He's probably spying on me
right now

1329
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:50,521
or sending a drone
to come and kill me.

1330
01:13:50,523 --> 01:13:53,225
You had access
to killer drones?

1331
01:13:53,227 --> 01:13:54,793
Yeah,
I didn't really want them,

1332
01:13:54,795 --> 01:13:56,695
especially after
I almost killed Brad.

1333
01:13:56,697 --> 01:13:58,295
You almost killed Brad?

1334
01:13:58,297 --> 01:14:00,464
Look,
I have to call Mr. Fury

1335
01:14:00,466 --> 01:14:02,301
and tell him
that Beck's a fraud...

1336
01:14:02,303 --> 01:14:05,503
- but I think he tapped my phone.
- So, what are you gonna do?

1337
01:14:05,505 --> 01:14:08,438
I need my suit,
and I have to go to Berlin

1338
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,477
and talk to Mr. Fury
in person.

1339
01:14:14,113 --> 01:14:16,146
Uh... Just...

1340
01:14:35,635 --> 01:14:37,102
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1341
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:39,140
The costume looks great...

1342
01:14:40,607 --> 01:14:41,839
for the costume party

1343
01:14:41,841 --> 01:14:44,176
at the prince's castle.

1344
01:14:44,178 --> 01:14:45,744
She knows.
I told her.

1345
01:14:45,746 --> 01:14:47,948
He didn't tell me.
I figured it out.

1346
01:14:49,248 --> 01:14:50,682
Oh.

1347
01:14:50,684 --> 01:14:51,682
That's cool.

1348
01:14:51,684 --> 01:14:52,852
Like, a long time ago.

1349
01:14:53,586 --> 01:14:54,585
Oh.

1350
01:14:54,587 --> 01:14:56,353
Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1351
01:14:56,355 --> 01:14:58,656
But he saved me
and Betty's lives.

1352
01:14:58,658 --> 01:15:00,959
He's been faking the thing
with illusion tech.

1353
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:03,462
Yeah, he's using these,
like, hologram projectors.

1354
01:15:03,464 --> 01:15:06,164
Whoa. That's crazy.

1355
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:07,201
Yeah.

1356
01:15:09,236 --> 01:15:12,570
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1357
01:15:12,572 --> 01:15:14,405
It's been mostly me.

1358
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:17,042
Ned, call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1359
01:15:17,044 --> 01:15:19,477
say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin.

1360
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:20,878
Got it. Easy.

1361
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,182
Wow, you guys
lie with such ease.

1362
01:15:24,184 --> 01:15:25,417
I gotta go.

1363
01:15:25,419 --> 01:15:27,218
Wait, wait, wait.
The projector.

1364
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,186
You're gonna need this.

1365
01:15:29,188 --> 01:15:31,556
Don't tell anyone about this,
okay?

1366
01:15:31,558 --> 01:15:33,792
Anyone who knows
is in danger.

1367
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:43,200
So you know too.

1368
01:15:43,202 --> 01:15:45,971
It's cool. I've known first,
and I've known longer,

1369
01:15:45,973 --> 01:15:48,239
but it's not a competition.
Heh.

1370
01:16:08,962 --> 01:16:10,896
Excuse me. Do you know where...?

1371
01:16:10,898 --> 01:16:14,235
- <i>Nacht</i> Monkey!
- No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1372
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:17,970
Get in.

1373
01:16:24,243 --> 01:16:25,477
Mr. Fury...

1374
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:27,611
You've got a lot
of explaining to do.

1375
01:16:27,613 --> 01:16:29,880
- No, no, no, listen.
- Wait until we're secure.

1376
01:16:29,882 --> 01:16:31,548
Okay.

1377
01:16:37,056 --> 01:16:38,056
Right.

1378
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:06,584
So is there anything
you want to tell us

1379
01:17:06,586 --> 01:17:07,686
about your girlfriend?

1380
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:09,286
He's talking about
EDITH.

1381
01:17:09,288 --> 01:17:10,789
I made a mistake,
I'm sorry,

1382
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,457
but he is not
who you think he is.

1383
01:17:12,459 --> 01:17:14,758
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals,

1384
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,761
it's all fake.
He has some illusion tech.

1385
01:17:16,763 --> 01:17:19,797
That's how he tricked you,
and me into giving him EDITH.

1386
01:17:19,799 --> 01:17:23,668
It's a projector. I pulled it
off the fire monster in Prague.

1387
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:26,003
So all that death
and destruction

1388
01:17:26,005 --> 01:17:28,839
we witnessed
was created by this?

1389
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:31,275
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1390
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:32,843
Well, if this is true,

1391
01:17:32,845 --> 01:17:36,513
then Beck's very dangerous
and we need to be smart.

1392
01:17:36,515 --> 01:17:38,152
Who else did you tell
about this?

1393
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:41,451
Parker? Parker!

1394
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:44,556
- What's wrong?
- It's Beck. He's here.

1395
01:17:44,558 --> 01:17:46,560
What? Hill?

1396
01:17:51,898 --> 01:17:53,267
No, it's just an illu...

1397
01:17:54,567 --> 01:17:55,569
Fury!

1398
01:17:57,136 --> 01:17:59,005
Unh. Aah!

1399
01:18:01,241 --> 01:18:03,374
<i>Wow, Peter, wow.</i>

1400
01:18:03,376 --> 01:18:05,509
<i>I thought we were close.</i>

1401
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:09,079
<i>Fury always had to die,
but not you.</i>

1402
01:18:09,081 --> 01:18:10,216
Stop hiding, Beck!

1403
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:14,985
<i>I tried to
help you walk away.</i>

1404
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:16,454
<i>Now you're making me
do this.</i>

1405
01:18:21,795 --> 01:18:25,629
<i>You told me,
you were just a kid.</i>

1406
01:18:25,631 --> 01:18:29,000
<i>You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.</i>

1407
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:30,904
- Help me!
- MJ!

1408
01:18:32,038 --> 01:18:33,072
Oh, God!

1409
01:18:35,142 --> 01:18:37,008
Peter, what's going on?

1410
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,343
I know this isn't real.

1411
01:18:38,345 --> 01:18:39,677
<i>Do you, though?</i>

1412
01:18:41,214 --> 01:18:42,981
MJ!

1413
01:18:42,983 --> 01:18:44,915
MJ!

1414
01:18:46,752 --> 01:18:49,219
<i>I don't think you know
what's real, Peter.</i>

1415
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:52,893
Whoa! Whoa!

1416
01:19:02,836 --> 01:19:04,071
<i>You need to wake up!</i>

1417
01:19:27,426 --> 01:19:29,929
<i>I mean, look at yourself.</i>

1418
01:19:39,473 --> 01:19:42,173
<i>You are just
a scared little kid</i>

1419
01:19:42,175 --> 01:19:43,944
<i>in a sweat suit.</i>

1420
01:19:45,178 --> 01:19:46,777
<i>I created Mysterio</i>

1421
01:19:46,779 --> 01:19:49,948
<i>to give the world
someone to believe in.</i>

1422
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,816
<i>I control the truth.</i>

1423
01:19:51,818 --> 01:19:54,521
<i>Mysterio is the truth.</i>

1424
01:20:18,178 --> 01:20:20,343
<i>If you were good enough,</i>

1425
01:20:20,345 --> 01:20:22,882
<i>maybe Tony would still
be alive.</i>

1426
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:38,799
<i>Deep down,
you know I'm right.</i>

1427
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:51,642
<i>You made your choice.</i>

1428
01:20:51,644 --> 01:20:54,846
<i>And all you had to do
was step aside.</i>

1429
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:57,015
<i>And now you have...</i>

1430
01:21:09,629 --> 01:21:11,195
Fury. Unh.

1431
01:21:11,197 --> 01:21:14,664
Beck's people
are trying to find everyone

1432
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,767
who could expose him.

1433
01:21:16,769 --> 01:21:18,035
Who'd you tell?

1434
01:21:18,037 --> 01:21:19,737
- Um...
- I know you told someone...

1435
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:20,938
- Um...
- ...so just tell me.

1436
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,740
- Okay.
- Who did you tell?

1437
01:21:22,742 --> 01:21:24,241
Who else did you tell?

1438
01:21:24,243 --> 01:21:26,011
Just Ned and MJ
from my class.

1439
01:21:26,013 --> 01:21:27,777
Maybe Ned told
his girlfriend Betty,

1440
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:29,347
but that's it.

1441
01:21:29,349 --> 01:21:31,015
What?

1442
01:21:31,017 --> 01:21:33,750
You are so gullible.

1443
01:21:33,752 --> 01:21:35,887
- What?
- You're smart as a whip.

1444
01:21:35,889 --> 01:21:38,255
Just a...

1445
01:21:38,257 --> 01:21:39,758
...sucker.

1446
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,592
And now all your friends
have to die.

1447
01:21:41,594 --> 01:21:43,127
Oh, my God.

1448
01:21:47,233 --> 01:21:48,700
It's easy to fool people

1449
01:21:48,702 --> 01:21:51,171
when they're already fooling
themselves.

1450
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,777
But for what it's worth,
Peter,

1451
01:21:59,045 --> 01:22:00,247
I really am sorry.

1452
01:22:09,822 --> 01:22:11,289
- EDITH.
<i>- Yes, Quentin.</i>

1453
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:14,959
Access files to
Peter Parker's class trip.

1454
01:22:14,961 --> 01:22:17,297
I need them to fly home
from London.

1455
01:22:56,403 --> 01:22:57,403
Hi.

1456
01:22:58,638 --> 01:22:59,803
Where am I?

1457
01:22:59,805 --> 01:23:02,140
Municipal holding
facility.

1458
01:23:02,142 --> 01:23:04,842
They said they found you
unconscious at the train yard.

1459
01:23:04,844 --> 01:23:06,076
Very dangerous.

1460
01:23:06,078 --> 01:23:07,344
And we gave you the shirt

1461
01:23:07,346 --> 01:23:09,414
because you seemed
a bit cold.

1462
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:11,218
Thanks.

1463
01:23:13,019 --> 01:23:14,185
You guys are nice.

1464
01:23:15,455 --> 01:23:17,355
You speak really good
English.

1465
01:23:17,357 --> 01:23:19,656
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1466
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:21,659
I'm in the Netherlands
right now?

1467
01:23:21,661 --> 01:23:23,063
Yep.

1468
01:23:24,296 --> 01:23:26,129
Bye. Aah!

1469
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:28,865
- Guard!
- The guard is on a break.

1470
01:23:28,867 --> 01:23:31,369
- Probably talking to his wife.
- Yeah, she's pregnant.

1471
01:23:31,371 --> 01:23:32,736
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1472
01:23:40,746 --> 01:23:42,579
Yeah.

1473
01:23:42,581 --> 01:23:43,815
Yeah.

1474
01:23:43,817 --> 01:23:46,851
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1475
01:23:50,991 --> 01:23:52,091
You guys okay?

1476
01:24:04,737 --> 01:24:06,170
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

1477
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:08,373
- Could I borrow your phone?
- Yeah.

1478
01:24:09,776 --> 01:24:12,744
Everyone is so nice here.
Uh...

1479
01:24:12,746 --> 01:24:14,881
Okay.

1480
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,319
Okay.

1481
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:26,024
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Hey, hey, uh...

1482
01:24:26,026 --> 01:24:29,494
I messed up.
I need a... I need a ride.

1483
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:31,995
Where am I?
Where am I, sir?

1484
01:24:31,997 --> 01:24:34,201
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1485
01:24:36,068 --> 01:24:38,201
Hang on.
Could you say that into there?

1486
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:42,039
Hi.
It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1487
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:44,208
Yeah, no problem.
Heh, heh.

1488
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:45,843
Thanks.

1489
01:24:45,845 --> 01:24:46,845
Did you get that?

1490
01:25:08,268 --> 01:25:10,868
Peter? Are you okay?

1491
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:13,737
- Happy, is that you?
- Yeah, of course it's me.

1492
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:17,307
Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.

1493
01:25:17,309 --> 01:25:20,143
Only I would know. Uh...

1494
01:25:20,145 --> 01:25:23,313
Remember we went to Germany?
You pay-per-viewed a video

1495
01:25:23,315 --> 01:25:25,316
in your room?
They didn't list titles,

1496
01:25:25,318 --> 01:25:27,819
but I could tell by the price
it was an adult film.

1497
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:30,788
- And you didn't know how I knew...
- Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1498
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:36,694
It's so good to see you.

1499
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:39,963
Peter, you'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1500
01:25:39,965 --> 01:25:41,865
Okay, hold still.

1501
01:25:41,867 --> 01:25:43,669
There we go.

1502
01:25:49,474 --> 01:25:50,674
Ouch.

1503
01:25:50,676 --> 01:25:52,308
I thought you had
super strength.

1504
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:54,313
It still hurts.

1505
01:25:56,148 --> 01:25:58,852
- Happy, come on.
- All right, relax.

1506
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:02,352
- Just a few more. There we go.
- Oh, my God.

1507
01:26:02,354 --> 01:26:04,188
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1508
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,559
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1509
01:26:07,526 --> 01:26:09,694
I trusted Beck. Right?

1510
01:26:09,696 --> 01:26:11,195
I thought he was my friend.

1511
01:26:11,197 --> 01:26:13,563
I gave him the only thing
Mr. Stark left for me,

1512
01:26:13,565 --> 01:26:16,234
and now he's gonna kill
my friends and half of Europe,

1513
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:19,137
so please
do not tell me to relax.

1514
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:23,740
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1515
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:28,248
I just really miss him.

1516
01:26:29,215 --> 01:26:30,717
Yeah, I miss him too.

1517
01:26:33,519 --> 01:26:36,186
Everywhere I go...

1518
01:26:36,188 --> 01:26:37,821
I see his face.

1519
01:26:37,823 --> 01:26:40,290
And the
whole world is asking

1520
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:43,060
who's gonna be
the next Iron Man...

1521
01:26:45,064 --> 01:26:48,535
And I don't know if that's me,
Happy. I'm not Iron Man.

1522
01:26:50,336 --> 01:26:52,637
You're not Iron Man.

1523
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,539
You're never gonna be
Iron Man.

1524
01:26:56,408 --> 01:26:58,810
Nobody could live up
to Tony.

1525
01:26:58,812 --> 01:27:00,247
Not even Tony.

1526
01:27:01,747 --> 01:27:03,679
Tony was my best friend.

1527
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:05,015
And he was a mess.

1528
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:06,883
He second-guessed
everything he did.

1529
01:27:06,885 --> 01:27:08,585
He was all over the place.

1530
01:27:08,587 --> 01:27:11,588
The one thing that he did
that he didn't second-guess

1531
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:13,192
was picking you.

1532
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,061
I don't think
Tony would have done what he did

1533
01:27:18,063 --> 01:27:21,567
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1534
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:24,502
Now, your friends
are in trouble,

1535
01:27:24,504 --> 01:27:28,108
you're all alone,
your tech is missing.

1536
01:27:29,509 --> 01:27:31,578
What are you gonna do
about it?

1537
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:38,048
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1538
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,985
I mean, right now. Specifically,
what are we gonna do?

1539
01:27:40,987 --> 01:27:42,887
We've been hovering
over a tulip field

1540
01:27:42,889 --> 01:27:44,155
for the last 15 minutes.

1541
01:27:44,157 --> 01:27:45,890
Right.
I can't call my friends

1542
01:27:45,892 --> 01:27:47,592
because he's tracking
their phones.

1543
01:27:47,594 --> 01:27:48,825
Give me your phone.

1544
01:27:48,827 --> 01:27:50,160
- My cell phone?
- Yeah.

1545
01:27:50,162 --> 01:27:51,762
Okay. Here.

1546
01:27:51,764 --> 01:27:53,164
What's your password?

1547
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,164
"Password."

1548
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:55,833
No, what is your password?

1549
01:27:55,835 --> 01:27:58,168
- "Password," spelled out.
- Head of security,

1550
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:01,137
- and your password is "password"?
- I don't feel good about it.

1551
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:04,275
<i>Hello, governor. Cup of tea?
I'm gonna be in London soon.</i>

1552
01:28:04,277 --> 01:28:06,343
- They're in London.
- London, okay.

1553
01:28:06,345 --> 01:28:07,410
Yeah, I need a suit.

1554
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:09,049
Suit?

1555
01:28:30,036 --> 01:28:32,102
Okay, um...

1556
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:35,174
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1557
01:28:41,746 --> 01:28:44,350
Yeah, open that.
Okay, no, no, no.

1558
01:28:51,956 --> 01:28:54,624
- What?
- Nothing.

1559
01:28:54,626 --> 01:28:57,496
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1560
01:29:01,334 --> 01:29:03,169
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1561
01:29:08,642 --> 01:29:11,510
Okay, can you pull up
my web-shooters?

1562
01:29:12,511 --> 01:29:13,878
Isolate the Taser webs,

1563
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,280
and reconfigure
and boost the voltage

1564
01:29:16,282 --> 01:29:19,383
to a factor of 25 percent,

1565
01:29:19,385 --> 01:29:22,285
and give me complete
manual control over detonation.

1566
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:27,391
I thought Kree
having sleeper cells

1567
01:29:27,393 --> 01:29:28,825
was top secret information.

1568
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:31,462
Nick, satellites are picking up
an EM pulse.

1569
01:29:31,464 --> 01:29:34,030
- I thought that was over.
- It's the biggest one yet.

1570
01:29:34,032 --> 01:29:35,866
- Where?
- London.

1571
01:29:35,868 --> 01:29:38,369
Okay, the company set up
a city tour,

1572
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:41,541
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1573
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:46,209
Is no one else gonna
acknowledge how crazy this is?

1574
01:29:46,211 --> 01:29:48,779
Oh, yeah, I get it.
There's been nothing scientific

1575
01:29:48,781 --> 01:29:50,280
about this science tour
at all.

1576
01:29:50,282 --> 01:29:52,048
No, no, I'm talking
about Peter.

1577
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:53,883
Has no one noticed
how shady he is?

1578
01:29:53,885 --> 01:29:55,886
I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop

1579
01:29:55,888 --> 01:29:57,754
with some woman
in his underwear,

1580
01:29:57,756 --> 01:29:59,524
and he's always
sneaking away,

1581
01:29:59,526 --> 01:30:01,459
like back at the opera, huh?

1582
01:30:01,461 --> 01:30:04,928
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1583
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:07,334
Is no one else here
interested in the truth?

1584
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:11,035
"The very concept
of objective truth

1585
01:30:11,037 --> 01:30:12,637
is fading out of the world."

1586
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,539
George Orwell.
Thank you, MJ.

1587
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:16,940
Yeah. Well, since
Peter's not really here

1588
01:30:16,942 --> 01:30:18,042
to tell his truth,

1589
01:30:18,044 --> 01:30:19,811
what about you, Brad?

1590
01:30:19,813 --> 01:30:22,146
Why take pictures of people
in the bathroom?

1591
01:30:22,148 --> 01:30:23,914
Yeah, dude,
what's that about?

1592
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:26,616
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that. It was...

1593
01:30:26,618 --> 01:30:27,918
I was trying to take a...

1594
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,954
Let's put all
this craziness behind us

1595
01:30:29,956 --> 01:30:32,823
and have a nice,
peaceful afternoon.

1596
01:30:32,825 --> 01:30:36,893
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"
said the class. Okay.

1597
01:30:36,895 --> 01:30:39,963
I'm gonna be a cool teacher
right now.

1598
01:30:39,965 --> 01:30:42,566
You gotta stop doing that.
It is weird.

1599
01:30:42,568 --> 01:30:46,303
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1600
01:30:46,305 --> 01:30:48,038
- Okay?
- Look at this.

1601
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,807
Mr. Harrington,
this is your bus.

1602
01:30:49,809 --> 01:30:53,110
- We got a bus all to ourselves.
- Nice to see you all. Come along.

1603
01:30:53,112 --> 01:30:55,244
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
- Thank you.

1604
01:30:55,246 --> 01:30:57,280
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1605
01:30:57,282 --> 01:30:59,149
All right.

1606
01:30:59,151 --> 01:31:00,854
I have the kids.

1607
01:31:04,724 --> 01:31:06,656
I got here as fast as I could.

1608
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:09,759
I did a full perimeter sweep.
Nothing.

1609
01:31:09,761 --> 01:31:10,761
Damn it.

1610
01:31:13,265 --> 01:31:14,464
Pulse is spiking.

1611
01:31:14,466 --> 01:31:15,932
I'll take
another look.

1612
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:17,767
Soon as you see something,
report.

1613
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:20,137
<i>You're all we've got, Beck.</i>

1614
01:31:20,139 --> 01:31:22,809
If this is what I
fear, then God help us, Fury.

1615
01:31:24,076 --> 01:31:26,811
God help us all.

1616
01:31:26,813 --> 01:31:28,846
Okay, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.

1617
01:31:28,848 --> 01:31:31,781
- <i>William, launch the drones.</i>
- Copy that, brother.

1618
01:31:31,783 --> 01:31:35,518
<i>Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.</i>

1619
01:31:40,992 --> 01:31:43,127
- Excellent. Janice?
- Working on the cape.

1620
01:31:43,129 --> 01:31:44,361
Get those wrinkles out.

1621
01:31:44,363 --> 01:31:46,329
I could be shaking hands
with the queen.

1622
01:31:46,331 --> 01:31:47,899
- <i>Guterman?</i>
- Almost in position.

1623
01:31:47,901 --> 01:31:50,467
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
- Increasing pulse.

1624
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:54,504
Whatever this is,
it's 100 times bigger

1625
01:31:54,506 --> 01:31:55,672
than the previous ones.

1626
01:31:55,674 --> 01:31:57,007
EDITH?

1627
01:31:57,009 --> 01:31:58,642
<i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1628
01:31:58,644 --> 01:32:00,410
Show me my loose ends.

1629
01:32:00,412 --> 01:32:02,245
Once the show's going,

1630
01:32:02,247 --> 01:32:04,080
execute the kill order
on my command.

1631
01:32:04,082 --> 01:32:05,315
<i>- Copy.</i>
- All right.

1632
01:32:05,317 --> 01:32:07,084
Start the show.

1633
01:32:08,354 --> 01:32:10,390
Let's save the world,
people.

1634
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:15,593
I don't like this.
Something's definitely up.

1635
01:32:15,595 --> 01:32:18,762
You're an FOS now.
"Friend of Spider-Man."

1636
01:32:18,764 --> 01:32:21,998
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1637
01:32:24,604 --> 01:32:26,936
That doesn't
look good.

1638
01:32:26,938 --> 01:32:29,005
But it's fake,
nothing to worry about.

1639
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:33,210
And the kids
are in the kill zone.

1640
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:35,215
<i>Great work, Guterman.</i>

1641
01:32:36,447 --> 01:32:38,115
What?

1642
01:32:38,117 --> 01:32:40,718
- <i>Happy Hogan here.</i>
- I know. What do you want?

1643
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,919
<i>At Mr. Stark's,
going through his belongings.</i>

1644
01:32:42,921 --> 01:32:44,888
<i>There was a surfboard
you left behind.</i>

1645
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:46,723
- What?
- <i>People said they didn't think</i>

1646
01:32:46,725 --> 01:32:49,994
<i>Nick Fury was a surfer, I said,
"Appearances can be deceiving."</i>

1647
01:32:49,996 --> 01:32:52,730
It's not mine. And don't ever
call this number again.

1648
01:33:00,572 --> 01:33:03,173
Fury's got the coded message.

1649
01:33:03,175 --> 01:33:05,008
Your friends
are at the Tower Bridge.

1650
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:07,710
Your boy called it London
Bridge, but I figured it out.

1651
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:09,413
- I'll scoop them up, okay?
- Yeah.

1652
01:33:09,415 --> 01:33:10,614
- We're close.
- We're close.

1653
01:33:10,616 --> 01:33:12,015
- How's the suit?
- Almost done.

1654
01:33:12,017 --> 01:33:13,417
- Good.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

1655
01:33:13,419 --> 01:33:16,052
Before you go,
if something happens to me,

1656
01:33:16,054 --> 01:33:17,788
could you please give
this to MJ?

1657
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:20,057
You'll make it back.
Give it to her yourself.

1658
01:33:20,059 --> 01:33:21,525
- You got this.
- I got this.

1659
01:33:21,527 --> 01:33:24,427
- Walk me through it.
- I know it's illusion tech.

1660
01:33:24,429 --> 01:33:26,196
All I do
is get inside the illusion,

1661
01:33:26,198 --> 01:33:27,431
then I can take it down,

1662
01:33:27,433 --> 01:33:29,033
find him,
and he's just a guy.

1663
01:33:29,035 --> 01:33:30,467
I can take EDITH
right back.

1664
01:33:30,469 --> 01:33:32,969
Right, but last time,
you got hit by a train.

1665
01:33:32,971 --> 01:33:36,140
True, but this time...

1666
01:33:36,142 --> 01:33:39,075
How do I explain this? Uh...
I have a sixth sense.

1667
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:42,713
The Peter-tingle. That's what
you're talking about, right?

1668
01:33:42,715 --> 01:33:43,981
It's not working, though.

1669
01:33:43,983 --> 01:33:45,950
I heard it wasn't working now.
Is it?

1670
01:33:45,952 --> 01:33:48,252
It is working.
I don't know if it's working...

1671
01:33:48,254 --> 01:33:50,320
You got the Peter-tingle.
That's the plan.

1672
01:33:50,322 --> 01:33:51,789
I'm gonna go get
your friends.

1673
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:53,990
You get that Peter-tingle
back online.

1674
01:33:53,992 --> 01:33:55,159
I got this. I got this.

1675
01:34:09,774 --> 01:34:10,807
Cue the lightning.

1676
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:12,911
Cuing lightning.

1677
01:34:17,649 --> 01:34:19,716
Sir, is it still safe
on the top,

1678
01:34:19,718 --> 01:34:21,985
or should we all come down?

1679
01:34:21,987 --> 01:34:22,987
Oh, my.

1680
01:34:24,823 --> 01:34:26,289
What did
the bus driver say?

1681
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:27,891
Bus driver's gone.

1682
01:34:27,893 --> 01:34:29,392
- What?
- Where?

1683
01:34:29,394 --> 01:34:32,228
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I
have it under control!

1684
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:33,698
No. Don't drag me into this.

1685
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,534
I'm doing my best,
Julius!

1686
01:34:36,536 --> 01:34:38,968
- Look...
- Oh, the witches are back.

1687
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:41,273
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1688
01:34:46,077 --> 01:34:48,044
- Okay.
- Okay, follow me, kids.

1689
01:34:51,184 --> 01:34:53,253
Come on, let's go!

1690
01:35:05,563 --> 01:35:08,699
Now, that is
an Avengers-level threat.

1691
01:35:25,251 --> 01:35:27,084
This way. This way!

1692
01:35:27,086 --> 01:35:28,518
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1693
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,420
- Flash!
- Follow that hand.

1694
01:35:30,422 --> 01:35:32,188
This way. Follow me.

1695
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:35,359
- It's not real, it's not real!
- It looks real to me!

1696
01:35:35,361 --> 01:35:37,695
Follow me, kids!

1697
01:35:37,697 --> 01:35:39,896
Earth, wind, fire, water.
Oh, no.

1698
01:35:39,898 --> 01:35:41,999
They joined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1699
01:35:42,001 --> 01:35:43,767
- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?

1700
01:35:43,769 --> 01:35:45,735
Voltron!
You're thinking of Voltron!

1701
01:35:45,737 --> 01:35:47,605
Hey, look,
it's Mysterio!

1702
01:35:47,607 --> 01:35:49,274
He's gonna save us!

1703
01:35:51,943 --> 01:35:54,210
Wait, if Mysterio
knows we know...

1704
01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:56,379
- Then we're in danger.
- Yeah, and so are they.

1705
01:35:56,381 --> 01:35:57,582
We should go.

1706
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:00,419
Kill that witch! Ba-bow!

1707
01:36:01,987 --> 01:36:04,923
This is for my family!

1708
01:36:06,326 --> 01:36:08,091
You should get
somewhere safe, Fury.

1709
01:36:08,093 --> 01:36:09,759
<i>I don't see this
ending well.</i>

1710
01:36:09,761 --> 01:36:11,762
I appreciate your concern,

1711
01:36:11,764 --> 01:36:13,766
but I never leave my men
behind.

1712
01:36:15,634 --> 01:36:17,668
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me?

1713
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:19,436
I can.
It's a little loud out here.

1714
01:36:19,438 --> 01:36:21,137
- I like the new suit.
- Thanks.

1715
01:36:21,139 --> 01:36:23,507
Whoa, Peter,
you sure that's not real?

1716
01:36:23,509 --> 01:36:26,109
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1717
01:36:26,111 --> 01:36:27,410
- Still the play?
- Uh-huh.

1718
01:36:27,412 --> 01:36:28,978
We need to get high enough

1719
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:32,684
- so Beck doesn't see me coming.
- Copy. Stay sticky.

1720
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:37,286
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid. What is it?

1721
01:36:37,288 --> 01:36:40,790
We need to have a conversation
about you and my aunt!

1722
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:56,905
Beck, report!

1723
01:36:56,907 --> 01:36:59,409
I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1724
01:36:59,411 --> 01:37:00,910
"It's all the Elementals.

1725
01:37:00,912 --> 01:37:02,846
They're merged
into something..."

1726
01:37:02,848 --> 01:37:05,249
...into something else.
Something more powerful.

1727
01:37:05,251 --> 01:37:07,653
It's drawing energy
from the Earth's core.

1728
01:37:11,823 --> 01:37:14,258
See, now,
that's some bullshit.

1729
01:37:16,862 --> 01:37:17,862
Is that...?

1730
01:37:22,934 --> 01:37:24,366
Be ready for anything.

1731
01:37:24,368 --> 01:37:25,404
Yeah.

1732
01:37:31,309 --> 01:37:33,745
It's not real,
it's not real, it's not real!

1733
01:37:38,282 --> 01:37:40,517
Whoa.

1734
01:37:40,519 --> 01:37:42,321
That's awesome.

1735
01:38:07,545 --> 01:38:09,713
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1736
01:38:09,715 --> 01:38:12,048
Maybe they hit a flock of birds.
You're fine.

1737
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:15,053
I wanna see what's happening
Taking manual control.

1738
01:38:20,859 --> 01:38:23,026
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

1739
01:38:23,028 --> 01:38:25,998
Yeah.
And I'm gonna kill him.

1740
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:32,504
I hope this works.

1741
01:38:48,754 --> 01:38:49,754
You got me?

1742
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,293
I got you.

1743
01:38:56,295 --> 01:38:59,096
<i>Boss,
the illusion is coming apart.</i>

1744
01:39:01,767 --> 01:39:03,133
I see you.

1745
01:39:06,938 --> 01:39:08,940
- EDITH, give me protection.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1746
01:39:23,621 --> 01:39:25,254
Just kill the illusion.
Kill it.

1747
01:39:25,256 --> 01:39:26,624
I'm not gonna. They'll see.

1748
01:39:26,626 --> 01:39:29,159
They'll see
what I want them to see!

1749
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:32,228
- Do you still need the cape?
- Yes, Janice.

1750
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:34,267
- I still need the cape.
- Done.

1751
01:39:37,068 --> 01:39:39,569
- Now render my illusion suit.
- All right, hang on.

1752
01:39:39,571 --> 01:39:41,804
<i>The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!</i>

1753
01:39:41,806 --> 01:39:43,009
There you are.

1754
01:39:46,778 --> 01:39:47,944
Easy.

1755
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:53,583
Who the hell is that?

1756
01:39:55,187 --> 01:39:56,419
- Ned!
- Happy!

1757
01:39:56,421 --> 01:39:58,320
I gotta get you out of here!

1758
01:39:58,322 --> 01:39:59,688
- Get on the jet!
- Who are you?

1759
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:01,859
I work with Spider-Man.
Get on that jet.

1760
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:03,694
You work for Spider-Man?

1761
01:40:03,696 --> 01:40:05,898
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1762
01:40:08,533 --> 01:40:10,633
- New plan. Into the Tower.
- What?

1763
01:40:10,635 --> 01:40:11,968
Happy, are you okay?

1764
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,670
<i>We're okay. Just get Beck.</i>

1765
01:40:13,672 --> 01:40:16,138
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1766
01:40:20,511 --> 01:40:22,681
I'll just kill the kids
myself.

1767
01:40:27,586 --> 01:40:28,586
Whoa!

1768
01:40:37,362 --> 01:40:38,697
There you are.

1769
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:42,900
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1770
01:40:42,902 --> 01:40:44,770
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Come on.

1771
01:40:48,674 --> 01:40:50,272
- Go!
- Into the vault!

1772
01:40:50,274 --> 01:40:52,543
The walls are 8 feet thick.
Go into the vault!

1773
01:40:52,545 --> 01:40:53,843
- What?
- Into the vault. Go!

1774
01:40:56,782 --> 01:40:58,417
Take cover!

1775
01:41:16,902 --> 01:41:17,902
Okay.

1776
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,539
Yeah?

1777
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:25,377
No. No.

1778
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,915
I see you.

1779
01:41:33,184 --> 01:41:34,184
Get that thing out...

1780
01:41:39,724 --> 01:41:40,892
Go!

1781
01:41:47,765 --> 01:41:50,102
How does Cap do that?

1782
01:41:59,144 --> 01:42:02,445
Happy, say something,
to let me know you're alive!

1783
01:42:02,447 --> 01:42:04,813
<i>- I'm here. I'm here.</i>
- Happy, thank God.

1784
01:42:04,815 --> 01:42:08,985
I bought us some time,
but not much.

1785
01:42:08,987 --> 01:42:12,290
I'm trying to get to Beck,
but I can't shake these drones!

1786
01:42:26,371 --> 01:42:27,873
Gotcha.

1787
01:42:49,627 --> 01:42:51,429
Going up!

1788
01:43:27,698 --> 01:43:28,698
Finally.

1789
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:31,168
Hey, William, how we doing?

1790
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:33,369
Illusion almost back up.

1791
01:43:33,371 --> 01:43:35,875
<i>I don't know
how you're gonna spin this.</i>

1792
01:43:50,255 --> 01:43:51,524
Oh, great. No webs.

1793
01:44:05,237 --> 01:44:07,440
- Are we gonna die?
- Nobody dies on my watch.

1794
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:11,975
I wasted my life
playing video games,

1795
01:44:11,977 --> 01:44:13,776
and we're gonna die.

1796
01:44:13,778 --> 01:44:17,713
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1797
01:44:17,715 --> 01:44:20,450
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1798
01:44:20,452 --> 01:44:23,151
Hey, if it wasn't
for those stupid videos,

1799
01:44:23,153 --> 01:44:25,388
Spider-Man would've never
found you.

1800
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:28,959
Spider-Man...? Spider-Man
follows me? I saved us, guys.

1801
01:44:28,961 --> 01:44:30,959
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1802
01:44:30,961 --> 01:44:32,427
- MJ!
- Stop it!

1803
01:44:32,429 --> 01:44:33,896
I'm sorry, okay?

1804
01:44:33,898 --> 01:44:35,598
I'm obsessed
with telling the truth

1805
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,234
even if it hurts
other people's feelings.

1806
01:44:38,236 --> 01:44:40,272
I'm in love
with Spider-Man's aunt.

1807
01:44:44,341 --> 01:44:45,777
We're sharing, right?

1808
01:45:24,916 --> 01:45:27,651
Your lies are over, Beck.

1809
01:45:27,653 --> 01:45:31,253
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1810
01:45:31,255 --> 01:45:32,624
EDITH?

1811
01:45:40,431 --> 01:45:42,999
Just give me the glasses.

1812
01:45:43,001 --> 01:45:44,737
You want these?

1813
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:47,170
Come and get them.

1814
01:45:57,381 --> 01:45:58,813
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1815
01:46:23,675 --> 01:46:25,174
Why aren't
these drones firing?

1816
01:46:25,176 --> 01:46:27,043
<i>You're in the strike zone.</i>

1817
01:46:27,045 --> 01:46:31,116
- <i>The chance of getting hit is...</i>
- No, fire all the drones now!

1818
01:46:49,533 --> 01:46:51,101
Beck!

1819
01:46:54,406 --> 01:46:55,407
Beck.

1820
01:46:56,573 --> 01:46:58,106
You lied to me.

1821
01:46:58,108 --> 01:47:00,977
- And I trusted you.
- I know.

1822
01:47:00,979 --> 01:47:03,445
That's the most...

1823
01:47:03,447 --> 01:47:05,584
d-disappointing part.

1824
01:47:06,818 --> 01:47:08,754
You're a good person,
Peter.

1825
01:47:10,988 --> 01:47:12,790
Such a weakness.

1826
01:47:14,893 --> 01:47:17,125
Stark was right.

1827
01:47:17,127 --> 01:47:19,130
You do deserve them.

1828
01:47:30,274 --> 01:47:32,644
You can't trick me anymore.

1829
01:47:35,947 --> 01:47:38,448
EDITH,
turn off the drones.

1830
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:42,118
<i>Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.</i>

1831
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:44,052
<i>Execute
all cancellation protocols?</i>

1832
01:47:44,054 --> 01:47:45,288
Just do it.

1833
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:46,859
- Execute them all.
- <i>Confirmed.</i>

1834
01:47:56,099 --> 01:47:58,168
Give me the spear.

1835
01:47:58,170 --> 01:47:59,638
That's a halberd. Ahem.

1836
01:48:04,675 --> 01:48:06,277
Thank you.

1837
01:48:09,848 --> 01:48:13,185
- How could you do all of this?
- You'll see, Peter.

1838
01:48:14,852 --> 01:48:18,590
People,
they need to believe.

1839
01:48:19,657 --> 01:48:21,526
And nowadays...

1840
01:48:23,327 --> 01:48:25,697
they'll believe anything.

1841
01:48:36,006 --> 01:48:37,442
Is he...?

1842
01:48:38,643 --> 01:48:40,045
Is this real?

1843
01:48:41,546 --> 01:48:43,848
<i>All illusions are down, Peter.</i>

1844
01:48:58,328 --> 01:48:59,928
Whoo! Yeah!

1845
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:01,597
Hey, where you going?

1846
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:10,475
- MJ.
- Hey.

1847
01:49:11,341 --> 01:49:12,709
- Hey.
- Hey.

1848
01:49:12,711 --> 01:49:14,543
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

1849
01:49:14,545 --> 01:49:16,879
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Is everybody else okay?

1850
01:49:16,881 --> 01:49:19,749
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1851
01:49:19,751 --> 01:49:22,418
- What happened?
- There was just the drones,

1852
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:25,690
and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.

1853
01:49:26,925 --> 01:49:28,961
- Was that you?
- Yeah.

1854
01:49:29,894 --> 01:49:31,430
Did you get him?

1855
01:49:34,166 --> 01:49:35,768
- Yeah.
- Well, I, um...

1856
01:49:37,269 --> 01:49:39,267
brought that.

1857
01:49:39,269 --> 01:49:41,570
In case
you needed some help.

1858
01:49:41,572 --> 01:49:43,575
Thanks.

1859
01:49:44,776 --> 01:49:46,676
Anyway, uh,

1860
01:49:46,678 --> 01:49:49,344
there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1861
01:49:49,346 --> 01:49:52,281
I think he works for you
or something.

1862
01:49:52,283 --> 01:49:53,415
He, um...

1863
01:49:53,417 --> 01:49:54,950
He gave me this.

1864
01:49:54,952 --> 01:49:56,888
No. No.

1865
01:49:58,389 --> 01:49:59,954
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1866
01:49:59,956 --> 01:50:02,092
- I had this stupid plan.
- Peter.

1867
01:50:02,094 --> 01:50:04,093
I wrote it down,
I was gonna buy you this

1868
01:50:04,095 --> 01:50:06,131
and give it to you in Paris
at the top...

1869
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,034
And you kissed me.

1870
01:50:11,036 --> 01:50:13,703
- What? What?
- Yeah.

1871
01:50:13,705 --> 01:50:15,704
I don't really have
much luck

1872
01:50:15,706 --> 01:50:19,208
when it comes
to getting close to people.

1873
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:22,014
Um... So I lied.

1874
01:50:23,313 --> 01:50:24,813
I wasn't just watching you

1875
01:50:24,815 --> 01:50:27,952
because I thought
you were Spider-Man.

1876
01:50:31,857 --> 01:50:33,325
That's great.

1877
01:50:34,792 --> 01:50:37,326
- Black dahlia, like the murder.
- The murder.

1878
01:50:37,328 --> 01:50:39,462
- Good.
- Yeah. Heh.

1879
01:50:39,464 --> 01:50:41,164
Sorry it's broken.

1880
01:50:41,166 --> 01:50:44,033
I actually like it better
broken.

1881
01:50:44,035 --> 01:50:46,305
I really like you.

1882
01:50:48,005 --> 01:50:49,474
I really like you too.

1883
01:50:50,642 --> 01:50:52,141
Uh...

1884
01:51:03,554 --> 01:51:05,788
Uh. Okay. I should...

1885
01:51:05,790 --> 01:51:08,825
I should probably get back
to the class.

1886
01:51:08,827 --> 01:51:10,229
I'll go and...

1887
01:51:11,461 --> 01:51:13,732
- Yeah. Heh. I don't know.
- Heh. Okay.

1888
01:51:15,032 --> 01:51:16,100
Just in case.

1889
01:51:24,175 --> 01:51:25,708
Yeah, no.

1890
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:29,044
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1891
01:51:29,046 --> 01:51:31,213
Yeah.
I'm glad he stayed too.

1892
01:51:31,215 --> 01:51:33,050
I gotta go.

1893
01:51:34,117 --> 01:51:35,383
I'm glad you're alive.

1894
01:51:35,385 --> 01:51:37,119
I guess the coded message
worked.

1895
01:51:37,121 --> 01:51:39,722
"Appearances can be
deceiving." Heh.

1896
01:51:39,724 --> 01:51:42,158
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1897
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,660
- It worked.
- Because I had serious doubts

1898
01:51:44,662 --> 01:51:46,128
about Beck
from the beginning.

1899
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:47,699
Not true.
He had zero doubts.

1900
01:51:51,368 --> 01:51:52,468
Where's Parker?

1901
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:53,869
He's with a girl.

1902
01:51:53,871 --> 01:51:56,539
I need to speak with him.

1903
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:58,341
He'll call you.

1904
01:51:58,343 --> 01:52:00,042
He'll...?

1905
01:52:03,415 --> 01:52:05,548
Okay. Great.

1906
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:07,417
Well, he better.

1907
01:52:07,419 --> 01:52:08,519
Or it's your ass.

1908
01:52:09,987 --> 01:52:13,356
And don't even think
about ghosting me.

1909
01:52:30,207 --> 01:52:32,374
Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?

1910
01:52:32,376 --> 01:52:35,978
Yeah, it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1911
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:36,978
Ouch.

1912
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:38,813
Except for me.

1913
01:52:38,815 --> 01:52:40,249
Aw. Thanks.

1914
01:52:40,251 --> 01:52:42,051
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

1915
01:52:42,053 --> 01:52:43,252
See you later.

1916
01:52:43,254 --> 01:52:45,788
- You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.

1917
01:52:45,790 --> 01:52:47,589
Uh...

1918
01:52:47,591 --> 01:52:51,127
I was thinking we should all go
on a double date or something.

1919
01:52:51,129 --> 01:52:53,795
Oh, we broke up.

1920
01:52:53,797 --> 01:52:55,231
No. What? Why?

1921
01:52:55,233 --> 01:52:57,665
Men and women
grow apart,

1922
01:52:57,667 --> 01:52:59,502
but the journey
they share together

1923
01:52:59,504 --> 01:53:01,737
will always be a part
of them.

1924
01:53:01,739 --> 01:53:04,376
- You are so wise.
- Thank you.

1925
01:53:07,778 --> 01:53:10,112
Hello, Gerald.

1926
01:53:10,114 --> 01:53:12,317
Could Mother not make it?

1927
01:53:13,484 --> 01:53:14,987
Hmm.

1928
01:53:18,122 --> 01:53:19,688
- May!
- I promise you... Ah!

1929
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:22,424
Oh, he's here.
Don't give me a ticket.

1930
01:53:22,426 --> 01:53:26,195
- Heh. Ah.
- Ooh. I'm so glad you're okay.

1931
01:53:26,197 --> 01:53:29,265
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1932
01:53:29,267 --> 01:53:31,066
Let's go.
Where are your bags?

1933
01:53:31,068 --> 01:53:32,468
Oh, right.
They got blown up.

1934
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:34,270
Yeah. Heh.

1935
01:53:34,272 --> 01:53:35,739
I got you
hot buttered bagels.

1936
01:53:35,741 --> 01:53:37,839
- Thank you so much.
- I know my boy.

1937
01:53:37,841 --> 01:53:39,776
<i>I kept my
identity pretty guarded</i>

1938
01:53:39,778 --> 01:53:41,310
<i>this past couple years.</i>

1939
01:53:41,312 --> 01:53:43,111
<i>I faced a lot of deception.</i>

1940
01:53:43,113 --> 01:53:46,082
<i>And I'm tired of the lies.</i>

1941
01:53:46,084 --> 01:53:48,787
So it's time for the truth
to be out there.

1942
01:53:51,354 --> 01:53:52,357
Are you dating?

1943
01:53:53,358 --> 01:53:55,658
- Yes.
- Not really.

1944
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:57,493
- What?
- Well...

1945
01:53:57,495 --> 01:53:58,994
- I think...
- Summer fling.

1946
01:53:58,996 --> 01:54:01,664
Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.

1947
01:54:01,666 --> 01:54:03,432
I still don't know
where it's going.

1948
01:54:03,434 --> 01:54:04,933
Open to wherever
it might lead.

1949
01:54:04,935 --> 01:54:07,270
- Anywhere. On or off.
- To share it with people...

1950
01:54:07,272 --> 01:54:09,204
We'll always be friends,
no matter what.

1951
01:54:09,206 --> 01:54:11,039
I'm gonna go
because I've got a date.

1952
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:13,642
...because we
all are interconnected.

1953
01:54:13,644 --> 01:54:14,843
- Bye.
- We are.

1954
01:54:27,892 --> 01:54:29,292
Whoo!

1955
01:54:33,497 --> 01:54:35,067
Sorry!

1956
01:54:39,537 --> 01:54:40,572
Whoa!

1957
01:54:41,938 --> 01:54:43,407
Whoa.

1958
01:54:46,077 --> 01:54:47,379
Whoo!

1959
01:54:54,519 --> 01:54:57,389
Whoo-hoo!

1960
01:55:11,435 --> 01:55:13,069
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

1961
01:55:13,071 --> 01:55:15,471
- It's fine.
- You ready?

1962
01:55:15,473 --> 01:55:17,240
- Yeah.
- You're gonna love this.

1963
01:55:17,242 --> 01:55:19,208
Okay! Okay!

1964
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:21,110
- Okay. Okay.
- You ready?

1965
01:55:21,112 --> 01:55:24,413
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.

1966
01:55:26,317 --> 01:55:29,485
I should stop looking.
I'm gonna stop looking! Heh.

1967
01:55:29,487 --> 01:55:31,823
Whoo!

1968
01:57:45,657 --> 01:57:48,727
Okay. You can put me down now!
You can put me down now!

1969
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:51,862
You okay?

1970
01:57:53,397 --> 01:57:54,763
Uh...

1971
01:57:54,765 --> 01:57:57,333
Whoo! Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1972
01:57:57,335 --> 01:57:59,935
Let's just...
Never, never doing that again.

1973
01:57:59,937 --> 01:58:01,736
- I'm never doing that again.
- Okay.

1974
01:58:01,738 --> 01:58:03,539
I should probably
get out of here.

1975
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:05,143
- Be safe. Heh.
- See you later.

1976
01:58:08,412 --> 01:58:10,612
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

1977
01:58:10,614 --> 01:58:13,615
<i>We come with revelations about
last week's attack in London.</i>

1978
01:58:13,617 --> 01:58:15,883
<i>An anonymous source
provided this video.</i>

1979

1982

I'm gonna make it.</i>

1984

<i>Spider-Man attacked me

1985
01:58:28,965 --> 01:58:31,633
<i>He has an army of weaponized

<i>saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man.</i>

1987
01:58:35,272 --> 01:58:38,106
<i>Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?</i>

1988
01:58:38,108 --> 01:58:39,941
<i>There will be
significant casualties.</i>

1989
01:58:39,943 --> 01:58:41,944
<i>Do it. Execute them all.</i>

1990

What the fu...?

2006
02:07:31,675 --> 02:07:33,644
You gotta tell him.

2007
02:07:35,045 --> 02:07:37,212
It was fine.

2008
02:07:37,214 --> 02:07:39,313
The little boy
handled it.

2009
02:07:39,315 --> 02:07:41,016
We helped.

2010
02:07:41,018 --> 02:07:42,150
- Talos.
- Come off it.

2011
02:07:42,152 --> 02:07:43,485
How was I supposed to know

2012
02:07:43,487 --> 02:07:44,953
that the whole thing
was fake?

2013
02:07:44,955 --> 02:07:47,356
I mean, that was all
very, very convincing.

2014
02:07:47,358 --> 02:07:49,024
The performances,
the illusion,

2015
02:07:49,026 --> 02:07:51,058
that costume,
the craftsmanship in that.

2016
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:54,232
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

2017
02:07:56,634 --> 02:07:59,334
Hey there. I hope your mission
is going well.

2018
02:07:59,336 --> 02:08:03,204
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

2019
02:08:03,206 --> 02:08:06,775
And it was very touching,
you know?

2020
02:08:06,777 --> 02:08:08,643
Really, really
quite touching.

2021
02:08:08,645 --> 02:08:10,044
Talos.

2022
02:08:10,046 --> 02:08:14,115
Um... And, you know,
shortly after that,

2023
02:08:14,117 --> 02:08:15,950
it really kind of went
off the rails,

2024
02:08:15,952 --> 02:08:17,453
so we need you to come back.

2025
02:08:17,455 --> 02:08:19,621
Everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

2026
02:08:19,623 --> 02:08:21,222
I don't know
what to say to that,

2027
02:08:21,224 --> 02:08:23,558
<i>so you're lucky
that Spider-Man won...</i>

2028
02:08:45,649 --> 02:08:47,785
Everybody back to work!

2029
02:08:54,657 --> 02:08:56,526
