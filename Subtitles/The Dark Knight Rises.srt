...rising from this abyss.

1868
02:31:52,144 --> 02:31:56,147
l see the lives for which
l lay down my life...

1869
02:31:56,565 --> 02:31:57,774
...peaceful...

1870
02:31:58,526 --> 02:32:01,778
...useful, prosperous and happy.

1871
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:07,867
l see that l hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...

1872
02:32:09,703 --> 02:32:12,872
...and in the hearts
of their descendants...

1873
02:32:13,707 --> 02:32:15,416
...generations hence.

1874
02:32:18,129 --> 02:32:22,340
lt is a far, far better thing that l do...

1875
02:32:23,217 --> 02:32:25,176
...than l have ever done.

1876
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:30,723
lt is a far, far better rest that l go to...

1877
02:32:33,644 --> 02:32:35,353
...than l have ever known."

1878
02:32:50,744 --> 02:32:52,912
[ALFRED SOBBING]

1879
02:32:53,706 --> 02:32:55,123
ALFRED:
l'm so sorry.

1880
02:32:55,499 --> 02:32:57,208
l failed you.

1881
02:32:59,253 --> 02:33:00,879
You trusted me...

1882
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:03,590
...and l failed you.

1883
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:09,512
Can l change your mind...

1884
02:33:11,849 --> 02:33:13,766
...about quitting the force?

1885
02:33:14,685 --> 02:33:18,521
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?

1886
02:33:18,898 --> 02:33:22,442
You were right, and l can't take it.
The injustice.

1887
02:33:22,651 --> 02:33:26,946
l mean, no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.

1888
02:33:27,156 --> 02:33:28,239
They know.

1889
02:33:30,159 --> 02:33:31,868
lt was the Batman.

1890
02:33:49,929 --> 02:33:53,514
LAWYER: Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.

1891
02:33:53,682 --> 02:33:57,518
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of.

1892
02:33:57,686 --> 02:34:01,147
The contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate's accounts...

1893
02:34:01,315 --> 02:34:05,652
...and the remainder is left in its entirety
to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1894
02:34:07,112 --> 02:34:11,991
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition that...

1895
02:34:12,159 --> 02:34:15,870
...they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...

1896
02:34:16,038 --> 02:34:19,832
...and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

1897
02:34:21,502 --> 02:34:25,755
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

1898
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:30,802
My clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions.

1899
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:32,387
BLAKE:
Blake, John.

1900
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:35,932
-Nothing here.
-Uh, try my legal name.

1901
02:34:39,353 --> 02:34:42,146
You should use your full name.
l like that name.

1902
02:34:42,314 --> 02:34:44,190
-Robin.
-Thanks.

1903
02:34:44,358 --> 02:34:46,526
SCIENTIST 1 : Why worry about
the stabilization software?

1904
02:34:46,694 --> 02:34:48,695
This entire autopilot system's
completely obsolete.

1905
02:34:48,862 --> 02:34:52,657
Please, l just need to know
what l could've done to fix it.

1906
02:34:52,825 --> 02:34:56,953
But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.

1907
02:34:57,121 --> 02:34:58,705
Check the ID on the patch.

1908
02:35:01,792 --> 02:35:03,376
SCIENTIST 2:
Bruce Wayne.

1909
02:35:04,253 --> 02:35:06,546
-Any news on the missing item?
-Not yet.

1910
02:35:06,714 --> 02:35:08,131
They better leave no stone unturned.

1911
02:35:08,299 --> 02:35:11,718
We can't leave a string of pearls
on the manifest as lost.

1912
02:44:27,899 --> 02:44:29,900
