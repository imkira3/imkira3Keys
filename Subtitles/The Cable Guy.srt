1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:27,414
You looked at Ray and said,
"l want him to be my boyfriend, -

3
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:31,793
- but he's got to change. "
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,048
One of the things
that initiated a misunderstanding -

5
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:40,302
- was that one day,
l didn't want to have sex with him.

6
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,931
So he starts talking about
calling somebody else to do it.

7
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:53,940
Stop at $4,000!

8
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:58,403
You'd been drinking, and you thought
you were making love to me.

9
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:06,662
This differs from a normal massage.

10
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:18,006
- Jamie, l ...
- No!

11
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:25,931
This television funny-man
killed his brother in cold blood.

12
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:29,851
My guests have crushes
on food service workers.

13
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:34,314
Mr. Davis, do you take
cream and sugar in your eye?

14
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:44,950
Do you want to tell them something?

15
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:48,870
l'm really a man.

16
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:02,384
Where's the cable guy?

17
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:15,314
Rick Legatos, please.

18
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:23,989
- Hey Rick, phone.
- How's the move going?

19
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:30,078
The cable guy is missing in action.
l hope he gets here before l die.

20
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:35,292
- You haven't called Robin?
- No. l'm giving her her space.

21
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,380
- l can't believe she's doing this.
- You shouldn't have proposed.

22
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:44,676
All she had to do was say no.
She didn't have to kick me out.

23
00:02:44,843 --> 00:02:49,139
- Let's go!
- Just give me a minute!

24
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:52,476
Listen, a piece of advice ...

25
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:58,523
Slip the cable guy $50, he'll give
you all the movie channels for free.

26
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,737
l'm not good at that stuff.
What if he says no?

27
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:06,948
None of them say no.

28
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:11,161
- l've got to go. Talk to you later.
- All right.

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,754
Hi, this is Robin Harris.
Steven doesn't live here anymore ...

30
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:46,947
- Cable guy!
- Oh, great!

31
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,536
- Cable guy!
- Don't leave!

32
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:59,376
- Wait!
- Cable guy!

33
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:03,839
- l'm coming!
- Cable guy!

34
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:08,427
Cable guy!

35
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:09,386
Cable guy!

36
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:17,102
Wait! Come back.

37
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:23,358
- Look who decided to show.
- You should have come hours ago.

38
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:28,447
Should l?
So, l'm the tardy one?

39
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:33,160
Yeah. l was going to the
bed-and-bath place. Now it's closed.

40
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:37,998
Maybe l shouldn't have come at all.
Jerk off!

41
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,337
l'm just joking with you.

42
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:51,845
The old McNair place! Never thought
they'd get the floors clean ...

43
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:57,559
- What happened?
- They had a lot of cats.

44
00:04:57,726 --> 00:05:01,813
- Please mail this in when l'm done.
- Does it go to your boss?

45
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,027
No, it goes to me.
l'm kind of a perfectioniss ...

46
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:10,447
Perfectioniss ... t.

47
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:15,494
Let's take a look.

48
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,418
This could be a cool pad.

49
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,674
Come on, baby.

50
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,554
Come on, baby.
Talk to me.

51
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:39,601
Tell me where you like it.

52
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:49,528
Hello, Mama.

53
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:56,243
ls this what you want?
ls this where you need it?

54
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:04,918
How about this?

55
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:16,054
That's your sweet spot, right there.

56
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,437
Your lady kicked you out.

57
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:27,399
What?

58
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:34,614
l noticed you were previously wired
at 1 2681 l2 Chestnut.

59
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:40,579
Last week, the billing
was transferred to one Robin Harris.

60
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:45,792
- Smells like heartbreak to me.
- l don't want to discuss that.

61
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,881
- Just install my cable, please.
- Suit yourself.

62
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:54,384
No sweat off my sack.

63
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:58,347
You might want to
put on a bathing suit.

64
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:03,018
You'll be channel surfing
in no time.

65
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:22,329
So ends day 54 of the trial
of former child star, Sam Sweet, -

66
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:26,708
- who has been accused of shooting
his brother Stan in cold blood.

67
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:33,090
The twins were stars of
the hit sitcom, "Double Trouble".

68
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:37,010
- Who broke this?
- He did it!

69
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:42,891
Life wasn't sweet
after their programme was cancelled.

70
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:46,186
Sam turned to petty larceny, -

71
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:51,775
- while his brother fell in with
the cult "Brotherhood of Friends".

72
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:58,448
l hope they fry this bastard.

73
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:09,334
What happened?

74
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:14,715
Your furniture and appliances were
causing problems with the reception.

75
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:21,596
- l moved a few things, okay?
- Yeah, l guess.

76
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:25,851
l just have some paperwork
for you to fill out.

77
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:32,399
lt's a drag. You just get to know
somebody and then the job is done.

78
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:36,111
Sign here.

79
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,167
l feel good about this.

80
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:57,841
Hey, wait!

81
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:04,014
l have this friend,
and he gave his cable guy $50 ...

82
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:09,311
He got all the movie channels
for free. Did you ever hear of that?

83
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:22,866
- You mean illegal cable?
- Yeah ...

84
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,703
- Who told you that?
- Forget it.

85
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,164
You're offering me a bribe.

86
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:35,212
That's illegal. You could be fined
up to $5,000 or go to jail.

87
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:39,257
No, l was just making conversation.
Forget it.

88
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,557
l'm just jerking your chain.

89
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:56,817
You are too easy. Wake up.
Smell the smelling salt.

90
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:59,361
l'll juice you up.

91
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:05,367
- One guy doing another guy a solid.
- That is so nice.

92
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:13,208
Well, you're a nice guy.
Many customers treat me like snot.

93
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,462
Here's my personal pager number.

94
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:24,386
- The company puts you on hold.
- Thanks. You'll get good marks.

95
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:29,349
Maybe l'll show you the satellite,
how this whole thing works.

96
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:34,062
- Sure, we should do that one day.
- How about tomorrow?

97
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:41,028
- Tomorrow's no good.
- You'll be stewing about your ex?

98
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:46,325
No.

99
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:53,665
- l crossed the line. Sorry.
- You didn't cross the line.

100
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:57,878
Cool! Pick you up at six-thirty.

101
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:06,011
There are 2 4 classrooms.
Each can be converted into a home.

102
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:12,601
There's a swimming pool,
tennis courts, a gym and a stage, -

103
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:16,647
- if the residents decide
they want to perform ''Oklahoma''.

104
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:22,611
- Oklahoma!
- lt's available in foreclosure.

105
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:26,323
With a cash bid,
we can steal this thing.

106
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:41,171
Tough room, but you got them.

107
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:45,717
Are you having
a little domestic discord?

108
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:51,139
Robin and l are having difficulties.
l think it's only temporary.

109
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:57,562
lf you screw this project up,
it's not going to be my ass.

110
00:11:57,729 --> 00:12:00,899
- Do you know what l mean?
- l'm on it.

111
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:05,237
l'm more patient. l'm more loving.
They tell me this.

112
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:10,117
There's something in everyone's life
they could improve.

113
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:16,748
lf they're doing well financially,
maybe their relationships suffer ...

114
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:23,797
Call now, and you'll be rushed
the "Personal Power Success System. "

115
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:30,804
Steven!

116
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:34,308
Stevie, time to leavie!

117
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:43,025
Come on down!
Are you waiting for an invitation?

118
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:47,571
lt's the fun bus. Come on!

119
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:53,952
- How's it going?
- Hey, buddy!

120
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,040
l've had a few drinks,
so buckle up.

121
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:04,630
That's my humour.
Thanks for coming out.

122
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:11,011
Most people never take the time
to understand how the cable works.

123
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:17,476
- Where exactly are we going?
- To ride the information highway.

124
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:47,297
l come up here to think sometimes.
Clear my head.

125
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:51,259
Brace yourself.

126
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:54,513
There she is.

127
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:06,984
She's sending entertainment and
information to millions of citizens.

128
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:14,366
- That's pretty impressive.
- l knew you'd appreciate this.

129
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:23,125
The future is now!

130
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,921
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer.

131
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:33,093
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

132
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,682
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

133
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:43,437
There's no end to the possibilities!

134
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:50,610
When l was a kid, my mom worked
nights. l never met my father.

135
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:55,449
- But the TV was always there.
- l know what you mean.

136
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:58,535
My dad might as well have been away.

137
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:06,335
That's tough. You must have
a lot of abandonment issues.

138
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,755
Reality isn't
''Father Knows Best'' any more.

139
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:14,259
lt's a kick in the face
with a steel-toe work boot, -

140
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:20,432
- and a trip to the hospital
for reconstructive surgery.

141
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:25,771
But what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

142
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,360
My brother is a speech therapist.

143
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,281
So?

144
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:39,493
Never mind.

145
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:46,625
- You're pretty love-struck, huh?
- l miss her.

146
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:51,922
- l proposed, and she kicked me out.
- l hate that.

147
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:59,972
- She said l pressed too hard.
- Women are a labyrinth, my friend.

148
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:03,225
Can l be frank?

149
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:09,690
l don't think you listen to her.
You tell her what she wants to hear.

150
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:14,069
She wants you to thirst
for knowledge about who she is.

151
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:18,699
All the complicated splendor
that is woman.

152
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:25,122
When your love is truly giving,
it will come back to you tenfold.

153
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:29,167
You're right.
That's incredibly insightful.

154
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:33,588
lt was Jerry Springer's
final thought on Friday's show.

155
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:46,226
Women love ''Sleepless in Seattle.''
lt's on HBO this month.

156
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:50,522
- That's your bait.
- Robin loves that movie.

157
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:58,155
Tell her you're cooking yourself
dinner and watching it by yourself.

158
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:03,910
- She'll come running.
- Maybe l'll give it a try.

159
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:08,957
lt's embarrassing,
l don't even know your name.

160
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:12,419
Do you really want to know my name?

161
00:17:12,586 --> 00:17:15,631
You do?

162
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:27,726
lt's Ernie Douglas.
But my friends call me Chip.

163
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:44,159
Goodbye.

164
00:17:45,202 --> 00:17:48,538
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

165
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:53,877
l don't listen to you.
l pretend to understand.

166
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:57,422
l'm just saying
what l think you want to hear.

167
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:05,722
l'm interested in learning about the
complicated splendor that is you.

168
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:12,688
l can see that taking this time
might be good for us. l'm not mad.

169
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:20,112
- Sometimes time apart is healthy.
- You're right.

170
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:25,742
That's what l came here to say.

171
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,287
l have to get back to the office.

172
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:37,129
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Cook dinner and watch a movie.

173
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:42,384
- ''Sleepless in Seattle'' is on TV.
- l love that movie.

174
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:45,846
Why don't you come by?

175
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:51,018
- Maybe l will.
- Whatever.

176
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:59,276
l'm Tabitha Soren.
Today in the Sam Sweet case, -

177
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:04,489
- the prosecution played the call
Sam made on the night of the murder.

178
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:07,826
Mr. Sweet confessed one month later.

179
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:12,331
Oh, my God.
My twin brother's been shot.

180
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:17,586
l think it was
an Asian gang or something!

181
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:23,800
l saw someone. He was speaking
another language. l'm pretty sure -

182
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:26,970
- it was Asian.

183
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:42,110
He had the same injury last year.

184
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:45,656
You guys play here too?

185
00:19:47,783 --> 00:19:52,120
l thought l'd see if anybody
wanted to play round ball.

186
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:56,875
- Great. We need another man.
- Chip Douglas, my cable guy.

187
00:19:57,042 --> 00:20:00,879
We met a week ago,
but l feel l've always known him.

188
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:04,508
That's sweet.

189
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:09,596
- Chip Douglas, you're on my team.
- No way.

190
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:15,102
- l'm on Steven's team.
- l'll switch teams. Let's play.

191
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:19,189
l've got to warm up!
l don't want to pull a hammy.

192
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:48,927
- Let's get it on .
- You any good?

193
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:51,680
You'll find out.

194
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:55,267
Check it.

195
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:58,312
Looks good.

196
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:02,899
Let's see what you got,
White Shadow.

197
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:05,610
Foul!

198
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:10,282
- That was a travel!
- Whatever you say, Chip!

199
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:14,411
l see.
We're playing prison rules, huh?

200
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:55,952
Feed me!

201
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:06,088
Steven, l'm open!
Feed me the rock!

202
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,510
Chip, over here!

203
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:48,213
l love this game.

204
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:55,095
- l guess we're done.
- Thanks for bringing your friend.

205
00:22:57,097 --> 00:23:03,562
l never made a slam dunk before.
Thanks for the boost.

206
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:09,192
What are you doing?

207
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,156
- l'm just talking trash.
- You ruined the game.

208
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:17,993
Friends don't speak to each other
like that.

209
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,456
We're not friends.
l don't even know you.

210
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:28,962
- Let me buy you a Heineken.
- l'm going home.

211
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:33,717
l guess we'll talk later.
l have to do some stuff anyway.

212
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:48,148
You have 1 1 new messages.

213
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:53,320
Steven, it's Mom. Call me.
l'm still your mother, you know.

214
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:57,282
Steven, call your mother.

215
00:23:57,449 --> 00:24:02,871
Hey, Steven. Give me a ring.
l'm at 555-4329.

216
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:08,794
l'm at a pay phone.
lf you're there, pick up.

217
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:12,130
l'll be home later.

218
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:17,427
Okay, l'm home.
Give me a buzz when you get in.

219
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:22,641
lt's me again. l was taking a whiz.
Thought you might have called.

220
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,813
We're having ourselves
a game of phone tag here.

221
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:35,821
l was just blow-drying my hair ...
Thought l heard the phone ring.

222
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:40,575
l think your machine is ...

223
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:56,049
- Hey, good to see you.
- You too.

224
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:08,687
- So how's work?
- Work's good.

225
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:15,027
- How's Hal?
- The guy has no vision.

226
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:21,033
lt's like working for Mr. Magoo.
And those hair plugs ...

227
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:28,290
He's just an utterly useless person.
l think l hate him.

228
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:35,088
- lt's nice to see you doing well.
- lt's nice just to see you.

229
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,719
Hey.
lt should be on now.

230
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:54,024
Damn it.
The cable's out.

231
00:25:54,941 --> 00:26:00,739
l know what to do.
The cable guy is a friend of mine.

232
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:06,078
l'm a preferred customer.
All l have to do is page him.

233
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:26,014
- Hi. ls there a problem?
- My cable's out.

234
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:32,688
Really?
So you called me.

235
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:36,441
Funny, how you call
when you need something.

236
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:42,864
- ls that how you treat people?
- l've been busy. Robin is here.

237
00:26:44,408 --> 00:26:50,288
- This is important.
- But calling me back isn't?

238
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:54,710
l'm sorry.
Can you help me out?

239
00:26:55,794 --> 00:27:01,216
Why should l help you?
l gave you free cable.

240
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:05,595
- What have you ever done for me?
- Anything you want.

241
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:11,393
- Tomorrow night we hang out.
- Fine, anything you want.

242
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,649
God bless you.
You're too good to me.

243
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:29,786
All set!

244
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:39,087
- What's with the cut cord?
- That's for effect. Until tomorrow.

245
00:27:39,254 --> 00:27:43,467
She's pretty. Don't kiss her.
Don't even touch her.

246
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:50,682
Resist the urge at all costs.
lt'll pay off in the end.

247
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:53,644
See what l'm saying?

248
00:27:56,813 --> 00:28:00,067
Enjoy the flick.

249
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:06,031
That was fast.

250
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:10,869
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine. Don't l look fine?

251
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:16,500
That isn't how it's done.
l'd rather just see somebody l like.

252
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:22,422
Get a feeling about them,
and ask them if they'd like a drink.

253
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:26,677
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Does it still work this way?

254
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:30,973
- lt doesn't. They ask you.
- l'm starting to notice that.

255
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:35,060
lf you get a new wife,
do you get to have sex with her?

256
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:40,524
- l certainly hope so.
- Will she scratch up your back?

257
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:42,776
What?

258
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:47,447
ln movies, women always scratch
the man when they're having sex.

259
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:51,785
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

260
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:08,260
- Mommy's got to go out now.
- When will l get a brother?

261
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:11,680
That's why Mommy is going out.

262
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:17,102
Just sit there with Mr. Babysitter
and he'll take good care of you.

263
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:22,024
Don't sit so close to that thing.
lt's going to rot your brain.

264
00:29:24,526 --> 00:29:30,073
- Why didn't you take my call?
- l can't always pick up the phone.

265
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:35,412
Your nostrils flare
when you're mad.

266
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:48,675
Sorry about yesterday.
How did everything go with you?

267
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:52,596
- Keep them closed!
- Pretty well. The other night ...

268
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:56,141
l want this to be a surprise.

269
00:29:56,308 --> 00:30:02,022
- Where are we going?
- The finest restaurant in town.

270
00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:06,693
Open ... sesame.

271
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,738
Medieval Times?

272
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:16,370
l knew you'd like it.
l come twice a week.

273
00:30:16,536 --> 00:30:23,919
l'm your serving wench, Melinda.
Care for something from the barkeep?

274
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:27,965
Dost thust have thou a mug of ale?

275
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:34,805
Me mate here, pitched in battle for
a fortnight, has a king's thirst.

276
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,813
- l'll be right back, My Lord.
- My thanks to ye, fair wench.

277
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,609
Thanks.

278
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:54,199
- Look, l have to tell you ...
- Hold that thought. Show's on.

279
00:30:54,366 --> 00:31:00,831
Welcome to a magnificent journey ...
into the past.

280
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:05,043
This is Medieval Times!

281
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,551
Are you prepared for a night
of feasting and sport -

282
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:16,596
- the likes of which
you'll never forget?

283
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:22,019
Stand up and cheer
for your section's knight!

284
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:26,440
Let the games begin!
The blue knight rules!

285
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:33,822
The red knight sucks the big one!
You're going down, red knight!

286
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:39,453
Going down, down, down!
Red knight going down!

287
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:45,125
Smite him!

288
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:54,092
- Could l get a knife and fork?
- There were none in medieval times.

289
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:58,263
- More Pepsi?
- There was Pepsi, but no utensils?

290
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,724
l've got a lot of tables.

291
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:10,359
Can l have your skin?
Check this out.

292
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:21,453
''Silence of the Lambs.''

293
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,415
Hello, Clarice.
lt's good to see you again.

294
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:34,007
This has nothing to do with you
as a person ...

295
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:37,469
We have reached the climax
of our competition.

296
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:45,102
Two noblemen from our audience
will battle to the death.

297
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:52,484
Master Steven Kovacs and Lord Chip,
come to the fighting pit!

298
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,655
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

299
00:32:56,822 --> 00:33:00,909
- We're going to do battle.
- ls this a normal part of the show?

300
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:06,707
No, but l give all the knights
free cable.

301
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:11,044
- ls it safe?
- Yes! That's what the armour's for!

302
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:17,467
We have to be careful
not to hurt each other, right?

303
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:23,890
l cannot listen to you,
for you are my sworn enemy.

304
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:33,150
Just take it easy, all right?

305
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:44,161
Nice move.

306
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:48,749
Necessity ...
is the mother of invention.

307
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,756
Come back ...
so that l may brain thee!

308
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:04,264
My leg!
l have a cramp!

309
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:07,476
Are you all right?

310
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:12,731
l am now.

311
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,074
Oh my God!

312
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:34,336
That's the spirit!
Let's give them a show!

313
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:53,188
l'm blinded! My eyes!

314
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:59,653
l don't believe you.
lt's another trick.

315
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:05,701
So that's how it's going to be?
You want to play rough?

316
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:09,246
Daddy can play rough!

317
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:16,920
This is like when Spock fought Kirk.
Best friends forced to do battle.

318
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:42,279
Chip, this isn't funny!
Stop it!

319
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:49,453
The name is Spock. lf we don't fight
to the death, they'll kill us both.

320
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,205
This isn't ''Star Trek''.

321
00:35:57,628 --> 00:36:01,298
Goodbye, Jim.

322
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:21,568
Good fight.

323
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:25,238
Keep eating!

324
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:31,036
Quickly! Muster atop your steed.

325
00:36:33,205 --> 00:36:38,835
Get on the friggin' horse.
l don't think he's kidding.

326
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:43,882
- Don't do this!
- Good luck to you!

327
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:48,971
- This is our destiny!
- No, it's not!

328
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:53,266
- Yes, it is!
- No, it isn't!

329
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,154
Are you all right?

330
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:15,914
Well done, good sir.
You are the victor.

331
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:19,626
But we will meet again.

332
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:39,479
Did you hear that?

333
00:37:39,646 --> 00:37:45,360
- You have a warrior's instinct.
- l had a real feeling of power.

334
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:49,948
lf Robin had seen you,
she'd be begging you to come back.

335
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:53,493
These knights get laid all the time!

336
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,539
We should go again next week.

337
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:03,629
- You have no messages.
- Nobody loves you.

338
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:09,718
l left something in the living room.
Will you check it out for me?

339
00:38:09,885 --> 00:38:13,847
Just a little piece of equipment.

340
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:25,275
- What do you think?
- What is all this?

341
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:33,033
lt appears as if someone has updated
your home entertainment system.

342
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:38,997
l got you the big-screen TV,
deluxe karaoke machine -

343
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:44,670
- and THX quality sound that would
make George Lucas cream his pants.

344
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:51,885
- You got in here when l was out?
- How else could l get the stuff in?

345
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:56,264
- How much did all of this cost?
- Practically nothing.

346
00:38:56,431 --> 00:39:01,561
l have a connection.
l hook him up, he hooks me up.

347
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:06,358
- l can't accept this.
- Why not?

348
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:10,612
You give me something more valuable.
Friendship.

349
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:17,786
You give me friendship. We're even.
You have to take this stuff back.

350
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:29,131
- Can l leave it here till Saturday.
- Sure. No problem.

351
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:35,804
Hi, this is Robin Harris. Steven
doesn't live here any more ...

352
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:41,435
Hey, it's Steven.
l'm still trying to reach you ...

353
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:45,272
l'm at the office. Call me.

354
00:39:46,231 --> 00:39:49,443
- How's it going?
- Good.

355
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:54,156
Good.
Keep it up. lt's your ass.

356
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:57,743
lt's Robin on line two.

357
00:39:57,909 --> 00:40:02,873
l had the best time the other night.
When will l see you again?

358
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,670
- How about tomorrow?
- Chip!

359
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:12,466
l knew l'd get you
on the phone that way.

360
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:17,971
Let's break the cherry
on that karaoke machine.

361
00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:22,851
- What does that mean?
- Karaoke jam. No ifs, ands or buts.

362
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:28,440
Maybe a few buts.
Big ones!

363
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:52,923
You're going on a date?

364
00:40:53,090 --> 00:41:00,055
We're not officially back together.
And you said time apart is good.

365
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:05,394
Yes. Time apart from each other,
but not with other people.

366
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,688
That's time with someone else.

367
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:13,402
- l love you, but l have to go. Bye.
- Bye.

368
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:25,747
This is just a sign
that you need to live a little.

369
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:32,754
- She's having fun. You should, too.
- Maybe you're right.

370
00:41:33,547 --> 00:41:40,012
- l got you a little something.
- You said we were even.

371
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:45,267
You're breaking the rules.
What is it?

372
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:53,608
LOOSE YOUR LlSP
lN 30 DAYS

373
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:57,529
My brother thought
it might help you.

374
00:41:57,696 --> 00:42:03,619
- This is ... There's no words ...
- lt's no big deal.

375
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:08,081
Yes, it is!
lt is to me.

376
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:13,045
Now l'm on a mission.

377
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:18,467
This is going to be
the best damn karaoke jam ever.

378
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:32,105
We're really bopping!

379
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,403
- You have some nice friends.
- They're just preferred customers.

380
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:43,241
Chick alert, two o'clock.
What a licorice!

381
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:50,415
- Don't look.
- You're just playing with me.

382
00:42:50,582 --> 00:42:55,587
- She's all over you.
- Shut up.

383
00:42:55,754 --> 00:43:01,718
l'd strike while the iron is hot.
He who hesitates, masturbates.

384
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:05,013
Go.

385
00:43:06,515 --> 00:43:11,895
- Hey. l'm Steven.
- Heather.

386
00:43:12,062 --> 00:43:17,734
- Can l get you a beer?
- How about a tequila?

387
00:43:22,072 --> 00:43:25,284
Hi, Rick.

388
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,203
That'll be a good one.

389
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:33,208
- Glad you accepted my invitation.
- Steven invited me.

390
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:36,586
He's having a super time.

391
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:44,803
He's changing. You'll have to learn
to live with that.

392
00:43:46,763 --> 00:43:53,145
l don't know what your story is,
but l'm going to find out.

393
00:43:53,312 --> 00:44:00,444
Don't dig too deep. You might
get burned by the molten lava.

394
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:05,115
l'm out of here.

395
00:44:11,663 --> 00:44:14,708
Thank you.

396
00:44:16,585 --> 00:44:21,673
The soothing sounds of Raoul,
ladies and gentlemen.

397
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,261
- You had honey in your voice.
- Do a song for us.

398
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:29,848
No, l couldn't.

399
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:34,019
All right, already!

400
00:44:34,186 --> 00:44:37,272
l fought the law, and the law won.

401
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:44,237
Jefferson Airplane performed
this song in ''Gimme Shelter'', -

402
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:49,618
- a film about how the Hell's Angels
had their way at a Stones concert.

403
00:44:49,785 --> 00:44:53,330
Tonight ... it's my turn.

404
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:29,825
- What do you do?
- Can we talk in the other room?

405
00:46:52,324 --> 00:46:56,286
We just had a baby born
at the party.

406
00:46:56,453 --> 00:47:00,874
We need an ambulance
over by the scaffolding.

407
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:04,503
Shut the door!

408
00:47:19,643 --> 00:47:26,149
lt's the summer of love, baby.
Let's leave these two alone.

409
00:47:26,316 --> 00:47:30,362
Smile!
That's going to be a good one.

410
00:47:46,128 --> 00:47:50,549
Good morning,
and how are we today?

411
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:55,470
l borrowed this sweatshirt.
Bacon and eggs, coming up.

412
00:47:55,637 --> 00:48:01,059
- Where did Heather go?
- She left early this morning.

413
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:04,354
You cad.

414
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,486
- What a night. Just what l needed.
- l'll tell you something.

415
00:48:11,653 --> 00:48:15,657
You look like a new man.

416
00:48:15,824 --> 00:48:21,997
l was getting so used to rejection.
l really liked her.

417
00:48:22,164 --> 00:48:26,293
lt was my treat.

418
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:34,551
- What do you mean?
- You can buy next time.

419
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:42,517
- Don't let your eggs get cold.
- Buy what?

420
00:48:42,684 --> 00:48:48,940
What do you mean, buy what?
The women.

421
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:53,820
Do you mean
that Heather is a prostitute?

422
00:48:53,987 --> 00:48:58,951
Of course. We couldn't get
a woman like that without paying.

423
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:02,120
This can't be happening.

424
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:11,463
lt's okay. She's totally clean.
l checked her out about a week ago.

425
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:18,470
To make sure she was good. And l'm
healthy as a horse ... Not a drip.

426
00:49:19,763 --> 00:49:26,228
- Would you like some juice?
- You're kidding. She's your friend.

427
00:49:26,395 --> 00:49:31,274
- l wish l had friends like that.
- Get out of my house!

428
00:49:31,441 --> 00:49:36,029
She was a working girl,
but she liked you.

429
00:49:36,196 --> 00:49:39,866
You might even have got a freebie.

430
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:45,205
l don't ever want to see you again.
Robin will never forgive me.

431
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:49,167
Don't tell her.
l'll help you get her back.

432
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:53,547
l want you out of my apartment.
And get this stuff out of here.

433
00:49:53,714 --> 00:49:58,677
Why are you doing this?
You're sabotaging yourself.

434
00:49:58,844 --> 00:50:01,388
Out! Now!

435
00:50:01,555 --> 00:50:05,267
Everything was going so well.

436
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:09,521
l made you breakfast,
and we were eating ...

437
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:12,065
Out!

438
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:17,154
l'll fix this.
l can make it cool again.

439
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:20,240
This is just a speed bump!

440
00:50:24,703 --> 00:50:28,874
- May l help you?
- No. l'm meeting someone here.

441
00:50:41,678 --> 00:50:45,641
l apologize about last night.
l came home and l just fell asleep.

442
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:59,321
Most appreciated.

443
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:04,952
Gail tells me
you're coming out of a relationship.

444
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:10,666
- We're in a holding pattern.
- A holding pattern?

445
00:51:10,832 --> 00:51:14,920
You need to come down and refuel.

446
00:51:16,546 --> 00:51:18,840
You're sexy.

447
00:51:23,971 --> 00:51:29,059
You've been working hard.
Take a break.

448
00:51:35,816 --> 00:51:39,319
Excuse me.
What's the story with our chicken?

449
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:46,743
Have the eggs had a chance to hatch?
Maybe you can go check on it for me.

450
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:50,163
l'm sorry to put you out.

451
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,916
Unbelievable.

452
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:57,254
l'm hysterical now.
What were we talking about?

453
00:51:57,421 --> 00:52:05,387
- What's your job like?
- lt's a little crazy right now ...

454
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:12,978
Wait. l need to use the head.
l want to find out about your job.

455
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:15,731
What's with the chicken?

456
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,198
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

457
00:52:25,365 --> 00:52:28,368
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, stretch.

458
00:52:28,535 --> 00:52:33,874
- Pleasant night, isn't it?
- Yeah, not too bad.

459
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:41,548
The weather is always nice in here.
The winters are remarkably mild!

460
00:52:46,303 --> 00:52:52,309
- lf you need anything, let me know!
- l got it under control!

461
00:52:52,476 --> 00:52:56,146
- Unbelievable.
- lt's no trouble.

462
00:52:56,313 --> 00:52:59,358
What is your ..?

463
00:52:59,316 --> 00:53:03,904
People rarely take advantage of
my services. l'll help you wash up.

464
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:06,949
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

465
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:14,331
You're on a big date.

466
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:17,876
You'll need to look your best.

467
00:53:21,129 --> 00:53:26,510
That'll take care of the shine.
Now, let's pluck those eyebrows!

468
00:53:26,677 --> 00:53:30,263
She loves me, she loves me not.
She loves me ...

469
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:34,267
... she loves me not.

470
00:53:34,434 --> 00:53:38,105
A little Jose Eber ...

471
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:43,860
A touch of Alfalfa ...

472
00:53:44,027 --> 00:53:47,823
We're ready to dry you off!

473
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:52,411
Right into the buckle.
That's got to hurt!

474
00:53:55,998 --> 00:53:59,167
Suck the air.

475
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:02,921
You look just like Dizzy Gillespie.

476
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:21,565
Don't worry about the tip.
But l've got one for you.

477
00:54:21,732 --> 00:54:26,278
Stay away from Robin.
She's taken.

478
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:40,042
A man was beaten in a restroom
by a bathroom attendant.

479
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:48,216
The victim is unable to speak, but
witnesses described the assailant.

480
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:52,554
Tonight on UPN: The trial
that has captured the nation.

481
00:54:52,721 --> 00:54:58,101
Everyone awaits the verdict,
but we're showing the movie now.

482
00:54:58,268 --> 00:55:02,022
- Cry - baby.
- l love you.

483
00:55:02,189 --> 00:55:07,361
- No, Sammy!
- Look who's crying now.

484
00:55:07,527 --> 00:55:13,617
Eric Roberts is Sam and Stan Sweet
in "Brother Sweet Brother".

485
00:55:13,784 --> 00:55:16,203
Parental discretion advised.

486
00:55:28,131 --> 00:55:32,678
- Who is it?
- lt's the cable guy!

487
00:55:32,844 --> 00:55:36,223
My cable's fine.

488
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:41,937
l have an upgrade order
for one Robin Harris.

489
00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:46,024
l didn't order that.

490
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:51,113
l guess you have a secret admirer.

491
00:55:54,324 --> 00:55:58,328
- ls it a man named Steven?
- l can't say.

492
00:55:58,495 --> 00:56:03,083
l promised Steven l wouldn't say.
Oh, look what l've done.

493
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:07,296
- You didn't hear it from me.
- Hold on.

494
00:56:27,566 --> 00:56:32,154
- Male witches are the worst kind.
- He's not a witch.

495
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,789
That about does it.
My work is done.

496
00:56:46,627 --> 00:56:50,589
That was hot up there.

497
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:57,804
- Are you a friend of Steven's?
- l'm proud to say that l am.

498
00:56:57,971 --> 00:57:02,434
l recently installed his cable
and we just hit it off.

499
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:07,356
- Are you guys going out a lot?
- Not really.

500
00:57:07,522 --> 00:57:11,068
That guy is devoted to you.

501
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:14,988
l shouldn't be telling you this ...

502
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:19,868
... but he thinks
you're the cat's pyjamas.

503
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:23,288
Did he say that?

504
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:29,503
Only every five minutes.
Frankly l'm sick of hearing it.

505
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:32,798
He's a good man.

506
00:57:32,965 --> 00:57:38,512
He mentioned
that you've had some problems.

507
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:43,225
- lt's a little complicated.
- lt always is.

508
00:57:43,392 --> 00:57:46,937
l asked a woman to marry me once.

509
00:57:47,104 --> 00:57:53,527
She wanted to think about it.
We agreed to take some time apart.

510
00:57:53,694 --> 00:57:58,448
You know ...
give each other space.

511
00:58:01,535 --> 00:58:04,329
She's no longer with us.

512
00:58:06,498 --> 00:58:09,042
l'm sorry.

513
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:15,173
Sometimes you don't know
what you've got till it's gone.

514
00:58:16,633 --> 00:58:23,056
Promise me you'll never
go bungee jumping in Mexico.

515
00:58:23,223 --> 00:58:27,311
- l promise.
- Anyway ...

516
00:58:27,477 --> 00:58:31,315
l've said too much.

517
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:36,069
Thank you.

518
00:58:37,446 --> 00:58:41,867
Cherish him, Robin.
Every hair on his head.

519
00:58:48,165 --> 00:58:51,126
Excuse me.

520
00:58:51,293 --> 00:58:53,795
- Hello.
- l love you.

521
00:58:53,962 --> 00:58:58,008
Robin?
l love you, too.

522
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:02,512
That was so sweet of you.

523
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:06,683
- You didn't have to do that.
- l ... l wanted to.

524
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:10,937
Giving me free cable. Only you
would do something like that.

525
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:19,780
l wanted to do something for you,
but you needed space, so ...

526
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:24,117
Let's not make any more rules.

527
00:59:24,284 --> 00:59:31,166
- Call me later if you're around.
- Sure, as soon as l get home.

528
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:34,920
- Bye.
- Bye.

529
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:41,009
- Are you ready to rock?
- The concert. Oh, Jesus.

530
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:45,222
l think Robin and l
are getting back together.

531
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:52,479
So you're blowing me off again.
l won't put up with it any more.

532
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:05,951
- Can't you ask someone else to go?
- Maybe l'll take my cable guy.

533
01:00:11,915 --> 01:00:15,794
l'll call you later ...

534
01:00:20,507 --> 01:00:25,137
Pretty smooth work.
l set them up, you knock them down.

535
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:32,436
- What?
- Robin. l got her back for you.

536
01:00:32,602 --> 01:00:37,190
- How do you know about us?
- Free cable's an aphrodisiac.

537
01:00:37,357 --> 01:00:43,447
- Don't mess around with my life.
- l wanted to make things up to you.

538
01:00:46,366 --> 01:00:49,119
Do you want to catch a flick?

539
01:00:53,624 --> 01:00:58,378
l appreciate
you helping me out with Robin.

540
01:00:58,545 --> 01:01:06,178
Now l'll have to work extra hard
not to screw things up again.

541
01:01:06,345 --> 01:01:14,686
You're a nice guy, but l just
don't have time for a new friend.

542
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:24,655
- What are you trying to say?
- l don't want to be your friend.

543
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:32,162
l appreciate your honesty.
You're a straight shooter.

544
01:01:33,205 --> 01:01:39,252
- So you're all right?
- l'm a big boy.

545
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:43,548
lt's no big deal.
Whatever.

546
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:53,767
- You're sure?
- Uh-huh. l'm fine.

547
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,331
- Robin Harris.
- Hey, it's Chip Douglas.

548
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:22,462
- Chip Douglas?
- The cable guy.

549
01:02:22,629 --> 01:02:30,137
- What's up?
- l'm worried about Steven.

550
01:02:30,304 --> 01:02:36,935
- What is it?
- He doesn't seem like himself.

551
01:02:37,102 --> 01:02:42,983
- Have you noticed anything?
- No. Things are going really well.

552
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:49,114
Good.
That makes me feel better.

553
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:55,954
- Should l be worried?
- No. Maybe l'm being too nervous.

554
01:02:58,248 --> 01:03:02,169
Let's just keep our eyes open.

555
01:03:03,503 --> 01:03:06,423
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

556
01:03:07,841 --> 01:03:11,553
Stevie, you did it, man.

557
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,350
You put our cajones on the table
and you slam-dunked it.

558
01:03:16,516 --> 01:03:19,770
Way to go. Now they'll probably
give him my job.

559
01:03:19,936 --> 01:03:25,859
- On to the next order of business.
- Steven, l need to talk to you.

560
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:31,782
We have to find an architect.

561
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:35,786
- l need to talk to you.
- lt shall wait.

562
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:42,626
- ls there a Steven Kovacs here?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

563
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:46,838
You're under arrest
for receiving stolen property.

564
01:03:47,005 --> 01:03:52,427
- l don't know anything about this.
- Do not speak until spoken to.

565
01:03:52,594 --> 01:03:57,557
You have the right to remain silent.

566
01:03:57,724 --> 01:04:02,104
- You have the right to an attorney.
- l didn't accept any stolen goods.

567
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:06,900
Deluxe karaoke machine.
Big - screen TV ...

568
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:09,820
Cream his pants ...

569
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:20,289
l can't believe you did this.

570
01:04:20,455 --> 01:04:26,920
He gave you a big-screen TV
and a hi-fi system as a present?

571
01:04:27,087 --> 01:04:30,757
- l swear it's true.
- Why would you accept such gifts?

572
01:04:30,924 --> 01:04:37,014
- l don't know.
- What's going on? Are you on pot?

573
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:41,143
l didn't do anything!
Just call my cable guy.

574
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:47,065
Nobody named Chip Douglas
works for the cable company.

575
01:04:47,232 --> 01:04:51,778
- This can't be happening.
- lt's killing your mother.

576
01:04:51,945 --> 01:04:57,075
- When can you get me out?
- There'll be no bail hearing today.

577
01:04:57,242 --> 01:05:00,579
You have to spend the weekend here.

578
01:05:00,746 --> 01:05:03,832
Look at the pretty boy!

579
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:12,341
They call me the pumper.
l'll be your friend.

580
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:15,636
Lock down!

581
01:05:24,936 --> 01:05:28,607
You hear anything?

582
01:05:30,609 --> 01:05:33,528
l came as soon as l could.

583
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:38,158
- What's your real name?
- Larry Tate. That's not important.

584
01:05:38,325 --> 01:05:43,413
We have to get you out of here.
l was watching Court TV.

585
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:48,418
l'll talk to the judge.
l'll put the system on trial!

586
01:05:48,585 --> 01:05:52,965
- Why are you doing this to me?
- You did this to you.

587
01:05:53,131 --> 01:05:58,637
- You set me up.
- No. l taught you a lesson.

588
01:05:58,804 --> 01:06:03,767
l can be your friend or your enemy.
You seem to prefer the latter.

589
01:06:03,934 --> 01:06:06,269
l'm just here to comfort you.

590
01:06:08,522 --> 01:06:12,943
Touch it.
You need human contact.

591
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:16,196
l will not touch it.

592
01:06:18,198 --> 01:06:22,911
- What are you doing?
- l know how you're feeling!

593
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:28,292
- Don't do that.
- l'm here for you!

594
01:06:29,543 --> 01:06:33,630
Don't do that! You'll get me killed!

595
01:06:34,006 --> 01:06:37,759
Oh, Billy.

596
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,686
l'm just messing with you.

597
01:06:47,853 --> 01:06:52,149
Remember ''Midnight Express''?
Oliver Stone won an Academy Award.

598
01:06:52,316 --> 01:06:54,651
Awesome scene.

599
01:06:54,818 --> 01:06:58,864
This is the man who framed me!

600
01:06:59,031 --> 01:07:02,951
Hey Bernie,
how's that sports package?

601
01:07:06,038 --> 01:07:13,086
Don't worry about Robin.
l'll take care of her.

602
01:07:13,837 --> 01:07:19,676
- lf you go near her, l'll kill you.
- That's it. Let's go!

603
01:07:21,803 --> 01:07:27,809
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

604
01:07:27,976 --> 01:07:32,022
- You've been blowing me off.
- This guy's doing a number on me.

605
01:07:32,189 --> 01:07:35,859
- l told you to stay away from him.
- You said l could get free cable.

606
01:07:36,026 --> 01:07:39,863
Did l tell you
to have a karaoke jam with him?

607
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:43,992
l'm out on bail.

608
01:07:47,204 --> 01:07:51,625
l'll see if l can track him down.
What was his name?

609
01:07:51,792 --> 01:07:56,880
Larry Tate. But at first he said
his name was Chip Douglas.

610
01:07:57,047 --> 01:08:01,134
Chip Douglas?
That sounds familiar.

611
01:08:02,302 --> 01:08:05,013
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine.

612
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:09,559
- You're not fine.
- l just want to get this over with.

613
01:08:09,726 --> 01:08:12,270
l hate visiting my parents.

614
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:19,903
ls this guy cool?
Just joking. Come in, you psycho.

615
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:25,492
- What is he doing here?
- l invited him.

616
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:28,787
- l invited him at lunch.
- At lunch?

617
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:33,542
- You look great.
- And you are a vision.

618
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:39,214
- You look rested.
- Come here.

619
01:08:39,756 --> 01:08:45,595
- What's wrong? You seem weird.
- You had me sent to jail.

620
01:08:45,762 --> 01:08:50,851
- l should take you to the police.
- You can if you like.

621
01:08:51,018 --> 01:08:54,813
But l'd hate
to have to show Robin this.

622
01:08:55,355 --> 01:09:00,694
- Bastard!
- Let's just have a good time.

623
01:09:02,654 --> 01:09:08,702
Steven is carrying his battle axe
and chasing me ...

624
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:13,457
So l say, ''Hey, it's just a show!''

625
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:21,965
- He takes things too seriously.
- The guy almost took my head off.

626
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:32,726
Did never played Porno Password?
lt's the adult version of the show.

627
01:09:32,893 --> 01:09:37,648
Robin, you're on my team.
Steven ... you're with Mom.

628
01:09:37,814 --> 01:09:40,442
You're the judges.

629
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,236
Pick a word.

630
01:09:53,538 --> 01:09:57,292
The password is ...

631
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:00,337
Vagina.

632
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:04,549
- l really don't want to play.
- Come on, Steven.

633
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,597
Woman.

634
01:10:10,764 --> 01:10:14,101
- Woman.
- Man?

635
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,401
Penis.

636
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:27,072
Penis.

637
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:32,244
- Penis.
- Vagina.

638
01:10:35,414 --> 01:10:38,792
She got vagina!

639
01:10:38,959 --> 01:10:44,339
- l would have said ''schlong''.
- Now we're starting to get this!

640
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:56,935
The password is ...

641
01:10:58,478 --> 01:11:01,481
Nipple.

642
01:11:01,648 --> 01:11:05,152
- Can l pass?
- Don't be a stick in the mud!

643
01:11:07,613 --> 01:11:10,741
Breast.

644
01:11:10,907 --> 01:11:13,702
Breast.

645
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,913
Tit?

646
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:23,420
Remember his clue.

647
01:11:24,087 --> 01:11:27,341
Hard.

648
01:11:29,926 --> 01:11:34,848
- Erection?
- No. But thanks for noticing.

649
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:41,980
- Your turn!
- Center.

650
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:47,027
Center.

651
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:52,074
- Center!
- Nipple?

652
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,911
- She got it!
- Mom.

653
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:05,921
The password is ...

654
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:10,050
l'm not sure how to say this.

655
01:12:10,217 --> 01:12:13,470
That little thing ...

656
01:12:13,637 --> 01:12:17,975
- l can't say that to my mother.
- She can handle it.

657
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:21,687
l won't do it. l've had enough!

658
01:12:21,853 --> 01:12:27,609
- lt's just skin, Steven.
- l don't want to do it any more!

659
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:32,739
- You're overreacting.
- No! He's fooling you all.

660
01:12:32,906 --> 01:12:39,413
- He's a lunatic and a felon.
- Everybody just relax.

661
01:12:39,579 --> 01:12:44,710
- We knew this would happen.
- Nothing is happening!

662
01:12:44,876 --> 01:12:49,798
This is a safe place.
You're with people who love you.

663
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:54,886
- We love you.
- l hate you! Get out of my life!

664
01:12:55,053 --> 01:13:00,267
- He's angry with me. l should go.
- No.

665
01:13:00,434 --> 01:13:04,855
- You are being an asshole.
- Do you see what's happening?

666
01:13:05,022 --> 01:13:08,984
- You're hitting bottom.
- Stay away.

667
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:14,156
This is where the healing begins.
Come on.

668
01:13:15,115 --> 01:13:20,787
Robin showed me her birthmark.
lt's very sexy.

669
01:13:26,126 --> 01:13:29,421
What the hell is wrong with you?

670
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:36,845
Thanks for the delightful evening.
l guess l'll be leaving now.

671
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:50,943
l forgive you. l only hope
my neurologist will feel the same.

672
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:01,453
- Did anybody notice l'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

673
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:05,707
- Did anybody notice l'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

674
01:14:07,459 --> 01:14:12,881
HELLO STEVEN
l'VE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU

675
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:22,766
- How's Hal?
- The man has no vision.

676
01:14:22,933 --> 01:14:29,356
lt's like working for Mr. Magoo.
lf only someone would dump him.

677
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:33,402
And those hair plugs ...

678
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:37,948
- Hair plugs. Hair plugs ...
- Oh, shit.

679
01:14:38,115 --> 01:14:43,745
He's so pathetic.
l think l hate him. Hate him ...

680
01:14:52,629 --> 01:14:56,008
lf only someone would dump him.

681
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:06,977
l ... l don't hate you.

682
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:11,690
- Those hair plugs.
- Get out!

683
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:41,511
Chip!

684
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:45,766
This isn't funny!

685
01:15:47,059 --> 01:15:50,479
Where are you?

686
01:15:54,232 --> 01:15:58,195
lf you build it, he will come.

687
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:18,340
- Hello?
- Bingo! ''My Three Sons''.

688
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:24,304
- Chip and Ernie Douglas.
- l have a list of ex-cable men.

689
01:16:24,471 --> 01:16:26,682
Murray Slaughter.

690
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:29,559
George Jetson. Jean Luc Picard.

691
01:16:29,726 --> 01:16:34,606
- Someone called the Big Ragoo.
- Carmine, from ''Laverne & Shirley''.

692
01:16:34,773 --> 01:16:42,364
Anyway, the cable company in town
fired a guy six months ago.

693
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:48,870
His boss was Larry Tate,
from a show called ''Bewitched''.

694
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:53,583
- He's not with the cable company?
- Yahtzee!

695
01:16:54,543 --> 01:17:01,925
They fired him for stalking
customers. You better lock up tight.

696
01:17:02,092 --> 01:17:07,514
ln the Sam Sweet Trial,
the jury is close to a verdict.

697
01:17:07,681 --> 01:17:12,936
They will continue deliberating
into the evening hours.

698
01:17:13,103 --> 01:17:18,442
The day started real nice,
but now the moisture is increasing.

699
01:17:18,609 --> 01:17:22,070
We see thunderstorms ...

700
01:17:27,618 --> 01:17:30,495
Cable guy!

701
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:35,042
Cable guy!

702
01:17:48,472 --> 01:17:51,933
Jesucristo!

703
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:56,104
Cable guy!

704
01:18:19,836 --> 01:18:23,840
Okay, l'm going!

705
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:30,514
See you! Bye.

706
01:18:46,196 --> 01:18:50,409
l just want to hang out!
No big deal!

707
01:19:13,724 --> 01:19:17,936
- Hello?
- We could have been blood brothers.

708
01:19:18,103 --> 01:19:22,941
But you're too needy.
lt's a real turn-off. Ask Robin.

709
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:26,737
The cable company fired you.

710
01:19:26,903 --> 01:19:31,450
Hold on.
l have a call waiting.

711
01:19:44,921 --> 01:19:48,842
- l know it's you.
- Sorry. Where was l?

712
01:19:49,009 --> 01:19:52,262
- Can't we work this out?
- l wish we could.

713
01:19:52,429 --> 01:19:59,436
- l'm just so tired, Steven.
- Where are you?

714
01:19:59,603 --> 01:20:06,860
l'd love to chat, but l'm
getting together with a lady friend.

715
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:12,950
- You might know her.
- Stay away from her!

716
01:20:18,622 --> 01:20:26,046
- Robin!
- She just left with the cable guy!

717
01:20:26,213 --> 01:20:29,216
Where were they going?

718
01:20:29,383 --> 01:20:35,138
l heard him say they were taking
a ride on the information highway.

719
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,356
The future is now!

720
01:20:44,523 --> 01:20:49,528
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer!

721
01:20:49,695 --> 01:20:55,617
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

722
01:20:55,784 --> 01:21:02,499
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

723
01:21:07,546 --> 01:21:10,882
l want to go home now.
l'm worried about Steven.

724
01:21:37,868 --> 01:21:41,663
- Help!
- Robin!

725
01:21:43,206 --> 01:21:45,876
Where are you?

726
01:21:46,043 --> 01:21:50,380
- Steven!
- l'm coming!

727
01:21:56,428 --> 01:22:00,390
- Help me!
- Hang on!

728
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:15,447
- Steven, look out!
- Yes, Steven! Look out!

729
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,590
''Dry land is not a myth!''
Kevin Costner, ''Waterworld''.

730
01:22:33,757 --> 01:22:39,721
- Leave him alone!
- l saw that movie six times!

731
01:22:41,932 --> 01:22:45,644
lsn't it funny
that we ended up like this?

732
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:58,532
You'll have to do
better than that, Steven.

733
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:06,957
My lisp is gone!

734
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:11,336
You stupid son-of-a-bitch.

735
01:23:13,839 --> 01:23:18,635
- Stop it! Steven!
- l'm coming!

736
01:23:28,145 --> 01:23:33,859
The trouble with real life is,
there's no danger music.

737
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:49,958
Nice jump, Spiderman!

738
01:23:53,545 --> 01:23:59,051
Steven called the fuzz!

739
01:23:59,217 --> 01:24:02,929
Bad boys,
what you gonna do?

740
01:24:04,264 --> 01:24:08,018
Skooch over just a tad.

741
01:24:16,026 --> 01:24:18,904
Here comes our hero.

742
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:23,617
- lt didn't have to be this way.
- What are you planning to do?

743
01:24:23,784 --> 01:24:31,416
l don't really have a plan.
l'm going moment to moment now.

744
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:35,379
You have to admit,
it's a cool place for an ending.

745
01:24:35,545 --> 01:24:38,840
- An ending to what?
- lt's like ''Golden Eye''.

746
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:45,138
This isn't a movie!
This is reality!

747
01:24:45,305 --> 01:24:50,060
This is the police! You're
trespassing in a restricted area!

748
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:00,529
l just wanted to be your friend ...

749
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:04,491
... but l screwed it up.

750
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:11,581
- You are in a high - voltage area!
- What's that?

751
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:16,169
Come again?

752
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:24,428
You want me to quiet down
and chill out in front of the TV?

753
01:25:27,973 --> 01:25:31,310
You were never there for me,
were you, Mother?

754
01:25:35,105 --> 01:25:39,234
You expected Mike and Carol Brady
to raise me.

755
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:46,950
l'm the bastard son of Claire
Huxtable! l'm the lost Cunningham!

756
01:25:47,576 --> 01:25:54,374
l learned the facts of life ...
from watching ''The Facts of Life''!

757
01:26:05,177 --> 01:26:08,680
That's it.

758
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:15,103
That's what l have to do!

759
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:19,816
No. Don't do that!

760
01:26:19,983 --> 01:26:24,613
- Let's go out and have a Heineken.
- Yeah!

761
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:27,908
l'm not thirsty any more.

762
01:26:28,492 --> 01:26:31,954
See ya.

763
01:26:39,670 --> 01:26:43,006
You're not going anywhere!

764
01:26:43,173 --> 01:26:48,470
lt's okay!
l understand my purpose now!

765
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:52,683
Don't do this. You just need help.
We all get lonely.

766
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:58,939
But l get really lonely.
Look at me!

767
01:27:02,401 --> 01:27:10,075
- l'll be your pal. Just come on up!
- No. lt's too late for me.

768
01:27:10,867 --> 01:27:16,456
But there are a lot of cable boys
and girls who still have a chance!

769
01:27:17,124 --> 01:27:20,836
Don't you understand, Steven?

770
01:27:28,385 --> 01:27:33,348
Somebody has to kill the babysitter.

771
01:27:43,525 --> 01:27:51,408
This is the moment we've been
waiting for. The jury is ready ...

772
01:27:51,575 --> 01:27:56,038
The jury has notified the judge
that they've reached a verdict.

773
01:28:07,257 --> 01:28:11,762
- The moment of truth ...
- Jacob Sweet has been found ...

774
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:30,948
Help.

775
01:28:35,202 --> 01:28:38,163
Preferred customer, my ass!

776
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:28,046
Squad 51 . Man down.
Possible back injury.

777
01:29:30,674 --> 01:29:35,721
We'll need an lV with D-5-W.

778
01:29:35,887 --> 01:29:39,391
Check vital signs.

779
01:29:40,601 --> 01:29:43,812
Prepare to defibrillate!

780
01:29:53,447 --> 01:29:56,158
Wait!

781
01:30:01,872 --> 01:30:05,000
You two will be just fine.

782
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:09,838
Take care of him, Robin.
He's good people.

783
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:13,884
You never told me your real name.

784
01:30:14,051 --> 01:30:17,971
You still want to know my name?

785
01:30:22,726 --> 01:30:27,981
lt's ... Ricardo.

786
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:31,985
Ricky Ricardo.

787
01:30:42,162 --> 01:30:45,874
l'm just messing with you.

788
01:31:06,019 --> 01:31:09,356
Let's go home.

789
01:31:14,987 --> 01:31:19,866
Hang in there, pal!
You're going to make it, buddy!

790
01:31:37,301 --> 01:31:43,098
- Am l really your buddy?
- Yeah, sure you are!

791
01:31:44,305 --> 01:32:44,334
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
