1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,668
Long ago, a mythic
battle between good and evil

2
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,546
played out in ancient China.

3
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,173
The country was torn by civil war,

4
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,468
with many kingdoms
struggling for land and power.

5
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,893
But one king had a ruthless ambition
to make himself emperor by the sword.

6
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,668
Leave me.

7
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,879
Prepare for war!

8
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,967
The other rulers hired assassins
to kill the King

9
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,678
before he could conquer them all.

10
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,844
Stop! l am not harmed.

11
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,812
We attack tonight!

12
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:44,121
Kingdom by kingdom,
his army swept away everything in its path,

13
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:48,042
and anyone who resisted met a terrible fate.

14
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,964
The country was his.

15
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,217
He was now Emperor of All Under Heaven.

16
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,640
He enslaved his conquered enemies
and forced them to build his Great Wall.

17
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,644
When they were dead or useless,
he had them buried beneath it.

18
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:42,179
The Emperor's mystics taught him
mastery over the five elements,

19
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,268
fire, water, earth, wood and metal.

20
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,687
His power seemed without limit.

21
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,110
He was master of millions,

22
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,989
but like the lowliest peasant,
he could not stop growing old.

23
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,286
l have too much to do for one lifetime.

24
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,457
He needed to defeat
his last enemy, death itself.

25
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,051
One day, news came of a powerful witch

26
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,679
who was rumored to know
the secret to eternal life.

27
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:29,018
He ordered General Ming, his oldest friend
and trusted ally, to find her.

28
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,698
The witch was named Zi Yuan,

29
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,952
and she was nothing
like the General expected.

30
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,629
Your Majesty...

31
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,386
Rise up.

32
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,226
l do not possess the secret of
immortality, my Lord...

33
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,270
...but l know where to find it.

34
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,773
General...

35
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,111
No man is to touch her.

36
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,031
She is mine.

37
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,832
On the western border
stood the Monastery of Turfan.

38
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,919
There was housed the greatest library
in the ancient world,

39
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,215
and Zi Yuan was sure
the secret to eternal life was here.

40
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,033
This is a key.

41
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,878
It was the long lost
oracle bones,

42
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,299
a collection of all the mystical secrets
of the ancient world.

43
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:28,929
The Emperor's answer was here
along with other magic beyond imagining.

44
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,026
You have served me well.

45
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,865
I will grant you anything you desire.

46
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,995
I want to spend my life with General Ming.

47
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,832
Of course.

48
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,459
Read.

49
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,312
She cast the spell in Sanskrit,

50
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,441
an ancient language
that the Emperor did not understand.

51
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,616
I feel your spell working.

52
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:37,873
I am now immortal.

53
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,128
Come, l want to show you something.

54
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,438
Become my queen and l will let him live.

55
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,651
Do what he says! Save yourself!

56
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,949
You will never keep your word.

57
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,618
You are right.

58
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,634
Now, join General Ming in hell.

59
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,652
What did you do to me?

60
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,780
I cursed you and your army.

61
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,922
Surround the Palace!

62
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,465
The Emperor is in trouble!

63
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,400
The curse must never be lifted,

64
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:32,988
or the Emperor will rise again
to enslave all of mankind.

65
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:37,952
On that dark day,
there will be nothing and no one to save us.

66
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,469
You can run, but you can't hide.

67
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,269
One o'clock.

68
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,104
OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND
1946

69
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,859
Ten o'clock, one o'clock. Ten o'clock, one...

70
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,862
And this is something for grown men to do?

71
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,456
Come on.

72
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,800
Bite on this.

73
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,486
Evy, I'm home!

74
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,656
Mrs. O'Connell is at her book reading, sir.
She'll be home for dinner.

75
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,493
Oh, right. Well, that's great,
'cause we're having fish.

76
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,498
You didn't think I'd catch anything,
did you?

77
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,084
I had the utmost confidence, sir.

78
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:16,008
There's a hook in your neck, sir.
Shall l fetch the wire cutters?

79
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,060
Fall back! Follow me!
Move! Move! Move! Move!

80
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,941
"Now safely aboard the airship
with the mummy finally vanquished,

81
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,109
LONDON

82
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,696
"Dash swept Scarlet into his arms.

83
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:43,077
"'Oh, God, Scarlet, l thought I’d lost you.'
'For a moment there, you did.'

84
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,372
"Bathed in rays of golden sunlight,

85
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:51,543
"our heroes sealed their reunion
with a kiss of timeless passion,

86
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,130
"their love deeper and truer than ever."

87
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,139
Mrs. O'Connell, we're all dying to know,

88
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,726
is the Scarlet O'Keefe character
really based on you?

89
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,648
Honestly, l can say
she's a completely different person.

90
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,733
- Any more questions?
- Mrs. O'Connell...

91
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:19,321
Mrs. O'Connell, is your life today
as exciting as it was before the war?

92
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,242
I wish my life were that exciting now.

93
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,743
Will there be another book
in the series?

94
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,413
Do you believe in happy endings?

95
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,584
Isn't this blissful?

96
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,588
Dinner at home.

97
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,300
- Every night.
- Every night.

98
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,930
- Here's to retirement.
- May we stay this happy forever.

99
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,531
Still no letter from Alex.
I've sent him three in the last month.

100
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,782
Yeah, well, what do you expect?

101
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:04,950
The only time we ever hear from that kid

102
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,286
is when he's getting kicked out of college
or he needs more money.

103
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,372
I’m sure he's just buried in his studies.

104
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,966
- So, how did your book reading go?
- Oh, fine. Thank you.

105
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,803
Until they asked me, "When will there
be another Mummy adventure?"

106
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,473
Yeah, but you did promise the publisher
a third book.

107
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,640
I know.

108
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,061
But l spend my nights staring
at a blank page, completely blocked.

109
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:38,317
We could skip dinner, and l could

110
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:43,697
attempt to inspire you upstairs.

111
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,576
Oh, that's so sweet of you, darling.

112
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:52,331
But I’m going to sit at that typewriter
until something exciting comes out.

113
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,043
Thank you.

114
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,839
Trout. How lovely!

115
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,347
I’m so happy you found a hobby
that doesn't involve guns.

116
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,857
NINGXIA Province, China

117
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,079
Don't worry, we'll find the entrance today.

118
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,124
Li Tung, what's for lunch?

119
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,292
Noodle soup.

120
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,127
Very good.

121
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,302
Good. Wilson's back.

122
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,931
You're a couple days late, Professor.

123
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,516
l was beginning to think
you'd run into bandits.

124
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,601
Oh, my dear fellow,
thank you for the concern.

125
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,395
- Are you thirsty?
- Oh, yes, please.

126
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,522
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

127
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,733
You know,
when l saw you standing up there,

128
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,986
l thought l was looking at your father.

129
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,821
You really are Rick O'Connell's son.

130
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:10,742
Yeah, well, hopefully after today,
he'll be known as Alex O'Connell's father.

131
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,537
What a powerful face!

132
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,583
When l told my colleagues at the museum
that you had discovered the Colossus,

133
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,251
they were thrilled.

134
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,545
- Yes, however...
- l know.

135
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,714
When am l gonna get in that tomb?

136
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,841
Don't let the buggers get you down.

137
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,343
It was you that discovered
the Bembridge journal,

138
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,929
and with it, you'll discover the Emperor.

139
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:34,808
- l have complete faith in you, Alex.
- Thank you, Professor.

140
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,185
Thanks for believing in me.

141
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,482
We found it! We found the door!

142
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,528
Bad Mummy.

143
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,406
Yeah.

144
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,868
Vile Mummy?

145
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,663
No. Cursed Mummy!

146
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,666
Mysterious Mummy.

147
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,046
Malignant Mummy.

148
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,510
Prepare to die!

149
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,722
Take that!

150
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,398
Rick!

151
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,235
Darling, where are you?

152
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,082
I’m ready to be inspired.

153
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,842
Do you remember the time
the mummy had me tied down?

154
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,888
And you came to save me and you cut...

155
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,226
No! You tore open the ropes
is what you did,

156
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,145
just as he was about to plunge his...

157
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,233
Oh, rats.

158
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,345
Watch out!

159
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,813
- Emperor didn't want any houseguests.
- Yeah.

160
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,149
Stay together.

161
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,509
Sir Colin Bembridge.

162
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,720
Oh, gee...

163
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,931
He went searching for this tomb
70 years ago.

164
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,975
They left him like this as a warning.

165
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,853
Unfortunately, this is not the dead man
that's gonna make us famous.

166
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,688
Let's keep moving.

167
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:04,893
Look at it, Alex.

168
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,562
Look at it!

169
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,727
Chu Wah!

170
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,939
- Chu Wah.
- No, no, don't, don't, don't.

171
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,734
Alex, Alex, they're dead! Come on.

172
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,945
This kind of danger goes with the territory.
You know that better than anyone.

173
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,322
Alex!

174
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,202
- Yes?
- Okay.

175
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,704
- Yes?
- Yeah.

176
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,918
All right, good chap. Okay. Good chap.
Oh, Jesus.

177
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,509
All the warriors are facing in to this point,

178
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,930
- as if awaiting an order from the Emperor.
- Well, then, where is he?

179
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:09,601
Listen, you don't think some bloody grave
robber's beaten us to the prize, do you?

180
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,394
No, he's still here.

181
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,689
You see, this is a feng shui compass.

182
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,450
Okay. Now. This...

183
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,452
Okay, this is true north,

184
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,790
but the feng shui compass
is set in the opposite direction.

185
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,959
- All right, we need to realign it.
- All right.

186
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,127
- All right, here we go.
- All right.

187
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,111
Alex! Alex, speak to me!

188
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,405
Are you all right?

189
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,075
- Alex!
- I’m fine.

190
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,745
Tell me, have we found the Emperor?

191
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,834
Alex!

192
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,884
What is it?

193
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,929
It's only the greatest find since King Tut!

194
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,729
"lf he is awakened,
all mortals should despair."

195
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,772
It’s definitely him!

196
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,529
Even had his concubines buried alive
with him.

197
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,989
Selfish bastard.

198
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,743
Hey, Professor Wilson,
you want to come down and take a look?

199
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,996
Or are you so overwhelmed you can't talk?

200
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,313
Wilson!

201
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,554
Let's go, Professor.
We've got a lot of work to do.

202
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,721
All right.

203
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,354
First of all, I’d just like to say

204
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,691
that the Foreign Office appreciates
all that you did during the war.

205
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:49,112
But I’ve been sent to offer you
one last assignment.

206
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:54,200
I’m afraid we've retired
from the espionage game, haven't we, dear?

207
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,452
Yeah, we've... We don't do that anymore.
We're finished.

208
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,913
- Not at all.
- Completely done.

209
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,127
But just out of curiosity,
what is the mission anyway?

210
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,589
We need you to courier this to Shanghai.

211
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,387
- Nice piece of ice.
- It’s the Eye of Shangri-La.

212
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,974
lf you believe the legend,
it points the way to the Pool of Eternal Life.

213
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,226
It was smuggled out of China in 1940.

214
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:23,062
Now, the government would like
to return it to the Shanghai Museum

215
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:26,566
as a sign of good faith
to the Chinese people.

216
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,570
And with your expertise in the field,
we naturally thought of you.

217
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,615
Oh, we'd be so flattered.

218
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,495
But Rick and l, we made a promise
to each other after the war

219
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,665
that we would settle down.

220
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,585
- That's right, yeah, we did, didn't we? We...
- l see.

221
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,588
Well, l must admit l am a little disappointed.

222
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,091
Postwar China is very dangerous.

223
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:57,096
There are a lot of factions that would love
to get their hands on the Eye of Shangri-La.

224
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,808
In lesser hands,
the Eye could be lost forever.

225
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,269
We couldn't let that happen, could we?

226
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,772
No, that could be bad for the world.

227
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,024
- The world... Terrible.
- Yeah.

228
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,693
You know, she has a brother
who lives in Shanghai.

229
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,612
- Jonathan!
- Yes.

230
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,572
He owns a nightclub, if I’m not mistaken.

231
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,115
We have been meaning to visit. We could...

232
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,492
- We should...
- ...drop in and surprise him.

233
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,244
- Say hello.
- Why not?

234
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,664
Does this mean
we can count on you one last time?

235
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:24,999
Yes.

236
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,421
Shanghai, China

237
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,507
Chinese NEW YEAR, 1947

238
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,535
There we are.

239
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,330
Here's to you, Princess.

240
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,667
And Imhotep.
May the bugger actually stay dead.

241
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,378
Ding-dong.

242
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,930
Hi, can you buy a drink for me?

243
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,726
Excuse me. Alex! Alex! You're back again.

244
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,269
Come here, Alex. Let me get you a drink.

245
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,896
Smooth special for the pup, huh?
The explorer.

246
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,400
Make that two.

247
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,028
Sorry, Uncle Jon, but l got a better offer.

248
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:38,823
No, no, Alex. No, look.
Listen, how can l... Come here.

249
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,700
To put it in archeological terms,

250
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,994
that's a tomb
in which many pharaohs have lain.

251
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,997
Now, listen, listen,
just think about me for a moment, all right?

252
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,876
Your discovery will go public in a few days,
and your parents are sure to find out.

253
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,503
They're not gonna be happy
you've dropped out of school. And...

254
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,424
Will you relax, Uncle Jon? Okay? I’m here.
They're a long way away.

255
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,344
- Alex...
- Excuse me, okay?

256
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,763
l have some excavation to do.

257
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,272
Jonathan!

258
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:18,654
You're in China! Evy. Rick.

259
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,115
What are you... It’s so...
l didn't even...

260
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,410
Brother, how lovely to see you.

261
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,245
l had no idea he was here!

262
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,789
- Who was here?
- Who?

263
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,834
This happens every time!

264
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,921
Every man in the bar!

265
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,089
- Dad?
- Alex!

266
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,840
- l don't know what to do with you!
- He's just a boy!

267
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,260
- l can't leave the room for 10 minutes!
- l didn't... Go away! Go to hell!

268
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,388
- I’m sick of it!
- Let's go get lover-boy!

269
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,431
I’m gonna kill you, kid!

270
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,809
Not so fast, that's my kid.

271
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:53,147
- Mad Dog Maguire?
- Ricochet O'Connell.

272
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,109
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing here?

273
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,070
- Alex! Sweetheart! Are you all right?
- Just a little family get-together, folks.

274
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,573
Come on,
let's get back to having a good time. Music!

275
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,117
How long has it been?

276
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,036
Egypt, '23. French Foreign Legion.

277
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,373
This guy could land a plane
on anything, you...

278
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,084
- Why are you here?
- Ricochet, he had his hands all over me girl.

279
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,461
Now, son or no son,
l gotta give him a beating!

280
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,880
- Get out of the way, Dad.
- Sit down.

281
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,716
Now as much as I’d really like you
to teach him a valuable lesson...

282
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,468
His mother would be upset! Very upset.

283
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,095
You have a lot of explaining to do,
young man.

284
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,388
l got a wife now, and a kid.

285
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,640
Things are a little bit different,
I’m sure you understand.

286
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,434
- Yeah.
- Let me make it up to you.

287
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,854
We're just surprised to see you here.
That's all.

288
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,355
Who's gonna pay
for all this damage?

289
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,731
All right?

290
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:36,858
I’m not here five minutes,

291
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,818
and I’m already pulling your fanny
out of the fire.

292
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,944
You're going back to college.

293
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,197
How'd you think this was gonna work, Dad?
You two show up, tell me what to do?

294
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:47,743
No. But we should sit down
and discuss this like a family.

295
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,621
No offense, Mom,
but we haven't been a family in a long time.

296
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,748
Hey, don't you turn your back on me. Alex!

297
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,209
Alex, just... Alex, come here.

298
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,713
Can you...

299
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,175
Don't look at me like that.

300
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,433
- It’s all your fault!
- My fault?

301
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,226
You're the one
that's always smothering him.

302
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,854
You couldn't leave him alone
for five minutes without wiping his nose.

303
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,691
Perhaps l was overcompensating for the fact
that you never took an interest in his life.

304
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,444
His life was my top priority.

305
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,113
How many times did l save that kid
from breaking his neck?

306
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,449
A little warmth and encouragement
would have been nice.

307
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,243
I’m his father. It’s implied.

308
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:36,250
We've spent our entire lives
searching for priceless artifacts,

309
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,919
and the one thing
that's most precious to us,

310
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,086
we've lost.

311
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:45,760
We can't let Alex become some stranger
in pictures on our mantle.

312
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,262
- We can't let that happen.
- No, we can't.

313
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,473
How are we gonna fix this?

314
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,268
We need to do it together.

315
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:05,154
PARAMILITARY OUTPOST
WESTERN China

316
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,515
The O'Connells are in Shanghai.

317
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,601
Do they have the Eye of Shangri-La?

318
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,062
Our spy says they do.

319
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:39,647
Good.

320
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:40,982
Assemble the troops!

321
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,149
Yes sir.

322
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,655
Soldiers!

323
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,659
Soon all our training and sacrifice...

324
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,870
will bear great fruit.

325
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,166
It is my dream to raise our Emperor
from his tomb.

326
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,004
Only He can bring order out of this chaos.

327
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,089
Soldiers...

328
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:10,011
tonight our great battle begins!

329
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,692
You know, this might have been faster
if we took a rickshaw.

330
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,111
It’s Chinese New Year.

331
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,237
Don't you just love this country?

332
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:31,699
They have so many extra little holidays,
and drinking is mandatory.

333
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,368
l can't believe
we get to see your first big discovery.

334
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,494
It’s so exciting.

335
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,080
Well, after last night,
I’m surprised you want to see it at all.

336
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,168
Listen,
I'll pick you up in about an hour.

337
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,544
You're not coming?

338
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,964
No, no,
I’ve seen enough mummies to last a lifetime.

339
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,727
There he is.

340
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,773
Oh, my darling, very impressive.

341
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,442
When do you get to open the sarcophagus?

342
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,569
Well,
after the official red tape has been cut.

343
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,947
Do the words "rest in peace"
mean anything to you two?

344
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:15,743
So, Mom, why don't you stick around
for the next few days,

345
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,078
and we can open it together?

346
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,579
l would like that very much, thanks.

347
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,956
Alex, why don't you go
and tell Professor Wilson

348
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,125
that we're here. You know...

349
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,585
No problem. Great.

350
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,838
Just don't wake the big guy up
while I’m gone.

351
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,055
Hey, Alex.

352
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:41,352
You know, this is all really, really big stuff.

353
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,774
Whatever you say, Dad.

354
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,104
What?

355
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:31,152
You just have a certain glow about you
this evening l haven't seen in a long time.

356
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,573
l guess mummies bring out the best in me.

357
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,327
Take a wrong turn at Cairo?
Sorry to interrupt.

358
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,914
- Roger.
- Professor Roger Wilson.

359
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,332
Rick.

360
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,961
You know, when Alex told me
that you had gone legit,

361
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,088
l just couldn't believe my ears.

362
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,884
Well, now l just pillage tombs
in the name of preservation. Evelyn.

363
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:59,096
- Congratulations on your latest discovery.
- Alex deserves all the credit.

364
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,265
He's one hell of a kid.
He's like the son l never had.

365
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,683
And he's the only one we've got,

366
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,810
so the next time you send him
on one of your field trips,

367
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,187
you give us the heads-up first.

368
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,647
Yes, yes, of course.

369
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:12,151
And now, l believe you have
something that belongs to us.

370
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,819
What's that?

371
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,529
Oh, you mean this?

372
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,701
I’m sorry...

373
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,163
There, go ahead.

374
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,040
All yours, Rog.

375
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,585
l knew l could rely on you two.

376
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:35,299
I’m afraid your work is not done yet,
Mr. and Mrs. O'Connell.

377
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,303
I’d like to introduce you to a friend of mine.
General Yang.

378
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,596
Roger!

379
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:45,392
Well, he is the man who financed Alex's dig.
We're in this together.

380
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,270
Cheek by jowl. General.

381
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,774
Search him.

382
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:57,822
No. The Eye belongs to the Chinese people.
You can't do this.

383
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:02,409
So, Rog, you snake, how much did...

384
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,287
Is it Yin and Yang? ...pay you?

385
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,915
Enough to pull strings at the Foreign Office,

386
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,419
make sure that it was you two
who delivered the Eye. Turn around.

387
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:16,507
The Eye contains the elixir
from the Pool of Eternal Life.

388
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,387
l need you to open it, Mrs. O'Connell.

389
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,848
No.

390
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,934
You're going to use it to wake the Emperor,
aren't you?

391
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,188
And his Terracotta Army.
At least, that's the general idea.

392
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:34,817
Raising an army of mummies is insane.
Listen, Yang...

393
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,281
Easy! Go easy.

394
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,243
Time to open the sarcophagus. Move!

395
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,126
Read the inscription! Now!

396
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,928
Ancient Chinese isn't my forte.

397
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:06,557
Here's some encouragement. Wilson!

398
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,767
I’ll do it!

399
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,563
No, Evy, don't do it!
They're just gonna kill me, anyway.

400
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,320
The inscription says
that only a drop of blood

401
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,615
from a person of pure heart
can open the Eye.

402
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,660
Your husband was right.

403
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,039
No!

404
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,383
Only the pure of heart would sacrifice
themselves for the one they love.

405
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,261
Open it.

406
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,144
You never called after our last date.

407
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,563
l don't have time for games, Alex.

408
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:58,025
You know my name, but l don't know yours.

409
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,318
It’s Lin.

410
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,947
You want to explain to me
why you tried to kill me?

411
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,156
We could do that.

412
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,033
Or we could save your parents.

413
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,707
Wilson, you son of a bitch!

414
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:09,388
- Get on with it, O'Connell.
- All right.

415
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:33,912
Once this touches him,
the Emperor will rise to rule again.

416
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,040
Finish him off.

417
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,998
Alex, please! Don't. That's...

418
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,834
Don't, don't. Don't, please.

419
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,587
No, don't, Alex, it's me. Please.

420
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,800
It’s not him. This is a eunuch! It’s a decoy!

421
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,845
Where the hell's the Emperor?

422
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,414
Stay!

423
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,935
Here we go again.

424
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,116
l live to serve you, my Lord.

425
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,784
l can help you become immortal.

426
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,704
lf you are lying, you will burn.

427
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:59,558
Wait! Wait! You wait for me!
I’m coming with you! Wait, wait...

428
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,835
Watch out!

429
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:36,053
We got to put this mummy down fast!
The longer we wait, the stronger they get!

430
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,472
Open the gate! Open the gate!

431
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, l know. Sorry, pal.
There's a mummy on the loose.

432
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,026
- You wanna drive?
- Why not?

433
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,903
God, l love a woman who can drive a truck.

434
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,073
Hey, pal, I’m really sorry,
but you know what? Happy New Year!

435
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,699
Hit it, honey!

436
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,748
No! Move over!

437
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,709
What? No!

438
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,127
No!

439
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,552
No!

440
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,640
- What?
- Jonathan, get in the back!

441
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,101
Sorry about the Rolls!

442
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,603
You guys are like mummy magnets!

443
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,857
- We have to turn you around!
- Okay.

444
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,156
Excuse me.

445
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,328
- Hey, we could use this!
- Give me that!

446
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:49,084
- Oh, yeah, that's a better idea.
- Size counts!

447
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,087
Stop mucking about! They're getting away!

448
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,756
Just drive!

449
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,634
- Aim for the Emperor!
- Aim for the Emperor?

450
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:00,387
- Light it up, Jonathan!
- I’m trying!

451
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,596
Fire!

452
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,744
Did we get him?

453
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,954
- Fire!
- What, again?

454
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,956
- Your ass is on fire!
- My ass?

455
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,916
- Hold still!
- Rick, my ass is on fire!

456
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,460
- Well, spank my...
- I’m putting it out!

457
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,295
- Put me out, Rick!
- Just hold still!

458
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,672
Spank my ass! Spank my ass!

459
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:37,716
All right, here l come!

460
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,471
Give me your hand!

461
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,728
Come on!

462
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,730
Watch out!

463
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,774
Evy, where are you going?

464
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,984
- Taking a short cut!
- Evy!

465
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,496
- l told you it was a short cut!
- Right!

466
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,456
Now he's chasing us!

467
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,212
Hurry!

468
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,049
Give me your hand.
Here, you're gonna need these.

469
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,009
- Don't wait up for me.
- Where are you going?

470
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:22,219
Out!

471
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,019
- Where's Rick?
- Where do you think?

472
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,610
Damn it!

473
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,241
You're mine!

474
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:53,041
- Give me your hand and get on this horse!
- Get back, Dad!

475
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:58,088
Alexander Rupert O'Connell, you get
on the back of this horse this instant!

476
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:11,643
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Oh, God!

477
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,068
Evy!

478
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,737
We've got to go back and help Rick!

479
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,699
Rick! Forget Rick!
Here they come!

480
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,917
I’ll go after the Emperor.

481
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,753
Trust me. I’ve got a little more experience
with mummies.

482
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,340
And l have the only weapon
that can kill him.

483
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,843
Okay. I’ll cover you. Let's go!

484
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,352
Lin!

485
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,789
- l thought you were dead!
- He missed.

486
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,193
Look out!

487
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,994
- Thanks, Rick. Could you get the cab?
- Does it look like l have a wallet?

488
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,765
You know, l would have killed the Emperor
if you two hadn't blown my cover.

489
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,100
l had everything under control.

490
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,436
Oh, yeah, that's exactly
what we were thinking.

491
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,354
Yeah, well, good going,
you raised another mummy.

492
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,398
And this bugger's got superpowers.

493
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,735
He's got control over fire, water,
metal and who knows what else.

494
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:07,902
And you dug him up anyway.

495
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,738
Yeah, well, you're not gonna
pin this one on me, okay, Dad?

496
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,073
- Am l?
- Oh, stop it, you two.

497
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,577
No one's to blame here.
Wilson manipulated all of us.

498
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,786
Yeah, that's true.

499
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,955
l apologize for my parents.

500
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,875
But l thought we worked
really well together.

501
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,127
Except we failed.

502
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,633
I’m sorry,
we haven't been properly introduced.

503
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,302
- Who are you exactly?
- My name is Lin.

504
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,764
My family has watched
over the Emperor's tomb for centuries.

505
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:40,185
The Emperor cannot be killed unless
he is stabbed through the heart with this.

506
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,979
My mother put a curse on it long ago.

507
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:45,398
Mmm-hmm.

508
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,985
Well, a quick family meeting, Alex.

509
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,280
- Sit.
- Down.

510
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,326
What do you really know about this girl?

511
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,164
Well, not much, but after her help tonight,
I’m willing to go on a little faith.

512
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,124
- Faith.
- Time is running out.

513
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,710
You don't really believe in the concept
of personal space, do you?

514
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:09,297
lf the Emperor reaches Shangri-La
and drinks from the Pool of Eternal Life,

515
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,258
he will raise his army
and no one will be safe.

516
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,886
Much as I’d like to stay
this boyishly handsome forever,

517
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,429
Shangri-La is a crock.

518
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,473
Yeah, but that's what you used to say
about mummies, too, Jon.

519
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,684
- You did pretty well off it.
- Good point.

520
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:25,188
The Gateway to Shangri-La lies in
a mountain pass high in the Himalayas.

521
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,440
Beyond it is a golden tower.

522
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:31,236
Once the diamond is placed at the top,
it will point the way to Shangri-La.

523
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,363
Yang still has the diamond,

524
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,449
and that's where
he and the Emperor will go.

525
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,034
She's right.

526
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:41,204
All the legends of the Eye
mention the Gateway.

527
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,456
l like her, Alex. She knows what's what.

528
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:49,045
Now, just say that we were to believe you,
could you guide us there?

529
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,549
Yes. l have been there once.
l remember the way.

530
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,846
Himalayas. We're going to need a plane.

531
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,724
Well, l know just the Mad Dog for the job.

532
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:07,021
Well, any self-respecting pilot
would land on the valley floor,

533
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,857
but l don't have any self-respect,

534
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,192
so I’ll put you down
halfway up the mountain.

535
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,027
That should give us a good advantage.

536
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,196
Of course,
l can't guarantee any of us will live.

537
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,489
Great!

538
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:24,122
I’d tell you to fasten your seatbelts,
but l was too cheap to buy any!

539
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,294
- Why am l laughing?
- Here we go!

540
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,506
Mad Dog, Mad Dog!
Ease up, ease up, ease up!

541
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,341
Oh, God!

542
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,851
Maguire!

543
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,104
Come on, man!

544
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:49,814
Mad Dog!

545
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,953
Brake! No, no! Nobody move.

546
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,790
Nobody move, nobody move!

547
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,472
What is that God-awful smell?

548
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,475
The yak yakked.

549
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,232
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.

550
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,692
Why did you raise me?

551
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,322
l love this land.
Only you can lead us back to greatness.

552
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,575
What is in it for you?

553
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,955
l want to serve as your general.

554
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,124
The last general l trusted...

555
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,211
betrayed me.

556
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,548
l will not make that mistake.

557
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:07,517
l cannot escape this curse
until l am immortal...

558
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,811
General.

559
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,523
l understand, my Lord.

560
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:17,694
We need to find the Pool of Eternal Life.

561
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:22,448
This will point the way.

562
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,638
Can't you see it's Mr. McGuire

563
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,557
come to court your sister Kate

564
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,728
You know very well he owns the farm
a wee bit out...

565
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,243
Delta-Tango-Alpha
to Ricochet. Come in, Ricochet.

566
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,748
Delta-Tango-Alpha, this is Ricochet.
Go ahead, Mad Dog.

567
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,292
Yeah, you know that Yang fellow
you told me to keep me eye out for?

568
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,585
He's just shown up.

569
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,921
Ricochet out. Thanks, Mad Dog.

570
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,672
That's us, people! Let's go!

571
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,591
- Jonathan, wake up!
- What...

572
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,936
Hold the line!

573
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,607
Good, we're a little more than halfway.

574
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:41,235
We're gonna...
We're gonna camp up there for the night.

575
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:58,252
Lin says if we leave at first light,
we'll reach the Gateway by noon.

576
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:03,758
Did she happen to mention how she knows
so much about the Gateway?

577
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,636
No, not really. Kind of mysterious.

578
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,181
She's certainly managed to enchant you.

579
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,019
Come on, Alex. You obviously like her.

580
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:20,566
Mom, the thin mountain air,
clearly messing with your head.

581
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,654
Whatever secret she's hiding,

582
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,032
l just don't want to see you get hurt.

583
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:31,577
l appreciate that, but, you know,

584
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:35,707
I’ve had my fair share of experience
with the opposite sex.

585
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,958
Really?

586
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,504
How many experiences
are we talking about?

587
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:48,011
Well, you shouldn't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to, okay, Mom?

588
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,220
Right.

589
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,223
Hey, Mom.

590
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,854
I’m sorry l blamed you guys
for raising the Emperor.

591
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,700
What's so funny?

592
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:18,291
My mother is under the impression
there's something between us.

593
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,376
l hope nothing romantic.

594
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,966
Yeah, well, l told her there
was no chance of that.

595
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,427
We're complete opposites,
you and me, right?

596
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:34,557
You guard tombs. l raid them.
You like ancient knives. I’m into guns.

597
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,727
Those are some
pretty insurmountable odds.

598
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,063
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.

599
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:45,151
Now that we've cleared that up,
we can focus on taking down the Emperor.

600
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,861
l agree totally.

601
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,200
Besides, you're not my type.

602
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:59,290
Of course not. You don't like a woman
who can knock you on your backside.

603
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,003
The expression is "kick my ass."

604
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,507
And for the record, you didn't.

605
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:13,471
Yeah, it's not easy being me, you know.

606
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,264
Then again, l don't suppose
it's easy being you,

607
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,517
is it, Geraldine, old girl?

608
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,811
lf I’d met a girl like you, Geraldine...

609
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,814
You know, hard-working,
you don't say much,

610
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,276
you're a little bit hairy, but l don't mind that.

611
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,623
There it is! We found it!

612
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,633
The Gateway of Shangri-La!

613
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:02,103
Go, girl! Go! You're free!

614
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,398
Go, Geraldine! Live free!

615
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:18,286
What did you do now? Rob an armory?

616
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,831
Have you ever seen a Walther P38?

617
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,167
Looks pretty anemic
compared to the Peacekeeper.

618
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,628
Well, it's not about size, Dad.
It’s about stamina.

619
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:31,674
You want power?

620
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:38,181
l give you the Thompson submachine gun.
Fifty rounds a drum.

621
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,434
- Twenty-five a mag.
- Tommy's good, Dad,

622
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,227
but the cocking mechanism always jams.

623
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:47,690
Here. Check out the Russian PPS
Personal Assault Weapon.

624
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,483
Now, this is the future right here.

625
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,945
You know, it's experience that wins the day.
It’s not all about firepower.

626
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,989
Boys! lf l may...

627
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,949
Do we have a plan for the Emperor?

628
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:58,993
Yeah. We're gonna hit him
high, hard and fast

629
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,828
and smash him like a Ming vase.

630
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,040
- And if that doesn't work?
- We go to plan B.

631
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,293
Plan B! You go upstairs,
you blow up that gold tower thing.

632
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,503
- You light it up. We blow the guy sky high!
- Me?

633
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,630
- You! What?
- Dad?

634
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,840
So if the explosion doesn't kill us,
the avalanche will.

635
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,425
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah. l do.

636
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,385
l say we ambush him
with long-range rifles and silencers.

637
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,553
Long-range, that's a better idea.

638
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:18,721
Yeah, we can get in close, Dad.

639
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,931
- Much better idea.
- And then we can finish him off

640
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,641
- with Lin's dagger.
- Look, I’m sorry,

641
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,393
l just don't put much faith
in your girlfriend's magic dagger.

642
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,687
- Okay, Dad, she is not my girlfriend.
- You say that now,

643
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,856
- but l still don't trust her.
- Well, l do.

644
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,651
- So you should trust my judgment, okay?
- Look, kid,

645
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,402
I’ve put down more mummies
in my time than you.

646
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,904
You put down one mummy, Dad.

647
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,199
Yeah. Same mummy twice!

648
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,498
Hand me the green wire,
will you, please?

649
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,417
Are you sure you know what you are doing?

650
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,670
Of course. I’ve done this a hundred times.

651
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,340
lf the Emperor places the Eye up there,
all will be lost.

652
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,939
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.

653
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,526
Prove yourself to me.

654
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,458
Let's give a warm O'Connell welcome!

655
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,922
Fire!

656
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,312
Bazooka!

657
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,901
Fall back!

658
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,621
Alex! Follow me!

659
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,764
We gotta take out those bazookas!

660
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:27,975
Go!

661
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,443
Fall back!

662
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,029
Move! Move! Move! Move!

663
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,997
Time to go to plan B! Blow up the tower!

664
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,957
Hey, I’m actually a little bit concerned
about plan B!

665
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,459
Couldn't we go straight to plan C?

666
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,170
Just make it go bang! I’ll cover you!

667
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,631
Come on.

668
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,717
All right, let's go, go, go!
Come on, come on!

669
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:03,636
Come on. Oh, be good.

670
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,990
Set up a crossfire!

671
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:26,951
Move it!

672
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,002
My last round!

673
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:04,864
- Abominable snowmen?
- The Tibetans call them yeti!

674
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,411
Please! l need your help!

675
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,705
These soldiers are evil!

676
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,667
She speaks Yeti?

677
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,894
Shoot! Kill them!

678
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,571
Why do l always have to save the day?

679
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:47,531
l hate it when the kid's right!

680
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,412
Get the other guy!

681
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,581
Thanks!

682
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:22,274
Trouble!

683
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,358
You can die slow or you can die fast.

684
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,841
Yes! Yes! Yes!

685
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,678
Yeah! l did it!

686
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:37,683
Oh, Mother, l did it!
Time for a retreat, l think.

687
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:47,860
I’m on your team! I’m a team player!
"One for all and all for me" kind of thing!

688
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:52,364
The dynamite, all this dynamite!
We should get out of here!

689
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,715
Back off! Back off!

690
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,634
Run!

691
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,040
l hate mummies!
They never play fair!

692
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,425
Dad! Dad, what are you doing?

693
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:04,728
Over here! Over here! Come on! Over here!

694
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:06,897
Oh, no!

695
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,612
Rick!

696
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,976
Shangri-La.

697
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,445
That's a diamond.

698
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,490
l could use a diamond like that.

699
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:22,514
Dad!

700
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,940
Okay, hold it. Hold on there, Dad.

701
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,194
All right, please, please, please
put pressure on it, okay, Dad?

702
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:38,614
It’s all right, it's all right.
We've been in tougher scrapes than this.

703
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,789
Avalanche!

704
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,532
- Help! Help me!
- Lin!

705
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,080
Please! Help me!

706
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,206
Yes!

707
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,085
I’ve got it! And I’m still alive!

708
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,508
Help me, please.
Somebody help me!

709
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,095
- We're over here! Over here!
- Alex?

710
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,764
- Mom, Mom, we're down here!
- Alex?

711
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,558
We're over here!

712
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,238
Oh, God.

713
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:48,535
We've got to take him to Shangri-La now!
It’s our only chance.

714
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,473
We made it!

715
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:28,784
The Pool.

716
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,046
Mother.

717
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:43,590
My sweet daughter.

718
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,558
l beg you...

719
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,187
My father is dying.

720
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,939
They are my friends.

721
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,316
Oh, please.

722
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,021
Thank you.

723
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,483
He must rest. We'll take him to my chamber.

724
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:05,005
Where are you going, General?
Our destiny awaits.

725
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:14,890
Well, it's not everyone that gets
their brother-in-law back from the dead.

726
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,852
Yeah, give me my four score years
and ten any day.

727
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,734
Is this Shangri-La?

728
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:38,538
l could live here. Lots of opportunity.

729
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,000
A casino.

730
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:50,258
l was wrong to involve you in my revenge.

731
01:13:50,802 --> 01:13:52,302
No, mother.

732
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,555
l would do anything for you.

733
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,234
He's resting well. Thank you.

734
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,404
How'd you get involved in all this?

735
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:16,535
The Emperor murdered the only man
l ever loved, Lin's father.

736
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:20,872
l would have died, too, by his hand,

737
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:24,876
if the yeti had not found me
and brought me to this pool.

738
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:28,046
Hang on a second.
How did this all happen?

739
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,090
This was before Christ.

740
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:35,846
How long were you guarding his tomb?

741
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,597
Over 2,000 years.

742
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:46,064
The Emperor must never be
allowed to reach the Pool,

743
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:49,067
or he will have the power to raise his army.

744
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:50,777
And once he becomes immortal,

745
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:54,906
he can transform himself into
the most hideous creatures ever seen.

746
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,951
l will take the first watch at the entrance.

747
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:08,211
You know, l have no problem
dating an older woman.

748
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,425
I’m afraid we can't be together.

749
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,928
Wait. What? Why?

750
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:21,183
Because I’m going to live forever.

751
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,269
l don't want to watch you die.

752
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,063
So what? That's it?

753
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:31,067
You're just gonna sit
on the sidelines for eternity?

754
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:34,237
My mother has mourned
my father for centuries.

755
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:37,532
l don't know if my heart can bear it.

756
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:45,373
People can live an entire lifetime
in one look.

757
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:50,086
l watch my parents do it every day.

758
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:54,341
Alex?

759
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,303
Your father's awake. Get up here!

760
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,400
Hello.

761
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,448
lf this is heaven, it looks pretty good so far.

762
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:29,251
Nice to see some things never change.

763
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,854
Go easy on him. He feels terrible.

764
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:58,029
When l saw you lying there, Dad...

765
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:01,241
I’ve never been so scared in my life.

766
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,078
Well, that makes two of us.

767
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:09,082
l mean, you know,
you're not supposed to die, you know?

768
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,209
You're Ricochet O'Connell, right?

769
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:14,546
You get beat up, you get tossed around,

770
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,257
but, well, you're always standing there
in the end.

771
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:20,552
l never really thought of
the world without you.

772
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,682
Alex,

773
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,394
the truth is,

774
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,606
I’m just trying to...

775
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,652
I’m just...

776
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:38,945
I’m trying to be a good husband.

777
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,405
I’m trying to be a good parent.

778
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:44,075
And the truth is,
I’ve been dropping the ball lately, and...

779
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,120
No, you know, l haven't been
the world's greatest son, you know?

780
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:51,249
No, no, that's 'cause you get it
from her side of the family.

781
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:52,751
Come here.

782
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:57,756
My boys.

783
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:05,138
You look tired, you should rest.

784
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,307
I’ll stay.

785
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:10,643
Fate is about to deal its final hand.

786
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,271
lf we are to defeat the Emperor...

787
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:17,192
l must ask for one more sacrifice.

788
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,860
Anything, mother.

789
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,864
Your immortality.

790
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,462
Oh, no! His powers have been fully restored!

791
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,880
Time to go.

792
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,864
General Ming's daughter.

793
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,034
Your child will be mine.

794
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:18,837
He is immortal.

795
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,785
Hey! You three-headed shape-shifting
son of a bitch!

796
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:02,547
Lin!

797
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:14,767
Alex!

798
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:19,481
Alex!

799
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,867
He's taking her back to his tomb
to raise his army!

800
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:34,078
- Is there a faster way down from here?
- The yeti. They'll help.

801
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,247
But he's already in the air. it’ll be too late!

802
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:40,502
Mad Dog can outfly a three-headed lizard
any day of the week! Let's go.

803
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:47,800
Portside! Nine o'clock!

804
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,685
Rick? Should l quit drinking?

805
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:04,609
Jonathan to Rick.

806
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,694
You'd better get a move on if
you're gonna beat him to the tomb!

807
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:09,489
Yeah, yeah, just get back here as fast
as you can with the reinforcements.

808
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:11,324
No sightseeing!

809
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,620
Here, Dad.

810
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:16,746
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

811
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,997
Nice.

812
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,794
The Terracotta Army is not indestructible
until it crosses the Great Wall.

813
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:26,256
That's comforting. How exactly are we
supposed to fend them off?

814
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,590
When the Emperor built the Wall,

815
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,050
he buried his enemies underneath it

816
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,553
and cursed their souls
to hold it up for eternity.

817
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:36,558
Most of them were conquered soldiers.
l will call them to battle once again.

818
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:42,146
Unlock an altar, raise an army.
That sounds like a plan. Let's go.

819
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:10,300
Grab her.

820
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,677
Guard her with your life.

821
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:17,015
Alex?

822
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:21,853
- Where'd he go?
- Where do you think?

823
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,247
AWAKE!

824
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,637
Today you awake to a world...

825
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,724
in the grip of chaos and corruption.

826
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:24,892
Open the gates of the past

827
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,520
and free the souls
of the wrongfully damned.

828
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:30,148
l will restore order...

829
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,151
l will retake what is mine.

830
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:36,487
l will crush any idea of freedom.

831
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:39,699
In the name of the ancestors
and the righteous,

832
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:43,161
l sacrifice my immortality
and that of my daughter

833
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:45,163
so that you may rise this day!

834
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,165
l will slaughter without mercy.

835
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,001
l will conquer without compassion.

836
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,670
l will now lead you past the Great Wall.

837
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:56,632
Once you cross, you will be indestructible.

838
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:02,722
Bring down the wrath of the oppressed
on this Emperor and all who follow him!

839
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,349
l raised you for one purpose...

840
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,394
to enforce my will on the entire world!

841
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,521
Long live the Emperor!

842
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,486
l call upon the hundreds and the thousands

843
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:21,449
that you may rise up and seize this moment
to take your victory,

844
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:25,369
to take your justice
and to take your revenge!

845
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,890
Zi Yuan.

846
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,898
It’s General Ming!

847
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,942
Follow General Ming!

848
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,407
Prepare for battle!

849
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:15,586
These are...
They're good undead guys, right?

850
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:19,173
Oh, no, no, no!

851
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:21,551
Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan sent us!

852
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:25,888
- Darling, l don't think he speaks English.
- We're with Zi Yuan!

853
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:27,265
Zi Yuan?

854
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,100
Right.

855
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,061
Let's go.

856
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:34,397
To battle!

857
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,088
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

858
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,467
Archers form up!

859
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:08,973
incoming!

860
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:26,365
- Hey! That's my favorite blue shirt.
- I’ve always hated that shirt.

861
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:44,258
Death to General Ming!

862
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,680
Charge!

863
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,026
Welcome to the 20th century!

864
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,295
We can't let them cross the wall!

865
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:49,467
You are no longer immortal.

866
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,177
Honey! Fall back to higher ground!

867
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,186
l really hate mummies!

868
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,605
It seems the feeling's mutual!

869
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,528
Shut up, clay boy! Fore!

870
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:52,279
Run!

871
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,794
- Catch!
- Got it!

872
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,217
Next time l say, "We've been in tougher
scrapes than this," l mean this!

873
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:42,204
Die, you mummy bastards! Die!

874
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:45,332
There is no call for bad language!

875
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:50,838
Jonathan certainly knows
how to make an entrance!

876
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,241
Any regrets, darling?

877
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:23,329
None. Not ever.

878
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:35,674
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

879
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:38,260
We had it completely under control.

880
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,807
This guy ever run out of tricks?

881
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:49,521
No!

882
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:58,239
Mother! No!

883
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,368
Mother!

884
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,583
Mother! Mother!

885
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,887
Pierce through his heart.

886
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:29,228
You must live and fight on.

887
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:51,208
She said through the heart.

888
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:53,836
Through the heart. Let's go.

889
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:08,809
Get in!

890
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:12,396
The O'Connells are going to
stop the Emperor!

891
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:26,452
So, Dad, what's the plan?

892
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:28,037
Divide and conquer!

893
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:31,206
No offense,
but isn't that a little short on detail?

894
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,418
- Twelve o'clock low!
- Hang on!

895
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,094
Remember our deal!

896
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:46,805
When this is over,
my men get to drink for free!

897
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:49,808
You can have the whole damn bar
for all l care!

898
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:52,603
I’m getting the hell out of China.

899
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:26,887
l dug you up...

900
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:30,265
and I’m gonna put you down.

901
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,341
Alex? Alex!

902
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:05,402
Let go!

903
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,570
Never!

904
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:13,452
Enough tricks! Where's your honor?

905
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:18,290
Fight like a man!

906
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:58,705
Divide

907
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,750
and conquer.

908
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:51,258
Now you can rule in hell.

909
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,369
The Emperor is dead.

910
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:21,330
The Emperor is dead!

911
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:12,381
- Evening, girls. You're looking well.
- Good evening, Mr. Maguire.

912
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:17,052
- It’s a fine night to be me.
- You dance great for an old lady.

913
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:20,138
Someone told me to stop living
on the sidelines.

914
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:23,266
- Well, he sounds like a smart guy.
- He is.

915
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,782
So l guess Dash and Scarlet
have their next adventure?

916
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:41,743
Why write about it when you can live it?

917
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,082
There's something incredibly romantic
about vanquishing the undead.

918
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:50,502
Even more romantic doing it with you.

919
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:54,131
- Kiss me.
- Don't have to ask me twice.

920
01:41:03,266 --> 01:41:04,933
- Can l get your bag, sir?
- No, no, no.

921
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:07,018
Don't touch it, don't touch it.

922
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:08,145
Where are you off to, Mr. Carnahan?

923
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,605
Someplace where they don't have mummies.

924
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:13,525
- Step on it! I’ve got a plane to catch.
- Yes, sir.

925
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:17,279
Yeah. Ciao, ciao, Shanghai.

926
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:19,531
Peru, here l come.

927
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:26,997
Soon after, mummies were found in Peru.
