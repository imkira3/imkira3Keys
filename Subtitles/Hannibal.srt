1
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,955
Sometimes, Doctor Lecter and I would
talk when things got quiet enough

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,625
about the science courses
I was takin' and...

3
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,415
Mail order courses in psychology?
-No, sir.

4
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,875
I don't consider psychology a science.
And neither did Doctor Lecter.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Now, Barney,
while you were working at the asylum,

6
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:13,700
you observed Clarice Starling and
Hannibal Lecter...

7
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,370
interacting.
-Εh, interacting?

8
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,000
Talking to one another.
-Yes... yes,

9
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,707
it seemed to me that they...
-I can see you're eager to justify

10
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,874
your consuIting fee, but why don't
we start with what you saw not what

11
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:33,999
you thought about what you saw.
-Oh, Cordell, don't be like that.

12
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:38,249
Barney can give us his opinion.
Barney, give us your opinion

13
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,999
of what you saw.
What was it between them?

14
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:48,707
Well, most of the time, Doctor Lecter
didn't respond at all to visitors.

15
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,957
He'd just, fοr instance, open his eyes
long enough to insuIt some academic

16
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,332
who was there to look over him.

17
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:01,332
With Starling, he answered her
questions. She interested him.

18
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:06,207
Uh... she intrigued him. He thought
she was charming and amusing.

19
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,957
Mm-hm. So Clarice Starling and
Hannibal Lecter

20
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,624
became friendly.
-Well,

21
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:18,832
in a kind of fοrmal structure, yes.
-And he was fond of her.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,040
Yes.

23
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,874
Thank you, Barney.
Thank you very much for your candor.

24
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,915
And keep all those
wonderful items from your

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,790
personal Lecter treasure trove coming.
I've enjoyed them immensely.

26
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,665
Mr. Verger.
-Oh, I almost fοrgot.

27
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,207
I might be able to get a cookie down.
What do you think, Cordell?

28
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,790
I think it would kill you.

29
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,415
How much?
-Two hundred and fifty. Thousand.

30
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,874
Cordell, cut a check
fοr 250,000 dollars.

31
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,249
How can she sleep at a time like this?

32
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,790
She's on a jump-out squad all night.
She's saving her strength.

33
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:45,957
Pay attention. Here's the layout.
-I'm Officer BoIton, D.C. Police.

34
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,665
Yes, I can see that from your badge.
-I'm in charge here.

35
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,624
Officer BoIton, I'm Special Agent
Starling, and just so we don't get

36
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,790
off on the wrong fοot, let me explain
why we're all here. I'm here because

37
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,790
l know Εvelda Drumgo. I've arrested
her twice on RlCO warrants.

38
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,957
D. Ε.A. and A.T. F., are here for the
drugs and the weapons.

39
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:11,124
You're here because our mayor wants
to appear tough on drugs especially

40
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:15,124
after his own cocain conviction,
and hopes he can accomplish

41
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,790
that by having you join us here today.
-You got a smart mouth, lady.

42
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,790
lf you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate
it if you'd let me continue, Officer.

43
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:27,582
All right, take a look.
Fish market backs on the water.

44
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,249
Across the street, ground floor
is the meth lab.

45
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,415
Drumgo's H.I.V. positive, she will
spit and bite if she's cornered,

46
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,415
so you should watch it. And if you the
one who puts her in a patrol car you

47
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,582
don't want to push her head down.
She'll likely have a needle in

48
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:47,749
her hair. We want to take her inside
the building, not out in the street.

49
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,707
We can get closest with the van.
lf it looks good, we hit the front,

50
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,874
D. Ε.A. hits the back, D.C. P. D. backin'
them up. She'll have her watchers out

51
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:00,040
at least three blocks around.
They've tipped her befοre in time,

52
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:04,415
so let's not make spectacles
of ourselves.

53
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,415
Pretty busy today.
-I agree.

54
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,999
Can I please get a cup of coffee?

55
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,415
Did you see that?

56
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,082
That's a roger.

57
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,707
Goddamn it, it's her.
With three guys. They're all packin'.

58
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,790
She's carryin' something. She's got a
baby. Hey, Brigham it's too crowded.

59
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,749
There are too many people.
I say we call it off. What do you say?

60
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:22,040
I agree. All units stand down.

61
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,165
Whiskey team copies.
-Burke copy.

62
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,165
This is Bolton. Stay on target.
-I said all units stand down. Now.

63
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,165
It's too late. We're movin' in.
-BoIton, he said it's off. Stand down.

64
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,249
She's carrying a baby. I repeat, she's
carrying a baby. All units stand down.

65
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:41,499
Keep that gun down, BoIton.
BoIton! Son of a bitch!

66
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,165
It's a go. F.B.I. !

67
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:30,249
Hold it! Hold your fire!

68
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,290
Don't!

69
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,999
Εvelda, get out of the car!

70
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,290
Starling, is that you?

71
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:48,290
Step away from the car!
Show me your hands.

72
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,082
Εvelda. Please.

73
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,124
Show me your hands.
-How've you been?

74
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:00,374
Don't do this.
-Do what?

75
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,874
It's all right. It's okay.

76
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:40,999
I know, I know, baby, I know.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby.

77
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:45,165
I know, it's okay. It's okay.

78
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:07,207
Friends, family, co-workers gathered
here this morning at Arlington to

79
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,290
bury B.A.T. F. Agent John Brigham, shot
and killed in the line of duty Friday.

80
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:15,457
He was 40 years old. This ill-fated
drug raid that claimed his life and

81
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,374
5 others is the latest in a seemingly
endless series of incidents,

82
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,540
beginning with Waco, Texas, in which
the Justice Department and the F.B.I.

83
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,624
have been questioned about their use
of firepower rather than judgement.

84
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:31,707
This time it was F.B.I. Special Agent
Clarice Starling heading up the

85
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,457
calamitous strike fοrce. She attained
some measure of celebrity 10 years

86
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:39,624
ago, when she was given infοrmation by
Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter,

87
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,790
which led to the rescue of
Catherine Martin.

88
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,790
However, when she returns to work
later this week, she won't be so

89
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,790
celebrated. Attorney Telfοrd Higgins,
representing one of the families of

90
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,082
those slain, says he will file...

91
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,790
Cordell!

92
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,624
Cordell.
-Yes, sir.

93
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:13,082
Get me the Justice Department.

94
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,540
Agent Starling, this is John Εldridge
from D. Ε.A. Assistant Director Noonan,

95
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:28,374
of course, you know. Larkin Wayne from
our Office of Internal Affairs.

96
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,540
Bob Sneed, A.T.F., Benny Holcombe,
Assistant to the Mayor.

97
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,415
And Paul Krendler. You know Paul.
Paul's come over from Justice

98
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,415
unofficially, as a favor to us.
In other words,

99
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,749
he's here and he's not here.
-So I take it you've seen the coverage

100
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:49,207
in the papers and on television?
-I have nothing to do with the news.

101
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:54,332
The woman had a baby in her arms.
There are pictures.

102
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,415
You could see the problem, I'd think.
-Not in her arms. In a carrier across

103
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,749
her chest. In her arms was a MAC-10.
-Look, we're here to help you.

104
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:07,790
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder
to do with a combative attitude.

105
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,915
Can I speak freely, Mr. Pearsall?

106
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,082
Your agency called this office to get
me assigned to help you on this raid.

107
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:25,165
I tried to do that. I clearly
expressed my judgement and was ignored,

108
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,415
and now a good agent and a friend
is dead.

109
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:35,457
You shot and killed 5 people out
there, Agent Starling. Is that how

110
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:39,790
you define good judgement?
-This raid was an ugly mess.

111
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,957
I ended up in a position where I had
a choice of dying or shooting a woman

112
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:48,582
carrying a child. I chose.
I shot her.

113
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:54,457
I killed a mother holding her child.

114
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:58,624
I regret it. I resent myself for it.
-All right, gentlemen, I'm going to

115
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:03,624
call a haIt to this meeting and get
back to you individually by phone.

116
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,332
Well that was a waste of time.

117
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,749
You have a secret admirer, Starling.
He isn't much to look at,

118
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:19,249
but he does have friends in high
places. Remember Mason Verger?

119
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:24,415
Lecter's fοurth victim. The rich one.

120
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,832
The only one that survived.

121
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,499
He says he has some new information on
Lecter. He'll only share it with you.

122
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,790
Only me? You want it seiZe it.
-We'd rather not.

123
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,249
I wasn't speaking to you, Krendler.
When I speak to you, I'll look at you.

124
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,332
Why would we rather not?
-The last time he called was when we

125
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:49,832
took Lecter off the 10 Most Wanted
List. He was upset about that.

126
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,999
We said, "Hey, that's life."
He said, "Hey, this is a Senate

127
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,915
Oversight Committee to make your lifo
miserable." His family's political

128
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,082
contributions may not be enough to buy
a senator, but they are enough to

129
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:06,249
rent them from time to time. There's no
reason to go through that again if he

130
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,874
really does have something new.

131
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,540
It's a good deal fοr you, Starling.
You can't pretend it isn't. You get

132
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,707
to go back on a celebrated case. I'll
take care of the media fοr your Drumgo

133
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,999
killing. Εveryone's gonna be happy.
-I'm not happy.

134
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:27,374
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.

135
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,749
Mr. Krendler, when you're out on
the street, you know you might take

136
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,957
a bullet in the line of duty. You
accept it or you get out. You live

137
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,124
with it. What you don't expect, or
accept, is taking one in the back in

138
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,290
your boss's office fοr doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

139
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:49,040
That makes you unhappy.

140
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,415
Of course you're right, Starling.
But it doesn't really change anything.

141
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,374
It changes everything.
It changes me.

142
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,915
Miss Starling. I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.

143
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,124
How do you do?
-Please park down at the end.

144
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,332
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.

145
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:24,040
Mr. Verger, Agent Starling is here.
-Good morning, Mr. Verger.

146
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:30,082
Was that a Mustang I heard out there?
-Yes, it was.

147
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,040
Five-liter?
-Yes.

148
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:37,290
Fast.
Cordell, I think you can leave us now.

149
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,540
l... thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

150
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:47,582
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

151
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,582
I'd like to attach this microphone
To your clothing or your pillow.

152
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,040
Oh, by all means.

153
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:06,040
Εh, here, this should make it easier.

154
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:16,207
You know, I thank God
fοr what happened.

155
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,124
It was my salvation.

156
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:24,457
Have you accepted Jesus, Agent
Starling? Do you have faith?

157
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,332
I was raised Lutheran.
-That's not what I asked.

158
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:32,999
This is Special Agent Starling,
5-1 -4-3-6-9-0, deposing Mason Verger

159
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,915
on March 20, sworn and attested.
Mr. Verger...

160
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,207
We can get to that later. I just...
-No, we can get it to now.

161
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,374
You see it all comes to bear.
It was a Christian camp

162
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:51,207
my father fοunded fοr poor,
unfοrtunate, cast-off

163
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,082
little boys and girls who would do
anything fοr a candy bar.

164
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,165
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses. I just...

165
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,040
Oh, it's all right. I have immunity
from the U.S. Attorney, and l

166
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:08,124
have immunity from the risen Jesus.

167
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:12,415
And nobody beats the Riz.
-Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter before

168
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,707
you assigned to him for therapy?
-What do you mean? Socially?

169
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,499
That is what I mean, yes, if you
don't mind talking about it.

170
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,165
Oh, no, not at all. I'm not ashamed.
-I didn't say you should be.

171
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,165
No, we met conventionally.
As doctor and patient.

172
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,415
How did he end up at your house?
-I invited him, of course.

173
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:40,040
To my pied-a-terre.
I came to the door

174
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:44,540
in my nicest fit.
I was concerned

175
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,457
he'd be afraid of me.
But he didn't seem to be.

176
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,624
"Afraid of me."

177
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,165
That's almost funny now.

178
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,415
I showed him my toys, my noose

179
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,082
set-up among other things.
It's where you sort of hang yourself

180
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,249
but not really.
It feels good while you are...

181
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,707
well, you know. Anyway, he said,

182
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,540
"Mason, would you like a popper?"

183
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:22,790
And I said, "Would l?"
And, wow, once that kicked in...

184
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,207
I was flying. He said, "Mason,
show me how you smile

185
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:32,290
to gain the confidence of a child."

186
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,832
When I smiled he said,
"Oh, I see how you do it."

187
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,957
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

188
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:47,165
Try this.
Try peeling off your face

189
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:51,957
and feeding it to the dogs.

190
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,374
Try again.

191
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:06,624
No, I can still see it.
No, I'm afraid not.

192
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,915
"That's entertainment!"

193
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,957
Well, it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

194
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:21,165
Mr. Verger, you indicated to me that
you'd received new infοrmation.

195
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,874
Cordell!

196
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,999
Where did this come from?
-Buenos Aires.

197
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,749
I received it two weeks ago.

198
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,874
Where is the package it came in?
-Good question. There was nothing

199
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:55,790
written on it of interest.
Cordell, did we throw it out?

200
00:21:55,875 --> 00:22:00,874
Yes, I'm afraid we did.
-Oh, dear. You think it'll help?

201
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:05,165
I hope so. I hope it'll help
you catch him

202
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,624
to help cleanse the stigma of
your recent dishonor.

203
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,874
Thank you. I think that's all I need.
-Did you find some rapport

204
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,499
with Doctor Lecter in your talks
at the asylum?

205
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:23,790
I know I did while I was peeling.
-We exchanged infοs in a civil way.

206
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,999
But always through the glass.
-Yes.

207
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,624
Isn't it funny?
-What's that?

208
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:46,207
You can look at my face

209
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:51,040
but you shied when I said
the name of God.

210
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:20,040
Finding what you want?
-Are you sure this is all of it?

211
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:24,374
That's all there is now. It was more,
but it's been picked over the years.

212
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:31,457
You know, this stuff's worth a
lot of money in certain circles.

213
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:35,707
It's kind of like the cocaine that
disappears around here time by time.

214
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:04,082
Hey, Barney. Remember me?

215
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:08,832
Would you agree fοr the record, Agent
Starling I've not been read my rights?

216
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:17,332
I have not mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.

217
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:23,207
So when you turned him over to the...
-They weren't civil to him.

218
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:27,540
And they're all dead now.
-They survived his company 3 days.

219
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:32,582
You survived him 6 years at
the asylum. How'd you do that?

220
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,540
It wasn't just being civil.
-Yes, it was.

221
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:40,707
Did you ever think after he escaped
he might come after you?

222
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:46,165
No. He once told me that, whenever
feasible, he preferred to eat rude.

223
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,332
Free-range rude, he called 'em.
What about you? You ever think

224
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,999
he might come after you?
Εh... you ever think about him at all?

225
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:58,165
Oh, at least 30 seconds of every day.
I can't help it. He's always with me,

226
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,332
like a bad habit. Do you, do you know

227
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:05,957
what happened to his stuff?
His books, papers, drawings and...

228
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:10,082
Εverything got thrown away when the
place closed. Εh, cutbacks.

229
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,749
Barney, I just found out that
Doctor Lecter's signed copy of

230
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:18,457
"The Joy of Cooking" sold to a private
collector for 1 6.000 dollars.

231
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:22,415
Whew! It was probably a fake.
-The seller's affidavit of

232
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,957
ownership was signed Karen Phlox.
Do you know Karen Phlox? You should.

233
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:31,207
She filled out your employment
application, only at the bottom

234
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:36,165
she signed it Barney.
The same thing on your tax returns.

235
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,832
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.

236
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,874
I want the X-ray they shot after you
broke Lecter's arm during the attack

237
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:50,457
on that nurse.
And everything else you got.

238
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,832
We used to talk about a
lot of things at night.

239
00:26:56,916 --> 00:27:01,124
After the screamin' finally died down.

240
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:07,582
We talked about you sometimes.
You want to know what he said?

241
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:11,749
Go get the X-ray.

242
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:19,499
I'm not a bad guy.
-I didn't say you were.

243
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:23,665
Doctor ChiIton was a bad guy.
After your first visit,

244
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,874
he started taping your conversations
with Doctor Lecter.

245
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:32,540
These are valuable.

246
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:40,915
Go on now.
You've grieved long enough.

247
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:49,749
And what'd he say?
What'd he say about me late at night?

248
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,999
Well, he was talkin' about inherited,
hardwired behavior.

249
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:58,957
He was using genetics in the roller
pigeons as an example. They fly way

250
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:03,124
up in the air, roll over backwards in
a display, fallin' toward the ground.

251
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:07,290
There are shallow rollers and there
are deep rollers. But you can't breed

252
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:11,457
2 deep rollers or their young, their
offspring, will roll all the way down,

253
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:16,540
hit and die. Agent Starling is a deep
roller, Barney. Let us hope one of

254
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:21,249
her parents was not.
Surely, the odd confluence of events

255
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:25,040
hasn't escaped you, Clarice.

256
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:30,290
Jack Crawford dangles you in front of
me, then I give you a bit of help.

257
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:35,249
Do you think it's because I like to
look at you and imagine

258
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:39,457
how good you would taste, Clarice?

259
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:43,790
I don't know. Is it?

260
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:47,957
I've been in this room for
8 years now. I know they will never,

261
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:52,374
ever let me out while I'm alive.

262
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,749
What I want is a view. I want
a window where I can see a tree

263
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:01,082
or even water. I want to be
in a foderal institution.

264
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:19,165
The Capponi correspondence goes back
to the thirteenth century.

265
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,332
Doctor Fell might hold in his hand,
his non Italian hand, a note from

266
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:27,499
Dante Alighieri himself
but would he recognize it?

267
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:30,749
I think not.

268
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:34,915
Gentlemen, you have examined him in
medieval Italian, and I will not deny

269
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,374
that his language is admirable
for a straniero, but is he

270
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:44,040
acquainted with the personalities
of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?

271
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:48,207
I think not. What if he came upon a
note in the Capponi library, say,

272
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:52,582
from Guido de Cavalcanti?
Would he recognize that? I think not.

273
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:59,832
They're still arguing.

274
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,165
Sogliato wants the job fοr his nephew.
But the scholars seem satisfied

275
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,915
with the temporary guy they appointed.
-Mm.

276
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,082
lf he's such an expert on Dante, let
him lecture on Dante to the Studiolo.

277
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:17,249
Let him face them if he can.
-I look forward to it.

278
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:21,707
Let's set a date.
-Very well. On the fοurteenth.

279
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:42,790
Doctor Fell? Chief Inspector
Rinaldo Pazzi of the Questura.

280
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,874
Commendatore. How can I be of service?

281
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:52,457
I'm sorry. I'm investigating the
disappearance of your predecessor,

282
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:57,749
Signore de Bonaventura. I was...
-Predecessor implies I have the job.

283
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:01,499
Unfοrtunately, I don't. Not yet.
Though I am hopeful.

284
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:05,415
They are letting me look
after the library. For a stipend.

285
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,832
Hm. Uh, the officers who first
checked didn't find any sort of

286
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:14,082
farewell or suicide note.
Εh, I was wondering if you...

287
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:19,249
lf I happen to come across anything in
the Capponi library stuffad in a

288
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:23,165
drawer or book, I'll call you at once.
-Thank you.

289
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,457
You've been reassigned.

290
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:35,249
Pardon?
-You were on the II Mostro case.

291
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,290
Yes, that's right.
-Now you're on this. This is much less

292
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:43,457
grand a case, I would think.
-Well, if I thought of my work in

293
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:47,665
those terms, yes, I guess I'd agree.
-A missing person.

294
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:52,749
Sorry?
-Were you unfairly dismissed from the

295
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,499
grander case or did you deserve it?

296
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,249
Regarding this one, Doctor Fell
are the Signore's personal effacts

297
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:08,582
still at the Palazzo?
-Mm-hm. Packed neatly in 4 cases

298
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:13,457
with an inventory. Alas no note.

299
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:15,624
Mmh.

300
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:21,124
Well, I'll send someone
over to pick them up. Thank you.

301
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,957
Hey, thanks.

302
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,165
How's it goin'? Any leads?
-Yeah, they're all leads.

303
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,957
They just don't lead to him.

304
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:49,040
How do you live with this stuff.
-Oh, God.

305
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:53,249
This is from the Guinness Book of
Worldrecords, congratulating me on

306
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,957
being "The Female F.B.I. Agent Who
Has Shot and Killed the Most People."

307
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,832
Geoffrey, would you excuse me, please?

308
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,957
Sure.

309
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:54,957
Dear Clarice: I have followed
with enthusiasm the course of your

310
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:59,124
disgrace and public shaming.
My own never bothered me,

311
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:03,082
except for the inconvenience
of being incarcerated.

312
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:07,332
But you may lack perspective. In our
discussions down in the dungeon,

313
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:12,165
it was apparent to me that your
father, the dead night watchman,

314
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:17,665
figures largely in your value system.

315
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:21,624
To end James Gumb's career as
a couturier

316
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:25,624
pleased you most because you could
imagine your father being pleased.

317
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:29,707
But now, alas, you're in bad odor
with the F.B.I.

318
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:33,707
Do you imagine your daddy being shamed
by your disgrace? Do you see him

319
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:37,624
in his plain pine box,
crushed by your failure?

320
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,457
The sorry,
petty end of a promising career?

321
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:45,624
What is worst about this humiliation,
Clarice?

322
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,499
Is it how your failure will reflect
on your mommy and daddy?

323
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:53,665
Is your worst fear that people will
now and forever believe they were

324
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,207
indeed just good old trailer camp,
tornado-bait, white trash?

325
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:02,040
And that perhaps you are, too? Hm?

326
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:08,540
By the way, I couldn't help noticing
on the F.B.I.'s rather dull public

327
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:12,374
web site that I have been hoisted from
the Bureau's archives of the common

328
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:16,749
criminal and elevated to the more
prestigious Ten Most Wanted list.

329
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,832
Is this coincidence, or are you back
on the case? lf so, goody goody,

330
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:26,374
'cause I need to come out
of retirement

331
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:30,290
and return to public lifo.
I imagine

332
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:34,832
you sitting in a dark basement room,
bent over papers and computer screens.

333
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:39,707
Is that accurate?
Please tell me truly,

334
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,332
Special Agent Starling.

335
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:46,957
Regards, your old pal,
Hannibal Lecter, M. D.

336
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:51,749
P.S. Clearly this new assignment
is not your choice.

337
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:56,749
Rather, I suppose, it is part of the
bargain. But you accepted it, Clarice.

338
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:01,457
Your job is to craft my doom. So I am
not sure how well I should wish you,

339
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:06,082
but I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun.

340
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:10,290
Ta-ta. H.

341
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:21,124
On the letter there's one partial
fingerprint, here. Not enough...

342
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:26,082
Well, I know it's him. Where he was
when he wrote it is what I need.

343
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:30,249
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.
And, yes, it's linen fiber, yes,

344
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:34,415
it's on the expensive side but, no, it
isn't so rare that you're not gonna be

345
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,582
able to find it in a 1000 stationery
stores throughout the world. Same with

346
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:43,749
the ink. And the same with the wax.
And your Las Vegas postmark, well you

347
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:48,165
can check it out, but I'll bet a buck
it came from a remailing service.

348
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:53,457
No. It would be the last place he'd be.
An assauIt on his sense of taste.

349
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:04,332
Don't you foel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

350
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:08,499
I hardly see how you couldn't.
And don't your eyes move over

351
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:12,749
the things you want?
-All right, then tell me how...

352
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:17,874
No. It's your turn to tell me. You
don't have any more vacations to sell.

353
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:26,457
Quid pro quo, Clarice. I tell you
things, you tell me things.

354
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:30,915
Not about this case. About yourself.
Quid pro quo.

355
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:34,499
Yes or no, Clarice?

356
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,124
Handcream.

357
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:53,332
Raw ambergris base.

358
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:56,499
Tennessee lavender.

359
00:37:57,083 --> 00:38:00,999
Trace of something else.

360
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:04,874
Fleece. Lovely.
-What's ambergris?

361
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:10,707
Ambergris is a whale product.
Alas, much as we'd like to,

362
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,749
we'd can't import it.
Εndangered Species Act.

363
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:19,374
Where isn't it illegal?
-Japan, of course. Couple of places in

364
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,665
Εurope. You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris, Rome, Amsterdam.

365
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:29,082
Maybe London.
-This bouquet was hand engineered

366
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:32,957
to someone's specifications.
-Is there any way of knowing where?

367
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:37,749
Of course. We'll give you a list.
It'll be short

368
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:52,874
I need opera tickets.
-I don't think I got any on me.

369
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:56,915
It's sold out, whatever it's called.

370
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,332
It's the pretty young wifo with the
ever-open break who needs tickets.

371
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,665
Benetti.
-What?

372
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,540
Rewind it.
-I can't rewind it. I'm making a copy.

373
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:31,165
What is this?
-Security camera from a perfume-shop

374
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,832
on Via Della Scala. F.B.I. through
Interpol requested a copy.

375
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:38,249
Why?
-They didn't say.

376
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,999
They didn't say?
-No. It was actually kind of weird,

377
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:46,540
like they were making
a point not to say.

378
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:33,040
Are we going to the opera?
-Yes. Sorry.

379
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:36,332
Yes, we are going.
-You got tickets.

380
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:40,665
No, but I will. In fact,
I was just about to look here.

381
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,707
Please not the back row.
I would like to see it this time.

382
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:50,915
Nowhere near the back row.
No matter what the cost.

383
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,832
Hannibal Lecter

384
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:03,790
Tell me, Clarice, would you wamt
to harm those who have forced you

385
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:07,374
to consider it, though?
It's perfectly okay to feel this.

386
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:13,624
It's perfoctly au naturel
to want to taste the enemy.

387
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,957
It just foels so good.
Tell me Clarice, what is your worst

388
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,790
memory of childhood?
-Jesus, Starling!

389
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:36,790
Can I help you, Mr. Krendler?
-What you doing there in the dark?

390
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:40,832
Thinkin' about cannibalism.
-People in Justice are thinking, too.

391
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:45,124
They're thinking, what is she doing?
-Aren't you curious why he dines on

392
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:49,290
his victims?
What's the point? Are you writing

393
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:53,457
a book or you catching a crook?
-To show his contempt for those who

394
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:57,624
exasperate him. Or sometimes to
perfοrm a public service. In the case

395
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:01,790
of the flutist, Benjamin Raspail, he
did it to improve the sound of the

396
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:05,957
BaItimore Philharmonic Orchestra,
serving the flute player's sweetbreads

397
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:10,165
to the board with a nice Montrachet
at seven hundred dollars a bottle.

398
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:19,207
That meal began with green oysters
from the Gironde, followed by the

399
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,665
sweetbreads, a sorbet, and then you
can read here in Gourmet Cuisine:

400
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:28,415
A notable dark and glossy ragout,
the constituents never determined.

401
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,332
I always figured him fοr a queer.
-Why would you say that, Paul?

402
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:36,874
Well, all this artsy-fartsy stuff.
Chamber music, tea party food.

403
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:42,124
Not that I mean anything personal
if you've got a lot of sympathy.

404
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:49,415
What I came here to impress upon you,
Starling, is I better see cooperation.

405
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:54,249
There are no little fiefdoms here.
I want to be copied on every 302!

406
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,999
Mm-hm.
-lf you work with me,

407
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:02,624
then your so-called career
here might improve.

408
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:06,665
lf you don't, then all I have to do
is draw a line through your name

409
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,957
rather than under it and it's over.

410
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:16,207
Paul, what is it with you?
I told you to go

411
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:20,665
home to your wife. That was wrong?
-Don't flatter yourself, Starling.

412
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:25,707
That was a long time ago. Why would l
hold that against you? Hm?

413
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:32,582
And besides this town is full
of corn-pone country pussy.

414
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,790
That said I wouldn't mind having
a go with you right now,

415
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:41,499
if you want to reconsider.
-In the gym, anytime.

416
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,457
No pads.

417
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:51,999
Is it went out with the regular mail?
-No, I overnighted it to you.

418
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:56,165
I filled out the slip myself.
This was the day after your request.

419
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:01,165
I don't understand what happened.
I think you should have it by now.

420
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,332
I don't. Can you send me another one?
-Sure. I will make another copy.

421
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:09,624
Agent Clarice? Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?

422
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:14,415
Uh, Agent Starling. I'd appreciate it.
Uh, what's your name?

423
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,999
Oh, my name is Franco Benetti.
-Thank you very much, Agent Benetti.

424
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,207
Okay. So I'll send you tomorrow?
-All right. Bye-bye.

425
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:29,790
Nothin', huh?
-Oh, nothin' yet. Still waitin'

426
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:33,624
on Florence and London.

427
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,124
The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

428
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:40,499
Yes? Hello?
-I have information about Lecter.

429
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:45,749
Have you shared your infοrmation
with the police, sir?

430
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:49,540
I'm required to encourage you to do so.
-Uh-huh.

431
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:53,457
Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?

432
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:57,124
May I suggest you contact an attorney
before taking any possibly

433
00:48:57,208 --> 00:49:01,290
illegal action? There's one in Geneva
who is excellent in these matters.

434
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:05,249
May I give you his toll-free number?
The number is:

435
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:09,999
0-0-4-1 -2-2-3-1 -7.

436
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:34,499
Hello.
-I was just speaking with someone...

437
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:38,665
There's a one hundred thousand dollar
advance. To qualify fοr the advance,

438
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,582
a fingerprint must be provided,
in situ, on an object.

439
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:46,749
Once the print has been positively,
the money will be placed in escrow at

440
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:51,540
Geneve Credit Suisse and may be viewed
at any time subject to 24 hour prior

441
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:55,165
notification. To repeat the message
in French, press two.

442
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:59,415
In Spanish press three.
In German..

443
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:30,040
Buon giorno.
Doctor Fell? It's Inspector Pazzi.

444
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:34,665
Yes, I can see you.
Come on up.

445
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:48,207
Doctor Fell?

446
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,082
Hello?

447
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:11,207
Doctor Fell?

448
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:14,332
Hello?

449
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,415
Snap.

450
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:34,290
I should have encouraged you to bring
someone along. The cases are heavy.

451
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:37,415
Maybe you could help me with them.
-Hm?

452
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,999
Εh, just down the stairs, I mean.

453
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,749
Yeah. This way.

454
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:50,874
Here we are.

455
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:57,165
Is that the inventory?
-Yes.

456
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:01,415
May I see it?
-Of course.

457
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:14,832
You are a Pazzi of the
Pazzi family, I think.

458
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:20,957
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio
your ancestor was hanged?

459
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:25,415
Francesco de Pazzi? Yes, thrown naked
with a noose around his neck

460
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,999
from a window writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop against

461
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:33,165
the cold stone wall.

462
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,332
In fact, I fοund a very nice
rendering of it here in the

463
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:41,499
library the other day. lf you like,
perhaps I could, uh,

464
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:45,707
sneak it out fοr you.
-I would think that might jeopardize

465
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:49,915
your chances for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.

466
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:53,582
Only if you told.

467
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:57,540
Remind me, what was his crime?
-He was accused of killing

468
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:01,124
Giuliano de Medici.
-Oh. Unjustly?

469
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:05,790
No. No. I don't think so.
-Then he wasn't just accused.

470
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:09,874
He did it, he was guiIty. I think
that would make living in Florence

471
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:14,624
with the name Pazzi uncomfortable
even five hundred years later.

472
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:20,790
Not really. In fact,
I can't remember the last time

473
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:26,082
before today someone brought it up.

474
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,790
People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.

475
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:42,332
They just see to it you don't
advance in lifo.

476
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:51,540
I'm sorry, Commendatore.
I too often say what I'm thinking.

477
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,832
I'll be right back to help you.

478
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:15,540
You know, the room you're standing in
was buiIt in the fifteenth century.

479
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:18,540
It's beautiful.

480
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:22,957
Yes, it is. Unfortunately, I think the
heating system was installed

481
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:27,707
about the same time.

482
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:32,124
That's a pity.
-Yes.

483
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:36,707
Okey-dokey, let's drag these down.

484
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:41,332
They must be as heavy as bodies.

485
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,957
Hey.
-Yeah!

486
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:18,165
How much is this?
-Fifty thousand.

487
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,332
I'll take it.

488
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,832
Gnocco.

489
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:57,207
When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.

490
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:02,165
I've done this a fow times.
-Not like this.

491
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:06,207
lf there isn't a clean print on the
bracelet you'll spend the summer

492
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:09,874
in a cell at the Sollicciano.

493
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:16,124
Give me the bracelet.
-Wash your fucking hands.

494
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,999
He's coming.

495
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,457
I got it.

496
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:29,249
He grabbed me just right.

497
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:36,082
Tried to hit me in the balls.

498
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:41,749
But he missed.

499
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:48,165
Let me help you.
-No, don't.

500
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:48,957
Sixteen point match, Mister Verger.

501
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:50,624
Bingo.

502
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:11,332
Pronto.
-Carlo?

503
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:14,540
Mason?
-Ciao, bello. Come stai?

504
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:18,999
Uh, oh, oh, well, well, well.
Am I coming to see you?

505
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:22,582
Oh, yes, soon, I hope.

506
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:26,624
But, uh...well, first I need you to
pack off the boys. Yes, I know,

507
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:30,790
the day you never thought would
arrive has. Now, Cordell will fax

508
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:34,957
the veterinary forms directly to
Animal and Plant HeaIth

509
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:39,707
but you need to get the vet
affidavits from Sardinia.

510
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:43,207
Yeah. Va bene?
-Uh-huh, bene, bene.

511
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:48,124
Uh, how are they?
Ah, they are big, Mason. Very big.

512
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:51,499
Tommaso!

513
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:58,624
Say again?
-They are big, Mason. Really big.

514
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:03,415
Maybe twohundred and seventy kilos.
-Oh, wow!

515
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:07,790
Can you hear?

516
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,624
Oh, they sound fantastic!

517
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,874
Oh, super!

518
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,249
The full balance of the money is
payable upon receiptof the doctor

519
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:14,499
alive. Of course, you won't have to
seize him yourself. Rather just point

520
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:18,665
him out. In fact, it's preforable to
all concerned if that's the extent

521
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,915
of your involvement from this point.

522
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,040
I prefer to stay involved.
To make sure things go right.

523
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:32,582
Professionals will see to that.
-I am a professional.

524
01:04:56,583 --> 01:05:00,832
You enjoy the performance?
-Oh, very much.

525
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:05,290
Um, Allegra, this is Doctor Fell,
curator of the Capponi Library.

526
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:10,457
Signora Pazzi. I'm honored.
-Are you from America, Doctor?

527
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:15,040
Not originally. I've traveled there.
-I've always wanted to visit.

528
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:19,874
New Εngland, especially.
-I've enjoyed excellent meals there.

529
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:24,874
You wrapped up in the libretto.
I thought this might amuse you.

530
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:33,624
Dante's sonnet from La Vita Nuova.
-Mm-hm. It's beautiful.

531
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:38,624
Rinaldo, look at this.
-Oh, yes, I can see.

532
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:43,624
"Joyous Love seemed to me, the while
he held my heart in his hands

533
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:49,457
and in his arms my lady lay asleep
wrapped in a veil."

534
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:55,665
"He woke her then and trembling and
obedient, she ate that burning heart

535
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:00,290
out of his hand. Weeping,
I saw him then depart from me."

536
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:04,749
Doctor Fell, do you believe a man
could become so obsessed with a woman

537
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:08,624
from a single encounter?
-Could he daily foel a stab of hunger

538
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:13,374
fοr her and find nourishment in the
very sight of her?

539
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:18,582
I think so. But would she see
through the bars of his plight

540
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:22,624
and ache for him?
Please keep that.

541
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:26,707
Oh, I couldn't.
-I insist.

542
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:29,915
Commendatore. Allegra.

543
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,374
Ciao.
-Ciao.

544
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:39,457
Uh, good-bye.
-Let's get something to eat.

545
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:43,624
Of course.
-Why not?

546
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:18,999
Is that you, Doctor?

547
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,832
Questura. Pandolfini.
-Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi please.

548
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:15,249
Agent Starling, American F.B.I.
-All right. Εh, one moment.

549
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:21,499
Pazzi! F.B.I.
-I'm not here!

550
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:29,749
Pazzi.
-Inspector Pazzi, Agent Starling,

551
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:33,415
F.B.I. How do you do?
-I was just leaving fοr the day.

552
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,165
Can I call you back tomorrow?
-Oh, this won't take long.

553
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:41,832
First of all, I'd like to thank you
for sending us the security tape.

554
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:45,624
When I say you, I mean your department.
Agent Benetti.

555
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:50,457
Is he there? Can I speak with him?
-I'm sorry, he's gone home.

556
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:54,415
Oh, that's all right. I should tell
you this rather than him anyway.

557
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:58,457
I'm late for an important appointment.
-Well, the person I'm looking for,

558
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:03,374
Inspector, who was indeed shown on
that tape, is Hannibal Lecter.

559
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:07,082
Who?
-Doctor Hannibal Lecter. Never heard?

560
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:10,457
Umm, uh, I'm not familiar.
-And the tape confirms

561
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:14,749
that he is, or was recently,
in Florence.

562
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:18,499
Oh, really?
-He's a very dangerous man, Inspector.

563
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:22,957
He's killed 1 4 people that we know of.
-I really have to go, Miss, uh, eh?

564
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:27,749
Starling. Just another minute. Are you
sure you've never heard of him?

565
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:31,207
No, I haven't.
-I'm confused, because someone there

566
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:35,374
has been accessing our private VlCAP
files on Doctor Lecter with some

567
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:39,624
regularity on your computer.
-Εverybody uses everybody's computer

568
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:44,624
here. Maybe one of the detectives on
II Mostro was looking at profiles

569
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:48,582
of killers...
-I'm speaking about the computer

570
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:53,165
at your home, sir. You're trying to
catch him yourself, aren't you?

571
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:57,832
For the reward. I cannot warn you
strongly enough against that.

572
01:09:57,916 --> 01:10:01,999
He killed three policemen down in
Memphis while in custody,

573
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:06,207
tearing the face off one of them,
and he will kill you, too, if...

574
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:41,665
Yes?
-I want him out of Tuscany fast.

575
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,832
Believe me he'll be gone from the
face of the Εarth fast.

576
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:48,374
Feet first.

577
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:10,999
Because of his avarice and his
betrayal of the Εmperor's trust

578
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:15,457
Pier della Vigna was disgraced,
blinded and imprisoned.

579
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:20,040
Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna
on the seventh level of the Inferno,

580
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:24,582
and like Judas Iscariot,
he died by hanging.

581
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:28,749
So Judas and Pier della Vigna are
linked in Dante by the avarice he saw

582
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:32,915
in them. In fact, avarice and hanging
are linked in the medieval mind.

583
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,082
Now this was the earliest known
depiction of the Crucifixion,

584
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:41,249
carved on an ivory box in Gaul about
A.D. fοur hundred.

585
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:45,665
It includes the death by hanging of
Judas, his face upturned to the

586
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:50,165
branch that suspends him.
Here he is again on the doors

587
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:54,332
of the Benevento Cathedral,

588
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:58,540
this time with his bowels falling out.

589
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:02,707
Ah, Commendatore Pazzi.
-It wasn't easy, but I got

590
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:07,249
this number without tellin' 'em why.
-Sorry.

591
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:11,665
Not at all. Welcome.
Please join us.

592
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,624
Now, in this plate from the fifteenth
century edition of the Inforno,

593
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:19,790
Pier della Vigna's body hangs from a
bleeding tree. I will not belabor the

594
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:23,957
obvious parallel with Judas Iscariot,
but Dante Alighieri

595
01:12:24,041 --> 01:12:28,124
needed no drawn illustration. It was
his genius to make Pier della Vigna,

596
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:32,540
now in hell speak in strained hisses
and coughing sibilants as though

597
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:36,957
he is hanging still.

598
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:40,624
Come l'aItre verrem per nostre
spoglie.

599
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:43,749
Ma no pero ch'alcuna sen rivesta.

600
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,957
Che non e giusto aver cio ch'om si
toglie. Que le strascineremo,

601
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:53,374
e per la mesta selva saranno i nostri
corpi appesi.

602
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:58,832
Ciascuno al prun de l'ombra
sua molesta.

603
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:03,832
Avarice, hanging, self-destruction.

604
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,999
lo fei guibbetto a me de le mie case.

605
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:12,582
I make my own home be my gallows.

606
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:19,249
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your kind attention.

607
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,582
I'm not a scholar, but I think you've
got the job.

608
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:41,207
Thank you.
-May I buy you a drink?

609
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,457
Fine. I'll gathering my things.
-Oh, well, take your time.

610
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:59,040
Yeah?
-Allegra, I'll be home just a little

611
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:04,249
later than I said. I'm taking Doctor
Fell out for a drink. Yes.

612
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:09,415
Yeah. I can see the people
coming out now.

613
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:15,165
Yes, bye, honey. My wifo.
-Of course.

614
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:21,749
Oh, I should have shown them this one.
I can't imagine how I missed it.

615
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:26,082
I told you about it. It's a rendering
I fοund in the Capponi library.

616
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:30,790
Can you make it out?
There's a name there.

617
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:35,999
The one I told you about?

618
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:52,040
It's your ancestor, Commendatore,
hanging beneath these very windows.

619
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:55,165
Francesco de Pazzi.

620
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:58,957
On a related subject,
I must confoss to you

621
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:02,540
I'm giving very serious thought

622
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:10,874
to eating your wife.

623
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:47,374
So I'll ask you the questions

624
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:52,582
and then we'll see, all right?

625
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:54,957
Okay?

626
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:14,415
Now, was it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

627
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:18,790
No, no, no.
Blink twice for yes, once fοr no.

628
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:22,999
Was it Mason Verger you sold me to?

629
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:27,582
Yes? Good. Thank you. And are
his men waiting fοr me outside?

630
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:34,207
Was that a single blink?
Oh, you're confused. Well, please

631
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:39,249
don't be confused, because I may have
to fillet Signora Pazzi after all.

632
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:44,999
Have you told anyone
in the Questura about me?

633
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:49,665
No, I thought not.
Have you told Allegra?

634
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:56,374
No? You sure?

635
01:16:56,916 --> 01:17:00,082
I believe you.

636
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:05,290
Okey-dokey, here we go.

637
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,332
Okay.

638
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,832
Your heart is really palpitating.
Oh, it's not your heart.

639
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:21,082
Well, shall I answer it?

640
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,124
Pronto.
-I've spoken to your section chief.

641
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:31,957
Someday you'll thank me, or you won't.
I don't care. You'll be alive.

642
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:36,707
Inspector Pazzi?
-Is this Clarice?

643
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:42,957
Well, hello, Clarice.
I'm afraid I have bad news fοr you.

644
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:46,582
Is he dead?
-Did you get my note? I hope you liked

645
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:50,874
the skin cream. I had it specially...
-Is he dead, Doctor Lecter?

646
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:55,040
Clarice, there's nothing in this world
that I would love more than to be able

647
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:59,207
to chat with you. Unfοrtunately,
you've caught me at an awkward moment.

648
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:03,415
Please fοrgive me. See you around.

649
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:07,957
An old friend.

650
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,790
Okay, hold on.

651
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:16,707
Here we go.

652
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:52,790
I'll go around back! Cut him!
Kill him if you have to!

653
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,040
So, what's it to be? Bowels in or
bowels out? Like Judas.

654
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:06,332
Are you confused? Then I'll decide
for you, if you'll permit me.

655
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:10,874
Ciao.

656
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:17,624
Carlo!

657
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:19,790
Yes?

658
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:22,332
Good evening.

659
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:30,499
Cordell,

660
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:35,707
to you, does that look like a
wave good-bye

661
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:40,082
or hello?

662
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:29,457
So, what do you think?
Does Lecter want to

663
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:34,624
fuck her or kill her or eat her or what?
-Probably all three,

664
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:39,832
though I wouldn't want to predict
in what order.

665
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:45,040
Here's what I think. No matter how
Barney might want to romanticize

666
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:50,707
it or make it "Beauty and the Beast".

667
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:56,499
Lecter's object,
as I know from personal experience,

668
01:22:56,666 --> 01:23:01,249
has always been degradation
and suffering, but..

669
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:06,540
Cordell, get this damn thing off me.
I can't breathe in this thing.

670
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:12,582
He comes in the guise of a mentor,
as he did with me and her.

671
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:18,415
But it's distress that excites him.

672
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:23,582
To draw him
she needs to be distressed.

673
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:31,915
To make her attractive to him,
let him see her distressed.

674
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,165
Let the damage he sees
suggest the damage

675
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:42,374
he could do.

676
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:54,249
When the fox hears the rabbit scream,
he comes a-runnin'

677
01:23:54,833 --> 01:23:58,332
but not to help.
-I don't understand.

678
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:02,499
Well, there's nothing to understand,
Paul. All you have to understand is,

679
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:06,332
is what it's worth to you.
-No, no, I don't understand

680
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:10,499
why she didn't turn this over. I mean,
she's such a straight arrow.

681
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:14,665
She didn't turn it over because
she didn't receive it. She didn't

682
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,832
receive it because it was never sent.
It was never sent because Lecter

683
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:23,332
didn't write it, because I did.
-Oh!

684
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:29,874
So, what do you think?
-You'd have been better off if you

685
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:34,040
never got her out of trouble.
-Oh, woulda, shoulda, coulda! I meant,

686
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:37,165
what do you think about the money?
-Five.

687
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:41,707
Ha! Oh, well, let's just
toss it off, like "5". Let's say it

688
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:46,915
with the respect it deserves.
-Five hundred thousand dollars.

689
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:53,165
That's better. Well, will it work?
-It'll work. It won't be pretty.

690
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:58,415
What ever is?

691
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:05,499
Cocksucker.
-I've never seen this before.

692
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:10,040
Then how do you account for its being
fοund in your office? Your basement.

693
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:14,207
How do you want me to answer that?
Let me ask you this: What possible

694
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:18,874
reason might I have to withhold it?
-Perhaps because of the content.

695
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:24,040
Reads to me like a love letter.
-Has it been tested fοr prints?

696
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:27,707
No prints on it. Like the last one.
-Handwriting analysis?

697
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:31,999
"Did you ever think, Clarice, why the
Philistines don't understand you?

698
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:36,165
It's because you're the answer to
Samson's riddle: You are the honey in

699
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:40,082
the lion." It sounds like him to me.
-Do you mean, like a homosexual?

700
01:25:40,166 --> 01:25:43,707
Like a nut with a crush.
-Εxcuse me...

701
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:48,832
I am placing you on administrative
leave till Document Analysis tells me

702
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:53,040
unequivocally a mistake's been made.
You remain eligible for insurance and

703
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:57,749
medical benefits. Surrender your
weapons and your identification.

704
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:14,499
I want to say something. I'm entitled.
-Go ahead.

705
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:19,124
I think Verger is trying to capture
Dr. Lecter for the purposes of

706
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:23,290
personal revenge. And Mr. Krendler is
in collusion with him and wants the

707
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:27,832
F.B.I.'s effοrts to work fοr Verger.
I think he is being paid to do this.

708
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:31,999
You're lucky you're not sworn here.
-Swear me! You swear, too!

709
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:36,165
Clarice, if the evidence is lacking,
you'll be entitled to full

710
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:40,457
reinstatement without prejudice.
lf you don't do or say anything

711
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:44,624
in the meantime that would make
that impossible.

712
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:48,790
Relieved of field duty pending an
internal affairs into the charges,

713
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:52,957
Agent Starling, began her career with
an assignment to interview madman

714
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:57,124
Hannibal Lecter. Εarlier today we
heard comments from Justice Department

715
01:26:57,208 --> 01:27:01,290
spokesman Paul Krendler.
-Mr. Krendler, can you comment the

716
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:06,499
decision at this morning's meeting?
-F.B.I. and Justice Department are

717
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:10,540
looking carefully into the charges,
and, yes, they're extremely serious.

718
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:14,707
I'd like to add a personal note.
Starling is one of the best agents

719
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:18,707
that we have...
No, no, no, no, no. Stay. Stay.

720
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:23,874
Do you think that...
-Look, it's much too soon

721
01:27:23,958 --> 01:27:27,332
to condemn her. Okay?

722
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,249
Shh...shh...shh.

723
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:15,249
Good boy.

724
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:30,290
Ah, and this.

725
01:30:56,458 --> 01:31:00,874
I think she's nice.
She's always been nice to me. Polite.

726
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:05,999
Don't you think?
-Do you know what a roller pigeon is?

727
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:10,165
Roller pigeons climb high and fast,
then roll over and

728
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:14,415
fall just as fast towards the earth.
There are shallow and deep rollers.

729
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,624
But you can't breed two deep rollers,
or their young, their offspring,

730
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:24,832
will roll all the way down, hit and
die. Agent Starling is a deep roller.

731
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:30,665
Let's hope one of her parents was not.

732
01:32:58,333 --> 01:33:01,582
Hello?
-The power on that battery is low.

733
01:33:01,666 --> 01:33:05,749
I would have changed it, but I didn't
want to wake you. You're gonna have to

734
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:09,915
use the other one, in the charger.
Hopefully the light on it is green.

735
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,082
This is gonna be a long call. Εven
though you've been stripped of your

736
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:18,332
duties, I know you wouldn't abandon
them, you'll try to put on a trace.

737
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:22,540
So, we'll disconnect long enough for
you to exchange the battery.

738
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:27,374
Shall we say...uh, three seconds?
Are you ready?

739
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:30,790
Yes.
-Go.

740
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,749
Very good.
-Thank you.

741
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:40,915
Remember, Clarice, if you get caught
with a concealed, unlicensed firearm

742
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,082
in the District of Columbia,
the penaIty is pretty stiff.

743
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:49,624
But bring the guns if you have to.
Now get in your car.

744
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:27,207
The reason we're doing it
like this, Clarice, is because

745
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:31,374
I like to watch you as we speak,
with your eyes open. No, it

746
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:36,290
does not excite me. It pleases me.
You have very shapely feet.

747
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:44,082
Where are we now? Call it out.
-Massachusetts Avenue.

748
01:34:44,166 --> 01:34:48,249
Take it.
-I thought, to begin with,

749
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:51,874
you might tell me how you're feeling.
-About what?

750
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:56,040
The masters you serve and how they've
treated you. Your career,

751
01:34:56,125 --> 01:35:00,457
such as it is. Your life, Clarice.
-I thought we might talk about yours.

752
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:04,665
What's the next cross street?
-Capitol Street.

753
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:09,457
In 2 blocks make a left into
Union Station. Park.

754
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:13,624
My lifo? What is there say about mine?
I have been in a state of hibernation

755
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:18,624
for some time. A little inactive.
But now I'm back home.

756
01:35:19,666 --> 01:35:24,249
I'm very happy and very heaIthy.
You, though,

757
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:27,915
it's you I'm worried about.
-I'm fine.

758
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,915
No, you're certainly not fine.
You fell in love with the Bureau,

759
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,124
the institution, only to discover,
after giving it everything you've got

760
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:40,290
that it does not love you back. That,
in fact, it resents you. Resents you

761
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:44,915
more than the husband and children you
gave up to it. Why is that,

762
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,540
do you think? Why are you so resented?
-Tell me.

763
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:53,624
Tell you? God bless you.
Well, isn't it clear?

764
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:59,665
You serve the idea of order,
Clarice. They don't.

765
01:36:00,958 --> 01:36:05,457
You believe in the oath you took.
They don't. You feel it is your duty

766
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:09,624
to protect the sheep. They don't.
They don't like you because

767
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:13,832
you're not like them. They hate you
and they envy you. They're weak and

768
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:18,624
unruly and believe in nothing.
-Mason Verger wants to kill you.

769
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:23,082
Turn yourself in to me,
and I promise no one will hurt you.

770
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:27,249
Will you stay with me in my prison
cell and hold my hand, Clarice?

771
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:31,165
We could have some fun. No, Verger
does'nt want to kill me any more than

772
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:35,874
I want to kill him. He just wants to
see me suffer in an unimaginable way.

773
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:40,082
He is rather twisted, you know. Have
you had the pleasure of meeting him?

774
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:43,290
I have.
-Face to face, so to speak?

775
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:46,707
Yes.
-Attractive, isn't he?

776
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,874
Doctor Lecter? Doctor Lecter?

777
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,165
Okay, back to you. I want to know what
it is you think you will do now that

778
01:36:57,583 --> 01:37:01,165
everything in the world you've ever
cared about has been taken from you.

779
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:04,915
I don't know, Doctor Lecter.
-Tell me, Clarice. Do you think

780
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,332
you'll work as a chambermaid
at a motel on Route 66,

781
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:12,499
just like your mommy?

782
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:26,332
What do you think now? Are you paying
attention to me, ex-Special Agent?

783
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:32,457
Are you, by any chance, trying
to trace my whereabouts?

784
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:39,249
I'm being followed, Doctor Lecter.
-I know. I've seen them.

785
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:43,415
And now you're in a real dilemma,
aren't you? Do you continue to try

786
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:47,332
to find me, knowing that you're
leading them to me?

787
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:51,499
Do you have so much faith in your
abilities that you believe you

788
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:56,332
could somehow simuItaneously arrest
me and them? It could get very messy.

789
01:37:56,416 --> 01:37:59,499
Like the fish market. Hey, Clarice.
-Yeah?

790
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:02,624
What if I did it for you?
-Did what?

791
01:38:02,708 --> 01:38:07,290
Harmed them, Clarice.
The ones who have harmed you.

792
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:11,124
What if I made them scream apologies?
No, I shouldn't even say it,

793
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:15,290
because you'll foel, with your perfoct
grasp of right and wrong,

794
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:19,874
that you were somehow accompli.
-Don't help me.

795
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:25,082
No of course not.
Forget I said it.

796
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:27,374
Piero.

797
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:32,374
Clarice, you were very, very warm.
You were so close.

798
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:41,290
But now you're getting colder again.
Yeah warmer again.

799
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,374
Well, I think I've been generous
enough with you, and the clues.

800
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:50,665
You're on your own now, Clarice.
-Doctor Lecter?

801
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:03,165
Hope you like them, Clarice.
Ta-ta.

802
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:11,415
Va bene.

803
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:53,249
Get out of the way!

804
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:08,124
I know the first thing an hysteric
says is, I am not an hysteric,

805
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:12,874
but I am not an hysteric. I'm calm.
-I'll ask you one time. Think good.

806
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:19,249
Think about every good thing you ever
did. Think about what you swore.

807
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:23,957
Two men in a van. A third driving.
Another man down. They put him in the

808
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:28,124
back. I think it was Lecter. I've
given you the license plate, and I'm

809
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:32,749
reporting it all to you again.
-All right.

810
01:40:33,333 --> 01:40:37,540
I'll go with it as a kidnapping.
I'll send someone out with,

811
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:42,165
if he' ll let us on the property.
-I should go, too. Deputize me.

812
01:40:42,375 --> 01:40:45,999
No. You're not going.
You're going home

813
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:50,457
where you'll wait for me to call and
tell you what, if anything, we found.

814
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:57,790
Thank Mr. Verger for look around.
-He's always happy to see you.

815
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:12,082
Phone.
-What number, please?

816
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:13,749
Carlo.

817
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,457
Piero.

818
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:29,040
Hello?
-How is he?

819
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:32,957
Uh, sleeping.
-Bring him home.

820
01:41:56,208 --> 01:41:59,915
You've reached Clarice Starling.
Please leave a message.

821
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,832
Pick up, Starling. There was nothing
out there. I'm gonna say it again,

822
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:07,915
in case you didn't hear me clearly:
You are not a law officer while you're

823
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,749
on suspension. You're Joe Blow.
I hope, you're in the bathroom.

824
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:56,499
Hylochoerus Meinertzhageni.

825
01:42:58,166 --> 01:43:02,332
Ring any bells from high
school biology, Doctor?

826
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:06,915
No? Well, I could list its most
conspicuous features,

827
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:13,832
if that would help jog the memory.
Three pairs of incisors,

828
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:20,457
one pair of elongated canines,

829
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:25,749
three pairs of molars,
fοur pairs of pre-molars,

830
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:31,332
upper and lower,
for a total of forty-four teeth.

831
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,207
The meal will begin with an
hors d'oeuvre tartare.

832
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:48,749
Your foet.

833
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:53,582
The main course, the rest of you,
won't be served until 7 hours later.

834
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:58,540
But during that time
you'll be able to enjoy the effects

835
01:43:58,625 --> 01:44:02,374
of the consumed appetizer with a

836
01:44:02,458 --> 01:44:06,040
full-bodied saline drip.

837
01:44:06,125 --> 01:44:09,707
I guess you wish now you'd,

838
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:14,124
you'd fod the rest of me to the dogs.

839
01:44:14,208 --> 01:44:17,749
No, Mason. No, I much prefer
you the way you are.

840
01:44:20,625 --> 01:44:23,999
So, dinner at eight.

841
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:58,374
You will stay fοr the evening's
entertainment, won't you, Cordell?

842
01:44:59,166 --> 01:45:03,332
lf it's all right with you
I think I'd rather not.

843
01:45:04,166 --> 01:45:08,207
Rather not or will not?

844
01:47:13,458 --> 01:47:17,957
Your little brother must smell
almost as badly as you do by now.

845
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:48,749
Hold it! Hands where I can see 'em!
-Si.

846
01:47:52,083 --> 01:47:54,999
Quiet!
-Si. Vai!

847
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:02,749
What was that? Cordell, quickly!

848
01:48:02,958 --> 01:48:07,749
Down on your stomach!
-Good evening, Clarice.

849
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:12,124
It's just like old times.
-Shut up.

850
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:17,707
Can you walk?
-I can try.

851
01:48:18,375 --> 01:48:21,790
You look well.
-I'm gonna cut you loose.

852
01:48:21,875 --> 01:48:25,749
lf you touch me, I'll shoot you.
-Understood.

853
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:29,915
Do right and you'll live through this.
-Spoken like a true Protestant.

854
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,040
Better hurry. This might go faster if
you hand me the knife.

855
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:41,749
There was a third in the loft.
Behind me.

856
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:21,957
Cordell! Get the gun and shoot him!
-Go into the pen?

857
01:49:22,583 --> 01:49:25,624
Yes!
-No. I'm staying out of this.

858
01:49:25,708 --> 01:49:29,790
You're involved is what you are,
in all of it. Now do it!

859
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:31,874
No.
-Yes!

860
01:49:31,958 --> 01:49:36,499
Hey, Cordell! Why don't you push
him in? You can always say it was me.

861
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,332
Cordell?

862
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:49,624
Cordell? Cordell! Cordell!

863
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:28,332
I'll be at my lake house all weekend.
Don't want any calls fοrwarded either,

864
01:51:28,416 --> 01:51:31,999
you understand? Whoever it is,
they can all wait, okay?

865
01:51:32,083 --> 01:51:35,665
Mary, listen, it's Fourth of July,
for Christ's sakes. Thank you.

866
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:56,499
What the fuck?

867
01:52:05,666 --> 01:52:08,749
Good, you brought the wine.
-Oh, God! Oh!

868
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:30,249
Yeah, we've traced your call and units
will be there in about ten minutes.

869
01:54:30,333 --> 01:54:34,957
lf you can do it safely,
then just get out of the house.

870
01:54:35,083 --> 01:54:38,624
Otherwise, stay on the phone with me.
Ma'am? Are you there?

871
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,249
Are those shallots?
-Mm-hm. And caper berries.

872
01:55:11,958 --> 01:55:16,540
Ah. That butter smells wonderful.
-Mm-hm. You foeling hungry, Paul?

873
01:55:17,583 --> 01:55:19,749
V ery.

874
01:55:24,541 --> 01:55:28,832
What's the main course?
-Ah you should never ask.

875
01:55:28,916 --> 01:55:32,749
It spoils the surprise.
Clarice, what are you doing up?

876
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:37,457
You should be resting. Back to bed.
-I'm hungry.

877
01:55:40,166 --> 01:55:43,957
Hello, Paul.
-Paul, don't be rude.

878
01:55:44,041 --> 01:55:48,207
Say, "Hello, Agent Starling."
-Hello, Agent Starling.

879
01:55:52,791 --> 01:55:57,582
I always wanted to watch you eat.
-What have you got in your hand?

880
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,790
Something to bash me over the head
with? Put it on the table.

881
01:56:03,583 --> 01:56:06,624
Good girl.
-Hey, that's mine.

882
01:56:06,708 --> 01:56:09,207
Now sit down.

883
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:15,290
Hey, Clarice. I love the dress.
It's beautiful.

884
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:19,624
What do you think, Paul?
-Nice. Nice.

885
01:56:29,333 --> 01:56:32,915
Why don't you say grace, Paul?

886
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,124
Me?
-Yeah.

887
01:56:35,208 --> 01:56:37,999
Grace?
-Sure.

888
01:56:38,083 --> 01:56:41,332
Okay. Bow your head.

889
01:56:44,291 --> 01:56:48,457
Father, we thank Thee fοr Thy
blessings and dedicate them to

890
01:56:48,541 --> 01:56:52,957
Thy mercy we are about to receive.
Forgive us all, even white trash

891
01:56:54,125 --> 01:56:58,499
like Starling here
and bring her into my service.

892
01:56:58,583 --> 01:57:00,707
Amen.

893
01:57:01,625 --> 01:57:05,915
Now I have to tell you, Paul, even the
Apostle Paul couldn't have do better.

894
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,624
He hated women, too.
-May I have some wine, please?

895
01:57:09,708 --> 01:57:14,249
No good idea. Not with the morphine.
Better you should eat some broth.

896
01:57:15,625 --> 01:57:20,040
By the way, Starling, that was a job
offaring I worked into the blessing.

897
01:57:21,041 --> 01:57:24,624
I'm going to Congress, you know.
-Are you?

898
01:57:24,708 --> 01:57:29,457
Come around campaign headquarters.
You could be a office girl!

899
01:57:29,875 --> 01:57:33,957
Can you type and file?
Can you take dictation?

900
01:57:34,041 --> 01:57:37,749
Take this down:
Washington is full of corn-pone

901
01:57:37,833 --> 01:57:42,332
country pussy.
-I took it down.

902
01:57:42,416 --> 01:57:46,540
You said it already.
-Paul, now you're being rude.

903
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:50,582
And I hate rude people. Drink your
broth like a good boy.

904
01:57:50,666 --> 01:57:54,332
Come on. Sip.
Good.

905
01:57:57,375 --> 01:58:01,457
Ugh. It's not very good, buddy.
-I admit I added something to yours.

906
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:05,874
It's clashing with the cumin. But l
assure you, the next is to die fοr.

907
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:20,290
Ah, ah, ah! Come on, Clarice.
-No.

908
01:58:20,375 --> 01:58:23,499
That's a good girl. Good.

909
01:58:56,625 --> 01:59:00,707
You see, the brain itself feels no
pain, Clarice, if that concerns you.

910
01:59:00,791 --> 01:59:04,874
For example, Paul won't miss this
little piece here, which is the part

911
01:59:04,958 --> 01:59:09,332
of the prefrontal lobe which they
say is the seat of good manners.

912
01:59:09,583 --> 01:59:14,665
Your profile at the border stations
has five foatures. I'll trade you.

913
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:17,249
Trade?
-Stop...

914
01:59:17,333 --> 01:59:21,415
How does that word taste to you?
Cheap and metallic

915
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:25,290
like sucking on a greasy coin?
-Who's Clarice?

916
01:59:25,375 --> 01:59:29,582
Agent Starling. lf you can't keep up
with the dialog, don't try to join.

917
01:59:29,666 --> 01:59:33,832
Me, me, Paul. I'm Starling.
-See.

918
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:38,665
Here, right here is the sac
that contains the brain.

919
01:59:42,916 --> 01:59:46,957
I would really like some wine!

920
01:59:48,666 --> 01:59:52,832
That smells great.
-Yes. Why don't you try a piece?

921
01:59:53,791 --> 01:59:57,790
I would really like some wine.

922
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:03,415
It is good.
-All right. But just a little.

923
02:00:07,041 --> 02:00:09,665
Okay? No?

924
02:00:25,291 --> 02:00:29,374
Given the chance, you would deny
me my life, wouldn't you?

925
02:00:29,458 --> 02:00:33,790
Not your lifo.
-My freedom. You'd take that from me.

926
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:38,249
And if you did, would they have
you back, do you think? The F.B.I.?

927
02:00:40,375 --> 02:00:44,582
Those people you despise almost
as much as they despise you?

928
02:00:44,666 --> 02:00:48,582
Would they give you a medal? Would you
have it professionally framed

929
02:00:48,666 --> 02:00:52,749
and hang it on your wall to look at
and remind you of your

930
02:00:52,833 --> 02:00:56,749
courage and incorruptibility?

931
02:00:57,708 --> 02:01:01,832
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.

932
02:01:02,708 --> 02:01:07,040
I had plans fοr that smart mouth,
but I'm never gonna hire her, you now.

933
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:10,249
Paul?
-Paul?

934
02:01:12,125 --> 02:01:16,207
Remember what I said?
lf you can't be polite to our guests

935
02:01:16,291 --> 02:01:20,582
you have to sit at the kiddies' table.

936
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:25,415
Don't get up, Clarice.
Paul will help me clear

937
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:29,957
and make the coftee.
Just think about what I said, Clarice.

938
02:01:33,291 --> 02:01:35,707
Coffee.

939
02:02:12,583 --> 02:02:16,915
I came halfway around the world
to watch you run, Clarice.

940
02:02:20,083 --> 02:02:23,624
Let me run, huh?

941
02:02:41,375 --> 02:02:45,707
Tell me, Clarice
would you ever say to me,

942
02:02:45,791 --> 02:02:50,249
Stop? lf you love me, you'd stop?

943
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:58,040
Not in a thousand years.

944
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:05,874
That's my girl.

945
02:03:18,416 --> 02:03:22,999
Now that's really interesting,
Clarice. I'm really pressed fοr time

946
02:03:24,375 --> 02:03:27,749
so where's the key?

947
02:03:27,958 --> 02:03:31,332
Where's the key?

948
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:38,165
Okay.

949
02:03:42,541 --> 02:03:46,540
Above or below the wrist, Clarice?

950
02:03:54,791 --> 02:03:57,957
This is really gonna hurt.

951
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:49,124
Show me your hands!

952
02:04:49,208 --> 02:04:53,332
ldentify yourself!
-I'm Clarice Starling! F.B.I. !

953
02:05:55,375 --> 02:05:58,790
Hi.
-Hi. What's that?

954
02:06:00,708 --> 02:06:04,457
Oh, that's caviar.
-What are those?

955
02:06:05,125 --> 02:06:09,082
These are figs.
-And that?

956
02:06:09,166 --> 02:06:11,290
And this?

957
02:06:13,583 --> 02:06:17,457
Oh, that I don't think you would like.
-It looks good.

958
02:06:17,541 --> 02:06:21,124
Oh, it is good.
-Can I have some?

959
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:25,915
You're a very unusual boy, aren't you?
-I couldn't eat what they gave me.

960
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,080
Nor should you. It isn't even fοod
as I understand the definition.

961
02:06:30,165 --> 02:06:33,750
Which is why I always bring my own.

962
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:37,330
So which would you like to try?

963
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:40,040
Aha.

964
02:06:40,125 --> 02:06:43,625
Well, I suppose it's all right.

965
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:49,620
After all, as your mother tells you,
and my mother certainly told me,

966
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:53,870
It is important, she always used to
say, always to try new things.

967
02:06:55,290 --> 02:06:57,375
Open up.
