2
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,982
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,442
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,788
My son...

5
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,543
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,718
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,679
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,974
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,771
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,273
He never speaks.

11
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,734
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,906
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,660
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,747
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,633
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,597
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,517
He's all I have left.

18
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:13,939
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,199
Vito, run!

20
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,409
Move and I'll kill him!

21
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,912
Run, Vito!

22
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,878
Kill him!

23
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,766
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

24
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,353
You understand?

25
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,618
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

26
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,729
Vito, we're praying for you!

27
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,113
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

28
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,033
...turn him over to us.

29
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,537
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

30
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,833
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

31
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,558
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

32
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,611
Nurse.

33
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,347
Money?

34
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,642
Interpreter!

35
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,359
Where are you from?

36
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,820
-What is your name?
-Maria.

37
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,368
What is your name?

38
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,789
Come on, son. What is your name?

39
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,879
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

40
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,299
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

41
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,427
Okay, over there.

42
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,554
Next.

43
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,318
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

44
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,829
Vito Corleone!

45
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,707
Vito Corleone!

46
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,920
Here he is. This is him.

47
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,653
Did you bring the car keys?

48
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,491
Laurie! Laurie!

49
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,847
Mama!

50
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,642
Mama!

51
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,563
-Look who's here.
-Father Carmelo.

52
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,900
-This is Father Carmelo.
-I'm Merle Johnson.

53
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,403
Mama!

54
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:03,575
-Here I am.
-Constanzia, after one week?

55
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,704
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

56
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:13,752
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!

57
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:17,047
-What is this?
-You remember Merle?

58
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,883
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

59
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,514
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.

60
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,975
You go see your children first.

61
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,730
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

62
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,071
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

63
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,450
<i>A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.</i>

64
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:49,621
<i>Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.</i>

65
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,499
<i>And there is Mrs. Geary.</i>

66
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,095
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

67
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:11,977
<i>This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs. Geary.</i>

68
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,689
<i>We see Nevada far too seldom.</i>

69
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:20,694
<i>But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends</i>

70
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,740
<i>and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.</i>

71
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:32,289
<i>And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.</i>

72
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:38,170
<i>I have here in my hand a check
made out to the university</i>

73
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:43,091
<i>and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of</i>

74
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,262
<i>Anthony Vito Corleone.</i>

75
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,433
<i>The check is signed by
that young man's parents</i>

76
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,353
<i>whom I think we should recognize.</i>

77
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:58,899
<i>Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!</i>

78
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,026
<i>Folks, I want you to join me</i>

79
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:06,865
<i>in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!</i>

80
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:18,085
<i>We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir</i>

81
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:24,591
<i>who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement</i>

82
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,679
<i>to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.</i>

83
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,347
<i>Boys.</i>

84
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,032
The plaque.

85
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,743
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

86
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,705
Okay, that's good.

87
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,917
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs. Corleone.

88
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,400
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

89
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,612
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

90
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,865
-Yes, yes.
-Sit down.

91
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:36,497
I thought that you and
I would talk alone.

92
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:43,754
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

93
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,840
Well, it's perfectly all right with me

94
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:51,595
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

95
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,764
Maybe more frankly

96
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,184
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before.

97
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,354
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

98
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:05,651
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas

99
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:10,280
and one in Reno.
The licenses were grandfathered in

100
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,784
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

101
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,747
Now my sources tell me

102
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:22,918
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

103
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:28,048
They tell me that within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

104
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:33,929
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.

105
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,309
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.

106
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:45,148
-Turnbull is a good man.
-Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

107
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,402
I don't want to spend
more time here than I have to.

108
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,946
You can have the license.

109
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,907
The price is 250,000 dollars.

110
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,660
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly

111
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:01,248
of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone.

112
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:09,756
The price for the license
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

113
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,259
That's right.

114
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:17,890
-Why would I pay more than that?
-Because I intend to squeeze you.

115
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,601
I don't like your kind of people.

116
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:26,231
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair

117
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,692
dressed up in those silk suits

118
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,696
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

119
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:38,452
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

120
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:44,041
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

121
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,383
Senator,

122
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,554
we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

123
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,559
But never think it applies to my family.

124
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,687
All right, all right.

125
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:11,652
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

126
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,824
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

127
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:22,996
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

128
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,667
Don't you contact me again, ever.

129
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,587
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

130
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:34,925
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

131
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,347
My offer is this...

132
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,099
Nothing.

133
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:49,439
Not even the fee for the gaming license,
which I would like you to put up.

134
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,155
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

135
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,536
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

136
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,706
-Honey, we have to go.
-Really? I'm sorry.

137
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,209
-It's been delightful.
-It was our pleasure.

138
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,962
It was wonderful talking to you.

139
00:20:56,507 --> 00:21:01,678
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

140
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,764
Frank Pentangeli!

141
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,975
I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

142
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,729
I've got to check on my boys.

143
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,857
-What's with the food here?
-What's the matter?

144
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:19,821
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says, "canapés".

145
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:25,202
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"

146
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:31,625
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

147
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,546
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

148
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:42,219
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

149
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:47,975
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

150
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,144
No, that was no heart attack.

151
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:55,482
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

152
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:58,569
-But what's with him?
-What do you mean?

153
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:04,074
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

154
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:08,787
-You can't get in to see Mike?
-He's got me waiting in a lobby!

155
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,544
-Johnny Ola.
-Al Neri.

156
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:26,388
-Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
-I remember Tom from the old days.

157
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,056
Rocco.

158
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,102
-What's this?
-It's an orange from Miami.

159
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:35,230
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

160
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,315
Johnny?

161
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:43,614
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

162
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,575
Sure, Mike.

163
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,874
-What are you drinking, Johnny?
-Anisette.

164
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:04,468
-If you need anything, I'll be outside.
-Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

165
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:13,810
-I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.
-How is his health?

166
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,812
It's not good.

167
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,525
Can I do anything or send anything?

168
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:24,488
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

169
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,490
That casino...

170
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:31,245
Registered owners. Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.

171
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,915
The real owners are
the old Lakeville Road group

172
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,292
and our friend in Miami.

173
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:43,757
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you

174
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:47,886
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

175
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,852
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

176
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:59,898
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

177
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:05,028
One by one, our old friends are gone.

178
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:08,866
Death, natural or not,

179
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,702
prison, deported...

180
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:18,208
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

181
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:25,799
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!

182
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,594
Let's have a tarantella!

183
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,351
You! Up, up, up!

184
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,487
<i>Questa mano!</i>

185
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,657
<i>Questa mano!</i>

186
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,416
What the hell have we here?

187
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:16,099
-I'll see my sister alone.
-It concerns me too. May I stay?

188
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:20,354
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

189
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,607
-I saw him with you.
-Could I have a drink?

190
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,531
Al, please get him a drink!

191
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:36,620
We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on The Queen.

192
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,540
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

193
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,626
We're getting married first.

194
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:54,513
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

195
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,142
You see your children on weekends.

196
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:04,398
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.

197
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,860
You fly around the world
with men who use you!

198
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:10,487
-You're not my father!
-So why come to me?

199
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:11,989
I need money.

200
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,172
Connie, Connie, Connie...

201
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,181
I want to be reasonable with you.

202
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:41,185
Why don't you stay with the family?

203
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,980
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

204
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,734
You won't be deprived of anything.

205
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:58,660
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

206
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:05,209
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him anymore.

207
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,503
He'll understand, believe me.

208
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,596
Connie.

209
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:23,227
If you don't listen to me
and marry this man,

210
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,442
you'll disappoint me.

211
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:06,228
<i>-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!</i>

212
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,022
What's "Chen dannay"?

213
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:12,025
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.

214
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:16,446
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

215
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,576
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.

216
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,286
Hey...

217
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:26,165
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law,
Deanna.

218
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:27,916
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.

219
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:42,472
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

220
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,725
I know, I know.

221
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:20,177
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.

222
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:24,097
You're justjealous
because he's a real man!

223
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:28,977
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!

224
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:33,023
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

225
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:38,028
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

226
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:41,031
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.

227
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:46,703
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

228
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:53,001
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

229
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,294
Fredo!

230
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:59,216
-I can't control her, Mikey.
-You're my brother, don't apologize.

231
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:07,224
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.

232
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,809
You took over and didn't give it to them.

233
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,143
I welched.

234
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:14,690
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.

235
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:20,404
-He hated them more than I do.
-Frankie, they feel cheated.

236
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:25,492
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains
and you're drinking...

237
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,911
-What's he drinking?
-Champagne.

238
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:33,041
Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgment on how I run my family.

239
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,087
Your family's still called Corleone.

240
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:41,341
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

241
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:45,429
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

242
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,598
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

243
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,766
...with Hyman Roth!

244
00:30:56,106 --> 00:31:00,652
You're a good old man and I like you.

245
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,155
You were loyal to my father for years.

246
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:08,785
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

247
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:15,876
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

248
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,837
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.

249
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,758
-Not touched?
-No, I want you to be fair with them.

250
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:27,888
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

251
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:34,186
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

252
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:38,065
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighborhoods!

253
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:44,655
And everything with them is whores!
Andjunk, dope!

254
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,366
And they leave the gambling to last.

255
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:52,704
I want to run my family without you
on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

256
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,624
<i>-No.
-Morte.</i>

257
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:05,968
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

258
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:12,140
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

259
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,189
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

260
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:24,069
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

261
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:27,406
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

262
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:31,034
or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.

263
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:36,665
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

264
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:43,797
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

265
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,091
Don Corleone.

266
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,260
Cicci, the door...

267
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,854
You want him to leave now?

268
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,903
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

269
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,573
The old man had too much wine.

270
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,079
It's late.

271
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:29,760
How's the baby?

272
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:34,223
-Sleeping inside me.
-Does it feel like a boy?

273
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:37,476
Yes, it does, Michael.

274
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,522
Kay?

275
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:46,193
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

276
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:48,654
It couldn't be helped, though.

277
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:51,949
It made me think
of what you once told me.

278
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:58,038
" In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate. "

279
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,041
That was seven years ago.

280
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:07,297
I know. I'm trying, darling.

281
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,031
Did you see this?

282
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,755
Why are the drapes open?

283
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,326
Kay, are you all right?

284
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:02,079
-Are you hit?
-No.

285
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,708
It's all right.

286
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,504
Stop! Stop!

287
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,799
Halt!

288
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,564
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

289
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,816
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.

290
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,442
Alive!

291
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:35,654
Stay by the door.

292
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:57,069
Yeah, come in.

293
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:07,037
-Mike, are you all right?
-Yeah.

294
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,169
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

295
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:19,299
And I know that's upset you in the past.

296
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:24,596
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

297
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:30,686
But it's because I admire you
and love you

298
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,605
that I kept things secret from you.

299
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:38,235
Now you're the only one I can trust.

300
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,948
Fredo?

301
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,576
Well, he's got a good heart.

302
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:50,247
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

303
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:54,293
Tom, you're my brother.

304
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:05,179
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

305
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:09,641
I know that.

306
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,025
You're going to take over.

307
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:21,320
You're going to be the Don.

308
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,745
If what I think has happened,
has happened, I'm leaving here tonight.

309
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:36,668
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

310
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,049
I'm trusting you
with the lives of my wife

311
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:45,135
and my children,
the future of this family.

312
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,477
-If we catch them, will we find out...
-We won't catch them.

313
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:58,982
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

314
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,779
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

315
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:08,492
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.

316
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:13,163
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

317
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:20,712
See... All our people are businessmen.

318
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:25,509
Their loyalty is based on that.

319
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:30,514
One thing I learned from Pop

320
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:35,352
was to try to think
as people around you think.

321
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:40,315
On that basis, anything is possible.

322
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:46,029
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

323
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:49,366
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

324
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,213
Over here! There's two of them.

325
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,551
Looks like they were hired
out of New York. I don't recognize them.

326
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:10,971
Won't get anything out of them now.

327
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,223
Fish them out.

328
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:40,042
Get rid of the bodies.

329
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:43,086
-Where's Mike?
-Rocco.

330
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:18,580
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

331
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:39,268
-Did you like your party?
-I got lots of presents.

332
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:42,771
I know. Did you like them?

333
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:46,233
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

334
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:49,570
Well, they were friends.

335
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:55,826
-Did you see my present for you?
-It was on my pillow.

336
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:01,498
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

337
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:06,670
-Will you take me?
-No, I can't, Anthony.

338
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:11,675
-Why do you have to go?
-I have to do business.

339
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:15,470
I could help you.

340
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:20,934
I know. Some day you will.

341
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:24,313
Get some sleep.

342
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:43,892
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

343
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:08,750
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

344
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:22,014
I left Naples. I left Mama.

345
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:25,184
For a no-good tramp!

346
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:31,523
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

347
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:36,987
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

348
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:41,158
Without news from home.

349
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:52,169
Finally, a letter from Naples!

350
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:58,050
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

351
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:00,928
She's very beautiful.

352
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:06,433
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

353
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:09,019
Our dear mother -

354
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:13,357
...is dead!

355
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,916
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

356
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:19,339
Sit down, you bum!

357
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:28,098
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

358
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:38,275
We'll go see her backstage.

359
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:42,821
Who was that?

360
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,365
The Black Hand.

361
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:20,359
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.

362
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,820
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

363
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:27,032
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

364
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,701
You'll pay me today!

365
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:41,672
Let's go.

366
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,094
Not my daughter! Let her go!

367
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,681
Here, take all my money!

368
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:01,358
Vito, come on.

369
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:11,076
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

370
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:15,080
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

371
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,541
Even my father, in the grocery store.

372
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,042
If he's Italian...

373
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:23,547
...why does he bother other Italians?

374
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,049
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

375
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:28,302
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

376
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:30,262
If you're happy, I'm happy.

377
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,354
Don't you feel well?

378
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,235
Is your boss treating you all right?

379
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:29,988
Forget it.

380
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,921
Hey, you speak Italian?

381
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,011
Hide this for me!

382
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:55,681
Next week I'll come and get it!

383
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:37,681
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

384
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:44,688
How's business?

385
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,905
It's good, it's good.

386
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:02,956
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

387
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:07,127
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

388
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:09,546
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

389
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:17,679
So Fanucci's changing?

390
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,557
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

391
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:23,727
Even from my father.

392
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:27,815
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

393
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,182
I've got some bad news.

394
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,939
I feel rotten about telling you this...

395
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,779
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...

396
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:25,414
And you have to give him my job.

397
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:29,668
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

398
00:53:30,878 --> 00:53:33,005
You looked after me like a father.

399
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:34,882
I thank you.

400
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,468
And I won't forget it.

401
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,817
Vito!

402
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,740
Oh, no!

403
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:03,202
Take this to your family.

404
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:07,915
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

405
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:45,077
What a nice pear!

406
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,103
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

407
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:16,233
Did you look inside?

408
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:20,612
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

409
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:36,253
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

410
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:46,805
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

411
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:52,352
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

412
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:02,529
Yeah, sure.

413
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:04,615
My wife would like it.

414
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:31,558
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

415
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,439
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

416
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:44,196
Well, he won't mind.

417
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:56,875
Come on in.

418
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:01,088
Hey, Vito, come on in!

419
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,028
This is your friend's place?

420
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,700
This is a real palace.

421
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,910
One of the best.

422
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,544
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

423
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,038
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

424
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:09,980
Come on in.

425
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:15,360
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

426
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:20,324
-Would you like a tuna sandwich?
-No, thank you.

427
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:30,375
<i>...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...</i>

428
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:35,214
-Mr. Roth?
-Come in, Michael.

429
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:39,718
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

430
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:43,639
It's almost over.

431
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:50,270
-Do you follow the football game?
-Not for a while I haven't.

432
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,941
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

433
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:59,112
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

434
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:06,453
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

435
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,377
I heard you had some trouble.

436
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,923
Stupid.

437
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:22,052
People behaving like that with guns.

438
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:26,723
The important thing is you're all right.

439
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:29,935
Good health is the most important thing.

440
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:33,814
More than success, more than money.

441
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:37,025
More than power.

442
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,377
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

443
01:03:55,544 --> 01:03:59,548
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

444
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:03,719
Nobody wants another war.

445
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:09,641
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

446
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:13,520
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.

447
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:15,606
I'll visit him soon.

448
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:20,527
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.

449
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:24,114
Nothing is more important.

450
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:31,079
-You're a wise and considerate man.
-And you're a great man, Mr. Roth.

451
01:04:31,997 --> 01:04:37,002
-There's much I can learn from you.
-Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

452
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:41,924
-Excuse me. Lunch.
-Come in.

453
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:46,845
-Thank you, my dear.
-You're going to break your eardrums.

454
01:04:47,888 --> 01:04:50,349
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

455
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,732
You're young, I'm old and sick.

456
01:04:59,817 --> 01:05:03,821
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

457
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:07,991
It's never been done before.

458
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:12,746
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

459
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:19,294
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

460
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:23,674
He's small potatoes.

461
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:35,853
What's up?

462
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,607
We got company?

463
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:55,706
What's going on?

464
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:57,875
Michael Corleone is here.

465
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:01,295
Where is he?

466
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:03,213
He's in your den. You better hurry.

467
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:05,966
He's been waiting a half hour.

468
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,350
Is something wrong?

469
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,233
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

470
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:27,237
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.

471
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:38,832
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died. We were so relieved...

472
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:41,084
In my home!

473
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:47,007
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

474
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:52,137
Where my children come to play.

475
01:06:53,806 --> 01:06:55,849
In my home.

476
01:07:12,908 --> 01:07:15,828
I want you to help me take my revenge.

477
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:19,581
Michael, anything. What can I do?

478
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:26,046
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

479
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:28,715
I don't understand. I don't...

480
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:33,804
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

481
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:38,684
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.

482
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:43,564
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?

483
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:52,781
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

484
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:57,077
I know it was him.

485
01:07:58,078 --> 01:08:00,205
Jesus Christ, Mike.

486
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:05,085
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

487
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:13,051
This used to be my father's old study.

488
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:16,513
It's changed.

489
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:21,685
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

490
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:30,068
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.

491
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:41,371
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

492
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:46,460
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

493
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:52,799
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

494
01:08:57,137 --> 01:09:03,227
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer. "

495
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:09,483
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor,

496
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:13,028
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

497
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:18,283
That's what I want him to think.

498
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:23,121
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

499
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:27,751
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

500
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:58,740
<i>-Yeah?
-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.</i>

501
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:03,287
<i>-We need some more help.
-Johnny?</i>

502
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:07,249
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

503
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:10,127
<i>-Who's that, honey?
-Listen good, Fredo.</i>

504
01:10:10,294 --> 01:10:13,505
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

505
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:17,050
<i>Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.</i>

506
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:19,303
<i>-Oh, God.
-Will he come alone?</i>

507
01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:22,639
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

508
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:27,978
<i>Everything will be all right. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.</i>

509
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:32,566
<i>All we want to know is if he's on
the level, or if he'll bring his boys.</i>

510
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:35,861
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me anymore.

511
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:40,908
<i>-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

512
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:55,339
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.

513
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:06,725
-Frankie, I've got nobody here.
-Wait in the car, Cicc'.

514
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:09,520
-Frankie.
-That's okay, Cicc'.

515
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:20,823
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.

516
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:26,328
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

517
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:34,503
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

518
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:38,882
-You won't regret it.
-I don't like the C note, Rosato.

519
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,635
I take that as an insult.

520
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:44,721
Michael Corleone says hello!

521
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:04,241
Close the door!

522
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:06,368
Your friend the cop...

523
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:11,039
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

524
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:14,960
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

525
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:19,381
What's the matter?

526
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:22,551
-Is that something on the floor?
-Carmine, not here!

527
01:12:22,634 --> 01:12:24,136
Anthony!

528
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:31,101
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

529
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:19,274
Freddy, it's good to see you.

530
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:26,448
-How is he?
-He's okay. He's in the back.

531
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,663
Girls, take a hike.

532
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:37,835
In this room here.

533
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:44,216
-I want to talk to him alone first.
-Come on.

534
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,686
I thought I could help you, Senator.

535
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:01,358
Hagen?

536
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:06,697
-Listen, I did not...
-It's all right.

537
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:11,618
-I didn't do anything.
-It's okay. You're very lucky.

538
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:17,082
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

539
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:22,212
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

540
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,468
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

541
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:33,807
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?

542
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,229
I passed out.

543
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:58,457
Just a game. Jesus.

544
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:11,470
Jesus, Jesus!

545
01:15:16,016 --> 01:15:18,185
Jesus God!

546
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:19,895
God!

547
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:26,527
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

548
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,822
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

549
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:35,410
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.

550
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:41,166
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

551
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:45,879
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.

552
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:53,637
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

553
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:58,559
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

554
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:01,645
It'll be as though she never existed.

555
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:06,942
All that's left is our friendship.

556
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:25,210
-Yes?
-Sorry, but we're not to let you through.

557
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:30,591
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.

558
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:33,760
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr. Hagen's. He's coming.

559
01:16:33,844 --> 01:16:36,305
I'll speak to him.

560
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:45,689
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

561
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:50,194
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.

562
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:55,616
-So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
-No, within the compound will be fine.

563
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:58,660
-We were going to New England.
-That's off.

564
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,623
-Am I a prisoner?
-That's not how we see it, Kay.

565
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:06,835
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

566
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:10,214
Joe.

567
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:57,719
Cuba, Cuba!

568
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:41,847
Most respected gentlemen.

569
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:44,141
Welcome to Havana.

570
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:51,440
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists

571
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:56,111
for continuing to work with Cuba

572
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,990
for the greatest period of prosperity

573
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:03,660
in her entire history.

574
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:06,079
Mr. William Shaw,

575
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:08,999
representing
the General Fruit Company.

576
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:12,002
Messrs. Corngold and Dant,

577
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:15,839
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

578
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:18,634
Mr. Petty,

579
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:22,679
Regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

580
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:27,351
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

581
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:31,563
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada,

582
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:37,736
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

583
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:41,448
And my old friend and associate
from Florida,

584
01:19:43,075 --> 01:19:44,910
Mr. Hyman Roth.

585
01:19:45,202 --> 01:19:50,374
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.

586
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:57,881
A solid gold telephone.

587
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:03,762
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

588
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:06,390
-Mr. President?
-Yes?

589
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:12,146
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?

590
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:13,856
-Of course.
-Heavy stuff.

591
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:19,611
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas,

592
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:32,040
my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara

593
01:20:32,124 --> 01:20:34,168
before the New Year.

594
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:37,963
I want to put you all at ease.

595
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:43,051
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

596
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:03,530
He said that they're making an arrest,

597
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:06,366
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

598
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,534
Johnny...

599
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:08,660
It's nothing.

600
01:21:09,453 --> 01:21:12,122
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

601
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:16,668
<i>Viva Fidel!</i>

602
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:37,356
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

603
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:42,361
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

604
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:48,033
I'm very pleased

605
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:52,746
you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

606
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:57,167
When a man comes
to this point in his life,

607
01:21:58,544 --> 01:22:01,922
he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

608
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:07,136
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had

609
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:13,642
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

610
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:16,395
-Not for years.
-Hear, hear!

611
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,691
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

612
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:26,947
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana

613
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:30,117
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

614
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,955
This kind of government knows
how to help business, to encourage it.

615
01:22:35,038 --> 01:22:39,084
The hotels here are bigger
and swankier

616
01:22:39,168 --> 01:22:41,545
than any of the joints in Vegas.

617
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:45,132
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government

618
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:49,970
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis

619
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:52,890
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.

620
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:57,436
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed...

621
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:00,314
Real partnership with a government.

622
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:02,399
Smaller piece.

623
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:08,030
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

624
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:11,825
At the time of my retirement, or death,

625
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:17,831
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

626
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:21,752
But, all of you will share.

627
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:25,714
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

628
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:29,176
the Capri to the Corleone family,

629
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:31,678
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

630
01:23:31,762 --> 01:23:35,349
but Eddie Levine will bring in the
Pennino brothers,

631
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:37,684
Dino and Eddie, for a piece

632
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:40,521
and to handle the casino operations.

633
01:23:40,604 --> 01:23:44,066
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

634
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:47,903
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

635
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:55,035
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

636
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:57,579
<i>-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!</i>

637
01:23:58,789 --> 01:24:01,542
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

638
01:24:02,835 --> 01:24:06,004
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

639
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:10,551
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.

640
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:14,221
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

641
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:18,142
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.

642
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:24,731
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

643
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:28,610
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.

644
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:34,658
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

645
01:24:34,741 --> 01:24:38,537
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

646
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,416
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

647
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:45,085
The trucks were owned by your father.

648
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,796
Michael.

649
01:24:54,845 --> 01:24:59,016
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

650
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:03,770
The two million never got to the island.

651
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:12,529
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money

652
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:15,115
because you worried about the rebels.

653
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:25,209
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

654
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,678
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

655
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:43,393
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

656
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:49,483
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

657
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:53,320
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

658
01:25:54,029 --> 01:25:57,574
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

659
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:02,204
90 miles. It's nothing.

660
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:08,418
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

661
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:12,089
and having the cash
to make it possible.

662
01:26:12,506 --> 01:26:14,049
Michael,

663
01:26:15,926 --> 01:26:18,345
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

664
01:26:45,122 --> 01:26:48,125
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

665
01:26:49,418 --> 01:26:54,131
<i>-Hi! Freddy Corleone.
-Mio frati.</i>

666
01:26:55,382 --> 01:26:57,426
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

667
01:26:57,885 --> 01:27:01,138
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".

668
01:27:01,555 --> 01:27:06,059
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

669
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:12,107
-Excuse me.
-It's okay.

670
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:15,944
You want to count it?

671
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:23,952
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.

672
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:28,832
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.

673
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:33,337
That's great! Havana's great.

674
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,007
It's my kind of town.

675
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:43,055
-Anybody I know in Havana?
-Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

676
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:48,644
No. I've never met them.

677
01:27:52,231 --> 01:27:56,276
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

678
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:04,701
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

679
01:28:05,369 --> 01:28:08,038
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

680
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:12,251
I know a place where
we can spend some time together.

681
01:28:14,294 --> 01:28:18,882
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

682
01:28:19,925 --> 01:28:22,803
Have kids. Have a family.

683
01:28:25,013 --> 01:28:28,892
For once in my life, be more like

684
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:31,436
Pop.

685
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:38,360
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

686
01:28:38,527 --> 01:28:41,655
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me. "

687
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:45,284
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies. "

688
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,494
Sometimes I think it's true.

689
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:50,581
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

690
01:28:51,915 --> 01:28:55,752
Mikey, I was mad at you.

691
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:07,014
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

692
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:09,766
You want a drink, right? Waiter!

693
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:16,023
<i>Por favor...</i>

694
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:20,277
-How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
-Banana Daiquiri.

695
01:29:20,444 --> 01:29:22,738
-That's it?
-That's it.

696
01:29:22,821 --> 01:29:24,907
Uno Banana Daiquiri

697
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:28,202
and a club soda.

698
01:29:35,959 --> 01:29:38,712
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow

699
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:41,340
with some government people.

700
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:45,093
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

701
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:51,099
-That's my specialty, right?
-Can I trust you with something?

702
01:29:51,809 --> 01:29:54,311
Of course, Mike.

703
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,234
Later in the evening we're all invited
to the Presidential Palace

704
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:02,069
to bring in the New Year.

705
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:08,242
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car, alone.

706
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:10,077
For my protection.

707
01:30:11,078 --> 01:30:14,706
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

708
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:35,644
-Who?
-Roth.

709
01:30:41,525 --> 01:30:44,361
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

710
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,615
It was Roth all along.

711
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:52,703
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

712
01:30:53,745 --> 01:30:56,915
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

713
01:31:01,795 --> 01:31:06,425
-How can I help?
-Just go along, as if you know nothing.

714
01:31:06,508 --> 01:31:09,219
-I've already made my move.
-What move?

715
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:12,890
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

716
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:34,328
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

717
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,788
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.

718
01:31:36,872 --> 01:31:39,291
I don't trust a doctor
who can't speak English.

719
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:43,670
<i>-Gracias, señor.
-Buenas noches.</i>

720
01:31:45,506 --> 01:31:49,218
-Honey, go to the casino.
-If you're feeling better.

721
01:31:49,384 --> 01:31:51,053
Feel fine.

722
01:31:52,888 --> 01:31:57,059
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

723
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:04,566
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

724
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:13,617
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to... Just want to wait.

725
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:20,707
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.

726
01:32:20,874 --> 01:32:24,461
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.

727
01:32:25,087 --> 01:32:30,843
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.

728
01:32:31,009 --> 01:32:34,179
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

729
01:32:35,139 --> 01:32:36,723
I know I didn't.

730
01:32:44,648 --> 01:32:49,736
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

731
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:56,368
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

732
01:32:56,451 --> 01:33:00,289
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

733
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:06,170
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

734
01:33:06,253 --> 01:33:09,339
Made a fortune. Your father, too.

735
01:33:11,008 --> 01:33:17,014
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

736
01:33:19,725 --> 01:33:25,647
Later on he had an idea to build a city

737
01:33:25,731 --> 01:33:29,526
out of a desert stop-over
for G. I.s going to the West Coast.

738
01:33:31,403 --> 01:33:35,157
That kid's name was Moe Greene

739
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:38,911
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

740
01:33:40,329 --> 01:33:42,789
This was a great man.

741
01:33:42,873 --> 01:33:45,292
A man of vision and guts.

742
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:51,632
And there isn't even a plaque,
signpost or statue of him in that town.

743
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:57,262
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

744
01:33:58,472 --> 01:34:00,808
No one knows who gave the order.

745
01:34:01,809 --> 01:34:05,103
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

746
01:34:05,229 --> 01:34:11,151
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

747
01:34:11,235 --> 01:34:16,073
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

748
01:34:17,825 --> 01:34:20,994
And I said to myself,

749
01:34:21,078 --> 01:34:25,082
"This is the business we've chosen. "

750
01:34:25,165 --> 01:34:27,417
I didn't ask

751
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:33,173
who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

752
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:46,228
That two million in a bag in your room...

753
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:52,151
I'm going in to take a nap.

754
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:58,073
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.

755
01:34:58,657 --> 01:35:01,785
If it isn't, I know I don't.

756
01:35:56,799 --> 01:36:00,969
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

757
01:36:01,136 --> 01:36:04,306
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

758
01:36:04,389 --> 01:36:07,351
Senator Payton from Florida...

759
01:36:07,643 --> 01:36:10,813
Judge DeMalco from New York...

760
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:13,816
Senator Ream from Maryland...

761
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:16,443
Fred Corngold from UTT.

762
01:36:16,527 --> 01:36:20,447
-That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
-He does?

763
01:36:20,531 --> 01:36:22,908
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

764
01:36:22,991 --> 01:36:27,454
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

765
01:36:27,538 --> 01:36:31,416
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas.

766
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,336
-That you got! Con gusto...
-Johnny!

767
01:36:35,504 --> 01:36:39,091
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

768
01:36:39,258 --> 01:36:42,886
-We never met. Johnny Ola.
-Pleasure.

769
01:36:44,096 --> 01:36:46,557
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

770
01:36:46,723 --> 01:36:48,350
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

771
01:36:48,517 --> 01:36:51,436
<i>-Feliz Año Nuevo!
-Happy New Year.</i>

772
01:37:03,115 --> 01:37:07,244
-Hey, Freddy, why are we standing?
-Everybody stands.

773
01:37:07,411 --> 01:37:11,999
-It's worth it. You won't believe this.
-I don't believe it already.

774
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:15,252
-50 dollars, right?
-You've got a bet, mister.

775
01:37:23,427 --> 01:37:24,928
That's Superman.

776
01:37:58,921 --> 01:38:01,173
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

777
01:38:02,883 --> 01:38:05,511
-I don't believe it!
-It's got to be fake.

778
01:38:05,677 --> 01:38:08,972
It's real. That's why
he's called Superman.

779
01:38:09,473 --> 01:38:13,519
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

780
01:38:13,602 --> 01:38:18,023
Johnny Ola brought me here. I didn't
believe it, but seeing is believing!

781
01:38:18,106 --> 01:38:21,568
-I see it, but still don't believe it!
-50 bucks, Pat.

782
01:38:21,652 --> 01:38:25,239
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

783
01:38:26,156 --> 01:38:31,119
-Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
-I want to see him break a brick!

784
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:56,455
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.

785
01:40:45,587 --> 01:40:48,006
...and you'll continue to get those.

786
01:40:48,173 --> 01:40:52,594
I don't believe that President
Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba

787
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:56,390
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

788
01:40:59,893 --> 01:41:03,188
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

789
01:41:03,272 --> 01:41:06,191
Fredo! Where are you going?

790
01:41:06,275 --> 01:41:09,903
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

791
01:42:05,459 --> 01:42:09,004
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.

792
01:42:09,087 --> 01:42:12,633
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

793
01:42:14,051 --> 01:42:18,972
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.

794
01:42:34,404 --> 01:42:37,741
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

795
01:43:52,649 --> 01:43:56,820
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

796
01:43:56,987 --> 01:43:59,615
Don't make a big thing about it.

797
01:44:02,993 --> 01:44:06,830
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

798
01:44:08,332 --> 01:44:10,125
You broke my heart!

799
01:44:50,332 --> 01:44:54,878
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

800
01:44:55,796 --> 01:44:58,132
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

801
01:45:00,509 --> 01:45:04,680
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

802
01:45:05,389 --> 01:45:08,559
And I shall leave the city immediately.

803
01:45:12,813 --> 01:45:15,816
I wish all of you good luck.

804
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:26,243
<i>Salud!</i>

805
01:45:27,452 --> 01:45:30,873
<i>Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!</i>

806
01:45:52,728 --> 01:45:54,271
Fredo!

807
01:45:54,938 --> 01:45:58,901
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

808
01:45:59,485 --> 01:46:01,445
Roth is dead.

809
01:46:02,237 --> 01:46:06,450
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

810
01:46:07,576 --> 01:46:09,077
Fredo!

811
01:46:33,685 --> 01:46:36,522
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

812
01:47:07,553 --> 01:47:09,513
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

813
01:47:49,803 --> 01:47:53,390
Al. Get me a wet towel.

814
01:47:59,855 --> 01:48:02,733
Does Kay know I'm back?

815
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:09,907
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

816
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:13,410
-I took care of it.
-What was it, so I'll know.

817
01:48:13,577 --> 01:48:18,624
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.

818
01:48:21,126 --> 01:48:23,253
Thank you, Al.

819
01:48:24,338 --> 01:48:27,883
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

820
01:48:44,942 --> 01:48:46,693
Where's my brother?

821
01:48:47,611 --> 01:48:50,823
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

822
01:48:50,906 --> 01:48:55,577
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.

823
01:48:55,661 --> 01:48:57,579
I asked about Fredo.

824
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:01,959
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

825
01:49:04,962 --> 01:49:06,380
All right.

826
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:10,425
I want you to get in touch with him.

827
01:49:10,509 --> 01:49:13,345
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

828
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:18,809
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.

829
01:49:19,726 --> 01:49:23,981
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.

830
01:49:24,982 --> 01:49:26,483
What?

831
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:35,284
What? Come on.

832
01:49:37,327 --> 01:49:39,621
Kay had a miscarriage.

833
01:49:52,551 --> 01:49:54,928
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...

834
01:49:55,012 --> 01:49:57,931
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?

835
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:04,646
I really don't know.

836
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:22,873
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

837
01:51:08,252 --> 01:51:11,964
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

838
01:51:12,297 --> 01:51:16,093
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

839
01:51:16,677 --> 01:51:18,720
You know I've got three daughters.

840
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:20,848
This is my neighborhood.

841
01:51:21,723 --> 01:51:25,102
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

842
01:51:26,228 --> 01:51:29,940
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

843
01:51:32,276 --> 01:51:35,946
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

844
01:51:36,613 --> 01:51:41,118
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

845
01:51:41,493 --> 01:51:46,582
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

846
01:51:48,876 --> 01:51:51,295
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

847
01:51:51,753 --> 01:51:54,298
And your family will be ruined.

848
01:51:55,466 --> 01:52:00,804
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

849
01:52:01,472 --> 01:52:05,476
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

850
01:52:05,809 --> 01:52:07,644
Now don't refuse me.

851
01:52:09,605 --> 01:52:11,315
Understand, paisan?

852
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:19,281
I understand.

853
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:26,371
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

854
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:32,127
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

855
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:38,634
Don't be afraid to tell them!

856
01:52:41,011 --> 01:52:42,805
600 bucks...

857
01:52:43,096 --> 01:52:45,349
Suppose we don't pay?

858
01:52:46,517 --> 01:52:49,978
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

859
01:52:50,729 --> 01:52:54,149
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

860
01:52:55,025 --> 01:52:58,529
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.

861
01:52:59,238 --> 01:53:01,198
$200 each...everybody agreed?

862
01:53:05,702 --> 01:53:07,204
Why do we have to pay him?

863
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:10,124
Vito, leave this to us.

864
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:14,211
He's one person, we're three.

865
01:53:14,503 --> 01:53:17,172
He's got guns, we've got guns.

866
01:53:17,714 --> 01:53:21,051
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

867
01:53:21,301 --> 01:53:23,512
This is his neighborhood!

868
01:53:25,222 --> 01:53:29,726
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

869
01:53:30,227 --> 01:53:31,770
Who?

870
01:53:32,146 --> 01:53:36,150
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.

871
01:53:36,233 --> 01:53:37,734
They don't pay Fanucci.

872
01:53:39,528 --> 01:53:44,408
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

873
01:53:45,576 --> 01:53:49,580
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

874
01:54:05,095 --> 01:54:07,931
Now what I say stays in this room.

875
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:12,978
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

876
01:54:16,148 --> 01:54:19,485
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

877
01:54:22,112 --> 01:54:24,448
If Fanucci says $200...

878
01:54:24,531 --> 01:54:25,949
...he means it, Vito!

879
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:29,411
I'll reason with him.

880
01:54:31,538 --> 01:54:33,540
Leave everything to me.

881
01:54:34,166 --> 01:54:36,251
I'll take care of everything.

882
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,464
I never lie to my friends.

883
01:54:41,298 --> 01:54:44,218
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

884
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:47,095
He'll ask for the money.

885
01:54:48,013 --> 01:54:52,643
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

886
01:54:53,811 --> 01:54:56,480
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

887
01:54:58,690 --> 01:55:01,485
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

888
01:55:02,277 --> 01:55:04,822
How can you get him to take less?

889
01:55:05,572 --> 01:55:07,699
That's my business.

890
01:55:08,033 --> 01:55:11,411
Just remember that I did you a favor.

891
01:55:15,833 --> 01:55:17,417
Is it a deal?

892
01:55:18,502 --> 01:55:19,503
Yes.

893
01:56:07,384 --> 01:56:09,761
His family's out of the house.

894
01:56:10,137 --> 01:56:12,431
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

895
01:56:17,352 --> 01:56:21,064
<i>Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.</i>

896
01:56:32,117 --> 01:56:34,703
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

897
01:56:38,123 --> 01:56:42,419
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

898
01:57:15,452 --> 01:57:20,165
It looks like there's -
$ 100 under my hat.

899
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:34,221
I was right.

900
01:57:35,639 --> 01:57:37,432
Only $ 100...

901
01:57:40,811 --> 01:57:43,063
I'm short of money right now.

902
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:49,528
I've been out of work...so just
give me a little time.

903
01:57:50,404 --> 01:57:52,614
You understand, don't you?

904
01:58:00,831 --> 01:58:03,459
You've got balls, young man!

905
01:58:05,461 --> 01:58:08,505
How come I never heard
of you before?

906
01:58:15,012 --> 01:58:17,431
You've got a lot of guts.

907
01:58:21,393 --> 01:58:24,354
I'll find you some work
for good money.

908
01:58:35,741 --> 01:58:39,995
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

909
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:45,209
You've done well for yourself.

910
01:58:49,129 --> 01:58:51,215
Enjoy the festa!

911
02:01:00,511 --> 02:01:02,846
Oh, this is too violent for me!

912
02:03:24,863 --> 02:03:26,323
What've you got there?

913
02:06:04,982 --> 02:06:08,944
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

914
02:09:34,024 --> 02:09:37,653
<i>Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,</i>

915
02:09:37,736 --> 02:09:41,240
<i>you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?</i>

916
02:09:41,698 --> 02:09:43,325
<i>That's right.</i>

917
02:09:44,201 --> 02:09:48,413
<i>But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization.</i>

918
02:09:51,375 --> 02:09:55,212
<i>No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.</i>

919
02:09:55,587 --> 02:09:58,090
<i>What was your position?</i>

920
02:09:59,007 --> 02:10:02,261
<i>At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.</i>

921
02:10:02,344 --> 02:10:05,264
<i>-What is that?
-A button, you know, Senator.</i>

922
02:10:05,347 --> 02:10:07,766
<i>No, I don't know. Tell me.</i>

923
02:10:09,309 --> 02:10:14,898
<i>When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?</i>

924
02:10:14,982 --> 02:10:16,358
<i>Mr. Questadt.</i>

925
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:19,069
<i>-You mean you kill people?
-What?</i>

926
02:10:19,153 --> 02:10:24,283
<i>You kill people at
the behest of your superiors.</i>

927
02:10:28,078 --> 02:10:29,580
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

928
02:10:29,663 --> 02:10:35,002
<i>And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?</i>

929
02:10:35,085 --> 02:10:38,213
<i>Yeah, Counselor. Michael Corleone.</i>

930
02:10:38,297 --> 02:10:42,134
<i>Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?</i>

931
02:10:42,926 --> 02:10:45,012
<i>No, I never talked to him.</i>

932
02:10:45,095 --> 02:10:49,016
<i>Mr. Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?</i>

933
02:10:49,099 --> 02:10:52,436
<i>-Do what?
-Could you expand on your answer?</i>

934
02:10:52,519 --> 02:10:58,317
<i>I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?</i>

935
02:10:58,442 --> 02:11:02,988
<i>Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.</i>

936
02:11:03,071 --> 02:11:07,534
<i>Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!</i>

937
02:11:09,411 --> 02:11:13,582
<i>You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.</i>

938
02:11:41,819 --> 02:11:43,987
Tell me something, Ma.

939
02:11:48,117 --> 02:11:51,787
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

940
02:11:58,377 --> 02:12:00,254
He was being strong...

941
02:12:06,718 --> 02:12:08,345
Strong for his family.

942
02:12:18,147 --> 02:12:20,816
But by being strong for his family...

943
02:12:22,317 --> 02:12:24,153
...could he...

944
02:12:26,071 --> 02:12:27,364
...lose it?

945
02:12:29,324 --> 02:12:34,705
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

946
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:39,835
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

947
02:12:41,545 --> 02:12:43,380
No, I meant...lose his family

948
02:12:47,718 --> 02:12:51,221
But you can never lose your family.

949
02:13:00,731 --> 02:13:02,566
Times are changing.

950
02:13:25,088 --> 02:13:27,549
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

951
02:13:28,342 --> 02:13:30,052
Take it as a gift.

952
02:13:32,971 --> 02:13:37,142
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

953
02:13:53,784 --> 02:13:56,662
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

954
02:13:59,623 --> 02:14:03,127
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

955
02:14:05,796 --> 02:14:07,798
She's in bad trouble.

956
02:14:08,465 --> 02:14:12,469
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

957
02:14:13,929 --> 02:14:16,181
He told her to get rid of the animal.

958
02:14:17,808 --> 02:14:21,979
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

959
02:14:22,604 --> 02:14:26,400
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

960
02:14:29,278 --> 02:14:32,114
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

961
02:14:32,781 --> 02:14:34,450
I'm so ashamed!

962
02:14:34,825 --> 02:14:39,288
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

963
02:14:42,124 --> 02:14:43,709
I'm sorry, but...

964
02:14:45,711 --> 02:14:49,173
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

965
02:14:50,007 --> 02:14:51,467
I can't move!

966
02:14:52,843 --> 02:14:54,761
I want you to talk to him!

967
02:14:55,345 --> 02:14:58,015
Tell him I want to stay here!

968
02:15:05,814 --> 02:15:07,399
What's your landlord's name?

969
02:15:07,858 --> 02:15:09,902
His name is Signor Roberto.

970
02:15:10,486 --> 02:15:12,905
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

971
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:16,450
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

972
02:15:17,534 --> 02:15:19,077
A real pig-sty, eh?

973
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:42,142
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

974
02:15:43,060 --> 02:15:46,355
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

975
02:15:46,897 --> 02:15:51,151
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

976
02:15:51,401 --> 02:15:55,447
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

977
02:15:55,823 --> 02:15:59,451
I already rented the place
to another family.

978
02:16:04,998 --> 02:16:09,628
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

979
02:16:10,879 --> 02:16:14,758
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

980
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:17,219
So let her stay.

981
02:16:17,302 --> 02:16:18,929
Impossible.

982
02:16:19,805 --> 02:16:21,140
Are you Sicilian?

983
02:16:21,557 --> 02:16:23,225
No, I'm Calabrese.

984
02:16:23,892 --> 02:16:27,187
We're practically paisan,
do me this favor.

985
02:16:27,771 --> 02:16:30,440
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

986
02:16:31,441 --> 02:16:33,735
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

987
02:16:34,278 --> 02:16:36,697
How much more a month?

988
02:16:37,823 --> 02:16:38,907
Five bucks.

989
02:16:43,787 --> 02:16:46,832
Here's six months increase in advance.

990
02:16:47,708 --> 02:16:50,794
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

991
02:16:51,253 --> 02:16:53,839
Come see me in another six months.

992
02:16:55,299 --> 02:16:58,302
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

993
02:16:59,094 --> 02:17:00,220
The dog stays.

994
02:17:04,808 --> 02:17:08,145
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

995
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:12,566
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

996
02:17:15,027 --> 02:17:16,779
Do me this favor.

997
02:17:17,654 --> 02:17:19,740
I won't forget it.

998
02:17:20,574 --> 02:17:23,869
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

999
02:17:24,995 --> 02:17:27,664
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

1000
02:17:34,505 --> 02:17:36,423
What a character!

1001
02:17:44,348 --> 02:17:49,269
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

1002
02:17:56,860 --> 02:18:00,197
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

1003
02:18:08,205 --> 02:18:10,999
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

1004
02:18:12,126 --> 02:18:14,378
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

1005
02:18:16,296 --> 02:18:18,340
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

1006
02:18:19,675 --> 02:18:22,594
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

1007
02:18:28,809 --> 02:18:31,728
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

1008
02:18:33,438 --> 02:18:39,194
Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!

1009
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:44,825
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

1010
02:18:53,417 --> 02:18:55,169
Can I sit down?

1011
02:18:58,213 --> 02:19:01,216
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

1012
02:19:02,259 --> 02:19:05,262
The rent stays like before!

1013
02:19:14,855 --> 02:19:16,315
I'll even lower it.

1014
02:19:19,151 --> 02:19:20,444
I'll lower it $5.

1015
02:19:24,782 --> 02:19:26,325
I'll lower it $ 10!

1016
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:34,875
Can I offer you some coffee?

1017
02:19:37,252 --> 02:19:41,882
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

1018
02:19:47,304 --> 02:19:49,765
You'll have to excuse me for now.

1019
02:19:55,145 --> 02:19:57,272
I wish I could stay longer!

1020
02:20:03,237 --> 02:20:05,656
Just call me and I'll be here!

1021
02:20:16,667 --> 02:20:19,503
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1022
02:20:35,185 --> 02:20:40,023
-Vito, what do you think?
-We'll make a big business!

1023
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:50,200
<i>-New York City.
-Would you speak up, please?</i>

1024
02:20:50,909 --> 02:20:52,578
<i>New York City.</i>

1025
02:20:52,661 --> 02:20:56,290
<i>-Are you the son of Vito CorIeone?
-Yes, I am.</i>

1026
02:20:56,373 --> 02:21:00,043
<i>-Where was he born?
-CorIeone, SiciIy.</i>

1027
02:21:00,210 --> 02:21:06,133
<i>Did he at times use an aIias that was
known in certain circIes as Godfather?</i>

1028
02:21:06,925 --> 02:21:13,098
<i>Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.</i>

1029
02:21:13,932 --> 02:21:18,395
<i>Mr. Chairman, I wouId Iike to verify
the witness' statement.</i>

1030
02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:23,567
<i>For years many of my constituents
have been of ItaIian descent.</i>

1031
02:21:23,901 --> 02:21:26,320
<i>I've come to know them weII.</i>

1032
02:21:26,445 --> 02:21:30,657
<i>They have honored me
with their support and their friendship.</i>

1033
02:21:30,783 --> 02:21:35,996
<i>I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are ItaIian-Americans.</i>

1034
02:21:37,247 --> 02:21:42,252
<i>However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunateIy
I have to Ieave these proceedings</i>

1035
02:21:42,419 --> 02:21:46,632
<i>in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.</i>

1036
02:21:47,758 --> 02:21:50,761
<i>Before I Ieave, I do want to say this,</i>

1037
02:21:50,844 --> 02:21:55,140
<i>that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever</i>

1038
02:21:55,224 --> 02:21:57,851
<i>a sIur upon the great ItaIian peopIe.</i>

1039
02:21:57,935 --> 02:22:01,104
<i>I can state from my own knowIedge
and experience</i>

1040
02:22:01,188 --> 02:22:06,360
<i>that ItaIian-Americans are among
the most IoyaI, most Iaw-abiding,</i>

1041
02:22:06,443 --> 02:22:09,947
<i>patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this Iand.</i>

1042
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:16,036
<i>It wouId be a shame, Mr. Chairman,
if we aIIowed a few rotten appIes</i>

1043
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:18,372
<i>to give a bad name to the whoIe barreI.</i>

1044
02:22:18,455 --> 02:22:24,044
<i>Because from the time of Christopher
CoIumbus to the time of Enrico Fermi</i>

1045
02:22:24,128 --> 02:22:26,255
<i>to the present day,</i>

1046
02:22:26,421 --> 02:22:30,676
<i>ItaIian-Americans have been pioneers
in buiIding and defending our nation.</i>

1047
02:22:31,135 --> 02:22:36,348
<i>They are the saIt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.</i>

1048
02:22:42,437 --> 02:22:46,233
<i>I'm sure we aII agree
with our esteemed coIIeague.</i>

1049
02:22:46,316 --> 02:22:50,612
<i>Mr. CorIeone, you have been advised
as to your IegaI rights.</i>

1050
02:22:50,696 --> 02:22:56,160
<i>We have testimony from
a previous witness, one WiIIi Cicci.</i>

1051
02:22:57,161 --> 02:23:01,582
<i>He stated that you are head of the most
powerfuI Mafia famiIy in the country.</i>

1052
02:23:01,665 --> 02:23:03,959
<i>-Are you?
-No, I'm not.</i>

1053
02:23:04,042 --> 02:23:07,337
<i>He testified that you are
personaIIy responsibIe</i>

1054
02:23:07,421 --> 02:23:11,425
<i>for the murder of a New York
poIice captain in 1947</i>

1055
02:23:11,508 --> 02:23:15,095
<i>and with him a man
named VirgiI SoIIozzo.</i>

1056
02:23:15,262 --> 02:23:17,764
<i>-Do you deny this?
-Yes, I do.</i>

1057
02:23:17,931 --> 02:23:21,018
<i>Is it true that in the year 1950</i>

1058
02:23:21,101 --> 02:23:26,482
<i>you devised the murder of the heads
of "the Five FamiIies" in New York</i>

1059
02:23:26,565 --> 02:23:30,152
<i>to assume and consoIidate
your nefarious power?</i>

1060
02:23:30,235 --> 02:23:33,572
<i>-It's a compIete faIsehood.
-Mr. Questadt.</i>

1061
02:23:33,697 --> 02:23:38,410
<i>Is it true you have a controIIing interest
in three major hoteIs in Las Vegas?</i>

1062
02:23:39,536 --> 02:23:44,708
<i>No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hoteIs there, but very IittIe.</i>

1063
02:23:47,336 --> 02:23:51,590
<i>I aIso have stock in IBM and IT&T.</i>

1064
02:23:52,674 --> 02:23:58,931
<i>Do you have any controI over gambIing
and narcotics in New York State?</i>

1065
02:23:59,014 --> 02:24:00,557
<i>No, I do not.</i>

1066
02:24:00,641 --> 02:24:04,228
<i>Senator, my cIient
wouId Iike to read a statement.</i>

1067
02:24:04,311 --> 02:24:09,900
<i>Mr. Chairman, I think this statement
is totaIIy out of order at this time.</i>

1068
02:24:10,067 --> 02:24:15,906
<i>Sir, my cIient has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.</i>

1069
02:24:16,073 --> 02:24:21,954
<i>He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement shouId be heard!</i>

1070
02:24:23,914 --> 02:24:28,877
<i>No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone to read
his statement. I'II put it in the record.</i>

1071
02:24:30,712 --> 02:24:33,841
<i>In the hopes of cIearing
my famiIy name</i>

1072
02:24:33,924 --> 02:24:37,886
<i>to give my chiIdren their share
of the American way of Iife</i>

1073
02:24:37,970 --> 02:24:41,014
<i>without a bIemish on their name
and background,</i>

1074
02:24:41,140 --> 02:24:46,353
<i>I have appeared before this committee
and given it aII my cooperation.</i>

1075
02:24:47,688 --> 02:24:53,235
<i>I consider it a great personaI dishonor
to have to deny that I am a criminaI.</i>

1076
02:24:54,278 --> 02:24:57,614
<i>I wish to have the foIIowing noted
for the record...</i>

1077
02:24:57,781 --> 02:25:01,827
<i>That I served my country faithfully
in WorId War Two</i>

1078
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:07,124
<i>and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defense of my country.</i>

1079
02:25:07,958 --> 02:25:12,254
<i>That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.</i>

1080
02:25:12,421 --> 02:25:16,383
<i>That no proof Iinking me to any
criminaI conspiracy</i>

1081
02:25:16,467 --> 02:25:21,346
<i>whether it is caIIed Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name</i>

1082
02:25:21,430 --> 02:25:23,765
<i>has ever been made pubIic.</i>

1083
02:25:23,932 --> 02:25:25,893
<i>I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment,</i>

1084
02:25:25,976 --> 02:25:29,146
<i>aIthough it's my right to do so.</i>

1085
02:25:31,982 --> 02:25:37,571
<i>I chaIIenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me</i>

1086
02:25:37,696 --> 02:25:43,619
<i>and if they do not, I hope they wiII have
the decency to cIear my name</i>

1087
02:25:43,702 --> 02:25:47,331
<i>with the same pubIicity
with which they have besmirched it.</i>

1088
02:25:48,707 --> 02:25:54,254
<i>I'm sure we're impressed. ParticuIarIy
with your Iove for our country.</i>

1089
02:25:54,421 --> 02:25:57,174
<i>We'II be in recess
untiI 10:00 a.m. Monday</i>

1090
02:25:57,341 --> 02:26:02,095
<i>when we wiII produce a witness who'II
corroborate the charges against you.</i>

1091
02:26:02,262 --> 02:26:07,267
<i>At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.</i>

1092
02:26:07,351 --> 02:26:11,855
<i>I remind you that you're stiII
under subpoena. Adjourned!</i>

1093
02:26:16,944 --> 02:26:18,654
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1094
02:26:18,737 --> 02:26:23,492
A ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!

1095
02:26:23,575 --> 02:26:28,247
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1096
02:26:29,289 --> 02:26:32,835
-Well, just get a good night's sleep.
-Yeah.

1097
02:26:32,918 --> 02:26:35,087
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1098
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:38,799
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1099
02:26:39,466 --> 02:26:42,761
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1100
02:26:42,928 --> 02:26:46,974
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1101
02:26:47,057 --> 02:26:52,271
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1102
02:26:53,272 --> 02:26:56,900
Come on! I saw this 19 times.

1103
02:26:57,985 --> 02:27:01,780
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1104
02:27:01,947 --> 02:27:05,075
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1105
02:27:05,242 --> 02:27:10,164
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1106
02:27:10,247 --> 02:27:13,083
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1107
02:27:13,167 --> 02:27:15,961
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1108
02:27:16,128 --> 02:27:18,422
Some deal!

1109
02:27:21,008 --> 02:27:24,887
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1110
02:27:26,638 --> 02:27:31,935
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1111
02:27:32,811 --> 02:27:35,189
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers

1112
02:27:35,272 --> 02:27:37,316
they tried to kill him.

1113
02:27:37,399 --> 02:27:39,651
He thought you double-crossed him.

1114
02:27:40,694 --> 02:27:44,031
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared

1115
02:27:44,114 --> 02:27:46,825
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1116
02:27:47,117 --> 02:27:51,288
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1117
02:27:53,123 --> 02:27:58,837
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24 hour guards.

1118
02:27:59,004 --> 02:28:01,632
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1119
02:28:06,386 --> 02:28:09,389
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1120
02:28:09,473 --> 02:28:13,143
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1121
02:28:13,310 --> 02:28:17,606
Roth, he played this one beautifully.

1122
02:28:24,905 --> 02:28:27,699
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1123
02:29:06,947 --> 02:29:09,658
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1124
02:29:11,201 --> 02:29:13,704
We have time.

1125
02:29:13,871 --> 02:29:17,040
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1126
02:29:18,375 --> 02:29:20,502
I didn't know all that much.

1127
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:26,258
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1128
02:29:26,884 --> 02:29:29,094
Anything you can tell me now?

1129
02:29:31,054 --> 02:29:33,724
They've got Pentangeli.

1130
02:29:48,363 --> 02:29:52,075
I didn't know
it was going to be a hit, Mike.

1131
02:29:52,242 --> 02:29:54,536
I swear to God I didn't know.

1132
02:29:57,289 --> 02:30:01,627
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1133
02:30:03,462 --> 02:30:06,548
He said that he wanted to talk.

1134
02:30:08,091 --> 02:30:14,264
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1135
02:30:16,809 --> 02:30:21,146
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1136
02:30:21,230 --> 02:30:25,150
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations

1137
02:30:25,234 --> 02:30:29,613
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast,

1138
02:30:31,156 --> 02:30:33,742
it would be good for the family.

1139
02:30:35,285 --> 02:30:39,790
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1140
02:30:39,957 --> 02:30:44,044
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1141
02:30:44,128 --> 02:30:48,257
-I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
-Taken care of me?

1142
02:30:49,591 --> 02:30:52,386
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1143
02:30:53,387 --> 02:30:57,474
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1144
02:30:58,559 --> 02:31:02,729
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1145
02:31:03,355 --> 02:31:07,901
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere. "

1146
02:31:07,985 --> 02:31:11,071
"Let Fredo fetch somebody
at the airport!"

1147
02:31:11,155 --> 02:31:14,241
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1148
02:31:14,408 --> 02:31:18,162
-It's the way Pop wanted it.
-It's not the way I wanted it!

1149
02:31:18,954 --> 02:31:23,834
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1150
02:31:24,001 --> 02:31:27,921
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1151
02:31:35,596 --> 02:31:40,809
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1152
02:31:48,817 --> 02:31:54,865
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.

1153
02:32:04,541 --> 02:32:06,293
Fredo,

1154
02:32:08,754 --> 02:32:11,381
you're nothing to me now.

1155
02:32:13,217 --> 02:32:15,677
Not a brother, not a friend.

1156
02:32:17,471 --> 02:32:20,474
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1157
02:32:21,558 --> 02:32:24,561
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1158
02:32:24,645 --> 02:32:27,231
I don't want you near my house.

1159
02:32:29,191 --> 02:32:33,862
When you see our mother, I want
to know in advance, so I won't be there.

1160
02:32:35,447 --> 02:32:37,074
You understand?

1161
02:32:46,875 --> 02:32:48,836
Mikey.

1162
02:32:55,425 --> 02:32:59,263
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1163
02:33:49,146 --> 02:33:52,649
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1164
02:33:52,816 --> 02:33:56,987
-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
-Frankie Five-Angels...

1165
02:34:16,381 --> 02:34:18,967
<i>This committee wiII come to order!</i>

1166
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:24,515
<i>-State your name, pIease.
-Frank PentangeIi.</i>

1167
02:34:24,598 --> 02:34:28,352
<i>-Where were you born?
-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.</i>

1168
02:34:28,519 --> 02:34:30,562
<i>Where do you Iive now?</i>

1169
02:34:30,729 --> 02:34:35,943
<i>I Iive in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.</i>

1170
02:34:36,985 --> 02:34:41,448
<i>We have here a witness
that wiII further testify</i>

1171
02:34:41,573 --> 02:34:47,955
<i>to MichaeI CorIeone's ruIe of a criminaI
empire that controIs aII gambIing.</i>

1172
02:34:48,205 --> 02:34:53,127
<i>This witness has had no buffer
between himseIf and MichaeI CorIeone.</i>

1173
02:34:53,210 --> 02:34:56,421
<i>He can corroborate enough charges</i>

1174
02:34:56,505 --> 02:35:01,176
<i>for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against MichaeI CorIeone.</i>

1175
02:35:01,343 --> 02:35:03,303
-Senator.
-Thank you, Chairman.

1176
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:06,223
<i>Mr. PentangeIi.</i>

1177
02:35:07,432 --> 02:35:13,105
<i>Mr. PentangeIi. Were you a member
of the CorIeone famiIy?</i>

1178
02:35:13,272 --> 02:35:18,318
<i>Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,</i>

1179
02:35:18,402 --> 02:35:22,948
<i>and under Vito Corleone,
aIso known as the Godfather?</i>

1180
02:35:28,662 --> 02:35:31,290
<i>I never knew any Godfather.</i>

1181
02:35:33,834 --> 02:35:35,961
<i>I have my own famiIy.</i>

1182
02:35:39,381 --> 02:35:41,925
<i>Mr. PentangeIi, you...</i>

1183
02:35:42,092 --> 02:35:46,472
<i>You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.</i>

1184
02:35:46,597 --> 02:35:50,350
<i>I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...</i>

1185
02:35:50,434 --> 02:35:54,688
<i>were you at any time a member of
a crime organization</i>

1186
02:35:54,772 --> 02:35:56,648
<i>Ied by MichaeI CorIeone?</i>

1187
02:35:56,732 --> 02:35:59,735
I don't know nothing about that!

1188
02:36:02,738 --> 02:36:06,700
I was in the olive oil business
with his father

1189
02:36:06,784 --> 02:36:09,453
but that was a long time ago.

1190
02:36:10,496 --> 02:36:13,582
<i>We have a sworn affidavit.</i>

1191
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:19,963
<i>Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of MichaeI CorIeone.</i>

1192
02:36:20,088 --> 02:36:24,593
<i>Do you deny this confession, and do
you reaIize what wiII happen if you do?</i>

1193
02:36:24,676 --> 02:36:27,846
<i>The FBI guys promised me a deaI</i>

1194
02:36:27,971 --> 02:36:33,644
<i>so I made up a Iot of stuff about
MichaeI CorIeone, just to pIease them.</i>

1195
02:36:33,811 --> 02:36:37,815
<i>But it was aII Iies. Everything!</i>

1196
02:36:38,482 --> 02:36:40,651
<i>They kept saying,</i>

1197
02:36:40,734 --> 02:36:45,781
<i>"MichaeI CorIeone did this"
and "MichaeI CorIeone did that".</i>

1198
02:36:47,324 --> 02:36:51,328
<i>So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"</i>

1199
02:36:51,495 --> 02:36:57,709
<i>Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentIeman sitting to your left?</i>

1200
02:36:57,793 --> 02:37:00,003
I can answer that.

1201
02:37:00,170 --> 02:37:02,548
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1202
02:37:03,549 --> 02:37:07,886
<i>-Is he reIated to the witness?
-He is, I believe, his brother.</i>

1203
02:37:08,220 --> 02:37:12,850
<i>-WiII he come forward and be sworn?
-He doesn't understand EngIish.</i>

1204
02:37:13,016 --> 02:37:16,061
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1205
02:37:16,895 --> 02:37:20,607
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1206
02:37:20,691 --> 02:37:24,486
<i>-He knows nothing about this?
-To my knowledge, nothing.</i>

1207
02:37:24,570 --> 02:37:28,824
<i>I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.</i>

1208
02:37:29,533 --> 02:37:31,618
<i>-The witness is excused.
-Senator!</i>

1209
02:37:32,703 --> 02:37:36,373
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1210
02:37:36,874 --> 02:37:40,878
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1211
02:38:08,489 --> 02:38:12,493
-Michael, excuse me.
-Hello, darling.

1212
02:38:12,910 --> 02:38:16,413
The children are outside. We're going.

1213
02:38:17,748 --> 02:38:20,417
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1214
02:38:21,251 --> 02:38:23,670
Rocco?

1215
02:38:24,713 --> 02:38:27,299
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1216
02:38:30,052 --> 02:38:33,138
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1217
02:38:33,222 --> 02:38:36,642
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1218
02:38:39,728 --> 02:38:42,272
I'm very happy for you.

1219
02:38:42,439 --> 02:38:46,944
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1220
02:38:48,403 --> 02:38:52,991
-Why don't you sit down?
-No, I'm not going to stay long.

1221
02:38:53,158 --> 02:38:56,912
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1222
02:38:57,079 --> 02:39:02,126
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1223
02:39:02,292 --> 02:39:05,337
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1224
02:39:06,505 --> 02:39:11,218
-I wasn't going to say anything...
-What do you mean, "too late"?

1225
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:19,309
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1226
02:39:25,107 --> 02:39:30,320
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.

1227
02:39:30,487 --> 02:39:32,281
Where is he now?

1228
02:39:33,615 --> 02:39:36,285
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1229
02:39:36,952 --> 02:39:39,496
All he had to do was show his face.

1230
02:39:41,165 --> 02:39:46,003
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1231
02:39:53,844 --> 02:39:57,723
I don't want you going!
Not you, not the kids. No.

1232
02:39:58,849 --> 02:40:02,853
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

1233
02:40:04,146 --> 02:40:07,983
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1234
02:40:08,150 --> 02:40:11,862
Things between men and women
will not change.

1235
02:40:12,029 --> 02:40:15,908
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1236
02:40:16,074 --> 02:40:21,246
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1237
02:40:21,413 --> 02:40:24,625
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.

1238
02:40:24,792 --> 02:40:28,712
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!

1239
02:40:30,047 --> 02:40:32,090
Over!

1240
02:40:44,103 --> 02:40:47,731
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1241
02:40:48,816 --> 02:40:53,821
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1242
02:41:08,168 --> 02:41:10,254
Kay...

1243
02:41:13,090 --> 02:41:15,259
We're leaving tomorrow.

1244
02:41:15,968 --> 02:41:19,138
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1245
02:41:19,221 --> 02:41:25,060
-Michael, you haven't heard me.
-Kay, what do you want from me?

1246
02:41:25,310 --> 02:41:31,692
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1247
02:41:32,484 --> 02:41:38,073
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1248
02:41:38,157 --> 02:41:42,077
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1249
02:41:42,911 --> 02:41:45,289
Don't you know that?

1250
02:41:46,957 --> 02:41:48,834
Kay...

1251
02:41:51,712 --> 02:41:56,341
In time, you'll feel differently.

1252
02:41:57,926 --> 02:42:00,846
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1253
02:42:02,764 --> 02:42:04,767
I know that.

1254
02:42:06,769 --> 02:42:10,189
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1255
02:42:12,024 --> 02:42:13,108
Yes.

1256
02:42:14,359 --> 02:42:17,112
I know what that meant to you.

1257
02:42:19,156 --> 02:42:21,283
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1258
02:42:22,159 --> 02:42:24,995
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1259
02:42:26,288 --> 02:42:28,207
I'm going to change.

1260
02:42:29,666 --> 02:42:33,837
I'll change. I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

1261
02:42:36,006 --> 02:42:39,009
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage

1262
02:42:39,843 --> 02:42:44,723
and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1263
02:42:46,058 --> 02:42:50,229
-We'll go on.
-Oh, Michael!

1264
02:42:51,355 --> 02:42:53,732
Michael, you are blind.

1265
02:42:55,567 --> 02:42:57,903
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1266
02:42:59,947 --> 02:43:01,490
It was an abortion.

1267
02:43:03,367 --> 02:43:08,539
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1268
02:43:09,456 --> 02:43:12,918
Something that's unholy and evil!

1269
02:43:14,545 --> 02:43:16,880
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1270
02:43:17,714 --> 02:43:21,552
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1271
02:43:23,470 --> 02:43:25,973
It was an abortion, Michael.

1272
02:43:26,056 --> 02:43:31,728
It was a son and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1273
02:43:33,313 --> 02:43:37,401
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1274
02:43:38,819 --> 02:43:43,782
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1275
02:43:44,241 --> 02:43:48,912
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1276
02:43:56,837 --> 02:43:59,715
-You won't take my children.
-I will.

1277
02:43:59,798 --> 02:44:04,178
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.

1278
02:45:33,976 --> 02:45:37,521
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1279
02:47:52,322 --> 02:47:54,324
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1280
02:47:58,245 --> 02:48:01,290
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

1281
02:48:01,623 --> 02:48:04,460
My partner in America, in New York.

1282
02:48:05,127 --> 02:48:06,962
His name is Vito Corleone.

1283
02:48:07,671 --> 02:48:10,215
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1284
02:48:11,008 --> 02:48:12,468
To his company in America.

1285
02:48:17,264 --> 02:48:20,559
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1286
02:48:30,277 --> 02:48:35,866
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1287
02:48:36,992 --> 02:48:39,870
Where is this young man
from New York?

1288
02:48:43,207 --> 02:48:46,376
Have him come closer.

1289
02:48:47,377 --> 02:48:50,214
I can't see him so good.

1290
02:48:57,221 --> 02:49:00,891
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1291
02:49:03,393 --> 02:49:05,104
Bless you!

1292
02:49:06,980 --> 02:49:08,565
What's your name?

1293
02:49:13,987 --> 02:49:17,157
You took the name of this town!

1294
02:49:17,699 --> 02:49:19,451
And what's your father's name?

1295
02:49:19,576 --> 02:49:23,247
His name was...Antonio Andolini.

1296
02:49:23,622 --> 02:49:27,251
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1297
02:49:30,712 --> 02:49:33,924
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1298
02:49:34,258 --> 02:49:36,969
...and this is for you!

1299
02:50:58,884 --> 02:51:01,512
Michael, say goodbye.

1300
02:52:04,741 --> 02:52:06,160
Hi, Al.

1301
02:52:18,213 --> 02:52:21,216
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1302
02:52:29,141 --> 02:52:30,851
Tom, where's Mike?

1303
02:52:32,102 --> 02:52:34,146
Waiting for you to leave.

1304
02:52:36,732 --> 02:52:41,278
-Can I talk with him?
-Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1305
02:52:41,862 --> 02:52:45,157
-Can I see him?
-He's in the boathouse.

1306
02:52:58,253 --> 02:53:00,631
Michael, it's Connie.

1307
02:53:21,902 --> 02:53:23,487
Michael...

1308
02:53:26,490 --> 02:53:29,993
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1309
02:53:38,502 --> 02:53:40,754
Is Kay coming?

1310
02:53:43,215 --> 02:53:44,883
No.

1311
02:53:53,016 --> 02:53:55,853
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1312
02:53:55,936 --> 02:53:59,857
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1313
02:54:03,527 --> 02:54:05,362
That's right.

1314
02:54:08,198 --> 02:54:11,577
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1315
02:54:15,164 --> 02:54:17,541
Please, I want to talk to you.

1316
02:54:29,052 --> 02:54:33,056
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1317
02:54:33,515 --> 02:54:38,854
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know

1318
02:54:42,065 --> 02:54:44,193
that I could hurt you.

1319
02:54:50,282 --> 02:54:54,703
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1320
02:54:55,287 --> 02:54:57,164
And I forgive you.

1321
02:55:01,835 --> 02:55:03,796
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1322
02:55:04,838 --> 02:55:09,468
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1323
02:55:15,808 --> 02:55:19,645
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1324
02:55:29,488 --> 02:55:31,031
Connie.

1325
02:57:13,258 --> 02:57:15,886
Tom, sit down.

1326
02:57:27,606 --> 02:57:31,360
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1327
02:57:32,736 --> 02:57:37,366
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.

1328
02:57:37,908 --> 02:57:42,538
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.

1329
02:57:42,704 --> 02:57:46,291
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1330
02:57:46,375 --> 02:57:49,128
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1331
02:57:49,419 --> 02:57:53,340
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1332
02:57:54,299 --> 02:57:58,303
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.

1333
02:57:58,429 --> 02:58:03,100
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1334
02:58:03,475 --> 02:58:08,188
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1335
02:58:08,355 --> 02:58:11,358
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1336
02:58:11,525 --> 02:58:15,696
-That plane goes to Miami.
-That's right. That's where I want it met.

1337
02:58:16,822 --> 02:58:22,202
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.

1338
02:58:22,369 --> 02:58:25,581
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1339
02:58:25,664 --> 02:58:27,124
It would be
like trying to kill the President.

1340
02:58:27,207 --> 02:58:31,712
-There's no way we can get to him!
-Tom, you surprise me.

1341
02:58:34,506 --> 02:58:38,135
If anything in this life is certain,

1342
02:58:38,218 --> 02:58:41,430
if history has taught us anything,

1343
02:58:41,513 --> 02:58:44,141
it's that you can kill anyone.

1344
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:54,401
-Rocco?
-Difficult. Not impossible.

1345
02:58:54,735 --> 02:58:56,445
Good.

1346
02:58:58,906 --> 02:59:02,493
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1347
02:59:06,163 --> 02:59:12,085
I thought you were going to tell me that
you were moving your family to Vegas

1348
02:59:13,462 --> 02:59:17,341
and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1349
02:59:19,468 --> 02:59:24,306
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

1350
02:59:28,519 --> 02:59:31,313
-Let's do business.
-All right.

1351
02:59:33,190 --> 02:59:36,193
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1352
02:59:37,444 --> 02:59:39,571
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.

1353
02:59:39,655 --> 02:59:42,199
Are they worth it,
are they strong enough?

1354
02:59:42,699 --> 02:59:47,579
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1355
02:59:47,663 --> 02:59:53,001
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1356
03:00:00,717 --> 03:00:03,387
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1357
03:00:05,514 --> 03:00:10,936
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress

1358
03:00:11,103 --> 03:00:14,231
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1359
03:00:17,359 --> 03:00:22,406
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

1360
03:00:26,994 --> 03:00:28,662
So...you're staying?

1361
03:00:30,706 --> 03:00:33,041
Yes, I'm staying.

1362
03:00:35,627 --> 03:00:37,754
What do you want me to do?

1363
03:00:38,255 --> 03:00:40,257
Hey, Anthony.

1364
03:00:40,799 --> 03:00:45,429
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1365
03:00:45,512 --> 03:00:48,015
-Would you like that?
-Okay.

1366
03:00:48,182 --> 03:00:50,809
You know, when I was your age,

1367
03:00:51,268 --> 03:00:58,150
I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1368
03:00:59,318 --> 03:01:02,821
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1369
03:01:04,823 --> 03:01:07,868
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1370
03:01:09,453 --> 03:01:13,248
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1371
03:01:13,415 --> 03:01:17,044
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1372
03:01:19,463 --> 03:01:23,634
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1373
03:01:25,719 --> 03:01:29,556
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.

1374
03:01:31,350 --> 03:01:32,684
What else have you got?

1375
03:01:59,253 --> 03:02:01,839
Everything will be okay.

1376
03:02:02,005 --> 03:02:05,926
-Did my brother go back?
-Yeah, don't worry.

1377
03:02:06,093 --> 03:02:11,014
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1378
03:02:12,057 --> 03:02:15,352
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1379
03:02:15,436 --> 03:02:20,482
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1380
03:02:20,649 --> 03:02:24,486
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1381
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:31,660
Tom,

1382
03:02:32,369 --> 03:02:34,955
what do I do now?

1383
03:02:35,664 --> 03:02:37,666
Frankie.

1384
03:02:42,212 --> 03:02:46,216
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1385
03:02:47,718 --> 03:02:51,180
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1386
03:02:51,346 --> 03:02:54,975
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1387
03:02:57,519 --> 03:03:03,275
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organization of the families,

1388
03:03:03,400 --> 03:03:08,822
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes," "capos" and "soldiers".

1389
03:03:10,073 --> 03:03:14,077
-And it worked.
-Yeah, it worked.

1390
03:03:14,870 --> 03:03:18,373
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1391
03:03:18,540 --> 03:03:21,668
We was like the Roman Empire.

1392
03:03:21,752 --> 03:03:25,255
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1393
03:03:27,633 --> 03:03:29,593
Yeah,

1394
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:32,137
it was once.

1395
03:03:36,558 --> 03:03:38,102
Frankie.

1396
03:03:48,570 --> 03:03:52,116
When a plot
against the Emperor failed

1397
03:03:53,367 --> 03:03:56,829
the plotters were always
given a chance

1398
03:03:58,789 --> 03:04:02,376
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1399
03:04:02,459 --> 03:04:04,586
Only the rich guys.

1400
03:04:04,670 --> 03:04:09,675
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1401
03:04:09,842 --> 03:04:15,055
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1402
03:04:16,223 --> 03:04:20,519
And their families were taken care of.

1403
03:04:22,146 --> 03:04:25,524
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1404
03:04:26,150 --> 03:04:27,609
Yeah.

1405
03:04:28,569 --> 03:04:30,654
They went home

1406
03:04:31,864 --> 03:04:34,825
and sat in a hot bath

1407
03:04:34,992 --> 03:04:37,536
opened up their veins

1408
03:04:37,703 --> 03:04:40,414
and bled to death.

1409
03:04:41,582 --> 03:04:45,752
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1410
03:04:51,091 --> 03:04:53,427
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1411
03:04:54,887 --> 03:04:58,182
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1412
03:05:16,658 --> 03:05:19,787
-See you, Tom.
-Addio, Frankie.

1413
03:05:30,714 --> 03:05:33,842
Kay. You have to go.

1414
03:05:35,636 --> 03:05:38,972
-So pretty...
-Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1415
03:05:47,773 --> 03:05:51,568
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.

1416
03:05:54,196 --> 03:05:56,990
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1417
03:05:57,157 --> 03:06:02,246
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.

1418
03:06:03,372 --> 03:06:05,749
Kay, please.

1419
03:06:08,669 --> 03:06:10,629
All right.

1420
03:06:23,892 --> 03:06:26,270
Mary, come here.

1421
03:06:33,444 --> 03:06:35,028
Anthony.

1422
03:06:35,112 --> 03:06:38,115
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1423
03:08:17,214 --> 03:08:19,299
Easy.

1424
03:08:25,013 --> 03:08:28,100
Anthony! Anthony!

1425
03:08:28,225 --> 03:08:31,270
-He's here, we're going fishing.
-No!

1426
03:08:31,437 --> 03:08:34,773
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1427
03:08:34,857 --> 03:08:36,859
Shit!

1428
03:08:38,068 --> 03:08:41,530
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1429
03:08:42,489 --> 03:08:46,452
-I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

1430
03:08:50,080 --> 03:08:51,665
Hey, Anthony.

1431
03:08:51,748 --> 03:08:56,086
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1432
03:09:00,132 --> 03:09:01,508
Let's go.

1433
03:09:40,672 --> 03:09:44,843
-Mr. Roth, I must take you into custody.
-I understand.

1434
03:09:45,010 --> 03:09:48,138
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1435
03:09:48,305 --> 03:09:51,100
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1436
03:09:51,266 --> 03:09:56,146
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1437
03:10:02,486 --> 03:10:06,115
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1438
03:10:14,289 --> 03:10:15,999
Frankie!

1439
03:10:31,890 --> 03:10:34,768
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1440
03:10:34,935 --> 03:10:38,564
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1441
03:10:38,730 --> 03:10:42,276
I came home to vote
in the presidential election

1442
03:10:42,443 --> 03:10:45,863
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1443
03:10:58,208 --> 03:11:00,627
Jesus Christ.

1444
03:11:01,670 --> 03:11:06,300
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1445
03:11:07,760 --> 03:11:10,387
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1446
03:11:11,180 --> 03:11:14,308
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1447
03:11:15,517 --> 03:11:19,730
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1448
03:12:01,605 --> 03:12:06,777
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1449
03:12:07,569 --> 03:12:10,322
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.

1450
03:12:10,489 --> 03:12:15,244
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1451
03:12:15,327 --> 03:12:18,664
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

1452
03:12:18,747 --> 03:12:21,583
Say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?

1453
03:12:21,667 --> 03:12:23,252
Yes.

1454
03:12:23,418 --> 03:12:27,464
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1455
03:12:27,965 --> 03:12:31,844
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1456
03:12:32,010 --> 03:12:34,263
Hey, Mr. Einstein...

1457
03:12:37,599 --> 03:12:40,102
-The cake.
-Sally, get in here!

1458
03:12:40,269 --> 03:12:42,396
-I was scared.
-Come on.

1459
03:12:43,063 --> 03:12:46,400
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.

1460
03:12:46,567 --> 03:12:48,944
Let's see that thing.

1461
03:12:50,654 --> 03:12:52,573
That's nice!

1462
03:12:52,656 --> 03:12:56,493
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1463
03:12:57,619 --> 03:13:00,747
-What is that? Rum?
-Yeah.

1464
03:13:05,753 --> 03:13:09,006
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1465
03:13:09,173 --> 03:13:11,842
He's not ugly...

1466
03:13:17,347 --> 03:13:23,604
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1467
03:13:23,687 --> 03:13:27,107
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1468
03:13:27,191 --> 03:13:29,860
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1469
03:13:30,027 --> 03:13:34,490
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1470
03:13:34,698 --> 03:13:38,368
-30,000 enlisted this morning.
-Bunch of saps...

1471
03:13:38,535 --> 03:13:42,039
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.

1472
03:13:43,165 --> 03:13:45,000
You talk to Carlo.

1473
03:13:46,960 --> 03:13:50,547
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

1474
03:13:50,631 --> 03:13:54,093
-That's Pop talking.
-You're right, that's Pop talking!

1475
03:13:54,218 --> 03:13:58,013
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.

1476
03:13:58,097 --> 03:14:04,019
-I don't feel that way.
-Then quit college andjoin the army!

1477
03:14:04,103 --> 03:14:05,604
I did.

1478
03:14:06,563 --> 03:14:09,525
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1479
03:14:11,735 --> 03:14:14,988
-Why didn't you come to us?
-What do you mean?

1480
03:14:15,072 --> 03:14:19,326
-Pop managed to get you a deferment.
-I didn't ask for it.

1481
03:14:20,077 --> 03:14:22,162
I didn't want it.

1482
03:14:23,330 --> 03:14:25,749
Come on! Knock it off!

1483
03:14:25,916 --> 03:14:29,670
-Punk!
-Sonny, sit down.

1484
03:14:32,673 --> 03:14:36,176
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1485
03:14:39,263 --> 03:14:42,015
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1486
03:14:52,317 --> 03:14:53,944
Nice.

1487
03:14:55,779 --> 03:14:57,322
Nice.

1488
03:14:57,948 --> 03:15:00,617
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1489
03:15:01,743 --> 03:15:04,496
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1490
03:15:04,580 --> 03:15:06,707
Don't encourage him!

1491
03:15:06,790 --> 03:15:09,460
Get me a drink. Go on!

1492
03:15:13,338 --> 03:15:16,800
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1493
03:15:16,967 --> 03:15:21,180
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1494
03:15:22,973 --> 03:15:26,810
You've talked to my father
about my future?

1495
03:15:28,103 --> 03:15:32,399
-My future.
-Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1496
03:15:32,483 --> 03:15:38,030
-I have my own plans for my future.
-Did you go to college to get stupid?

1497
03:15:38,113 --> 03:15:39,990
He's here!

1498
03:15:41,950 --> 03:15:43,911
Come on.

1499
03:15:46,163 --> 03:15:48,123
Stupid!

1500
03:16:05,390 --> 03:16:07,768
Surprise!

1501
03:16:10,854 --> 03:16:16,527
<i>For he's a joIIy good feIIow
For he's a joIIy good feIIow</i>

1502
03:16:16,735 --> 03:16:20,531
<i>That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...</i>
