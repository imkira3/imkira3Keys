<i>Death Race,
the number one sport in the world,</i>

00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:44,309
<i>located on Terminal Island.</i>

00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,513
<i>Convicts race over the course of three grueling days</i>

4

<i>for the chance
at the ultimate prize.</i>

5
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,717
<i>Win five races,
win your freedom.</i>

6
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,289
<i>Preorder the next
Death Race now</i>

7
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,092
<i>and you'll not only
get 20% off,</i>

8
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:03,796
<i>but you'll also receive limited
edition Frankenstein merchandise.</i>

9
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,398
<i>Frankenstein, the four-time
Death Race champion,</i>

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,634
<i>has taken the world by storm.</i>

11
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,302
<i>The most unlikely of heroes</i>

12
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,737
<i>who has come
out of nowhere</i>

13
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,473
<i>and is now just one
win away from freedom.</i>

14
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,708
Death Race.

15
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,481
<i>Now streaming live.</i>

16
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,349
<i>Death Race is the trademark of Weyland International.</i>

17
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,651
<i>Your safety's
our top priority.</i>

18
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,692
<i>The notorious Death Racer
known only as Frankensten</i>

19
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,195
<i>won his fourth race toda.</i>

20
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:39,498
<i>One more victory and the
masked killer gains his freedom.</i>

21
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,136
Frankenstein
fears nothing.

22
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:48,273
Anything in his way,
he destroys.

23
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:52,845
<i>Under my watch,
Terminal Island and Death Race have thrived.</i>

24
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:55,481
<i>Rumors have been going around
that Weyland International,</i>

25
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,183
<i>the organization
behiDeath Race,</i>

26
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,819
<i>has been targeted
for hostile takeover.</i>

27
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,722
As a businessman,
takeover talk is common.

28
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,792
You have something of value, naturally,
people want to take it away.

29
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,861
<i>British billionaire,
Niles York,</i>

30
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:12,131
<i>has placed himself in the center of a firestorm.</i>

31
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,199
Well, I've got nothing to say about that at the moment.

32
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,902
But I will say this.

33
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:22,608
When I want something,
no one can stop me from taking it.

34
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,377
I'm not too concerned.
I've won more battles than I've lost.

35
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,547
I feel bad for Weyland,
I really do.

36
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,250
But Father Time,
he's caught up with the old man.

37
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,584
He never really
stood a chance.

38
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,666
Good morning,
Mr. Weyland.

39
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,671
Wasn't so bad, was it?

40
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,846
I built this business.

41
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,781
I didn't
have to steal it.

42
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,450
What you left vulnerable,
I seized. I stole nothing.

43
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,720
You lacked vision, Weyland.
That was your undoing.

44
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,929
Vision.

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,468
Is that why you're investing millions in
dilapidated prisons all around the globe?

46
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,338
Vision?

47
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,675
You're so far over your head,
you might as well be six feet under the ground.

48
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:33,412
The prison business is not what
made this company profitable.

49
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,280
So the conclusion to draw,

50
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,552
<i>you're trying to
franchise Death Race.</i>

51
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,391
It's not going to work.

52
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,627
Because you couldn't
make it work.

53
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,530
Let me show you what true vision really looks like.

54
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,742
You started something
beautiful, Weyland.

55
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,811
But you only scratched
at the surface.

56
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,847
<i>And you're right.
I'm taking Death Race global.</i>

57
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,883
<i>By this time next year,
there will be a different race every two weeks</i>

58
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:16,388
at a different exotic hellhole with different drivers,
tracks and challenges.

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:22,561
I will have a monopoly on the most
profitable sport in the history of the planet.

60
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,530
More cars.
More cons. More guns.

61
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,833
More death.
The sky's the limit.

62
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,842
Well, you forgot
one thing.

63
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,445
Frankenstein.

64
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,716
It's a man in a mask.

65
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,918
I could have 20 Frankensteins around the globe.

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,021
How would the fans know
which one was real?

67
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,590
Frankenstein won
his fourth race today.

68
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,760
One more win,
he goes free.

69
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,462
That's a fact
that every fan knows.

70
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,932
Now, if you suddenly change
the rules of the game,

71
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,068
you're going to
lose your audience.

72
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,904
And if you're hoping
that Frankenstein loses,

73
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,874
well, son, I guess
there's a first time.

74
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,411
Now, how would your
little copycat event play

75
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,913
without the game's
marquee star?

76
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,982
That's why you're
going to fail.

77
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,388
What kind of cigars
you smoke, Weyland?

78
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,492
<i>I'll be sure to send you a box when
Death Race becomes a global success.</i>

79
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,363
It'll be the second time I've beaten you.
The second time you've lost.

80
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,001
Well, you enjoy your
moment while you can.

81
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,771
Payback's a bitch, son.

82
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,416
Weyland's right.

83
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,552
Find out who the man
behind the mask really is.

84
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,587
What he loves, what he hates,
what he covets most.

85
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,755
And find out what Weyland
was planning next.

86
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,857
What do you mean?

87
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,058
The company's banking nearly eight million quid a week

88
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,793
hawking Frankenstein
merchandise.

89
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:02,894
He wasn't just
gonna let it go.

90
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,364
Anything else?

91
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,967
Yeah. Get yourself some decent clothes.
You look like a bag lady.

92
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:13,805
<i>I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't have done all
this unless I absolutely loved Death Race.</i>

93
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,409
So I'm speaking to the millions of fans around the globe.

94
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,411
Fear not.
I am like you.

95
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,781
I seek not to destroy nor to compromise
what we've all come to revere.

96
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,884
<i>The Death Race that we all
know and love will not change.</i>

97
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:30,489
It will grow bigger and better.
This, I promise.

98
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,590
Thank you.

99
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,699
Overall, I have to say I'm very happy.

100
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,734
You wanna
take a look?

101
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,035
No.

102
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,572
We'll run a few more
tests tomorrow,

103
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,141
and you're back to your old self in no time.

104
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,008
No, he won't.

105
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,911
He'll be better.

106
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,649
Everybody out.

107
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,719
You heard the man.
Take a coffee break, guys.

108
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,591
So, I guess
the rumors are true.

109
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,064
Yeah, and I guess you won't
be shedding any tears for me.

110
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:16,802
Hey, you and I, Carl,
we've taken very different paths in life.

111
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,071
But we both ended up here.

112
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,140
No, I'm here.

113
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,943
You come and go as you please,
see the ones you love.

114
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,946
They see you.

115
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,582
Don't compare us, Weyland.
You lost the company.

116
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,786
I lost my life.
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,623
Yeah, and I also fixed your
face and I gave you a way out.

118
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,892
Look at me and tell me you were gonna keep your word.

119
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,863
I'm not stupid, Weyland.

120
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:48,133
And you didn't fix my face out of
the kindness of your heart, did you?

121
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,602
It was infected.
I was gonna die.

122
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,037
And you would have
lost your star driver.

123
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,876
Yeah, you're not so bad.
You're worse.

124
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,980
And you want me
to trust you?

125
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,715
You deserve the
shit-storm you're in.

126
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,652
Well, I got news
for you, Carl.

127
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,790
You're already
in waist-deep.

128
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,559
You're Frankenstein.

129
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:18,163
This all starts
and ends with you.

130
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,071
<i>Carl Lucas.</i>

131
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,674
<i>Born a gangster,</i>

132
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,009
<i>became a prisoner,</i>

133
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,514
<i>and now, a monster.</i>

134
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,111
<i>May he rest in peace.</i>

135
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,885
<i>You and your team
win five races</i>

136
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,754
<i>and you go free.</i>

137
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:19,658
<i>Goldberg, Lists</i>

138
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,961
<i>and that beautiful,
beautiful Katrina.</i>

139
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,274
<i>Now, for this to work,</i>

140
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,245
<i>you can't tell your
true identity to anyone.</i>

141
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,648
<i>Carl Lucas stays dead.</i>

142
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,951
<i>You're Frankenstein.</i>

143
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,719
Well,
you're welcome, asshole.

144
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,987
Four wins and not
even a thank you.

145
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:55,093
<i>This all starts
and ends with you.</i>

146
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,240
There he is.
There's the guy.

147
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,313
I'm having
you transferred.

148
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,783
You're headed to the Kalahari Desert
Maximum Security Penitentiary

149
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,954
<i>in South Africa where you will compete
in the first ever Desert Death Race.</i>

150
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,391
Wow. What do I get,
my own dune buggy?

151
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:29,194
You're just on loan
to the Kalahari

152
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:32,197
<i>to help launch the first of what will
be many international Death Races.</i>

153
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,933
We're sending 14K,
as well as both your teams.

154
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,268
So I'm guessing I should get my passport updated.

155
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,304
I get the feeling that you are not taking me seriously.

156
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,406
That's because I'm not.

157
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,342
Listen to me.
I made a deal with Weyland.

158
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,312
I win one more race,
me, my team,

159
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,180
we're out.

160
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,916
Yeah, well, you know,
it's a pity about Weyland,

161
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,185
because all deals
with him are null and void.

162
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,888
You work for me now.
New rules.

163
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,989
No.

164
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,226
No, I don't think so.

165
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,294
You don't have a choice, mate.
But if you don't want to drive,

166
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,697
fine.

167
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:13,705
I will paint my plane
red with your blood.

168
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,407
Really?

169
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,275
Niles?

170
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,810
What are you gonna do,
replace me?

171
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,746
With who?

172
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,848
Why would you care?
You're already dead.

173
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:31,322
So, as long as you're alive,
you'll be treated like the star that you are.

174
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,425
Or,

175
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,160
I could just simply
fuck up your little plan,

176
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,028
couldn't I,
by winning one more race

177
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,797
and I'm free.

178
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,767
Wow. You'll never make it
to the finish line, mate.

179
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:43,968
Trust me on that.

180
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,972
You lose, you live.
You win, you die.

181
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,357
Okay, get out!

182
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,126
Let's go, move!

183
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,162
Bring that
jackhammer here.

184
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,264
Get in the line!
Get moving!

185
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,139
Boy,
take a look at those!

186
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,476
Move your fuckin' arse.

187
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,246
Who's that?

188
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,942
Hey, Goldberg!

189
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,443
Yeah, that's right.

190
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:09,881
I'm a big fan.
But we've got our own bitches down here.

191
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,115
I don't know why you
brought yours along.

192
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,918
Hey, let me give
you an autograph.

193
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,186
Move! Move!

194
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,899
Let's take this fucking joint!

195
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,265
Kill them all!

196
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,268
Set up a perimeter now.
On the ground, now!

197
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,587
Shit!

198
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,537
Get up!

199
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,639
Are you hurt? What?

200
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,049
Lucas.
It always was you.

201
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,720
You son of a bitch!

202
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,192
We thought
you were dead.

203
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,727
So it's always been
you behind the mask.

204
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,997
Yeah, it's a long story.

205
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,531
So what kind of deal
did they make, huh?

206
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,433
I didn't have a choice.

207
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,371
Whatever it was,
it included getting your face fixed.

208
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,206
I saw it.
I was there.

209
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,741
Did you, Goldberg?

210
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,676
Or did you just see what
they wanted you to see?

211
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,677
What did they
want us to see?

212
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,513
That is no deal.

213
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,348
You never needed
to make a deal.

214
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,584
All you had to do was win five
races in a row and you're free.

215
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:00,785
Those are the rules.

216
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,690
There are no rules
in the cage, Lists.

217
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,459
At least none that
benefit the cage.

218
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,495
Believe what you want,
Goldberg.

219
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:13,231
But I don't think it's wise, right now,
that they see us together.

220
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,240
Welcome to hell.

221
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,417
Keep moving, don't stop!
Come on!

222
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,119
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

223
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:39,157
Welcome to Kalahari Prison.
You dare try and escape,

224
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,660
the desert will kill you before we do.
Come on, move!

225
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,495
You all right?

226
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,821
Close the gate.

227
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,165
Hey, Goldberg.

228
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,170
She's bigger
and better.

229
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,739
Way bigger.
Way better.

230
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,287
I've been through
more shit in my life

231
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,823
than most people
go through in 10.

232
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:57,728
But what I never did was lie or betray my friends.

233
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,964
Doesn't matter what
your intentions were,

234
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,699
your secret would have
been safe with us.

235
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,435
We could've helped.

236
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,370
You know
better than that.

237
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,806
Helping me comes with a price,
and I wasn't about to let you do that.

238
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,344
You believe
in curses?

239
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,513
This thing.

240
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,748
It comes with one.

241
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,218
You should've
trusted us.

242
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,792
Let's go, Lists.

243
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,855
<i>Live from Kalahari Prison in South Africa,</i>

244
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,892
<i>this Death Race
Navigator Wars.</i>

245
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,028
<i>Featuring 16
of the most beautiful,</i>

246
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,864
<i>ruthless and lethal
convicts alive,</i>

247
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:10,534
<i>including an IRA terrorist,
a contract killer,</i>

248
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,337
<i>even identical twin
serial killers.</i>

249
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,607
<i>But all eyes will be
on Katrina Banks,</i>

250
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,777
<i>the gorgeous copilot of
the notorious Frankenstein.</i>

251
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,883
<i>This is a match to the death.
The only rule, survive.</i>

252
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,057
What the hell
is happening?

253
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:37,628
<i>Good evening and welcome to
a special pre-Death Raevent.</i>

254
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,531
Sixteen beautiful,
yet deadly women,

255
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,868
<i>vie for 10 spots
as Death Race navigators.</i>

256
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,408
These ladies will battle to the
death to see who's worthy

257
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,611
<i>to navigate in tomorrow's Death Race.</i>

258
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:59,984
<i>pressure plates activate
a variety of lethal weapon.</i>

259
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,853
<i>The fight ends when
10 ladies are left alive.</i>

260
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,756
Katrina's statistical probability of survival is very low.

261
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,892
And the Swedish twins aren't gonna fight each other.

262
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,960
Plus, Katrina's celebrity
will attract more attention.

263
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,595
That changes the odds.

264
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,064
So, what are
you saying?

265
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,332
Seven to 10%.

266
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,668
Best case scenario.

267
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,938
<i>Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.</i>

268
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,816
Katrina, kick some ass!

269
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,968
Do I know
my audience or what?

270
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:01,011
That's reality TV shit.
Come on.

271
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,150
Yes.

272
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,386
<i>Pressure plates
are now active.</i>

273
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,038
Go in tighter.
Go in tighter.

274
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,148
Get me a close-up!

275
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,682
Kill!

276
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:39,550
Do you want some
popcorn with that?

277
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,985
I don't need...

278
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,854
Get to
the weapons, Katrina!

279
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,928
Come on,
cook her ass!

280
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,009
Camera five, close-up!
Katrina Banks.

281
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,012
I'm gonna fuck you up!

282
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:10,714
Take this!

283
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,156
Good work, good work!

284
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,031
You love
me to death!

285
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,043
No!

286
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,245
Oh, man,
I really thought both twins were gonna make it,

287
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,681
the way they hyped 'em
up and all, you know?

288
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:44,648
Never believe
your own hype.

289
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,018
Don't miss that shot!

290
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:03,801
<i>Ten women remain who'll compete as
navigatos in tomorrow'Death Race.</i>

291
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,840
<i>Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts shod not be duplicated at hom.</i>

292
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,738
Relax, Prudence.
There's nothing for you to fear here.

293
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,773
They may be ruthless,
vicious murderers and rapists,

294
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,208
but they've taste
enough to ignore you.

295
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,784
It's race time,
motherfuckers!

296
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:05,729
Don't touch me.
I'm feeling a little fragile this morning.

297
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,964
Come on, let's go.

298
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,133
Come on!

299
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Good to see you, too.

300
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,292
Drop dead.

301
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,294
Come on, move! Good idea.
But I already tried that.

302
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,696
Next!

303
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,367
Next in line.

304
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,670
Next!

305
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:21,739
Nice. Thank you.

306
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,243
Another one. Next!

307
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,348
What do you think you're
putting inside of me?

308
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,250
Let him go.
He's just doing what he's told to do.

309
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,722
Unlike Terminal Island,
there are no walls here.

310
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:41,959
We didn't want our drivers dashing for their freedom.

311
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:44,862
This will tell us exactly where you are at all times.

312
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,702
So, I go off-course,
what happens?

313
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:56,006
You're not familiar with the German-made

314
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,741
No.

315
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,677
You go off-course,
and you will be.

316
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,945
Just as there's
no escape from Kalahari,

<i>there is no escape

Well, ain't
that somethin'?

319
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:21,832
Mr. York. While you are here,
I want you to know that I am at your disposal.

320
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,301
Anything your heart desires,

321
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,738
Anything?

322
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,039
Please do take a seat.

323
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,886
<i>Streaming live from the Kalahari Prison in South Africa,</i>

<i>Niles York presents

<i>across one of the most

<i>Win five races,

330

Lists?

331
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,226
There's a speaker and mic here,
so no more headsets.

332
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,927
But the weapon trigger's
still in the same place.

333
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,195
Okay.

334
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,964
There are no
shields out here.

335
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,099
Only offensive weapons.

336
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,936
Weapon locations are marked on the map,
indicated here on the tablet.

337
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,340
Now, remember, you have to drive through,
not over, to activate.

338
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,446
You think this thing's gonna be like a Baja race?

339
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,817
The only thing
I know about Baja,

340
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,118
it's a style
of tacos I like.

341
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,121
Goldberg,

342
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,291
I'm gonna need you
on this one.

343
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,328
I got your back.

344
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,365
Three things
you gotta worry about.

345
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:03,834
Razor.

346
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,273
<i>He'd rather
kill us than win.</i>

347
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,443
Nero.

348
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,148
Checkered flag has nothing to do with winning.

349
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,319
Okay.
So what's the third?

350
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,223
Third,

351
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:29,059
it's that beautiful girl
sitting next to you.

352
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,174
Let's get it ready
for an online broadcast.

353
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,277
Let's make a tight MCU.
Camera 15, 10 and eight.

354
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,586
Thanks.

355
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:56,453
Gotcha.

356
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,895
Katrina.

357
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,997
Don't.
I don't wanna hear it.

358
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:25,549
You're my nav-girl.
You, do you speak English?

359
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,651
I speak English,
you fucking idiot.

360
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,254
Let's just fucking
win this race.

361
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,889
Wow, this is
gonna be great.

362
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,001
The first official
race of this kind

363
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:48,472
started in Tijuana,
Baja California on October 31st, 1967

364
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:51,174
and was called the NORRA Mexican 1000 Rally.

365
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:55,979
The course length that year was 849 miles,
or 1,366 kilometers,

366
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:58,982
and ended in La Paz,
Baja California Sur, sir.

367
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,585
The overall winning time
was 27 hours, 38 minutes

368
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,387
set by Vic Wilson
and Ted Mangels

369
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:04,955
while driving
a Meyers Manx buggy.

370
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,293
Who're you talking to?

371
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:13,297
Thought you'd appreciate some
relative historical perspective.

372
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:14,464
Well, you thought wrong.

373
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,069
Set the lights.

374
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,241
Number 10,
pan to your left.

375
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:27,344
<i>All eyes are on Frankenstein,

376

<i>and become the first inmate

377
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:33,583
<i>The mysterious Frankenstein

378

<i>after winning his

379
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,689
<i>But that was back
on Terminal Island.</i>

380

<i>Can he repeat that
success here in Africa?</i>

381
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,660
Three.

<i>Unique challenges

383

<i>move from the confines of Terminal

384

<i>The carnage

387
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,181
He's jumping.

388
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,617
We've got a jumper.

389
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:10,687
Fire away.

390
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,629
What about our trackers?

391
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,199
You know something?

392
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,066
What are you doing?

393
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,505
Get out of here, man!

394
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,140

396

<i>And The Jackal

Are you ready
to get serious now?

418
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,907
The roads are narrow,
so pass only on the turns.

419
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:47,777
Weapons are inactive
until mile marker 25.

Lists, what's my top
speed on this thing?

421
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,883
100 miles per hour,
but you wanna keep it somewhere between 50 and 60.

422
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,751
Forget everything
you know about racing.

00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,985
<i>Who's laughing now, Joke?</i>

474
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,158
You know, I gotta tell you something.
I am very, very impressed.

475
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,795
Nice, Goldberg.

476
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:34,531
Fuck logic.

477
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:38,201
Sometimes you just gotta let your
heart and gut tell you what's right.

478
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:42,772
<i>Two Death Racers down. Nine remain,
as we enter Khayelitsha Township.</i>

479
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:02,559
Damn!

480
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,495
Shit.

481
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,909
Go left, left,
left, left, left.

482
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,549
<i>Weapons activated
for this sector only.</i>

483
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,518
Take left!

484
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,262
This is Africa,
son of a bitch!

485
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,811
These people got a damn death
wish. Off the fucking road!

486
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,086
Son of a bitch!

487
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,041
We need to
get outta here!

488
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,644
No, stay with the car!
The tracking device!

489
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,082
Let's go!
Come on! Run!

490
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,321
We've got a runner.

491
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,823
Who?

492
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,091
Pretty Boy's
left his car.

493
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,172
We've got
a lock on him.

494
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:58,141
Fire.

495
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:01,110
He's in the middle of a town.
Won't you kill a lot of innocent people?

496
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:04,247
They will be rewarded in their next life.
Fire when ready.

497
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,998
Shit!

498
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,634
Out of my way!

499
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,297
Fuck!

500
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,181
Watch out, watch out.

501
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,942
No!

502
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,150
Fucking beautiful.

503
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,394
<i>They are coming here!
Seven drivers remain,</i>

504
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:01,030
<i>as they enter
the last leg of stage one.</i>

505
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,198
<i>The lost zone.</i>

506
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,720
Shit!

507
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,957
Hey, Lists,
do you know anything about these guys?

508
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,393
<i>They're the
warlords of Kalahari.</i>

509
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:34,363
They're responsible for exactly 74.5
% of all organized crime in the region.

510
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:38,101
<i>Drugs, prostitution,
kidnapping are their three biggest earners.</i>

511
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:39,502
Great, just
what we needed.

512
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:41,738
Let it go, Luke.
Just finish the race.

513
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,511
Shit. Are these people
even in the game?

514
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,421
Just move out
of my fucking way!

515
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,156
This,
fucking 14K!

516
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,193
He's coming up
behind us. Bitch!

517
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:14,070
Luke, you're in second place.
You have to pass Razor.

518
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:17,073
You're on the last corner before the finish line.
Come on, Luke, push!

519
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,889
<i>Razor takes day one.
Damn!</i>

520
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:35,391
<i>Frankenstein finishing
a close second.</i>

521
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:39,896
<i>14K, Olga, Baby, Psycho
and Nero have all survived.</i>

522
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:42,331
That was amazing, Satana.
Incredible job.

523
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:45,334
I think it's cause for a celebration,
don't you?

524
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,569
Prudence.

525
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,841
Fuck off and tell the rest of them to fuck off, too.

526
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,177
Everybody out.

527
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,580
I said, everybody out!

528
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,120
Keep moving! Come on,
get out, everybody!

529
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,441
Hey, you did
well today.

530
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:34,851
You see, you wanna fuck me now don't you?
You wanna fuck me now.

531
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:37,153
God, she wants to
fuck me now. Typical.

532
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,190
Do you really
wanna fuck me now?

533
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,405
Katrina. Look, I know
I fucked up, okay?

534
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,443
I was just trying
to protect you.

535
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:02,144
It wasn't safe
for you to know.

536
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,521
We can't be
what we were.

537
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,626
Second place.
You're slipping.

538
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:20,429
Lists, let's get
this thing cleaned up.

539
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,236
Frankenstein!

540
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,505
Oh, no fucking way!

541
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:49,392
<i>A fight in the tunnel.
It's Frankenstein.</i>

542
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:51,127
Get him out of there. Now!

543
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,507
Now, get out!

544
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:08,244
Doctor!
We need a doctor!

545
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,083
Doctor!

546
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,356
George Villiers,
1st Duke of Buckingham, Crazy Horse,

547
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,258
Henry III of France,
Henry IV of France.

548
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,467
Am I gonna
be all right?

549
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,703
You're gonna be fine.

550
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:47,750
It's just a scratch.

551
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,561
Now I'm gonna need you
to drop your trousers.

552
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,763
Is that necessary?

553
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:15,077
What? Am I all right?

554
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:17,279
You're going
to be fine.

555
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:21,717
What I probably should have disclosed,
I'm a big fan of yours.

556
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,554
How big?

557
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:28,324
Singer/songwriter Elliott Smith and,
of course, Julius Caesar.

558
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,494
What are you doing?

559
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:33,462
Well, I'm listing the most notable stabbing victims.

560
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,531
He's gonna be okay.

561
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,534
I gotta see him.

562
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,370
How is he?

563
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,576
Wonderful.

564
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:04,827
As girls,
I thought it would only be fitting to offer Frankenstein,

565
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:09,532
our new celebrity,
an incentive, a prize,

566
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,469
a free fuck.

567
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:14,637
All right, honey!

568
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,573
Amber, get up, move it.

569
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,184
Hurry up.

570
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:29,452
Get it, girl!

571
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,293
Say bye to your
boyfriend, honey.

572
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,596
Fucking bitch!

573
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,537
Someone's
fucking your boyfriend!

574
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,874
A gift.

575
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,452
Frankenstein?

576
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,754
Yeah.

577
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,271
So,

578
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:58,674
I was hoping that we could
discuss the terms of our contract.

579
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:01,844
I was thinking six races per year,
three year guarantee.

580
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,947
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

581
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,215
And how much did
you have in mind?

582
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,486
I got Martine
to put together a bid.

583
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:12,321
Oh, you did, did you?

584
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:19,261
You gotta be
kidding, right?

585
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:22,932
Do you know what?
Let's just see how this one concludes tomorrow

586
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:24,967
before we discuss
any future races.

587
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,670
But I gotta tell you,
I am very, very pleased

588
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:29,205
with how things
are going so far.

589
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:30,639
I didn't think
it would be this easy.

590
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,575
What do you mean?

591
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:36,312
I was expecting issues with the freak.
They told me he was a monster.

592
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:37,613
He's a pussycat.

593
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,949
Do not underestimate him.

594
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:45,621
I made a deal with the guy.
I was expecting him to renegotiate. But he didn't.

595
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:46,689
He's planning
something.

596
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,490
Hmm.

597
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,288
Stop fucking me with your eyes
and let's get on with this.

598
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,258
What the
fuck is going on here?

599
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,860
The first time you see
a white nincompoop naked?

600
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:29,798
Come on, move!
Damn it! Come on. Shit.

601
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,044
What's up, baby?
Hey.

602
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:43,646
Let's do it.

603
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:44,947
Where's Lucas?

604
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,417
What are you doing here?

605
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:56,992
Truth time.

606
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,628
Look, I had my reasons.

607
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,832
But I haven't been straight with you.
And I'm sorry for that.

608
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,371
But I wanna
make this right.

609
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:12,408
Well, then don't
lie to us again.

610
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:16,845
Okay. Look, there's something you
all need to know about the race.

611
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:19,515
I did make a deal
with the new boss.

612
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:24,653
To lose.

613
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:27,389
To lose?
You'll have a tough time losing in this car.

614
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:29,024
I know. He had
a gun to my head.

615
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,095
He had a gun
to all of your heads.

616
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:35,464
So, I made a new deal.

617
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,500
And this is what
we're gonna do.

618
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:03,392
<i>Welcome to stage two of Death Race.
Seven drivers remain.</i>

619
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:08,030
<i>Sit back, relax.
The carnage is about to begin.</i>

620
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:17,740
<i>Log on and get inside acces
on your favorite drivers.</i>

621
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,742
<i>For an additional cost,
you can tap in</i>

622
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:23,011
<i>to the closed circuit camea
inside the driver's car.</i>

623
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,481
Death Race.

624
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:27,383
<i>It's a beautiful day</i>

625
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,817
<i>to die.</i>

626
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,831
<i>Nero is in the lead,
followed by Frankenstein,</i>

627
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:46,135
<i>14K, Razor and Olga.</i>

628
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:49,972
<i>The surprising Psycho is sixth.
And Baby is seventh.</i>

629
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:55,744
So, weapons are
active now, yes?

630
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,814
Yes and no.
There's a little twist.

631
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,917
Ooh!

632
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:05,521
<i>The racers approach Keiskie Road,
heading towards the dry lake.</i>

633
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:07,856
<i>Look, they're
throwing you a curve ball.</i>

634
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:10,826
<i>That weapons marker you see
is the last one for 25 miles.</i>

635
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:15,197
<i>But if you die,
the weapon marker reactivates.</i>

636
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,833
<i>So, everyone's
gonna be on your ass.</i>

637
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:20,102
It's because I'm damned if I do,
damned if I don't, right?

638
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,603
You got it, homes.
Exactly.

639
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,154
Weapon marker's
coming up on your left.

640
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:40,656
Okay, over there.

641
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,726
Luke!

642
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:47,062
Almost, almost, come on!
Come on, make it! Yes!

643
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:48,831
<i>Olga wins
the weapons marker.</i>

644
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,066
Fuck it.

645
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:57,739
Hey, sorry, ladies.

646
00:57:57,741 --> 00:57:59,708
Those aren't ladies.

647
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,577
Don't get jealous.

648
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,813
Get your eyes
back on the road.

649
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,981
Sure.

650
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:09,618
There's Olga, up ahead.

651
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,919
Fuck!

652
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,221
Son of a bitch.

653
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,959
Oh, yeah.

654
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:19,595
Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea after all.

655
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:20,929
Why?

656
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,064
'Cause they're
all after us now.

657
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,658
Fuck this!

658
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,164
Man, you get the bitch
out of the way. Come on!

659
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,040
I'm a bad man.

660
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,133
Oh, yeah!

661
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,940
Oh, shit!

662
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:48,650
Yeah!

663
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:51,954
Knock this bitch
out the way.

664
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:53,188
Kiss your fucking ass.

665
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,101
Whoo!

666
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,302
I told you.

667
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,649
What you gonna do, bitch?

668
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,092
What you got?

669
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,271
Come on. Come on.

670
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,352
Eat this!
Oh, shit!

671
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,192
Weapon marker's
dead ahead.

672
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,260
Okay.

673
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,908
<i>The double kill leaves only five cars in the race,</i>

674
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,010
<i>as they head into
Calvinia Township.</i>

675
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,311
Jesus, somebody pissed them off.
I don't think they're friends.

676
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,486
They really
don't like us.

677
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:38,487
Yeah, I'm getting
used to that.

678
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,438
Why don't you warm up
that flame thrower?

679
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:58,874
Finally!

680
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:07,783
Watch out!

681
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,954
Come on!

682
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:15,957
Fucking roll, will you?

683
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:27,936
Whoa!

684
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:37,579
Holy shit, that's awesome!

685
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,322
Okay. It's like that, huh?

686
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,395
Damn it!

687
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,604
Fucking fire.

688
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:03,505
All right.

689
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,076
Son of a bitch!

690
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:09,311
Yeah!

691
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,400
Luke! Watch,
Razor's coming closer.

692
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,576
He's coming up behind us.

693
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,514
Do you wanna play?
Let's end this.

694
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,921
Bitch!
You fucker.

695
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,589
Man. I'm sick
of this asshole.

696
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:07,669
I can see you, devil!

697
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,313
What?

698
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,258
What the fuck are you doing?
Get off me.

699
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,407
This is just
so fucking beautiful.

700
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,326
<i>And that
marks the end of Nero.</i>

701
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:42,464
<i>As we enter the final stage,
we're down to the final four.</i>

702
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:46,301
<i>Driving back through Loeriesfontein to the finish line.</i>

703
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:49,571
<i>Let's see what the warlords of
Kalahari have in store today.</i>

704
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,526
Weapon markers
ready for activation.

705
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,197
Okay, we're clear.

706
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,465
Get me weapons now.

707
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,354
Hang on.

708
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,528
Where's he going?
We're not done yet.

709
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,732
What the fuck you want?

710
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:54,135
What are you doing?

711
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:55,403
Huh?

712
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,704
What's who doing?

713
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,094
You will die!

714
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,842
What was that for?

715
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:35,543
To save your ass.

716
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:39,380
Go, go, go.

717
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:45,386
We got company.

718
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,624
Shit!

719
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:50,692
Camera two,
pick that up.

720
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,234
Motherfucker!

721
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,605
Who the fuck
are these people?

722
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,741
It's okay. I got it.

723
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:07,842
Coming up behind you.

724
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:10,845
Die, you bastard!

725
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,588
This is just
fucking awesome.

726
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,223
Yeah.

727
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,572
You can't run,
motherfucker!

728
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:49,651
This is gonna be close.

729
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:07,535
What now, Luke?

730
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:09,771
It's on.

731
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,529
Camera two, pan in.

732
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:47,642
Camera two, move it!

733
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,923
Let's not lose
that shot, boys. Come on.

734
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,612
Move it, move it.
Do you wanna miss the fucking shot?

735
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,297
Awesome.

736
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:44,365
<i>Day two
concludes with a bang.</i>

737
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:47,468
<i>Tune in tomorrow
for the epic conclusion.</i>

738
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,838
<i>Any rebroadcast or unauthorized
use is punishable by death,</i>

739
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,875
<i>or life in prison
if under the age of 15.</i>

740
01:11:53,877 --> 01:11:56,311
I didn't know
he had a child.

741
01:11:56,313 --> 01:12:00,515
Shocking how little we know
about the ones closest to us.

742
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:02,417
I know virtually nothing
about my secretary here.

743
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:04,986
Conversely, she knows
every aspect of my life,

744
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,789
personal, business,
good, bad and ugly.

745
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:09,824
Turn around and face me.

746
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,041
I'm sorry to hear
about Goldberg.

747
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:30,445
I never knew the man,
but I know how integral he was to your team.

748
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:34,515
What possible understanding can
a man like you know about that?

749
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,584
He was more than just a part of my team.
He was family.

750
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,386
Hmm.

751
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:40,054
Just to be clear,
our deal still stands. Yes?

752
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:45,560
Now, don't let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

753
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:47,628
14K will win tomorrow.

754
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:51,432
You're gonna stall out.
Officially, mechanical failure resulted in your loss.

755
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:52,800
I don't want it to
look like you were beat.

756
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:54,569
Can't damage
your rep now, can we?

757
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:55,670
Are we clear?

758
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:00,675
When I ask you a question,
you answer me. Do you understand?

759
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:03,010
No. Not really.

760
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:06,047
Now get these foolish thoughts
of winning out of your head.

761
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:09,083
You will lose tomorrow,
or so help me God,

762
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:12,687
I will put you in the deepest,
darkest cell I can find.

763
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:15,590
And while you're down there,
crying about that dead spic,

764
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:18,092
just imagine what I'll be doing to your girlfriend.

765
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:19,894
Bad idea.
What are you gonna do?

766
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,496
Threaten to kill me?
No.

767
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:24,031
No, Niles.

768
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:25,967
That would be letting you off too easy.

769
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:32,540
You can live tomorrow,
but you can't win.

770
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:36,644
Maybe. Guess you'll just have to tune in, huh?
Like everybody else.

771
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:04,205
No, no, no, no.
I need to talk in private.

772
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:14,482
I hear you.

773
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,620
Is there something
you wanna say to me?

774
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,088
I was just wondering

775
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:25,660
if you are the original
Frankenstein.

776
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,496
And why is that?

777
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:29,897
Think about it.

778
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:34,836
Who is the man
behind the mask?

779
01:14:34,838 --> 01:14:37,572
Hmm? Does anybody know?

780
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,975
They just want
the monster.

781
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:46,481
And they can take you out in a way
that would kill a normal human being,

782
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,983
and then just slap the suit on
the next guy and hey, presto.

783
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,586
Frankenstein lives.

784
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,989
You think they're
gonna kill me?

785
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:58,593
No. Frankenstein
can never die.

786
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:04,765
He can be shot. He can crash and burn.
He can explode.

787
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:10,505
But Frankenstein
will always emerge.

788
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:13,140
Battered and bruised,
maybe. But alive.

789
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,011
Just makes his legend
even greater.

790
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,753
Yes. Yes, he spoke to me.

791
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,560
What are you doing?

792
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:34,729
What is the
meaning of this?

793
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,967
This is my business.

794
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:43,971
This is my production.

795
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:47,308
No, this is my
production. Mine!

796
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:55,683
And your network was more
than eager to sell it and you out.

797
01:15:55,685 --> 01:15:57,785
Guess you won't be
needing that bid now.

798
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,890
I'll give you a free
pass for that one.

799
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,725
But if you try anything like it again,

800
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:09,330
and I will have you chained up
and I personally will pimp you out

801
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:13,568
to the nastiest fucking psychos in this prison.

802
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,232
Hey, you, stop.

803
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:48,369
Guard.

804
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:50,871
Let her through.

805
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:57,878
All of you.
Leave us.

806
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,616
<i>I thought it would only be fitting to offer Frankenstein,</i>

807
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:05,920
<i>our new celebrity,
an incentive, a prize,</i>

808
01:17:05,922 --> 01:17:07,221
<i>a free fuck.</i>

809
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,294
So did you...

810
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,098
Sleep with her?

811
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,271
No.

812
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:37,818
And you know why
I didn't. Right?

813
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,059
Hey, you.
Get back to work!

814
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,696
Go.

815
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:23,164
I won't let you down.

816
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:26,801
Though I don't have any statistical
evidence to back up that statement,

817
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:28,436
I feel strongly...

818
01:18:28,438 --> 01:18:32,073
Lists, there's no one,
no one I'd rather have watching my back.

819
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:34,875
Thanks, Luke.

820
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,951
Do you mind?

821
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:48,823
Let's do this.

822
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50,758
<i>Okay,
people, listen up.</i>

823
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,294
Whatever happens today,
Frankenstein cannot win.

824
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:55,329
So, keep your eyes open.

825

<i>All eyes are on one man.</i>

827
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:11,112
<i>Frankenstein. He's been the most
dominant driver in Death Race history.</i>

828
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:15,082
<i>But can he hold on for one more
day and win to earn his freedom?</i>

829
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:17,318
Torch these bitches.

830
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,407
Let your heart
and gut guide you.

831
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:41,509
Let your heart

832
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:43,778
You can do this.
You can do this.

833
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:50,351
Luke, watch out for turn three.
It's a massive turn.

834
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,800
I don't like this music.

835
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:09,036
Can you get something else?
God, I hate this music.

836
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,943
Yeah, that's nice. Yes.

837
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:18,078
<i>Frankenstein

842
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,541
Hang on, Katrina.
I've had enough of this guy.

843
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:51,505
Hold on.

844
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,448

Frankenstein just got weapons,
and he's in the lead, about to win.

854
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:30,437
He's gonna need
more than that.

855
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:36,043
Ready the missiles.

856
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:38,178
You wanna kill Frankenstein
while the whole world watches,

857
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,014
the audience will
never forgive you.

858
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:41,482
You will kill
the fucking show.

859
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:43,183
It is mine to fucking kill!

860
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:52,559
Target's locked.

861
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:54,695
He's too close
to the finish line.

862
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:56,630
You could kill
dozens of people.

863
01:23:58,401 --> 01:23:59,633
You know what, Prudence?
You're right. You're always right.

864
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:01,802
You're fired.

865
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:05,706
You're still here?
Get out of my sight now!

866
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:14,314
Okay.

867
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,384
Fire.

868
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:30,264
Hey, guys. Get ready

01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:31,131
Shit.

870
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,334
It's the tracking device.

871
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,106
Oh, fuck.

872
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:44,178
What?
Activate countermeasures!

873
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:47,748
We're not gonna
make it through this.

874
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:49,716
Oh, shit.

875
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:53,253
Activated.

876
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:02,262

do you have?

880
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,298
Well, at least
one more, I guess.

881
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,400
How the fuck did
he survive that?

882
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:42,469
You told me that tracking device was foolproof.

883
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:43,337
Who designed it?

884
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:44,705
Your company did.

885
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,711
Hey, Lists. Patch me
through to 14K's rig.

886
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:52,212
Patch me through to 14K.

You're such a coward.

902
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:41,395
Out, out!

903
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,733

He screwed me over.

Yes.
Yes, it is Frankenstein.

939

Yes, yes. I can confirm that

I've arranged a new pit crew leader for Frankenstein.

Yes, yes, that's

But what of

949
01:31:50,973 --> 01:31:55,208

01:32:08,724 --> 01:32:10,690
I'm not Frankenstein!

955
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,592
<i>He's obviously
still in shock.</i>

956
01:32:12,594 --> 01:32:14,294
<i>We brought his friend down
to calm him down.</i>

957
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,201
Frank?

958
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:24,538
For the last
fucking time,

959
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:29,209
I am not Frankenstein.

960
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:36,082
So you're
absolutely sure?

961
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:41,021
It's him all right.
But I've never seen him like that before.

962
01:32:41,023 --> 01:32:44,190
Prudence, tell them.
Tell them who I am. I'm Niles York.

963
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:45,692
I am not Frankenstein!

964
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:48,728
No!

965
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:03,209
Hello, baby.

966
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:07,113
Is everything okay?

967
01:33:07,115 --> 01:33:08,181
No.

968
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,250
It's perfect.

969
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:15,922
All right,
lovebirds.

970
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,658
We can always
rely on you.

971
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:22,862
To Lists.
To Lists.

972
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:32,672
<i>Did you get my wire?</i>

973
01:33:32,674 --> 01:33:35,775
Yeah, I'm looking at it
right now. It's very...

974
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:39,212
Very generous.
Thank you.

975
01:33:39,214 --> 01:33:41,681
For what you did to that bastard,
I would have paid triple.

976
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:43,383
<i>Well, if I'd known that.</i>

977
01:33:43,385 --> 01:33:44,951
I thought the plan
was to kill him.

978
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:47,153
Well, things change, huh?

979
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:50,090
Personally, I think
I did better than that.

980
01:33:50,092 --> 01:33:52,292
Are you complaining?
Hell, no.

981
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:53,259
How the hell
did you pull it off?

982
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:02,702
That son of a bitch
screwed you over, didn't he?

983
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:06,906
We do this,
one condition.

984
01:34:06,908 --> 01:34:08,708
<i>I made
a deal with the gu.</i>

985
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:11,711
You lose, you live.
You win, you die.

986
01:34:11,713 --> 01:34:12,879
There's something
you all need to know.

987
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:14,247
I did make a deal.

988
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:16,383
With our old boss.

989
01:34:16,385 --> 01:34:18,118
<i>Weyland?</i>

990
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:21,154
And I expected him to at least renegotiate.
But he didn't.

991
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,923
Do not underestimate him.

992
01:34:23,925 --> 01:34:25,392
<i>He's planning somethin.</i>

993
01:34:25,394 --> 01:34:28,294
My way,
my rules, my plan.

994
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,769
I'm gonna need something
very important from you.

995
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:37,003
And what's that?

996
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:38,738
I'm gonna need to
kill you, Goldberg.

997
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:43,276
They're the
warlords of Kalahari.

998
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:45,045
Look, I'm gonna bring these warlords into the race.

999
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:48,148
What are you doing?

1000
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,117
What's who doing?

1001
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:57,023
While everybody's watching,
I'm gonna need you to take yourself out.

1002
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:58,958
I'm gonna need a signal.

1003
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,126
<i>It's gonna be loud.</i>

1004
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:07,100
<i>What do
you need me to do?</i>

1005
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:11,171
We need someone
on the inside.

1006
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:13,339
Done.

1007
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:15,341
The coast is clear.

1008
01:35:17,778 --> 01:35:20,146
I'm sorry to hear
about that dead spic.

1009
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:23,717
This is my production.

1010
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,152
<i>You were right.</i>

1011
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:27,420
Out, out!

1012
01:35:27,422 --> 01:35:28,822
<i>He screwed me over.</i>

1013
01:35:28,824 --> 01:35:30,790
I should have
listened to you before.

1014
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:33,293
Frankenstein is headed to the finish line.
Take him out!

1015
01:35:33,295 --> 01:35:35,361
Do yourself a favor
and listen to me right now.

1016
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:37,497
I'm gonna take
him out myself.

1017
01:35:37,499 --> 01:35:38,998
What do you want me to do?

1018
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,001
Keep him in the room.
No matter what.

1019
01:35:42,003 --> 01:35:42,869
The fucking key!

1020
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:57,083
<i>Death Race
has the ultimate prize.</i>

1021
01:35:58,352 --> 01:36:00,086
<i>You win your freedom.</i>

1022
01:36:02,223 --> 01:36:06,426
This all starts and ends
with Frankenstein.

1023
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:13,099
Someone's alive!

1024
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:15,235
<i>I was just wondering</i>

1025
01:36:15,237 --> 01:36:19,506
if you are the
original Frankenstein.

1026
01:36:19,508 --> 01:36:21,040
<i>Yes,
it is Frankenste.</i>

1027
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:23,042
<i>The tracking deve
confirms it.</i>

1028
01:36:23,044 --> 01:36:26,212
<i>Frankenstein
can never die.</i>

1029
01:36:26,214 --> 01:36:29,916
<i>He can be shot. He can crash and burn.
He can explode.</i>

1030
01:36:29,918 --> 01:36:32,418
But Frankenstein
will always emerge.

1031
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,932
<i>Frankenstein,
he isDeath Race.</i>

1032
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:51,171
<i>Carl Lucas,
may he rest in peace.</i>

1033
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:54,507
Psst! The coast is clear.

1034
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,427
I'm not going.

1035
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:20,533
What are you talking about
you're not going? You have to.

1036
01:37:20,535 --> 01:37:24,037
I was never any
good out there.

1037
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:25,505
I didn't understand
the rules.

1038
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:28,575
In prison,
things make sense.

1039
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:32,278
And, plus, someone
has to stay behind.

1040
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,348
A witness
to tell the tale.

1041
01:37:36,917 --> 01:37:38,151
What you're doing
isn't logical.

1042
01:37:38,153 --> 01:37:40,186
Yeah, he's right.

1043
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:42,255
Someone once told me,

1044
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:45,058
fuck logic.

1045
01:37:47,428 --> 01:37:49,128
Let your heart
tell you what's right.

1046
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:25,298
<i>I spoke to Weyland.
I'm here to help you.</i>

1047
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:28,568
<i>Blueprints, electrical systems,
ventilation shafts.</i>

1048
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:38,912
Now, how would your little
copycat event play

1049
01:38:38,914 --> 01:38:40,613
without the game's
marquee star?

1050
01:38:40,615 --> 01:38:44,250
<i>It's a man in a mask.</i>

1051
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,019
<i>How would the fans kw
which one was real?</i>

1052
01:38:49,123 --> 01:38:51,958
<i>That's why
you're going to fail.</i>

1053
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:56,329
The boy wonder billionaire will
become the laughing stock.

1054
01:38:56,331 --> 01:38:59,065
<i>The Death Race that you all
know and love will not change.</i>

1055
01:38:59,067 --> 01:39:04,470
<i>It will grow bigger and better.
This, I promise.</i>

1056
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:07,941
<i>Now, if you suddenly change
the rules of the game,</i>

1057
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:10,376
<i>you're going to lose
your audience.</i>

1058
01:39:10,378 --> 01:39:12,578
<i>What are you gonna do,
replace me? With who?</i>

1059
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:16,649
<i>Payback's a bitch, son.</i>

1060
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:22,956
<i>I am Frankenstein.</i>
