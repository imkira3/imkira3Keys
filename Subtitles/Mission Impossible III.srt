2
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,568
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

3
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,470
Does that sound familiar?

4
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:45,909
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

5
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:48,644
I gave it to you.

6
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:51,777
Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?

7
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:55,653
Wait... What are you saying?
That wasn't it?

8
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:59,423
- What I gave you, was that...
- I'm going to count to 10.

9
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:03,590
You're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.

10
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,007
Jules, it's going to be okay.

11
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,772
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?

12
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:20,041
One.

13
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:23,445
You listen to me.
I got exactly what you asked for.

14
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:25,817
Did you want something else?

15
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:28,164
If there was a misunderstanding,
I will fix it.

16
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:30,091
I can get it, whatever you want.

17
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:31,353
Two.

18
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:34,888
Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,

19
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,790
like gentlemen.

20
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:40,727
- Three.
- God!

21
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:52,541
All right. All right, all right.

22
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:56,575
I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.

23
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:58,914
I can help you.

24
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:01,684
The way you helped me
on the airplane?

25
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:03,454
That way?

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,485
You put the gun down.
I'm not talking to you like this.

27
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:09,030
That's your choice. Four.

28
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:11,992
The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.

29
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:14,832
You want to know where in Paris?
Then let her go.

30
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:18,032
- 'Cause you will not...
- It's not in Paris. Five.

31
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:21,570
I can get it for you.

32
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:23,558
But you kill her, you do this,
you get nothing.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,910
- Six.
- Are you listening to me?

34
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:29,179
The only way you're going
to get what you want is for you to...

35
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:31,379
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

36
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:33,820
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

37
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:35,755
Where is it? Where the hell is it?

38
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:37,333
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

39
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,827
- Stay with me.
- Seven! Seven!

40
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:44,457
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to kill you!

41
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,626
- Eight!
- No, please.

42
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,470
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

43
00:02:57,114 --> 00:03:00,413
I promise you. I promise you.

44
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:03,179
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

45
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:06,481
Listen to me. Listen to me.

46
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:09,955
I want to help you.

47
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:12,787
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

48
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:16,593
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

49
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,467
No. No.

50
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:30,270
No.

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,322
- Ten.
- Don't!

52
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:32,364
- Ten.
- Don't!

53
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,154
- What are you doing?
- Your brother wants another one.

54
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:13,956
Oh, God, no.
Ethan, that's what we talked about...

55
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:16,075
- I'm watching him. He's fine.
- That's how it is with Rick.

56
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:18,563
He's fine and then suddenly he's naked
and he's hugging everybody.

57
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:21,495
- I'll take full responsibility for Rick.
- You will? Full?

58
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:24,089
- Well, mostly full.
- It's a huge responsibility.

59
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,759
It's going well, right?

60
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:28,167
- It's going really well.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:31,001
Julia, your sister's here.

62
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:33,909
- Give me a hug.
- You look so beautiful.

63
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:36,103
I don't know about that. So, is this him?

64
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:38,841
- I hope so.
- Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.

65
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,513
All right. Mom's dying to see you.

66
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,716
I can't believe
you guys came all the way to Virginia.

67
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,030
Like we'd miss your engagement...

68
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,922
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,

69
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,028
I had one thought,
that it was just too bad

70
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:56,395
that Daddy wasn't here
to walk her down the aisle.

71
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:59,731
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, Mom.

72
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:02,304
That Ethan doesn't have
his parents anymore, either,

73
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,202
I got really sad.

74
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:08,471
But it occurred to me
that this is about starting a new family

75
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,541
and how beautiful that is.

76
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:13,775
And I just want to say
I am making Julia an aunt,

77
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,715
so I expect the same treatment
very, very soon.

78
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,082
Cheers!

79
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:25,090
Department of Transportation?

80
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,390
I've been there over 10 years now.
Wow.

81
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,055
What do you do at the DOT?

82
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:30,689
I study traffic patterns.

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,192
You hit the brakes for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,

84
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,257
you can literally track
the ripple effect of that action

85
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:36,695
across a 200-mile stretch of road,

86
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:38,103
because traffic has a memory.

87
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,199
It's amazing. It's like a living organism.

88
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,181
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka martini?

89
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:43,247
Yeah. Thanks.

90
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:45,247
Ladies, do you need...

91
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,276
- I'd marry him.
- I would, too.

92
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:53,220
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?

93
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:56,257
- Okay, you actually get dropped...
- From a helicopter, yeah.

94
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,327
- It's how they met.
- Really?

95
00:05:58,428 --> 00:06:00,293
- Tell her the story.
- There's no story.

96
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:01,989
It is a good story. Tell the story.

97
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:05,158
First of all,
no one was ever good enough for Julia.

98
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:06,496
Oh, here we go.

99
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:10,539
Not spontaneous enough,
adventurous enough, funny enough...

100
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:13,579
You know what? No, that's not true.
You make it sound like I've never dated.

101
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,629
No one we liked.

102
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,475
- That is true.
- That is true.

103
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:33,860
Then she goes and gets in a chopper
that takes off from this lake...

104
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:36,761
- What was the name of that lake?
- Lake...

105
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:40,235
Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.

106
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:42,732
Wanaka. Thank you.

107
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:45,602
- He heard that?
- How did he hear that?

108
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,733
And the hospital's cool
with you taking three weeks?

109
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,769
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.

110
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,737
I'm psyched that you're going
to be my brother, man.

111
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:19,866
So am I, Rick.

112
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:21,870
No, it's awesome.
I think it's going to be sick.

113
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,345
Me, too, man.
I just got to get the phone.

114
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,278
- You rock hard.
- Okay.

115
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,408
Hello?

116
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:30,611
- Is this Mr. Ethan Hunt?
- Yes, it is.

117
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,222
This is Ready-Travel Resort Services.

118
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:37,953
We'd like to offer you a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.

119
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,671
We ran out of ice.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

120
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,046
- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?
- No, I got it.

121
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,085
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.

122
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:04,517
Thank you.

123
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:23,638
$1.86.

124
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:37,016
Thanks for coming.
Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.

125
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:40,121
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.

126
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,486
How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.

127
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:46,775
- Yeah, you should have come.
- You should have invited me.

128
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,062
- You know I would have.
- Thanks.

129
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:54,662
I know we joke about it, but I am always
this close to begging you

130
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:57,216
to stop training our people
and get your ass back in the field.

131
00:08:57,316 --> 00:09:00,107
But that's not what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.

132
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,340
You know I do. Family's everything.

133
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,915
Come on, John. What's going on?

134
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:14,585
It's Agent Farris.

135
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,216
She was on an operation.

136
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:21,363
She's disappeared.
Been off-grid 11 hours.

137
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:27,002
I'm sending in Search and Rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.

138
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:34,140
You've got good people for that.

139
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,774
Yeah. Yep, that we do.

140
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,786
Wheels up at sunrise
if you have a change of heart.

141
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:47,118
Take some pictures of the party for me.

142
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:08,572
Ethan. Three days ago,

143
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:12,170
Agent Lindsey Farris was captured
while on a surveillance operation.

144
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:15,012
This is the man she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.

145
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,415
Details are eyes-only,

146
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,283
but I can tell you
that Davian's a black-market trafficker.

147
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,290
Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.

148
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,354
At 1400 hours today,

149
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:26,621
a recon satellite ID'd
a caravan of vehicles

150
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:30,358
with plates matching those known to
have been used by Davian's operatives.

151
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:33,026
They stopped at a derelict factory
outside Berlin.

152
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:36,401
It appears they have a hostage.
We believe it's Agent Farris.

153
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,599
Normally we would disavow,

154
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,903
but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer to Davian,

155
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,572
and that's a risk we need to take.

156
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,375
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

157
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:48,040
is to find Lindsey and bring her home.

158
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,414
I've already assembled a team.

159
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:53,415
I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.

160
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,490
This message, let's call it
my excellent engagement gift to you,

161
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:00,655
will self-destruct in five seconds.

162
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:03,357
Good luck, Ethan, and thanks again.

163
00:11:19,282 --> 00:11:20,476
Am I ready?

164
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:35,362
- You okay?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:38,495
Yeah.

166
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:56,082
You know, I'm sorry. I realized
I didn't tell you that the office called

167
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:59,386
during the party.
I have to go to Houston for a night.

168
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:03,391
METRO's having
a public transpo conference.

169
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:09,954
- It's so last-minute.
- I know.

170
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:38,320
Well, well, well.

171
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:42,090
Now, if it isn't
Mr. "Those Who Can't Do, Teach"

172
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:43,722
back in the field.

173
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,994
- What's up, baby?
- Hey, man.

174
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:50,396
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.

175
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,671
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten how good we are?

176
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:57,604
Welcome back, brother.

177
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,404
Is our truck in place?

178
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,631
Weapons good to go?

179
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:26,470
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

180
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,537
You know I got your six.

181
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:31,078
Hey, man. That's your job.

182
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:55,496
Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.

183
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:58,597
Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.

184
00:13:59,642 --> 00:14:01,075
Guns ready.

185
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:08,945
All four guns operational.

186
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:12,748
They've got men on
the second, third, fourth floors.

187
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:15,253
I count 14 of them.

188
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:18,485
Observer, I'm in approach position.

189
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,459
Roger that. Stand by.

190
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:26,863
Target match.

191
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:29,870
The prize is on the sixth floor.
Two Tangos with her.

192
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,570
Moving in.

193
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,216
So, Raider One, at some point,

194
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:52,726
we got to go over
this whole "getting married" thing.

195
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:54,626
Negative, Observer.

196
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:57,562
I don't respect you nearly enough
to have that conversation.

197
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:58,827
You may not respect me,

198
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,062
but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.

199
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,071
So, this girl,
what the hell do you see in her anyway?

200
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:07,336
Who, Julia? You've never met her.

201
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:10,343
Yeah, and the way things are,
I probably never will.

202
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:13,515
Lucky for her, right?
That's what you're thinking.

203
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:15,449
They've got communications gear.

204
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:18,520
Two Tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.

205
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:20,355
Groundhog, that's you.

206
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:22,194
You need to grab that gear
on the second floor

207
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:23,556
as soon as we go hot.

208
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,150
Copy that. I'll need two minutes,

209
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,150
which means
you'll need me in one, right?

210
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,688
Yeah, just about.

211
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:32,130
Raider One,
make a left at the top of the stairs.

212
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:35,170
The prize should be
at the end of the hall.

213
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:55,816
Phoenix, I have eye on the prize.

214
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:57,859
Give her 10 cc's more.

215
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:05,298
- Call me when she wakes.
- Okay.

216
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,137
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?

217
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:09,537
Roger that, I copy.

218
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:12,698
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.

219
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:19,412
Stand by to go live. On my mark.

220
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:21,642
Three.

221
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:22,809
Two.

222
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,648
One. Execute.

223
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:35,558
Warning. Warning.

224
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:58,220
Raider One, you're clear. Move!

225
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:08,063
Lindsey. Lindsey.

226
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:10,993
Ethan?

227
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:14,626
I'm going to get you home.

228
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,438
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.

229
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:22,977
Roger that.

230
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:32,647
This is adrenaline.
Lindsey, you're going to feel this.

231
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:51,669
Groundhog, second floor is clear.

232
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,274
On the move!

233
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:18,200
Observer, we're on the move. Wrap out.

234
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:20,495
- Evac in 90 seconds.
- Roger that.

235
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:22,366
Phoenix, get to the LZ now.

236
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:24,666
Roger, Observer. On my way.

237
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:43,515
Ethan. I have to talk to you.

238
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:45,657
- Come on, come on.
- I have to talk to you right now!

239
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,722
Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.

240
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,389
Do it, Ethan!

241
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:03,071
Ethan!

242
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:14,419
- Lindsey! Moving!
- Moving!

243
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:27,761
Mag!

244
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,728
Ready to move.

245
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:56,662
We evac from here.

246
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,163
Get down!

247
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,065
I'm out. How many rounds you got?

248
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:10,740
Enough.

249
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:23,021
Now I'm out.

250
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:27,828
T minus five, baby.

251
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,434
Lindsey, hold on to me.

252
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,060
Luther!

253
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:07,165
Rolling!

254
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:36,221
God! My head! What is that?

255
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,089
- What is...
- Is she okay?

256
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,327
Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.

257
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:41,960
Zhen, get rid of the truck.

258
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:43,402
Let's go!

259
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:52,775
God! What is that? You can't hear that?

260
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:55,682
- Oh! God!
- What's wrong with her?

261
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:58,515
- Let's go!
- We loaded?

262
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,885
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

263
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:08,226
Go, go, go, go, go!

264
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:31,748
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

265
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:35,220
Guys, we got company.
I'm going to try and lose them.

266
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:36,848
Hurts so much.

267
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,290
Turn it off. Please.

268
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:58,739
Please, Ethan.

269
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,056
Guys, their missiles are hot!

270
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,562
Incoming! Hold on.

271
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:32,640
Okay. That was lucky.
We only get one of those.

272
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:44,018
Do we have a defibrillator?

273
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:47,958
Ethan, turn it off!

274
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:49,931
Bring it on!

275
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:55,230
Ethan! What is it?
Did they put something in my head?

276
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:57,271
They injected you
with a time-release charge.

277
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:59,040
- Do you remember that?
- No. Time-release...

278
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,391
An explosive. They've activated it.

279
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:02,077
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,

280
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:03,441
- which is what we're gonna do.
- No, Ethan.

281
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:04,749
Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart.

282
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:07,273
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.

283
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:08,475
Do it!

284
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:10,677
Guys! They're firing another one!

285
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:20,121
- Ethan!
- Zhen!

286
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:22,697
Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!

287
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:47,416
- I want you to set it for 150.
- 150.

288
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:49,511
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.

289
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,326
- You're gonna be okay.
- It'll need 30 seconds.

290
00:24:52,594 --> 00:24:53,891
Damn it.

291
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,193
- Twenty-five seconds!
- Come on.

292
00:24:56,298 --> 00:24:58,095
We're almost there.

293
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:03,671
- They have us locked.
- Twenty seconds.

294
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:06,602
Hold on.

295
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,953
I got them!

296
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,527
- Ten seconds.
- Almost there. Almost there.

297
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:29,219
Give me the paddles.

298
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,799
Ethan. Thank you.

299
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,097
Shit.

300
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:46,332
Hey.

301
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,236
Hey.

302
00:26:56,852 --> 00:26:58,342
How did it go?

303
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,851
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.

304
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:07,086
I'm just tired.

305
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:38,686
I read your training brief
on Agent Farris.

306
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:41,227
The words you used were
"beyond capable."

307
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:42,728
That still stand, Mr. Hunt?

308
00:27:42,831 --> 00:27:45,163
- Mr. Brassel...
- Does it stand?

309
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,128
Yes, sir, it does.

310
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:50,466
Because we've got a corpse downstairs
that says otherwise.

311
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:52,233
Killed by a detonator

312
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:55,571
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.

313
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:59,908
Mr. Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge
Agent Farris' competence based...

314
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:02,108
It's unacceptable
that chocolate makes you fat,

315
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,242
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?

316
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:06,685
Now, I approved Agent Farris'
surveillance op

317
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:08,915
based on your evaluations, Mr. Hunt,

318
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:11,457
of a woman
who allowed herself to be captured.

319
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,529
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.

320
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,291
You don't grab any of them?

321
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,027
Our objective, Mr. Brassel,
was to recover Agent Farris.

322
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:23,173
Davian employs a cellular structure
at his organization.

323
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:25,312
The men there
more than likely had no information...

324
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,399
Who's drawing these conclusions?
Is it you?

325
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:31,671
- I am, sir. Based upon...
- I'm not on you yet.

326
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:34,882
You allowed Farris
to board your chopper without a scan.

327
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:37,023
That explosive device
could have taken you all out.

328
00:28:37,152 --> 00:28:41,612
There is one reason that you are sitting
here before me today, and that is luck.

329
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:46,023
Because your operation was
poorly conceived and executed worse.

330
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:48,460
- Two laptops were recovered...
- I'm aware of that.

331
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:49,894
We've talked to Tech Services.

332
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:52,364
They doubt
if they can reconstitute the drives.

333
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:55,732
"Crispy," I believe,
is what they called them. Worthless.

334
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:58,135
Mr. Brassel,
as Operation Manager of this office,

335
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,717
- I have the authority...
- Excuse me.

336
00:28:59,817 --> 00:29:02,801
Did you just throw a title at me,
Mr. Musgrave?

337
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:06,277
I don't care if your daddy plays golf
with the President.

338
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:09,475
This is Intelligence.
So far I haven't seen any.

339
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:12,746
You think this op was worth the risk,
Mr. Hunt.

340
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:16,283
What do you know about Owen Davian?

341
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,884
He was the one
who brought gas centrifuge technology

342
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:22,054
to Korea from Pakistan.

343
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:26,328
He was also the man who sold Toxin
Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.

344
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:31,000
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!

345
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,003
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.

346
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:39,079
Wells, not Ellison,
in case you want to be cute again.

347
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:40,944
We can't find him.

348
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:45,518
He knows it. It's emboldened him.

349
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:49,500
I've been trying to bring Davian down
since the day that I got here.

350
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,785
Do you know what I've got for it?

351
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:53,103
It's never been confirmed
the Toxin Five theft was Davian.

352
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:57,188
Mr. Musgrave, please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking rhetorical questions.

353
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,392
Your operation has achieved one thing.

354
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:02,698
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

355
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:07,198
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go inform Mr. And Mrs. Farris

356
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,177
that their baby girl was killed
in a head-on collision on l-95.

357
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,773
I stand here today deeply saddened

358
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:18,848
by the death of one of God's children,

359
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:21,685
Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.

360
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:27,225
It is always startling when the Lord
takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

361
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:33,391
Be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.

362
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:35,594
Now, to fire the lock,
the extractor has to be...

363
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:37,651
That bag's not going to hit you back.
Hit harder.

364
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:40,201
Don't rely on your sights.
Keep your eyes dead on the target...

365
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:41,834
Attack me. Come on.

366
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:45,071
Don't ever release the firing pin
unless the extractor's...

367
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,239
Good. There you go. Good.

368
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:51,848
Identify the target. Point and shoot.
It's very simple. You point and shoot.

369
00:30:51,987 --> 00:30:53,045
Stay focused.

370
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:56,147
Miss Farris, you know
how many recruits I've trained.

371
00:30:56,258 --> 00:30:58,123
I'm proud to say that you are the first

372
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:00,854
that I've recommended
for active field duty.

373
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:02,327
Congratulations.

374
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,829
Am I ready?

375
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:11,130
Yes?

376
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,303
Is this Mr. Kelvin?

377
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:17,707
Yes. Who is this?

378
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,145
I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.

379
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,682
Lindsey Farris
rents a post office box here.

380
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,411
She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin

381
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,419
and asked us to call you
when it arrived.

382
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:28,386
It came this morning.

383
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,092
Thank you.

384
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:39,992
- This right here.
- Thanks.

385
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,687
It's a microdot.

386
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,118
A microdot with nothing on it.
This is unusual.

387
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,214
Lindsey wouldn't send me
a blank microdot.

388
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:04,885
I'm telling you, man, there's no image.

389
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:06,521
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

390
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:07,902
Where the hell am I supposed to look?

391
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:09,650
There's not much square footage
to this thing.

392
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,142
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?

393
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:12,984
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey send you anything?

394
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:15,630
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

395
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:19,364
Listen, man.
I don't mean to cross the line,

396
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:23,406
but was there something going on
between you two?

397
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:25,206
You and Lindsey.

398
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:28,238
Lindsey was like my little sister.

399
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,284
And you never

400
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,117
slept with your little sister, right?

401
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:39,888
Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?

402
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:42,486
Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.

403
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:44,992
Well, that's old school.

404
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:48,591
If she was in a hurry and only had
access to black-market gear, maybe.

405
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:51,001
- Could you get the tools to read it?
- I might know a guy.

406
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,439
- Magnetic means encrypted.
- Yeah, I know that.

407
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,203
Yeah. Be right there.

408
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:59,513
The thing about Lindsey is
she was brand-new.

409
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,776
She was sweet.
Remember when you were sweet?

410
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:06,411
- Can you remember that far back?
- Yeah, well, barely.

411
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:10,279
In Germany,
you asked me what it is I see in Julia.

412
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,818
What I see in Julia is life before all this.

413
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,290
And it's good.

414
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,066
Benji, what have you got?

415
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:22,398
Well, these hard drive platters
are just fried.

416
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:24,288
- Yeah.
- You know, they made a mess of them.

417
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:26,073
It's just like...
There's holes in them and stuff.

418
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,905
And it's got scorched
all the way through. And then...

419
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,540
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

420
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,998
I can't believe. I can't even look at it.

421
00:33:31,098 --> 00:33:33,107
- Benji. Did you recover anything?
- Yes. Yes.

422
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:36,125
Despite the aforementioned conditions
of the hard drive you brought back,

423
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:40,779
I managed to recover
portions of two dozen e-mail files.

424
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:42,413
Also made what I believe to be

425
00:33:42,524 --> 00:33:45,493
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

426
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:49,387
Your Mr. Davian is going
to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow

427
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:52,523
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.

428
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,794
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?

429
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:56,928
It's all got to do with the "Rabbit's Foot."

430
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:58,130
Rabbit's Foot?

431
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:00,010
Yeah, well,
I'm assuming it's like a code word

432
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,249
for something he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

433
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:05,872
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe it's not a code word.

434
00:34:06,014 --> 00:34:08,676
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive bunny appendage.

435
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:10,307
You have no idea what it is?

436
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:13,148
It's interesting. I used to have
this professor at Oxford, okay?

437
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:16,348
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like this massive, fat guy.

438
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,824
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

439
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:21,011
You know... Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

440
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:23,525
He taught biomolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

441
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,656
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

442
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:28,930
with this story about how the world
would eventually be eviscerated

443
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:30,368
by technology.

444
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:33,930
You see, it was inevitable
that a compound would be created,

445
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:36,566
which he referred to as the "Anti-God."

446
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:38,949
It was like an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

447
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:42,107
like an unstoppable force
of destructive power

448
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,979
that would just lay waste to everything.

449
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,280
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

450
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:48,879
and ice cream parlors, you know?

451
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,854
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

452
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,623
willing to spend this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

453
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:59,097
I always assume it's the Anti-God.

454
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:03,464
End-of-the-world kind of stuff,
you know?

455
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:08,369
But, no, I don't have any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

456
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:10,842
- Did you brief Musgrave on this?
- Who, me? No, not yet.

457
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,606
- Good. Don't.
- What?

458
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,655
- Don't tell anyone about this.
- This took me ages.

459
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:16,143
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

460
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:18,518
I want Musgrave to have deniability.

461
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,214
- That's great work, Benji.
- What operation?

462
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:24,491
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

463
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:26,457
You know that, right?

464
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:30,426
Any available resident to Pediatrics.

465
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:33,828
Any available resident to Pediatrics.

466
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:38,501
Rehabilitative Care, call the pharmacy.

467
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:42,299
Rehabilitative Care, call the...

468
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:45,303
I have to go away again.

469
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:49,778
On business. Two days.

470
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,483
Two days?

471
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:54,714
Yeah.

472
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:03,330
Ethan, what's going on?

473
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:07,524
I keep thinking you just need time

474
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:12,871
to tell me whatever it is that it's...

475
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:19,472
But nothing in my mind makes sense.

476
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:23,343
Yeah.

477
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:28,878
What's wrong?

478
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:39,129
What are you not telling me?

479
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:08,057
I need to ask you for something.

480
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:10,596
And it's the most...

481
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:21,868
I need you to trust me.

482
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,444
Of course I trust you.

483
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:34,514
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?

484
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,950
I need you to trust me.

485
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:47,260
Yes.

486
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,103
I trust you.

487
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:54,468
Is it...

488
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,273
Tell me it's real.

489
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:04,149
I mean us.

490
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:07,448
Tell me it's real.

491
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:11,623
Follow me.

492
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,493
The vows you're about to take

493
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:18,157
are not to be taken
without careful thought and prayer.

494
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:23,235
This love is not to be diminished
by difficult circumstances

495
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:26,432
and it is only to be dissolved by death.

496
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:30,308
Do you have the rings?

497
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:31,738
Yeah.

498
00:38:46,194 --> 00:38:47,855
Repeat after me.

499
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:56,933
I, Julia Anne Meade...

500
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,199
"I, Julia Anne Meade..."

501
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:04,769
...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt...

502
00:39:05,747 --> 00:39:08,477
"...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt..."

503
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:11,277
...to be my lawfully wedded husband.

504
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:14,350
"...to be my lawfully wedded husband."

505
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:33,633
Tomorrow may be the only time
we can predict

506
00:39:33,775 --> 00:39:35,333
where Owen Davian is going to be.

507
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:36,967
Charity event. Vatican City.

508
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:40,070
Our mission is to get in
and kidnap Davian.

509
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:42,580
I don't know why he's so happy.

510
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:46,182
I did remind him
that the Vatican is the Vatican.

511
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:50,389
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,

512
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:54,086
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,

513
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:56,662
with over 200 CCTV cameras.

514
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:00,265
That's not even
what makes it a challenge.

515
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:04,566
Getting Davian is good.
But getting his buyers is even better.

516
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:08,731
If they realize he's been grabbed,
they'll disappear.

517
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:10,901
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

518
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:12,342
No matter how we grab Davian,

519
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:14,278
his clients are gonna know
he's been taken.

520
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:17,215
No, they won't. Access point is here.

521
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:20,611
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.

522
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:23,918
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.

523
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:02,673
Now we've pissed off
every Italian in Rome,

524
00:41:02,773 --> 00:41:03,769
go do what you got to do.

525
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:06,231
- Don't forget the smoke.
- Yeah.

526
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,639
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."

527
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:06,508
Alpha team, this is Bravo.
Right on schedule.

528
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:09,442
We should have breach in 60.

529
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:12,180
Roger that. Charlie team, report.

530
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,814
Well, I don't have anything
to report, really.

531
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:20,095
Except I think I should be right on time.

532
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:21,254
We'll be waiting for you.

533
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:24,094
- ETA two minutes.
- Roger that.

534
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:57,378
Charlie team, did you fire the tracer yet?

535
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:00,032
Stand by.

536
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:16,985
Firing the tracer. Now.

537
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:25,920
Alpha, I'm in. T minus two minutes.

538
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:27,427
Roger that.

539
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:31,427
Charlie team, I see you.

540
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:34,300
I'm looping the security feed.
Stand by to move.

541
00:44:34,403 --> 00:44:35,768
Roger that.

542
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,939
Video is looped. Go.

543
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:55,387
Alpha team,
catacomb video taken care of?

544
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:57,516
Taken care of. We're good to go.

545
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:09,369
- Delta team, do you copy?
- All I do is copy.

546
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,972
That's funny.
Get ready to move into position.

547
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:15,543
- I'm already there.
- Really?

548
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,738
ETA 30 seconds.

549
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:21,407
See you in 30.

550
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,427
Alpha team moving into position.

551
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:34,291
Bravo standing by for transmission.

552
00:45:36,365 --> 00:45:37,457
Transmitting.

553
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,132
Got you.

554
00:45:56,886 --> 00:45:58,353
Miss Onia Demea.

555
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:01,056
I should be on the list. Thank you.

556
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:03,502
I'm sorry. Your name is not here.

557
00:46:03,602 --> 00:46:05,424
There must be some mistake.

558
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:15,427
Miss Demea?

559
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:17,763
Just a minute.

560
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,543
She made it.

561
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,532
We have a photo opportunity.

562
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:21,663
Just give me the word. I'm standing by.

563
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,398
Delta, ready for upload.

564
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,448
Delta team, download good.

565
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:56,365
Listen, man, I didn't mean to be
so cavalier the other day

566
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:57,996
about you getting engaged.

567
00:47:58,107 --> 00:48:00,735
I know that. Thanks.

568
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,807
But a normal relationship
isn't viable for people like us.

569
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:09,714
- I don't agree with that.
- Then I'm smarter than you.

570
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:12,310
I'm going up. I agree with Luther.

571
00:48:12,455 --> 00:48:16,391
We can't have real relationships.
But you see, I love that.

572
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,545
Twenty-three months.
That's as long as it'll last

573
00:48:43,652 --> 00:48:46,621
when you got the baggage we do
and the lifestyle we got.

574
00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:48,656
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

575
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:52,523
Look at me.
I know what I'm talking about.

576
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,596
And you know
I know what I'm talking about.

577
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,141
Wait here.

578
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,514
Davian just picked up a briefcase.

579
00:49:32,614 --> 00:49:34,489
We're going to have to
move sooner than we thought.

580
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:38,270
- Can you identify who made the drop?
- Negative. How close are you guys?

581
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:40,433
We're just printing now.

582
00:49:59,728 --> 00:50:01,992
I'm not proud of it.
I'm not happy about it,

583
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:03,928
but I've lived with women a few times,

584
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,126
and it doesn't ever make it to two years.

585
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:07,998
- You can't.
- Thanks for the advice,

586
00:50:08,103 --> 00:50:10,628
but it's different for me
than it is for you, you know?

587
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:12,730
- I'm not in the field anymore.
- Oh, okay.

588
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:15,037
Here's a retirement present.

589
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,775
In our job, there's always going to be
something between you and a woman.

590
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:23,044
Always.

591
00:50:23,185 --> 00:50:25,380
- Luther, listen.
- Dishonesty.

592
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:28,183
A dishonesty that poisons everything.

593
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,951
I think I need to tell you something...

594
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:32,926
Stop talking. This isn't about you, Ethan.

595
00:50:33,629 --> 00:50:37,588
And whoever this girl is, you're going to
end up messing up her life, too.

596
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:39,166
Don't do it.

597
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:43,265
Jules and I got married two days ago.

598
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:47,034
Congratulations.

599
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:50,443
Thanks. Thanks.

600
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:58,050
- He's walking. I'm going in.
- Roger that.

601
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:00,745
I'm on my way.

602
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:07,293
Ma'am. I need you to step back.

603
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:09,329
No. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

604
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:11,831
I always spill red wine
on my white custom-made shirt.

605
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:15,233
- Okay. Step back.
- It's fine. It's fine. Bathroom.

606
00:51:17,973 --> 00:51:19,406
Tell me you're on your way.

607
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:21,203
I'm on the move.

608
00:51:30,286 --> 00:51:31,412
Move it. Come on.

609
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,981
His bodyguards
are checking out the bathroom.

610
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:39,388
I'm almost there.

611
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:21,328
He's going in.

612
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:51,291
Quiet. Read this.

613
00:52:51,433 --> 00:52:52,695
Slowly.

614
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:55,898
Read it.

615
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,073
"The pleasure of Buzby's company

616
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:03,477
"is what I most enjoy.

617
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,376
"He put a tack on Miss Yancy's chair

618
00:53:08,217 --> 00:53:10,845
"when she called him a horrible boy.

619
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:14,246
"At the end of the month
he was flinging two kittens

620
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,119
"across the width of the room.

621
00:53:16,225 --> 00:53:19,092
"I count on his schemes to reveal the..."

622
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,560
- What the hell is this?
- Finish.

623
00:53:23,732 --> 00:53:25,393
Alpha, you're about to have a visitor.

624
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:26,994
Finish!

625
00:53:27,102 --> 00:53:28,694
"...a way to escape my gloom."

626
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:30,066
Got it.

627
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:38,213
Alpha, do you copy?
The guard's on his way.

628
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:39,837
Delta, stall him. I need more time.

629
00:53:39,948 --> 00:53:42,917
It's too late for that. He's in the hallway.

630
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,590
Sir, is everything all right?

631
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,186
Everything is not all right.
Voice mask is still compiling.

632
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:56,958
I need 30 seconds.

633
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:02,028
Sir?

634
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:10,937
Sir?

635
00:54:18,787 --> 00:54:19,981
Six seconds, I'm uploading.

636
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:23,555
- A way to escape my gloom.
- Okay. Go.

637
00:54:23,655 --> 00:54:24,819
- A way to escape my gloom.
- Okay. Go.

638
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:27,985
I'm fine. Wait outside.

639
00:54:42,678 --> 00:54:44,236
See you in the sewer.

640
00:54:52,054 --> 00:54:55,353
- She's sorry about your shirt.
- That's no problem.

641
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:02,027
Her hotel has laundry service,
and she'll happily take care of it.

642
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,428
You want to wash my shirt?

643
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:06,052
What are we going to do
while we're waiting in your hotel room,

644
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:07,465
and I'm not wearing my shirt?

645
00:55:11,673 --> 00:55:13,538
She'll think of something.

646
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,102
She would like to drive.

647
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:17,735
Follow me to the hotel.

648
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:19,643
Sir, would you like us
to watch the case?

649
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:20,806
No.

650
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,015
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

651
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:04,892
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

652
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:06,255
Nothing.

653
00:56:24,479 --> 00:56:26,003
Blow the car.

654
00:56:28,116 --> 00:56:30,107
Oh. It's such a nice car.

655
00:56:30,252 --> 00:56:32,447
And yet, do it.

656
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,840
...covered some hot spots
over in central Eurasia.

657
00:56:56,945 --> 00:56:59,914
I direct your attention
to the third satellite image in the series

658
00:57:00,015 --> 00:57:01,642
forwarded to us by our friends...

659
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,183
Mr. Musgrave to see you.

660
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:04,718
Send him in.

661
00:57:06,822 --> 00:57:10,553
Ethan Hunt and his team
just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.

662
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:14,093
They're headed back now.
I thought you should know.

663
00:57:14,763 --> 00:57:16,993
You were aware of this operation?

664
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:20,499
Yes, I was.

665
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,062
Then good work.

666
00:57:26,808 --> 00:57:28,139
Thank you.

667
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:04,436
You're dead, Mr. Davian.

668
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:11,015
There were witnesses.

669
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:16,619
That was you in the bathroom.

670
00:58:16,725 --> 00:58:18,454
Now, you're going to tell us everything.

671
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,085
Every buyer you've worked with.
Every organization.

672
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:22,458
What the hell is your name?

673
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:24,691
Names, contacts, inventory lists.

674
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:27,666
You have a wife, girlfriend?

675
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:31,972
It's up to you how this goes.

676
00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:34,975
Because you know
what I'm going to do next?

677
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:37,409
I'm going to find her, whoever she is,

678
00:58:37,546 --> 00:58:40,811
I'm going to find her,
and I'm going to hurt her.

679
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:46,453
You were apprehended carrying details

680
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:49,581
of the location of something
code named the Rabbit's Foot.

681
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:53,388
I'm going to make her bleed, and cry,
and call out your name.

682
00:58:53,528 --> 00:58:57,225
And you're not going to be
able to do shit. You know why?

683
00:58:58,767 --> 00:58:59,825
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

684
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:02,199
Because you're going to be
this close to dead.

685
00:59:02,304 --> 00:59:03,464
And who is the buyer?

686
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:07,064
And then I'm going to kill you
right in front of her.

687
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:10,517
- I'm going to ask you one more time.
- What's your name?

688
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:12,173
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?
- Who are you?

689
00:59:12,273 --> 00:59:13,244
And who is the buyer?

690
00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:15,681
You don't have any idea
what the hell is going on, do you?

691
00:59:15,784 --> 00:59:20,221
I mean, you saw what I did to your
little blonde friend at the factory, right?

692
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:25,725
Well, that was nothing. That was

693
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:28,955
fun.

694
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:34,468
That was fun.

695
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,593
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

696
01:00:14,509 --> 01:00:17,000
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

697
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:18,911
Ethan, stop!

698
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:20,447
What is it?

699
01:00:21,683 --> 01:00:23,150
Don't do it!

700
01:00:23,852 --> 01:00:26,343
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

701
01:00:28,457 --> 01:00:29,617
You tell me!

702
01:00:29,724 --> 01:00:31,385
Ethan, stop! Don't do it.

703
01:00:31,493 --> 01:00:33,654
This isn't you, man! This isn't you!

704
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:36,525
We can use him, Ethan! You know that!

705
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:44,939
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

706
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:48,142
Please, stop!

707
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:21,002
What I'm selling,

708
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,701
and who I'm selling to,

709
01:01:26,381 --> 01:01:29,578
is the last thing
you should be concerned about,

710
01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:33,315
Ethan.

711
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,808
Ethan, we got it. Lindsey's microdot.

712
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:37,080
It's a video file.

713
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:44,483
Ethan, I don't know what they've
told you. I don't know what you think.

714
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:46,185
Just listen to me.

715
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:48,819
Brassel sent me to Germany
to surveil an exchange,

716
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,955
to ID a man named Owen Davian.

717
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:53,829
I tagged his phone,
and I intercepted a transmission.

718
01:02:53,935 --> 01:02:57,302
I traced the call through the
IMF network, and this is what came up.

719
01:02:57,405 --> 01:03:00,465
The call to Davian
came from Brassel's office.

720
01:03:01,343 --> 01:03:04,244
It's Brassel.
I think he's working with Davian.

721
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:06,314
I think I'm being set up...

722
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:21,829
Ethan!

723
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:55,986
You all right?

724
01:04:03,605 --> 01:04:05,539
Someone call for help!

725
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:08,906
Does anyone have a cell phone?

726
01:04:42,444 --> 01:04:44,241
Everybody, get down!

727
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:48,112
Get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody, get down!

728
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,901
- There's a woman down.
- I see her.

729
01:05:24,419 --> 01:05:26,717
Get down! Get down! Stay down!

730
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,584
Everybody, get down! Get down!
Stay down!

731
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:32,057
Get down!

732
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:36,658
Open up!

733
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:39,096
Open up! I need the prisoner!

734
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:56,616
Oh, my God!

735
01:05:57,319 --> 01:05:59,719
It's really bleeding.
Don't leave me, okay?

736
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:01,755
Don't worry. I'm right here.

737
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,189
Ethan, there's a G36 in the truck!

738
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:05,350
I know! I know!

739
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,658
Turn the drone around.
There's an IMF agent in the truck.

740
01:06:46,568 --> 01:06:48,798
Ethan! Get out of the truck!

741
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:57,677
Ethan, move!

742
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:10,543
- Hello?
- Rick, this is Ethan. Is Julia home?

743
01:09:10,645 --> 01:09:13,739
Hey, man. Look, I hope you're not mad
I'm here. It's just...

744
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,159
Rick, I'm not mad. Is Julia home?

745
01:09:15,259 --> 01:09:17,170
I tried her cell phone,
and there was no answer.

746
01:09:17,752 --> 01:09:21,347
No. Sorry.
Hey, did your friend find you?

747
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:24,557
Which friend?

748
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,287
I don't know. Just some English guy.

749
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:30,963
Rick, what did you tell him?

750
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:33,933
Look, it's all good, man.
I told him I didn't know where you were,

751
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:37,493
and Julia might, and he should
just try her at the hospital.

752
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:40,299
Hello?

753
01:09:46,414 --> 01:09:49,174
- All right, see you tomorrow, Sally.
- All right. Good night, honey.

754
01:09:56,591 --> 01:09:58,991
Hi. It's Julia.
Please leave me a message...

755
01:10:06,568 --> 01:10:10,527
...at 4:00 today, the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge is closed in both directions.

756
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,470
- Sixth floor.
- Sally, this is Ethan.

757
01:10:12,574 --> 01:10:14,633
- I need to talk to Julia.
- Hey, honey.

758
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,503
She just went downstairs.
I'll transfer you.

759
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:38,626
Damn it!

760
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,559
Excuse me.

761
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:43,053
I was wondering if you knew
where I might find this patient.

762
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:45,732
Probably not. But I'll know who can.

763
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:52,479
What's that?

764
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,730
Sally. Where's Julia?

765
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:12,631
- Where's Julia?
- I think she left.

766
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,962
Have you tried the east building?

767
01:11:21,509 --> 01:11:23,443
- Has Julia left yet?
- I haven't seen her.

768
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,775
- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia?
- Hey, you okay?

769
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,404
- Have you seen Julia?
- No.

770
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:33,784
Watch it, buddy!

771
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,026
- Jules?
- You hung me outside of an airplane.

772
01:11:47,168 --> 01:11:48,965
You can always tell
someone's character

773
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:51,595
by the way they treat those
they don't need to treat well.

774
01:11:51,706 --> 01:11:55,608
- If you hurt her, I swear...
- Don't threaten me. Just don't.

775
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,544
The briefcase I picked up in Rome,
the one you took from me,

776
01:11:59,681 --> 01:12:01,774
contains the location
of the Rabbit's Foot.

777
01:12:01,883 --> 01:12:05,284
You're going to get it and bring it to me.
The Rabbit's Foot.

778
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:08,288
Ethan, you had a watch
last time I saw you.

779
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,154
You have 48 hours,
starting on my mark.

780
01:12:11,259 --> 01:12:12,487
Wait, wait, wait.

781
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,653
Now, call me at this number
when you have it.

782
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:17,493
- Just wait.
- Julia's life for the Rabbit's Foot.

783
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:21,000
- You have 48 hours, or she dies.
- Wait! Wait. Wait.

784
01:12:25,707 --> 01:12:28,005
Condition 1-116. All units on scene.

785
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:30,043
We need you to come with us.

786
01:12:30,178 --> 01:12:32,510
Just... Pete, what the hell is this?

787
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,310
Sorry about that, Mr. Hunt.
We were told to bring you in.

788
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,544
- Okay.
- Get ready to transport.

789
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,449
Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.

790
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:41,954
- Just tell them you came and that...
- Ethan. Get in.

791
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:45,424
We don't want to use force here,
and you know we will. Ethan, get in.

792
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,791
- Tell them that you came here...
- Ethan!

793
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:49,989
...and that I left already, okay?

794
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,097
Freeze!

795
01:12:56,404 --> 01:12:59,532
Ethan, stop! Stop, Ethan!

796
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:15,385
Yeah. Get his hands.

797
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:46,220
I reviewed the transcript
of your Berlin operation.

798
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,221
It's very interesting.

799
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:50,382
It seems that Agent Farris
had some information

800
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:53,723
she wished to share with you
but not with this agency.

801
01:13:53,828 --> 01:13:55,591
Something you failed to report.

802
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:58,894
You ordered the Vatican operation
without proper approvals.

803
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,434
That mission
resulted in a catastrophic attack.

804
01:14:01,536 --> 01:14:03,436
And then you fled the scene.

805
01:14:03,538 --> 01:14:06,632
Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect.

806
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:10,342
You don't get to where I am
without developing a thick skin.

807
01:14:10,445 --> 01:14:12,606
But what I won't stand for,

808
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:16,246
what I will lose sleep over,
and I love my sleep,

809
01:14:16,551 --> 01:14:20,282
is the idea of an irresponsible
rogue agent working in my office.

810
01:14:20,388 --> 01:14:24,154
So I'm going to
slow things way down here.

811
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,263
You can look at me

812
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:32,527
with those judgmental,
incriminating eyes all you want,

813
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:34,328
but I bullshit you not.

814
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:38,269
I will bleed on the flag
to make sure the stripes stay red.

815
01:14:57,325 --> 01:14:59,623
I don't know what to say to you.

816
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,559
Brassel's right. You're out of control.

817
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:06,332
Look at me.

818
01:15:08,102 --> 01:15:12,402
Ethan, at least show me the courtesy
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

819
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:25,281
I intercepted Davian's call. I know he
wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.

820
01:15:25,386 --> 01:15:26,853
It's just...

821
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:30,485
This is

822
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:33,021
so disappointing.

823
01:15:33,661 --> 01:15:37,097
Go to Shanghai.
Feng Shan Apartments... 1406.

824
01:15:42,036 --> 01:15:45,733
I wish there was something I could do
to help you, but...

825
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,010
Take him to the holding cell.

826
01:17:06,854 --> 01:17:08,287
No, I'm on it.

827
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,554
Yes, sir. There's no need to panic.
I'll get him back.

828
01:17:10,654 --> 01:17:11,683
Sir? Ethan Hunt...

829
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,277
I know what happened.
Give me the radio.

830
01:17:13,377 --> 01:17:16,143
This is Director Brassel. Ethan Hunt
is attempting to escape the building.

831
01:17:16,243 --> 01:17:18,205
He's in the west cargo elevator.
He must be stopped.

832
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:21,030
I want Mendoza and Graham
in the situation room right away.

833
01:17:21,135 --> 01:17:22,864
I'm having the building surrounded, sir.

834
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,681
I've got units posted
at all the entrances.

835
01:17:24,781 --> 01:17:28,037
This is Brassel again. I'm ordering
a code-six lockdown. I repeat.

836
01:17:28,142 --> 01:17:30,440
- It's Hunt.
- I know it's Hunt.

837
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:34,943
Hunt was flagged
on sub-basement nine.

838
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:38,348
I want all security personnel
down there now.

839
01:17:38,886 --> 01:17:40,547
Security channel's jammed.

840
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:43,749
Hunt must be holding down
the transmit button.

841
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,112
You've got to be kidding me.

842
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:24,161
Last call for flight 1162 for Helsinki,
now boarding at gate 46.

843
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:29,897
Final call for Mr. Bower.
Final call for Mr. Bower.

844
01:18:30,004 --> 01:18:31,562
Please come to gate 4.

845
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,341
- Mr. Pavel Sobo... Sobotka.
- Sobotka.

846
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:38,503
Sobotka. Okay.
And you're flying to Shanghai?

847
01:18:42,016 --> 01:18:45,679
I don't speak Czech. I'm sorry.
Let's see about your flight.

848
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:46,981
Okay.

849
01:18:47,088 --> 01:18:48,919
- Okay.
- Okay.

850
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:28,845
Don't kill me.

851
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:31,722
I'm sorry.

852
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:34,459
I'm sorry.

853
01:20:36,197 --> 01:20:39,724
Musgrave told us about Julia.
We're here to help.

854
01:20:39,867 --> 01:20:41,960
To get your wife,
you'll need the Rabbit's Foot.

855
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:44,094
According to the plans
from Davian's briefcase,

856
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:47,663
it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor
of the Hengshan Lu Building.

857
01:20:47,775 --> 01:20:49,689
Which is a nightmare
for just about every reason.

858
01:20:49,789 --> 01:20:53,373
They're a Chinese military contractor.
We have no pull, no details.

859
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:55,311
The good news is, whatever it is,

860
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:57,680
the Rabbit Foot's small,
so we can steal it.

861
01:20:57,785 --> 01:21:00,481
The bad news, we got to steal it.

862
01:21:01,355 --> 01:21:04,017
From a thief's point of view,
this is worst-case scenario.

863
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,320
The security guards
are all privately-contracted

864
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:07,792
former People's Liberation Army.

865
01:21:07,895 --> 01:21:10,159
The only access to the lab
is by private elevator.

866
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:12,926
And that can only be activated
by persons inside the lab.

867
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,867
All of it surveilled by
security cameras within the building.

868
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:17,835
What about the roof?

869
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,537
Four guards full time.
Two on each rooftop.

870
01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:23,439
Langley was a cakewalk
compared to this.

871
01:21:23,544 --> 01:21:25,068
That's the one.

872
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,948
- How tall is that building?
- Why?

873
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:30,347
It's 162 meters at the highest point.

874
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:32,949
What about that, the building
on the left? How tall is that one?

875
01:21:33,049 --> 01:21:34,454
Says 226 meters.

876
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:37,217
226. Distance between the buildings?

877
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:39,122
47.55 meters across.

878
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:56,936
Ethan?

879
01:21:57,678 --> 01:22:00,442
That's good. I think it's tall enough.

880
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:04,083
- For what?
- A fulcrum.

881
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:08,883
Oh, you're gonna swing...
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

882
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,390
- You could bounce right off the roof.
- Yes, I could.

883
01:22:11,492 --> 01:22:13,680
Even if you made it to the rooftop,
took out the guards,

884
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:17,357
and got the Rabbit's Foot, you can't just
walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?

885
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:19,092
Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.

886
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,360
Even at 162, you're pushing
minimum height for a jump.

887
01:22:21,502 --> 01:22:23,246
Chute opens any lower than that
and you're dead.

888
01:22:23,346 --> 01:22:24,292
What are you going to do?

889
01:22:24,392 --> 01:22:26,489
Land in the middle of Shanghai
and hope no one notices?

890
01:22:26,589 --> 01:22:27,802
Central Park's two blocks away.

891
01:22:27,908 --> 01:22:29,959
Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying
I have a better idea,

892
01:22:30,059 --> 01:22:32,378
but there's a point
where bold becomes stupid.

893
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,954
Now, we don't even know
what this thing is, and you're talking

894
01:22:35,054 --> 01:22:37,924
about handing it over to a guy
who provides terrorists with information.

895
01:22:38,024 --> 01:22:40,330
Luther, of course I'm not
suggesting that we just hand it over.

896
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:43,196
We're going to tag the Rabbit's Foot
so we can trace it and know where it is.

897
01:22:43,296 --> 01:22:46,091
Now, you know we can get
that gear here. I just deliver it myself.

898
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:49,060
We contact Musgrave,
have the IMF trace a tag, order a raid,

899
01:22:49,163 --> 01:22:50,926
get the Rabbit's Foot back, grab Davian.

900
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:53,728
Now, if I get out with Julia, we win.

901
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,632
If I don't, then...

902
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,911
Look, then she's dead anyway.
And so am I.

903
01:23:07,114 --> 01:23:08,411
You know?

904
01:23:08,549 --> 01:23:12,883
Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12.

905
01:23:15,389 --> 01:23:18,517
And we have two hours
before they kill my wife.

906
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,156
Are you in or not?

907
01:23:28,736 --> 01:23:30,431
Of course we're in.

908
01:24:02,841 --> 01:24:04,604
You got 18 minutes.

909
01:24:07,012 --> 01:24:08,912
You're going to make it over there.

910
01:24:09,014 --> 01:24:12,347
You're going to find the Rabbit's Foot,
get back to the roof,

911
01:24:12,484 --> 01:24:14,244
radio me when you're ready to make
the jump,

912
01:24:14,386 --> 01:24:16,820
and we're going to come get you.

913
01:24:17,823 --> 01:24:19,552
Thank you for coming.

914
01:24:20,325 --> 01:24:21,792
That's my job.

915
01:24:58,096 --> 01:24:59,427
Batter up.

916
01:25:27,225 --> 01:25:30,251
Oh, yeah. They're freaking out.
Hit them again.

917
01:27:05,156 --> 01:27:06,282
Okay.

918
01:27:07,826 --> 01:27:08,826
He made it.

919
01:27:09,027 --> 01:27:10,392
He made it.

920
01:27:13,531 --> 01:27:15,294
I knew he'd make it.

921
01:27:29,848 --> 01:27:32,749
I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.

922
01:27:40,925 --> 01:27:43,325
- It's been 12 minutes.
- He's got five minutes left.

923
01:27:43,428 --> 01:27:46,864
If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes,
Julia's dead.

924
01:27:46,965 --> 01:27:48,330
Anything?

925
01:27:49,901 --> 01:27:50,901
Negative.

926
01:27:51,036 --> 01:27:53,163
How about you? Any good news?

927
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:54,704
No, nothing.

928
01:27:54,873 --> 01:27:56,363
Come on, Ethan.

929
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:07,117
What is that?

930
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:16,590
When I was little I had a cat,
and he used to run away all the time.

931
01:28:18,096 --> 01:28:21,224
And it's just a prayer I'd say
to bring him home.

932
01:28:23,168 --> 01:28:24,692
Teach it to me.

933
01:28:26,471 --> 01:28:28,772
I've got the Rabbit's Foot,
but I can't make it to the roof.

934
01:28:28,872 --> 01:28:31,594
What the hell do you mean you can't
make it to the roof? Where are you?

935
01:28:31,694 --> 01:28:33,735
Look up! Look up, look up!

936
01:28:36,614 --> 01:28:38,775
- Oh, shit.
- He's way too low.

937
01:30:29,561 --> 01:30:32,553
- Ethan! Get in! They're coming!
- Who?

938
01:30:32,697 --> 01:30:35,325
Building security, and they're pissed.

939
01:30:37,936 --> 01:30:39,767
Okay. Go, go, go, go.

940
01:30:46,644 --> 01:30:48,737
How much time you got left?

941
01:30:49,047 --> 01:30:50,844
Less than two minutes.

942
01:30:57,155 --> 01:31:00,283
You gotta get us out of here.
I lost the signal.

943
01:31:02,994 --> 01:31:04,757
- You okay?
- Not yet.

944
01:31:13,137 --> 01:31:14,263
Come on. Come on.

945
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:23,397
I don't have a signal.
I don't have a signal.

946
01:31:23,497 --> 01:31:24,694
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!

947
01:31:33,091 --> 01:31:34,149
Zhen!

948
01:31:36,294 --> 01:31:37,921
Damn it. I'm sorry.

949
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:47,831
Put pressure on it.

950
01:31:48,339 --> 01:31:51,467
- Tell me when you get a signal.
- What are you doing?

951
01:32:10,561 --> 01:32:12,119
I got a signal!

952
01:32:16,467 --> 01:32:17,764
Hit redial.

953
01:32:19,904 --> 01:32:22,600
You only had five seconds left.
Do you realize that?

954
01:32:22,707 --> 01:32:25,005
The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.

955
01:32:25,376 --> 01:32:29,369
The train yard at Dunan Zhong Lu.
Wait for me there. Alone.

956
01:32:32,684 --> 01:32:34,151
- Yeah?
- Go secure.

957
01:32:34,252 --> 01:32:35,480
We are.

958
01:32:36,587 --> 01:32:38,612
I have the Rabbit's Foot.

959
01:32:38,723 --> 01:32:40,953
- You okay?
- I'm tagging it now.

960
01:32:43,928 --> 01:32:46,353
You need to run a trace.
Make sure we have eyes on this thing.

961
01:32:46,453 --> 01:32:49,366
- What's the tag?
- 6-3-9-6-4-1.

962
01:32:50,335 --> 01:32:51,495
Got it.

963
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:55,569
I see you on Luang Tao Lu Road.

964
01:32:55,673 --> 01:32:59,165
If you don't hear from me in eight hours,
you send an army after this thing.

965
01:32:59,277 --> 01:33:01,142
- Good luck.
- You, too.

966
01:33:08,553 --> 01:33:10,350
- Mr. Musgrave.
- Yeah.

967
01:33:10,588 --> 01:33:12,647
It's come to my attention
that yesterday afternoon

968
01:33:12,757 --> 01:33:14,247
you sent a team to the Far East.

969
01:33:14,892 --> 01:33:16,951
We received intel that
Hadaam Saleen Bahar

970
01:33:17,061 --> 01:33:18,323
was en route to Shanghai.

971
01:33:18,429 --> 01:33:20,727
- Hadaam Saleen Bahar.
- That's right.

972
01:33:20,865 --> 01:33:22,853
You know what I'd love?
I'd love to see that intel.

973
01:33:22,953 --> 01:33:25,370
- I'll be in my office.
- Yes, sir.

974
01:33:37,882 --> 01:33:39,372
Thanks again.

975
01:33:39,784 --> 01:33:41,752
I'll see you back home.

976
01:33:42,653 --> 01:33:43,881
Ethan.

977
01:33:45,089 --> 01:33:48,058
You know they probably plan
to kill you both.

978
01:33:49,761 --> 01:33:52,059
Then I won't see you back home.

979
01:33:53,631 --> 01:33:55,189
Better get back.

980
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,580
Drink it. No questions.

981
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:49,544
Good morning.

982
01:36:05,463 --> 01:36:06,589
Jules.

983
01:36:07,798 --> 01:36:10,665
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

984
01:36:10,768 --> 01:36:12,827
Does that sound familiar?

985
01:36:13,571 --> 01:36:15,869
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

986
01:36:16,607 --> 01:36:18,268
I gave it to you.

987
01:36:18,876 --> 01:36:21,071
Now, I'm going to count to 10

988
01:36:21,212 --> 01:36:24,841
and you're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is

989
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,615
or she dies.

990
01:36:52,810 --> 01:36:56,143
Seems we have a lot to talk about.
Don't we?

991
01:36:58,983 --> 01:37:00,917
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

992
01:37:01,018 --> 01:37:03,748
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

993
01:37:03,854 --> 01:37:04,912
Where is it?

994
01:37:05,022 --> 01:37:06,446
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

995
01:37:06,546 --> 01:37:07,844
- Look at me. Stay with me.
- Seven!

996
01:37:07,944 --> 01:37:10,088
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to...

997
01:37:10,194 --> 01:37:12,059
- Eight!
- No, please.

998
01:37:13,864 --> 01:37:17,391
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

999
01:37:18,002 --> 01:37:20,994
I promise you. I promise you.

1000
01:37:21,372 --> 01:37:24,068
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

1001
01:37:25,109 --> 01:37:28,044
Listen to me. I want to help you get
whatever you want.

1002
01:37:28,145 --> 01:37:31,672
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

1003
01:37:32,617 --> 01:37:34,084
No, please...

1004
01:37:36,721 --> 01:37:37,779
No.

1005
01:37:40,024 --> 01:37:41,024
No.

1006
01:37:41,392 --> 01:37:43,121
- Ten.
- Don't!

1007
01:37:59,977 --> 01:38:03,606
I pushed him as far as he can go.
I know he's not lying.

1008
01:38:03,914 --> 01:38:05,438
I understand.

1009
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:09,213
I've got some questions
I want to ask him first.

1010
01:38:31,676 --> 01:38:33,303
It's complicated.

1011
01:38:40,217 --> 01:38:42,412
You can't just open the canister.

1012
01:38:42,553 --> 01:38:45,386
We had to make sure
you brought the real thing.

1013
01:38:45,523 --> 01:38:48,822
The Rabbit's Foot. Now we know.

1014
01:38:57,601 --> 01:39:00,832
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!

1015
01:39:10,081 --> 01:39:13,517
Davian's translator,
his Head of Security.

1016
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:17,947
Remember?
At the Vatican she failed him.

1017
01:39:20,324 --> 01:39:24,522
Ethan, Julia is still alive.

1018
01:39:25,329 --> 01:39:29,197
Davian wanted to kill you both,
but I convinced him otherwise.

1019
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:33,134
Julia hasn't seen me.
She doesn't know anything. She's clean.

1020
01:39:33,304 --> 01:39:35,602
She can go on to have a life.

1021
01:39:36,006 --> 01:39:40,568
As long as you tell me,
what was in Lindsey's message?

1022
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:44,412
I know she sent you a microdot
from Berlin.

1023
01:39:45,816 --> 01:39:48,284
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?

1024
01:39:48,419 --> 01:39:51,354
Is that why she sent the message
to you? Did you read it?

1025
01:39:51,455 --> 01:39:53,082
Did anyone else see it?

1026
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:55,488
Did she know about the work
I was doing?

1027
01:39:55,593 --> 01:39:57,561
Could I be compromised at IMF?

1028
01:39:57,661 --> 01:39:59,288
Ethan. Ethan.

1029
01:40:00,765 --> 01:40:03,097
Did she buy that Brassel set her up?

1030
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,929
Did she buy that?

1031
01:40:06,203 --> 01:40:07,636
You told him.

1032
01:40:09,006 --> 01:40:11,474
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

1033
01:40:11,609 --> 01:40:13,167
You told him.

1034
01:40:15,146 --> 01:40:17,410
I thought you could get her back.

1035
01:40:17,515 --> 01:40:21,110
But I wasn't gonna let Brassel,
of all people, undo the work I'd done.

1036
01:40:21,218 --> 01:40:25,655
I took action, Ethan, on behalf
of the working families of our country.

1037
01:40:25,790 --> 01:40:27,189
The Armed Forces, the White House.

1038
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:29,225
I'd had enough
of Brassel and his sanctimony.

1039
01:40:29,326 --> 01:40:32,625
IMF Executive Director.
He's an affirmative action poster boy.

1040
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:36,188
You grab Davian like he wanted,
then what?

1041
01:40:36,801 --> 01:40:38,428
Davian's a weed.

1042
01:40:40,137 --> 01:40:44,164
You cut him out, two more spring up
just like him the next day.

1043
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:46,275
Arrest him? Then what?

1044
01:40:47,711 --> 01:40:49,110
You use him.

1045
01:40:50,581 --> 01:40:53,209
Collaborate with him.

1046
01:40:54,718 --> 01:40:56,709
And it's Christmas.

1047
01:40:58,556 --> 01:41:01,491
In 18 hours,
the Rabbit's Foot will be delivered

1048
01:41:01,592 --> 01:41:04,891
to its Middle Eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel to prove it.

1049
01:41:04,995 --> 01:41:07,828
US Security Council will get a report
by this time tomorrow.

1050
01:41:07,932 --> 01:41:10,992
We're talking a military strike
within a week.

1051
01:41:11,402 --> 01:41:13,461
And when the sand settles,

1052
01:41:13,938 --> 01:41:16,406
our country will do what it does best.

1053
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:19,202
Clean up. Infrastructure.

1054
01:41:20,945 --> 01:41:22,537
Democracy wins.

1055
01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:29,750
What was Lindsey's message?

1056
01:41:30,788 --> 01:41:34,087
You tell me, and Julia walks.

1057
01:41:36,694 --> 01:41:39,162
It's the only play you have left.

1058
01:41:40,531 --> 01:41:43,898
Not till I hear her voice,
know she's alive.

1059
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:47,367
Of course.

1060
01:42:00,484 --> 01:42:01,849
Put her on.

1061
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:11,045
- Jules?
- Ethan?

1062
01:42:11,145 --> 01:42:12,046
- Jules?
- Ethan?

1063
01:42:12,146 --> 01:42:15,127
When we met,
there was a lake near the mountain.

1064
01:42:17,334 --> 01:42:19,302
What was the lake called?

1065
01:42:20,638 --> 01:42:21,866
Wanaka.

1066
01:42:22,473 --> 01:42:24,031
Please, Ethan.

1067
01:42:24,241 --> 01:42:26,766
- Jules.
- Ethan, I don't understand...

1068
01:42:46,163 --> 01:42:47,653
Benjamin Dunne.

1069
01:42:48,432 --> 01:42:49,490
Benji, it's me.

1070
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,626
- Ethan.
- What? No. Really?

1071
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:54,610
Listen to me very carefully.
I need your help.

1072
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:59,371
I need to trace the location
of the last call made from this phone.

1073
01:42:59,476 --> 01:43:01,103
Look, no. Ethan. Shush.

1074
01:43:01,211 --> 01:43:02,999
They're looking...
Everyone's looking for you.

1075
01:43:03,099 --> 01:43:06,107
Everyone I know. They're looking...
I just looked it up.

1076
01:43:06,216 --> 01:43:08,047
Okay, you're on
Interpol's most wanted list.

1077
01:43:08,152 --> 01:43:10,620
And that, by the way,
is a spectacular list to be on.

1078
01:43:10,721 --> 01:43:13,215
Whatever happened, I'm sorry,
but I'm hanging up now right now.

1079
01:43:13,315 --> 01:43:14,588
Benji, I don't have time for this.

1080
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:16,343
What do you think happened?
I've been set up.

1081
01:43:16,443 --> 01:43:19,420
I think I like my job. Okay? A lot.

1082
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:21,725
All right? And you know
they're gonna be taping this call.

1083
01:43:21,825 --> 01:43:24,429
And you know you can erase it.
I'm giving you the number right now.

1084
01:43:24,535 --> 01:43:26,628
- Are you ready?
- All right. Just hang on.

1085
01:43:26,737 --> 01:43:29,103
I'm gonna lose my citizenship
because of this, you know.

1086
01:43:29,206 --> 01:43:32,039
7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.

1087
01:43:32,176 --> 01:43:34,940
Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold the line, please.

1088
01:43:49,259 --> 01:43:50,851
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

1089
01:43:50,995 --> 01:43:52,189
Okay.

1090
01:43:52,896 --> 01:43:56,024
Maybe we can share a jail cell together,
you know?

1091
01:43:56,166 --> 01:43:58,691
If this all goes tits up, which it will.

1092
01:43:58,836 --> 01:44:00,633
The location of that number
is Shanghai.

1093
01:44:00,738 --> 01:44:02,032
There, I just told you. Shanghai.

1094
01:44:02,132 --> 01:44:04,864
I've just aided and abetted an enemy
of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.

1095
01:44:04,964 --> 01:44:07,140
Am I close?
Use this phone to track my location.

1096
01:44:07,244 --> 01:44:09,644
Oh, you're there. Well, you're close.

1097
01:44:09,747 --> 01:44:11,510
How close?
Is the signal in the building?

1098
01:44:11,615 --> 01:44:13,129
No, no, no. It isn't coming from there.

1099
01:44:13,229 --> 01:44:14,983
It's in a building
one mile to the northeast.

1100
01:44:15,085 --> 01:44:16,677
Benji, lead me to the signal.

1101
01:44:29,233 --> 01:44:32,725
There is one thing. What the hell
are you doing in Shanghai?

1102
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:35,031
I'll tell you when I see you.

1103
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:45,844
What you...
You need to go north.

1104
01:44:45,949 --> 01:44:48,315
Okay, there's a bridge.
Get to it, cross it.

1105
01:44:48,419 --> 01:44:51,752
Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile
along the river.

1106
01:44:51,889 --> 01:44:53,686
I got it. I got it.

1107
01:45:29,093 --> 01:45:31,040
Good, good. That's right.
Keep going. Keep going.

1108
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:32,669
Make your next left
and then the next one.

1109
01:45:32,769 --> 01:45:34,221
And then follow that down 1,000 yards.

1110
01:45:34,331 --> 01:45:35,992
A thousand yards.

1111
01:45:36,366 --> 01:45:39,267
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay. Left. Left.

1112
01:45:39,837 --> 01:45:41,988
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
Keep going. Keep going.

1113
01:45:42,088 --> 01:45:44,166
Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi.

1114
01:45:44,308 --> 01:45:45,775
Benji, where?

1115
01:45:45,876 --> 01:45:48,140
- Benji? Which way do I go?
- Now take a right.

1116
01:45:54,885 --> 01:45:56,352
Okay. Go down, left.

1117
01:45:56,787 --> 01:45:58,618
Left? I'm going left.

1118
01:46:00,524 --> 01:46:01,616
Good, good.

1119
01:46:01,725 --> 01:46:03,454
It's in the second building on your left.

1120
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,926
The signal bearing's
plus or minus three meters

1121
01:46:06,029 --> 01:46:07,155
from the northeast corner.

1122
01:46:07,698 --> 01:46:08,960
I owe you.

1123
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,150
Jules. Jules.

1124
01:48:08,819 --> 01:48:10,446
You're gonna be okay.

1125
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:14,752
Oh, God!

1126
01:48:15,292 --> 01:48:16,316
God!

1127
01:48:27,004 --> 01:48:29,438
I've activated the charge in your head.

1128
01:48:34,945 --> 01:48:37,413
You have maybe four minutes left.

1129
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:49,586
Didn't I tell you
she'd call out your name?

1130
01:48:55,699 --> 01:48:58,668
Ethan. Ethan.

1131
01:49:02,806 --> 01:49:03,864
No.

1132
01:49:08,745 --> 01:49:10,042
Please.

1133
01:49:14,885 --> 01:49:18,218
And I told you I was going to kill you
in front of her?

1134
01:49:18,355 --> 01:49:20,880
Well, I'm going to kill her in front of you.

1135
01:51:13,437 --> 01:51:14,563
Ethan?

1136
01:51:17,874 --> 01:51:19,341
Are you okay?

1137
01:51:20,444 --> 01:51:22,173
I don't understand
what's going on, Ethan.

1138
01:51:22,279 --> 01:51:25,214
- I know. I know. Just wait.
- What do those men want from you?

1139
01:51:25,315 --> 01:51:27,943
Why are we here?
How did you find me?

1140
01:51:29,052 --> 01:51:31,850
Please, Ethan.
What the hell is going on?

1141
01:51:32,022 --> 01:51:33,319
Are you okay?

1142
01:51:33,457 --> 01:51:37,154
Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, God.

1143
01:51:40,297 --> 01:51:44,165
I'm going to tell you everything.
You just stay with me.

1144
01:51:50,807 --> 01:51:53,708
Ethan. What's happening?
What are you looking for?

1145
01:51:53,844 --> 01:51:56,540
- We've got to get out of here.
- Not yet.

1146
01:51:58,348 --> 01:52:00,043
- They don't have one!
- What?

1147
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:02,550
- A defibrillator.
- A defibrillator?

1148
01:52:02,686 --> 01:52:03,778
Ethan?

1149
01:52:04,554 --> 01:52:08,490
Ethan? Who are these people?
What the hell are we doing here?

1150
01:52:11,394 --> 01:52:12,622
Good!

1151
01:52:14,064 --> 01:52:16,157
This is a Beretta 92F.

1152
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,797
It's a very accurate,
close-range weapon.

1153
01:52:18,902 --> 01:52:21,132
- Don't point it at me.
- Sorry.

1154
01:52:23,106 --> 01:52:24,505
It holds 15 rounds.

1155
01:52:24,608 --> 01:52:27,975
When the mag is empty,
the slide will lock back like this.

1156
01:52:28,078 --> 01:52:30,308
How do you know so much about this?

1157
01:52:30,413 --> 01:52:33,007
To reload, push this button.

1158
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:35,008
The empty mag falls out

1159
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:37,052
and you shove the other one in,

1160
01:52:37,187 --> 01:52:39,655
like the batteries in the flashlight
in the kitchen,

1161
01:52:39,756 --> 01:52:41,690
then release the slide.

1162
01:52:44,895 --> 01:52:47,013
- Why are you giving me a gun?
- There could be others.

1163
01:52:47,113 --> 01:52:48,793
If you have to use it, you stay low.

1164
01:52:48,899 --> 01:52:51,595
You identify your enemy.
Point and shoot.

1165
01:52:51,735 --> 01:52:53,293
It's very simple. Point and shoot.

1166
01:52:53,403 --> 01:52:54,768
Stand back.

1167
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,598
Good.

1168
01:52:58,942 --> 01:53:01,672
I have a charge in my head.
I'm going to die unless you kill me.

1169
01:53:01,778 --> 01:53:03,769
- What?
- Throw the switch on and off.

1170
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,438
- Don't forget the off.
- I can't do that.

1171
01:53:05,538 --> 01:53:07,645
You can bring me back.
I'll come back.

1172
01:53:07,751 --> 01:53:09,981
- I can't.
- You have to! There's no time!

1173
01:53:10,086 --> 01:53:11,553
Now! Please!

1174
01:53:18,428 --> 01:53:20,953
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. I love you.

1175
01:53:21,264 --> 01:53:22,595
I love you.

1176
01:54:37,741 --> 01:54:38,969
Oh, God.

1177
01:54:45,148 --> 01:54:46,615
Come on, baby.

1178
01:54:50,987 --> 01:54:54,388
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

1179
01:54:54,524 --> 01:54:58,119
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen.

1180
01:55:03,233 --> 01:55:07,727
Come on, baby.
I need you to come back.

1181
01:55:09,172 --> 01:55:10,730
I need you back.

1182
01:55:56,986 --> 01:55:58,283
Oh, God.

1183
01:56:07,564 --> 01:56:08,963
You did that?

1184
01:56:12,836 --> 01:56:13,928
Wow.

1185
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:42,923
So, I was just thinking...

1186
01:56:45,368 --> 01:56:49,304
I was thinking you might want to tell me
why we're in China.

1187
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:52,068
I know.

1188
01:56:56,179 --> 01:56:57,237
I...

1189
01:56:59,048 --> 01:57:00,913
I work for an agency.

1190
01:57:01,985 --> 01:57:03,577
It's called IMF.

1191
01:57:06,322 --> 01:57:08,290
What does that stand for?

1192
01:57:09,526 --> 01:57:11,585
Impossible Mission Force.

1193
01:57:12,562 --> 01:57:13,756
Shut up.

1194
01:57:14,664 --> 01:57:16,029
No, I'm not kidding.

1195
01:57:16,132 --> 01:57:20,000
You don't understand.
Everything I'm telling you is top-secret.

1196
01:57:20,136 --> 01:57:21,831
You can trust me.

1197
01:57:22,338 --> 01:57:23,600
Yeah, I know.

1198
01:57:25,008 --> 01:57:27,568
Just wanna show my appreciation
for your work.

1199
01:57:35,051 --> 01:57:38,953
Call it reparations for anything
I might have put you through.

1200
01:57:39,355 --> 01:57:41,448
You should know
the White House has contacted me.

1201
01:57:41,558 --> 01:57:43,890
Now, there's a job that they are

1202
01:57:44,561 --> 01:57:47,155
very interested
in speaking with you about.

1203
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:53,034
Thank you,

1204
01:57:54,103 --> 01:57:55,327
but I have a lot to think about.

1205
01:57:55,427 --> 01:57:58,397
You aren't considering quitting,
are you, Ethan?

1206
01:57:58,541 --> 01:58:01,135
I'm considering
going on my honeymoon.

1207
01:58:04,113 --> 01:58:05,273
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

1208
01:58:05,381 --> 01:58:06,473
Yeah.

1209
01:58:08,284 --> 01:58:09,842
Hey, one thing.

1210
01:58:11,421 --> 01:58:13,685
The Rabbit's Foot. What is it?

1211
01:58:17,126 --> 01:58:19,924
Promise me you'll stay, I'll tell you.

1212
01:58:22,565 --> 01:58:25,363
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Fair enough.

1213
01:58:26,305 --> 01:59:26,401
