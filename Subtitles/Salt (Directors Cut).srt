2
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,470
Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think l am.

3
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,097
I'm really not who you think l am.

4
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,059
Please. Please. I'm not a spy.

5
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,769
-You are a spy.
-l'm not a spy.

6
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,064
-Please let me go home.
-Try again.

7
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,940
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

8
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,069
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

9
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,654
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

10
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,909
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,995
I am not a spy! l am not a spy!

12
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,894
-Try again.
-l am not a spy.

13
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,687
-You are a spy.
-l am not a spy.

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,189
Don't lie to me.

15
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:58,117
I am not a spy.

16
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,496
It is through the grace
and munificence...

17
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,040
...of our glorious Dear Leader...

18
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,836
...that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea...

19
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,589
...has pardoned
the American imperialist...

20
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:16,844
...for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.

21
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,556
Keep your head down. Don't say
anything till we make the swap.

22
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,351
In case Kim Jong ll here
changes his mind.

23
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,325
Exchange.

24
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:47,916
Right face!

25
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,544
I don't understand.

26
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,963
You don't understand what?

27
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,634
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life...

28
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,554
...is not worth blowing
operational cover.

29
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,930
You got that right.

30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,101
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good, we will.

31
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,311
So why did you do it?

32
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,315
Well, l didn't do it.

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,067
He did.

34
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,280
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

35
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,035
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

36
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:26,246
We didn't need the publicity
so l figured we better do something...

37
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,958
...or he's gonna invade this
goddamn rice-paddy republic himself.

38
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,518
You okay?

39
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,105
Yeah.

40
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,901
Hey.

41
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,863
-Good morning.
-Happy anniversary.

42
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,076
You want me to make you breakfast?

43
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,662
How about pancakes?

44
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,789
Your cooking?

45
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,958
You're joking. You like my cooking.

46
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,127
Germans don't joke.

47
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,255
Burt likes my cooking.

48
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,347
Get your bugs off the table.

49
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:12,644
-They're spiders.
-They're bugs.

50
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:21,611
Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.

51
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,365
Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back...

52
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,368
...and over one another
about a third of the way.

53
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,874
Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.

54
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,168
Are you doing this
on company time?

55
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,005
-And insert your favorite silverware....
-lt's my anniversary.

56
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,508
And l want it to be perfect.

57
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,218
But...

58
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,887
...that is not sexy.

59
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,765
No, but it is utilitarian.

60
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,100
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

61
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,854
I ran the trace. First name Usam,
last name Utsaev.

62
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,522
-Any verifiable hits?
-One.

63
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,026
Hey, Francis, do me a favor and
stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

64
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,278
Mata Hari here's
got a big night tonight.

65
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,655
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

66
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,784
"Sir"? Do l look like a "sir" to you?

67
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:09,993
From head to toe.

68
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,288
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

69
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,626
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

70
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,504
Was I ever that young?

71
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,965
Younger.

72
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,468
Walk me out.

73
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,471
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

74
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,473
Oh, you know. The usual.

75
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,059
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia...

76
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,188
...the day before it happens. How about
you? I heard that interview went well.

77
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,065
Fingers crossed.

78
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,484
You sure about this?

79
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,612
You know, once you start pushing
paper, there's no turning back.

80
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,157
I had the strangest feeling
when l was out last time.

81
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,785
-l was homesick.
-Homesick?

82
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,287
-Sir! Sir!
-Can't you take something for that?

83
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,042
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 1 0 minutes ago.

84
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,545
-Here?
-l guess he's not buying our cover.

85
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,713
-Did you get his bona fides?
-He's Russian.

86
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,007
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

87
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,385
-He's a strange guy.
-How's his English?

88
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,679
Passable. Not great.

89
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,723
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance....

90
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,519
-Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
-Yeah, and l got a plane to catch.

91
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,728
Come on, Salt.

92
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,065
No one can sort out a nutjob
from the real thing faster than you.

93
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,277
-l got 25 minutes.
-l got 26. Let's go.

94
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,286
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

95
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,705
-Who called Counterintelligence?
-Not me.

96
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,499
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

97
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,503
-Peabody.
-Salt.

98
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,468
Please remove the hood.

99
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,180
Microphones are on.

100
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,307
Checking levels.

101
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,018
Baseline recorded.

102
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,233
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

103
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,487
-Ev.
-Yeah.

104
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,823
Commencing audio
and visual recording.

105
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,958
Testing earpiece.

106
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,505
Interview has commenced at 1442.

107
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,309
You're married.

108
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,855
A husband must be a distraction...

109
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,651
...for a female intelligence officer.

110
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,986
Well, we're here to talk about you.

111
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,321
So, what is your name?

112
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,866
My name is...

113
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:59,412
...Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

114
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,834
I have cancer.

115
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,045
I'm moved.

116
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,339
A defector with cancer.

117
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,551
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

118
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,390
If l have gained anything
by damning myself...

119
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:24,646
...it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

120
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,275
Russia is also dying.

121
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,861
-But unlike me, she's not dead.
-Oleg Vassily Orlov...

122
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,740
...shows up in 1 993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

123
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,201
He was on Victor Barisovsky's
staff there.

124
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,661
He checks out as FSB, Ev.

125
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,706
Scan says he's truthful
on the cancer.

126
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,291
Prior to '93?

127
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,752
-Russia was once strong, powerful....
-Nothing.

128
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,254
He doesn't exist.

129
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,174
And she will be again
when things have been set back...

130
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,343
...on the correct path.

131
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:58,305
I have somewhere l need to be,
Mr. Orlov...

132
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,057
...so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

133
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,439
I came here to tell you a story.

134
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,150
I don't like stories.

135
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,111
But l'll listen anyway.

136
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,196
In English, please.

137
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,157
Others are listening.

138
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,077
1 975.

139
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,788
The Cold War.

140
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,375
In a gymnasium in Grozny...

141
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,794
...a Soviet Olympic wrestler...

142
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,506
...named Sasha Fyorodovich
Chenkov...

143
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,592
...meets for the first time...

144
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,096
...the only female chess grand master
of her era:

145
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,976
Anja Nurekyova.

146
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,355
Within a month, they were married.

147
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,983
And within a year, a child.

148
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,569
One month more...

149
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,782
...the child was back
in the same hospital...

150
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,325
...sick with fever.

151
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,246
And within days after that...

152
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:09,000
...the child suddenly was dead.

153
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,048
Yes, a child was dead.

154
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,427
And, yes, a child was buried.

155
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,188
But the Chenkov baby was alive...

156
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,734
...and became the property
of another man.

157
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:39,280
A master spy who had
devised the greatest plan...

158
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,785
...a Russian patriot
could ever invent.

159
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,289
A plan to destroy America.

160
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,917
It had all started...

161
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,046
...with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

162
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,342
In 1 959, he emigrated to Russia.

163
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,429
Three years later, he returned home.

164
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,390
But the man
who came back to America...

165
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:11,020
...was in fact a Russian spy
named Alek.

166
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,941
On November 22nd, 1 963...

167
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,861
...Alek became the first success
of the new program...

168
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:23,324
...and a hero of the Soviet Union.

169
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,619
The spymaster was now
given the go-ahead...

170
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,622
...to create many more like Alek.

171
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,251
Scores of agents,
males and females...

172
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,045
...to be substituted for Americans.

173
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,883
I pledge allegiance to the flag....

174
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,177
At an abandoned monastery...

175
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:46,139
...Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English...

176
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,850
...long before they learned Russian.

177
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,144
Drilled in idiom...

178
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,521
...idiosyncrasy and...

179
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,857
...ideology.

180
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:02,238
And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming...

181
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,492
...the spymaster
made warriors of iron.

182
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,037
Unquestioning and unbreakable.

183
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,456
Who crossed first?

184
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,374
Who crossed last?

185
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,467
You're killing me, man.

186
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,844
When does the good fairy come in?

187
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,971
Never.

188
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,890
It's a story without hope.

189
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:34,062
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

190
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,774
There was an accident.
The family died.

191
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,902
Chenkov was sent to America...

192
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,447
...to live a complete lie...

193
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:48,493
...and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

194
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,703
Day X.

195
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,375
The long-awaited mission is here.

196
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,045
Chenkov will travel
to New York City...

197
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:03,383
...to kill the president of Russia...

198
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:09,138
...at the funeral of
the American vice president.

199
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,769
Chenkov is KA 1 2.

200
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,605
-"KA."
-Cold War legend.

201
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,607
Highly trained
Russian sleeper agents...

202
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,653
...inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

203
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,699
Supposedly they'd wait years
to strike. Decades, even.

204
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,826
Supposedly.

205
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,037
-What, you don't believe in moles?
-l believe in moles, all right.

206
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,539
Just not the bogeyman.

207
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,667
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

208
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,752
This guy's selling smoke.

209
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,838
Wrap it up, Ev.

210
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:47,302
So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? ls that it?

211
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,013
Okay.

212
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,432
Thank you very much.

213
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,185
And what would you like
in return for that information?

214
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,063
I simply wish to help you do...

215
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,649
...what you need to do.

216
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,112
You're good.

217
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,992
The KA program
is brilliant bullshit.

218
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,203
But l'm officially off duty...

219
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,999
...so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

220
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,251
-Salt.
-Yes?

221
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,756
The name of the Russian agent
is Salt.

222
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,383
Evelyn Salt.

223
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,722
My name is Evelyn Salt.

224
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,017
Then you are a Russian spy.

225
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,770
Truthful.

226
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:44,734
So far the fMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

227
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,614
Ted?

228
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,914
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

229
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,750
-l need to get to the phone.
-Not after the neural scan.

230
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,711
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

231
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,838
I am trained to, and so is he.

232
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,633
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

233
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,386
-Let me call my husband.
-Let me see it.

234
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,975
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

235
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,936
They don't just blow up their cover...

236
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,605
...they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

237
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,400
-Do you remember Henley's wife?
-Yes, I do.

238
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,068
Speaker.

239
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:31,030
Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks. Bye.

240
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,908
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

241
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,119
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

242
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,621
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

243
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,793
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

244
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,462
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

245
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,425
-l'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
-l didn't say you were.

246
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,719
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

247
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,972
No, no. We gotta go to
a secure location. Now.

248
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,432
All right.

249
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,309
Doesn't get any more secure
than this.

250
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,646
Ev? Five minutes.

251
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,484
-Call Protective Services, find Mike.
-l will.

252
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,820
This is bullshit.

253
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,659
Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

254
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,288
I know we're heading
into your jurisdiction.

255
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,248
-l'm just asking for five minutes.
-No.

256
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,216
If l have to. You can't have
five minutes. I have to talk to her.

257
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,802
-She's scared. Don't you see that?
-l don't care.

258
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,347
There is a mole in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. l am sure.

259
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,404
Please step in the elevator.

260
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,058
--Russian president, okay? So I'm
gonna ask you to step out of my way.

261
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,399
What the hell is that?

262
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,026
Sir.

263
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,904
I gotta pee.

264
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,826
-Where do you think he went?
-No one saw him coming out the front.

265
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,871
-Jesus Christ.
-Here he is again.

266
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,916
No sign of him so far on the street.

267
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,876
It's two minutes ago,
before lockdown.

268
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,671
-Anything clean on him?
-We just got a match, sir.

269
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,548
It's May Day, 1 981 .

270
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,925
There's Brezhnev. And there....

271
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,218
-Orlov.
-That's him.

272
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,263
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

273
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,515
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter...

274
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,727
...airport, train station, taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

275
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:51,063
-Get me Medford on a secure line.
-Yes, sir.

276
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,942
-Top-right screen. ls that live?
-Yes, sir.

277
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,485
Where is she going? Track her.

278
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,115
No one may leave the building.

279
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,534
Rink Petroleum, Security.

280
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,621
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

281
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,293
-We lost the visual on her.
-Damn it. Where'd she go?

282
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,295
We are on security lockdown.

283
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,298
Dave? lt's Evelyn, is Mike there?

284
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,800
No, l'm sorry. He left after lunch.

285
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,552
Hey, happy anniversary, huh?

286
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,387
The stairwell.

287
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,098
-Second floor.
-What's on that floor?

288
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,934
-lt's empty, a security buffer.
-lsolate and seal it.

289
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,402
Get her records to my handheld.

290
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,281
East corridor.

291
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,997
Notifying Metropolitan Police.

292
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,591
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

293
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:07,056
We got her.

294
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,558
Locking down all floors.

295
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,144
Security Protective Service
responding to threat.

296
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,401
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

297
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,736
-Yes, sir.
-Director Medford, sir.

298
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,738
Get me a side arm.

299
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,866
I'll call her back.

300
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,833
-Shit.
-Lost visual.

301
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,752
Where is she, Albert? Talk to me.

302
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,046
Come on.

303
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,764
North hallway.

304
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,490
There, interrogation room,
bring it up.

305
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,447
Switch down, switch down.

306
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,456
-Have you found him?
-What the hell are you doing, Ev?

307
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,791
This doesn't look good.

308
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,709
-Let's do it.
-Move.

309
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,337
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

310
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,963
Get your panties off the camera.

311
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,299
Get where we can see you
so you don't get hurt.

312
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,469
-Have you found my husband?
-These boys aren't fooling around.

313
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,810
Please. I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

314
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,520
Call me when you find Mike.

315
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,980
Sweeping corridors
outside the elevator.

316
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,695
Put the masks on.

317
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:28,155
Situation is hot.

318
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,501
Open the door about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.

319
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,046
-Tac team in position. Waiting for a go.
-ls that absolutely necessary?

320
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,006
What, you want me to shoot her?

321
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,384
Get a medical team in place now.

322
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,607
We're ready.

323
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,029
Now.

324
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,872
Okay, on my count.

325
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,584
Three, two, one. Go.

326
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,884
Jesus Christ.

327
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,942
Where is she? Come on, guys.

328
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,987
-Find her, Albert. Now.
-Suspect has escaped.

329
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,197
There. Bring that up.

330
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:57,119
Stay with her,
she's crossing the street.

331
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,787
Pan the goddamn camera.

332
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,760
Back that up and zoom in.

333
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,763
-We're looking for Michael Krause.
-Freeze.

334
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:19,600
-We're looking for her husband, Mike.
-What the hell are you doing, Ev?

335
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,603
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

336
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,397
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

337
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,484
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

338
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,402
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes away.

339
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,529
We can cover it,
but she won't go there.

340
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,366
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

341
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,076
Okay.

342
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:38,953
Taxi!

343
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,416
U Street. l'll tell you when to stop.

344
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:56,261
Hi, this is Mike. Please leave
a message after the tone.

345
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,207
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Ev...

346
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,460
...and as such, enjoys pretty much
unrestricted access...

347
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,046
...to the borders of North Korea.

348
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:34,675
So brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

349
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,179
He's the perfect cover
to get us inside.

350
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,471
Mike?

351
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,060
Mike? Honey?

352
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,443
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

353
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,570
It's all right.

354
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:43,869
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

355
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,108
Come on. Come on.

356
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,908
Check for back exits.

357
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,469
Go! Go!

358
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,725
Bedroom, clear!

359
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:52,104
Kitchen is clear.

360
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,899
Office, clear!

361
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,819
Living room, clear!

362
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,639
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

363
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,210
Come here.

364
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,796
What are you doing?

365
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,466
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

366
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,135
Did it ever occur to you that
that Russian was lying?

367
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,803
-Why'd she run?
-l don't know.

368
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,890
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

369
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,142
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

370
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,561
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

371
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,396
"Maybe" is your department.

372
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,232
Mine is catching her
so we can find out.

373
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,069
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

374
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:24,363
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

375
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,574
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

376
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,951
Should it?

377
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,830
-ls your mom home?
-No.

378
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,582
-No? Can you do me a favor?
-Yeah.

379
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,918
Hi. You babysit Burt for me?

380
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:42,089
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah? Here's some money for food.

381
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,049
Hi, Burt.

382
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,926
What you doing?
You doing homework?

383
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,220
Yeah, math.

384
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:52,057
-Algebra.
-l hate math.

385
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,028
Hi. Nice to see you again.

386
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,323
-You talking to me?
-Yeah, I've seen you here before.

387
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:13,161
Yeah, l-- Yeah, l come here a lot.

388
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,788
You?

389
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,582
Oh, l'm working here.
At the museum.

390
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,627
-l'm an arachnologist.
-A what?

391
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,796
A spider hunter.

392
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,216
You look like one.

393
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:34,307
There are 40,000 species of spiders
in the world.

394
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,020
And that one is mine.

395
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,229
You discovered it.

396
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,647
Inside North Korea.

397
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:46,319
I named it Terrijoolsima peterbesti.

398
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,573
Do you get that?

399
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,617
No. Should I?

400
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,454
Peterbesti? I named it
after Pete Best.

401
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,164
The first drummer before Ringo.

402
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,501
Best never was a famous Beatle...

403
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,340
...but now he's a famous spider.

404
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,863
I got her.

405
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,783
She's heading north
towards the Metro station.

406
00:32:33,451 --> 00:33:00,435
Ev!

407
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,989
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

408
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,411
Excuse me.

409
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:33,176
-Will do. Headed there now.
-There she is.

410
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,430
All teams, southbound
toward the bridge. Box her in.

411
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,359
Circle around!

412
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,278
Salt! Stop!

413
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:53,738
-Keep her in your sights!
-Coming up behind you!

414
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,282
Fuck!

415
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,288
Keep back! Hold your fire!

416
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,665
Salt! Down!

417
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,960
Salt!

418
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,759
Spread out!

419
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,971
-Salt!
-Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

420
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,265
-On the ground. Now!
-Please don't. No!

421
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,476
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

422
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,853
I have to find my husband.

423
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,813
-Why'd you run?
-To find my husband!

424
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,773
-That's not a reason.
-Don't shoot.

425
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,317
-Stay back!
-Last chance.

426
00:34:30,484 --> 00:34:32,986
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

427
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,488
-Don't make me put you down.
-Put the gun down!

428
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,199
-Give yourself up!
-Come on, Ev.

429
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,910
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, l promise.

430
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,330
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

431
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:46,124
Somebody's going to try to
kill the Russian president.

432
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,044
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

433
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,504
There's nowhere to run! Quit now!

434
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,006
No, I didn't do anything.

435
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,549
Get back! No!

436
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:05,185
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1 , heading north.

437
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,187
Get a roadblock in place now.

438
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,201
Metro Police on alert.

439
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,409
There she is. On the tanker.

440
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,120
Stop. Stop!

441
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,048
Ev!

442
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,358
You, my friend, have got
a mole in your group.

443
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,778
-We don't know that yet.
-l'd say she's a trained goddamn liar...

444
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,656
...and everything she's said
has been to protect her cover.

445
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,451
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

446
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,295
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

447
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,899
Okay, take it down.

448
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:14,082
Shit!

449
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,714
Okay.

450
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,509
Ted, I know you're her friend...

451
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,137
...but we gotta drop a net
on New York.

452
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,390
-We gotta do it now.
-Let's go!

453
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,479
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

454
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,400
Tell them Salt might be
coming their way.

455
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:44,279
And if she is,
Orlov may not be far behind either.

456
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,325
You seen this?

457
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,911
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

458
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:56,374
She was in a car accident with
her parents in '88. They both died.

459
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:02,422
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy
for the American children of the staff.

460
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,550
That's why we put her on Russia
in the first place.

461
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,597
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

462
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:25,028
Send everything we've got on Orlov
to N.Y.P.D.

463
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,908
And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up...

464
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,702
...and preparations are continuing
well into the night...

465
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,956
...for the funeral of
Vice President Maxwell Oates.

466
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:22,669
Among the dignitaries attending the
service at St. Bartholomew's Church...

467
00:40:22,836 --> 00:40:25,296
...is Russian president
Boris Matveyev...

468
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,966
...who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.

469
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:33,096
Public transportation will experience
delays, with subway closures and....

470
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,142
Evelyn.

471
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,353
Look at me.

472
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:45,191
If there was a way, l would kill them.

473
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,988
You shouldn't have come here.

474
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:52,699
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

475
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,578
Now they know who you are.

476
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,621
Who?

477
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,457
Evelyn.

478
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,502
Who?

479
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,840
I would accept anything about you...

480
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,758
...but l need to know.

481
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:14,012
So look at me. Look at me.

482
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,683
Just tell me, okay?

483
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,351
Just tell me.

484
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,606
I work....

485
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,525
I work for the ClA.

486
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,030
So you see, there's....

487
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,950
There's no future for us.

488
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,039
You're not safe with me.

489
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,542
I don't wanna be safe.

490
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,755
I know you...

491
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,591
...and l wanna be with you.

492
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,387
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.

493
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,849
Okay?

494
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,687
Okay. Okay.

495
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:28,628
Welcome to New York, Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

496
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,922
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

497
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,256
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

498
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:43,226
-l'll put these in the closet, sir?
-Yeah, fine.

499
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:13,760
I do solemnly swear...

500
00:44:13,928 --> 00:44:20,934
...that l will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States...

501
00:44:21,102 --> 00:44:26,398
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

502
00:44:26,566 --> 00:44:30,235
That I will faithfully discharge...

503
00:44:30,403 --> 00:44:32,946
...the duties of the office
on which l'm about to enter.

504
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:36,158
...the duties of the office
on which l am about to enter.

505
00:44:36,326 --> 00:44:39,620
-So help me God.
-So help me God.

506
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:47,878
A solemn day here in New York City.

507
00:44:48,046 --> 00:44:50,964
The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates...

508
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:54,843
...a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold War warrior...

509
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:57,387
...whose greatest legacy
may be as architect...

510
00:44:57,555 --> 00:45:00,849
...of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

511
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:03,018
Russian president Boris Matveyev...

512
00:45:03,186 --> 00:45:05,979
...has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer...

513
00:45:06,147 --> 00:45:10,359
...to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the West.

514
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:10,516
What's the security perimeter?

515
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,728
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

516
00:46:13,895 --> 00:46:17,231
And those are Secret Service agents,
not CIA.

517
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,860
-So relax.
-That's real funny.

518
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,571
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

519
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,659
Detail, halt.

520
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:33,080
Forward, march.

521
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:54,352
Due to the funeral,
the 51 st Street station is closed.

522
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:03,235
Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51 st Street station is closed.

523
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,616
What--? Hey, what's going on?

524
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,701
Hey! There's smoke.

525
00:47:12,954 --> 00:47:15,998
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

526
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,785
Eleanor. Good to see you.

527
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,079
Thank you.

528
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:01,043
-Boris.
-Mr. President.

529
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,882
Hello.

530
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:20,104
Please be seated.

531
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,702
Stand by for president's speech.

532
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,875
Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.

533
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,627
Mrs. Oates.

534
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:48,799
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald....

535
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:53,053
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

536
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,432
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

537
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:05,399
I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.

538
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,860
As vice president...

539
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,573
...he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

540
00:49:13,074 --> 00:49:14,366
And today...

541
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:19,288
...the world says goodbye
to a great man.

542
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,257
I'll check the back.

543
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,927
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

544
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,121
My friendship with Maxwell Oates...

545
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,291
...began in the unlikeliest of places:

546
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,962
-Lima Zulu 4, come in.
-Across the negotiating table....

547
00:50:08,129 --> 00:50:10,297
What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?

548
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,674
We got two MlAs.

549
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:16,971
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel outside
the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

550
00:50:17,138 --> 00:50:20,266
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

551
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:22,059
What's going on, guys? Talk to me.

552
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:25,354
Subunits Lima Zulu 1 , 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

553
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,605
Converge on the crypt.

554
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,816
He made all the difference,
and for that...

555
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:33,863
...he will always have
my respect and admiration.

556
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,661
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

557
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,628
What's going on?

558
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,015
Matveyev.

559
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,059
Get goddamn Matveyev.

560
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,868
-Get the bomb squad in here!
-Go, go!

561
00:52:42,575 --> 00:52:47,329
Drop it!

562
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,548
-Any MTs down here?
-l see her.

563
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,467
-Keep your hands up!
-Shooter's at 1 2 o'clock.

564
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,887
-Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
-Don't move!

565
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,265
-Do not move! Do not move!
-Keep your hands up!

566
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,685
-Take her down, take her down!
-Check for other weapons.

567
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,105
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

568
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,107
I can't feel a pulse.

569
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,402
Jurisdiction is clear.
This is New York City.

570
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,030
N.Y.P.D. has her.
She's going to 1 Police Plaza.

571
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,741
-l'm not arguing jurisdiction.
-We don't know yet, sir.

572
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:26,493
-The shooter is CIA. l know her.
-Yes, I'll be there.

573
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,120
I'll be on the next chopper out.

574
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,998
-Have your superior call the mayor.
-Open up, guy, open up.

575
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,583
Move it.

576
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,251
Back it up! Back it up!

577
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,379
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

578
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,798
Let's go, let's go.

579
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,009
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

580
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,218
-Back up!
-Keep moving.

581
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,636
Sir, back up!

582
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,389
Why? Why?!

583
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,852
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

584
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,604
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

585
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,814
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark hole!

586
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,483
Get ahold of yourself.

587
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,651
Get the door, get the door.

588
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,488
-Get off me!
-Back off, man! Back off!

589
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:03,989
That's it. Let's go.

590
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,950
Stand back.

591
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,204
Close it! Go, go, go!

592
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:26,011
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

593
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,763
Jesus Christ.

594
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,348
Yeah.

595
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,683
You were right about her.

596
00:54:32,685 --> 00:54:35,187
She had the drop on me, Ted.

597
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,273
Why didn't she shoot?

598
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,886
Natasha.

599
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,805
Is that you?

600
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,058
Did they give you a new face?

601
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,895
I'm going home tomorrow, Shnaider.

602
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,897
Home to Grozny?

603
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:23,318
My home is in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.

604
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:28,949
My favorite place there is McDonald's
on Fern Street...

605
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,451
...because it's near the river.

606
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,788
But l won't want to go there
anymore...

607
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,125
...because my mother and father
are dead.

608
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,002
Natasha...

609
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,380
...will you miss me?

610
00:55:44,465 --> 00:55:48,677
My name is Evelyn Salt.

611
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,116
Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

612
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:03,669
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

613
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,672
Right now! Hands in the air!

614
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:27,401
-Hey, did you see that?
-Hey, get those guys over here.

615
00:57:27,568 --> 00:57:29,861
Get them over here to help.

616
00:57:44,877 --> 00:57:47,462
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

617
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,166
What college will you attend?

618
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,209
Princeton University.

619
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,421
-Where will you work?
-The Central Intelligence Agency.

620
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,631
Who will you trust?

621
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,508
No one.

622
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,053
Be very patient.

623
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,929
Remember your training.

624
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,100
Remember, you're not the only one.

625
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,894
There are many others.

626
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,355
All of you waiting to strike.

627
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:49,608
-Yes.
-And we will strike.

628
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,487
-Together.
-Yes.

629
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,574
Wait.

630
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:04,247
One day, l will come for all of you.

631
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,130
Hello, Evelyn.

632
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:15,634
I'm Martin Crenshaw
from the U.S. Embassy.

633
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:19,679
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

634
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:30,607
Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their new leader's words...

635
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:34,277
...and called on him to take strong
action against what they are calling...

636
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:38,156
...a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U.S.

637
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,367
These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks...

638
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,703
...of anti-American protests
across Russia.

639
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:47,040
"We will strike back,"
says the new Russian president...

640
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,626
...angrily condemning
today's assassination...

641
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:53,255
...by American intelligence officer
Evelyn Salt.

642
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,425
As the body of slain President Matveyev
is on its way back to Moscow...

643
00:59:57,593 --> 01:00:00,178
...anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia...

644
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,056
...with bombings of U.S. diplomats'
cars in Moscow.

645
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,310
The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.

646
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,522
Responding to
a rapidly escalating crisis...

647
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,900
...President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting...

648
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:17,487
...with cabinet members, military
leaders and NATO representatives.

649
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,574
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

650
01:00:26,747 --> 01:00:29,666
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

651
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,801
You were not supposed
to get married.

652
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:44,389
Not unless it had
great tactical advantage.

653
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,266
I did it to seem normal.

654
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,102
When you escaped today, l thought:

655
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:53,440
"Even I could not have hoped
for so much."

656
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:57,485
You are my greatest creation.

657
01:00:58,654 --> 01:01:00,822
You trained me well.

658
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,445
My husband, you have him?

659
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,989
I had to be certain.

660
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,242
But now you trust me?

661
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:46,451
Completely.

662
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,169
So...

663
01:01:56,545 --> 01:01:58,588
...tell me what's next.

664
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:01,091
Next, part two:

665
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:05,595
We seize control of
this country's atomic weapons.

666
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,889
How?

667
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,683
You'll see.

668
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,269
All right.

669
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,108
Are you ready to watch him die?

670
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,617
Give me the gun.

671
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,538
That would be too easy.

672
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,891
Satisfied?

673
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,602
I'm satisfied.

674
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,272
Comrades...

675
01:04:21,565 --> 01:04:25,193
...our sister has rejoined us.

676
01:04:25,569 --> 01:04:28,655
Russia will rise from the ashes...

677
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,283
...of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

678
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:36,121
And the world will hear us!

679
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:37,956
Will hear.

680
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,794
Welcome back to our family, sister.

681
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:46,798
Sister.

682
01:04:55,224 --> 01:05:00,937
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

683
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:07,318
You're to meet an agent,
NATO uniform, at a plane here.

684
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:13,491
Tail number N1 82SL.

685
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,038
Final instructions will come from him.

686
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,333
-That's it.
-That's it.

687
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,545
After this, we go dark.

688
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,339
Radio silent.

689
01:05:29,341 --> 01:05:31,134
You won't hear from me again...

690
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,969
...my daughter.

691
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,910
Have you heard from Orlov?

692
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,038
Yes. Last word was "go."

693
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:06,544
Chenkov.

694
01:06:08,088 --> 01:06:09,714
Do you remember me?

695
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,179
Chenkov.

696
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,224
Did you miss me?

697
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,975
Shnaider?

698
01:06:25,522 --> 01:06:26,814
How long have you been here?

699
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:33,279
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

700
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:37,158
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

701
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:40,245
Colonel Edward Tomas.

702
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:43,748
And you are my attache.

703
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,583
Your ID.

704
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,586
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

705
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,673
More importantly, our mission.

706
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:56,469
The bunker eight stories
below the White House.

707
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,181
That's where the president
needs to be.

708
01:07:05,437 --> 01:07:06,604
How do we do it?

709
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:10,858
Don't worry, he'll be there.
That's my job. l'll make sure he's there.

710
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,154
-What's my job?
-Do you remember, Chenkov...

711
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:19,075
...when we were young and you
had to finish first in everything?

712
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,994
Had to be the best at everything.

713
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:25,206
Though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane, you had to finish first.

714
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,958
I remember.

715
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,628
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

716
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,635
Tonight you will kill
America's president.

717
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:52,317
IDs, please.

718
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,111
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

719
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:56,529
I'll check the side.

720
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,326
Control, this is Hayes.

721
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:04,370
I have a Colonel Tomas
and a Major Vicek.

722
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:05,872
Undercarriage is clean.

723
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,166
Back's clean.

724
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,795
Colonel. Major. All clear.

725
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,517
You know the drill, colonel.

726
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,064
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

727
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:34,233
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

728
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,864
Step through, please, sir.

729
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:44,952
Turn around.

730
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,041
Thank you.

731
01:08:54,546 --> 01:08:57,298
-Step through. Arms out.
-Patience is key.

732
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,551
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here longer.

733
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,054
-What others?
-l don't know.

734
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:06,391
But you were the best of us
and l was the least.

735
01:09:06,558 --> 01:09:10,019
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

736
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:11,896
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

737
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,272
-Major Vicek.
-Pleasure.

738
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,359
You'll have minutes to preview NATO's
point of view before the meeting.

739
01:09:17,861 --> 01:09:20,696
Now, Ted, your Russian
CI agent, Salt.

740
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:24,200
-What can you tell us about her?
-We think she may be a Soviet plant...

741
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:30,081
...inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

742
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:34,419
A day marking the start of a large
strike against the U.S. and her allies.

743
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,178
This should be the president now.

744
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,308
You have a big job, Chenkov...

745
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:50,768
...but you can do it.

746
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,271
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

747
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,314
Home.

748
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:57,233
I'm going home.

749
01:10:00,847 --> 01:10:03,098
-Down! Take cover!
-Get the president!

750
01:10:03,725 --> 01:10:05,726
-A gun! He's got a gun!
-Get back!

751
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:09,313
Get back!

752
01:10:23,036 --> 01:10:24,202
-Are you okay, sir?
-Yes.

753
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,872
-Goddamn it.
-Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

754
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,754
Help, over here!

755
01:10:36,049 --> 01:10:38,342
Get a medic! Get a medic!

756
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,450
I think I saw her.

757
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:49,493
You saw who?

758
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,747
Salt.

759
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:55,499
I think I saw her in the corridor.

760
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,545
The other NATO officer.

761
01:11:02,966 --> 01:11:04,175
She's here.

762
01:11:05,677 --> 01:11:06,844
Check.

763
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:08,387
-Clear.
-Move.

764
01:11:09,097 --> 01:11:10,139
Go!

765
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:12,892
We may have a visual
on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

766
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,229
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

767
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:20,691
This is not a drill.
The White House is under attack.

768
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:24,737
If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.

769
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:26,697
This is not a drill.

770
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,533
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

771
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,829
Command, this is Jenks. l need
the PEOC bunker up and running.

772
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:36,374
If this was authorized
by the Russian government...

773
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:39,085
...it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

774
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:44,507
If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.

775
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,592
This is not a drill.

776
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,427
-Clear!
-Let's go, sir.

777
01:11:51,139 --> 01:11:52,723
Alpha team!

778
01:11:56,436 --> 01:11:58,062
Move, move.

779
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,732
Close it.

780
01:12:09,032 --> 01:12:11,742
Please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.

781
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,995
This is not a drill.

782
01:12:45,068 --> 01:12:46,485
Go, go.

783
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,948
Geronimo approaching bunker door
in five seconds.

784
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,079
Clear.

785
01:13:05,088 --> 01:13:06,339
Any chance she could follow?

786
01:13:06,506 --> 01:13:08,591
My own men couldn't
get through that door.

787
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,427
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

788
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:16,807
Okay, go.

789
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,311
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

790
01:13:24,232 --> 01:13:26,192
Geronimo secured.

791
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:56,639
-Get me Director Medford.
-Yes, sir.

792
01:13:57,557 --> 01:14:00,518
Sir, l think we need to
seriously consider the possibility...

793
01:14:00,685 --> 01:14:03,562
...that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

794
01:14:04,272 --> 01:14:06,774
Mr. President,
Director Medford is up.

795
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,527
Marion, what's the situation?

796
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:12,696
It should be coming up
on one of your screens.

797
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,533
What you see there
represents temperature drops...

798
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,868
...in mobile missile units in Siberia.

799
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:21,872
It means the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.

800
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,626
And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.

801
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:30,297
Mr. President, l strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

802
01:14:30,465 --> 01:14:32,883
At least at our forward bases.

803
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,678
Do it.

804
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,222
And since the Russians
have deployed...

805
01:14:39,015 --> 01:14:42,143
...we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

806
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,396
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

807
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:49,442
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

808
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:11,255
Sir.

809
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:17,386
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

810
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,306
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

811
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,100
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

812
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:27,396
Command, our eyes are down. We have
a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

813
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,523
Get out there now.

814
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,567
Seal this room.

815
01:15:33,653 --> 01:15:35,237
Down that corridor. Secure it.

816
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:22,993
Victims are being taken to
George Washington Hospital.

817
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:27,206
Reports are coming in that there
are casualties at the White House.

818
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,459
This is President Howard Lewis.

819
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:34,463
-Proceed with authentication.
-Yes, Mr. President.

820
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,720
-Ready to commence authentication.
-Zulu.

821
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:42,972
-Tango.
-Echo.

822
01:16:43,139 --> 01:16:44,139
-Seven.
-Niner.

823
01:16:44,307 --> 01:16:45,516
-Juliett.
-X-ray.

824
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:46,684
-Sierra.
-Seven.

825
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:47,851
-Alfa.
-Mike.

826
01:16:48,019 --> 01:16:49,687
-Charlie.
-Whiskey.

827
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:50,896
-Five.
-Six.

828
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:54,149
-Tango.
-Authentication codes confirmed.

829
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:56,694
It's all yours now, Mr. President.

830
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,571
God be with you.

831
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:03,409
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

832
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:08,956
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

833
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:13,586
Is the camera outside
this door working? Put it up.

834
01:17:13,753 --> 01:17:15,796
Officer Dryer, what's your status?

835
01:17:17,465 --> 01:17:18,549
Officer Dryer, come in.

836
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:23,721
Federal Communication Commission is
activating the Emergency Alert System.

837
01:17:23,888 --> 01:17:25,472
Who the hell's that?

838
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:29,184
That's her. That's Evelyn Salt.

839
01:17:29,352 --> 01:17:31,061
She's in. Go to DEFCON 1 .

840
01:17:31,254 --> 01:17:32,671
Give me your side arm.

841
01:17:32,839 --> 01:17:36,383
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

842
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,260
Screw protocol.
We got an enemy agent.

843
01:17:38,427 --> 01:17:40,428
Protocol is protocol, sir.

844
01:17:40,763 --> 01:17:43,598
And dead is dead.

845
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,725
Behind me!

846
01:17:47,144 --> 01:17:48,895
I'm the national security advisor.

847
01:17:49,355 --> 01:17:50,397
Not anymore.

848
01:17:58,281 --> 01:17:59,322
Sit down.

849
01:18:02,702 --> 01:18:03,743
Who are you?

850
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,247
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

851
01:18:08,457 --> 01:18:10,959
And unless you do exactly as I say...

852
01:18:11,294 --> 01:18:13,712
...l will be the last person
you will ever see.

853
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:22,095
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

854
01:18:22,388 --> 01:18:23,597
Go to hell.

855
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,479
Selective attack options ready.

856
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,106
Ted?

857
01:18:57,273 --> 01:19:02,403
Emergency action message
released by....

858
01:19:02,862 --> 01:19:06,031
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

859
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,325
Why didn't you tell me?

860
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,122
I tried many times, but....

861
01:19:13,873 --> 01:19:16,667
My loneliness was my only friend.

862
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:19,545
You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.

863
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,672
I was a class ahead, comrade.

864
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,133
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

865
01:19:24,592 --> 01:19:27,219
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

866
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:29,138
Excuse me.

867
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:33,350
Selective attack targets acquired.

868
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:36,145
Tehran.

869
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:37,896
Mecca.

870
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:41,692
Mecca? Tehran?

871
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,527
Part two of our plan.

872
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:45,654
Kill nine million people.

873
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,823
Enrage a billion Muslims.

874
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,826
America will suffer a painful death.

875
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:53,996
Permissive action links initiated.

876
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:59,042
Missiles arming.

877
01:20:05,341 --> 01:20:07,676
Nuclear command...

878
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,679
...posts airborne.

879
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,181
Let me join you.

880
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,518
lCBMs set to...

881
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,146
...maximum yield.

882
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:23,442
You know, when you first came
to Langley...

883
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,653
...l didn't think I'd be able
to do it.

884
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,740
I didn't think l'd be able to...

885
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:33,452
...resist the temptation
to say something.

886
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:36,455
Then you met Mike and...

887
01:20:36,956 --> 01:20:38,415
...well...

888
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:40,876
...things changed.

889
01:20:43,963 --> 01:20:45,255
Let me join you.

890
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:50,719
All these years right in front of me
and l never knew.

891
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:59,061
Let me join you.

892
01:20:59,979 --> 01:21:01,939
I want to be with you.

893
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:18,080
The man we thought was dead has
made a resurrection that is miraculous.

894
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,957
President Matveyev is alive.

895
01:21:20,124 --> 01:21:22,251
We're going to Russia.
What you are seeing...

896
01:21:22,418 --> 01:21:24,878
...are live pictures of
Russian president Matveyev...

897
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:28,924
...arriving at the airport outside
of Moscow. This is astonishing.

898
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:32,302
According to his doctors,
President Matveyev's mistaken death...

899
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,847
...is attributed to
a temporary paralysis...

900
01:21:35,014 --> 01:21:37,558
...from a toxin
derived from spider venom.

901
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:41,937
A recap for those who may not have
been following the events of the day....

902
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:47,150
At least l was right.

903
01:21:50,029 --> 01:21:53,532
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

904
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:57,578
I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

905
01:21:57,745 --> 01:21:59,913
You were supposed to
recruit him, Ev...

906
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:01,707
...not fall in love with him.

907
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:05,085
That's why I told Orlov
to pick him up.

908
01:22:08,339 --> 01:22:10,549
By the way, how is Mike?

909
01:22:48,087 --> 01:23:10,108
Identity confirmation requested.

910
01:23:15,114 --> 01:23:16,740
Identity confirmed.

911
01:23:31,714 --> 01:23:35,801
Minuteman IlI lCBMs' batteries
up to power.

912
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:17,467
Authorization, 99 percent.

913
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,642
Go!

914
01:24:25,835 --> 01:24:28,587
Permissive action links initiated.

915
01:24:28,796 --> 01:24:32,424
Trident submarines
at firing readiness.

916
01:24:33,176 --> 01:24:36,928
Permission to launch.

917
01:25:06,626 --> 01:25:08,001
Get down on the floor, now!

918
01:25:08,753 --> 01:25:10,128
I said now!

919
01:25:15,134 --> 01:25:18,094
Launch sequence aborted.
Systems restored.

920
01:25:18,262 --> 01:25:20,180
-Move, move, move!
-Show me your hands!

921
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:22,098
-Get down!
-What is your name, sir?

922
01:25:22,266 --> 01:25:25,602
I'm Theodore Winter, ClA.
Help the president.

923
01:25:27,104 --> 01:25:28,980
Mr. President.

924
01:25:30,441 --> 01:25:32,734
Mr. President, can you hear me?

925
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:35,987
-Hold still.
-EMT's on the way.

926
01:25:36,155 --> 01:25:38,281
Make sure they got body bags.
At least seven.

927
01:25:38,449 --> 01:25:39,991
She's wearing a vest.

928
01:25:40,576 --> 01:25:43,161
I'll meet you in five minutes.
I wanna get cleaned up.

929
01:25:43,329 --> 01:25:44,913
And l want her alone in a room.

930
01:25:45,081 --> 01:25:47,582
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

931
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:51,378
She won't talk. She's trained not to,
no matter what we do to her.

932
01:25:51,545 --> 01:25:54,047
If we're gonna find these people,
we gotta do it.

933
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:03,598
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
I'll be right back.

934
01:26:07,937 --> 01:26:10,814
No one comes through until
the president is secure. Step back.

935
01:26:10,982 --> 01:26:13,275
-l'm Theodore Winter--
-Step back, sir. Please.

936
01:26:16,946 --> 01:26:19,364
Well, sir, you're injured.
Why don't you have a seat?

937
01:26:19,532 --> 01:26:21,283
We'll take a look at you.

938
01:26:21,993 --> 01:26:23,702
Are you okay?

939
01:26:24,537 --> 01:26:26,913
Pretty good gash there.

940
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:29,666
Looks like you got a piece of glass
in there.

941
01:26:53,232 --> 01:26:54,357
She killed someone else.

942
01:26:54,525 --> 01:26:57,652
lt's Winter. lt's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.

943
01:27:06,996 --> 01:27:08,913
Check him. Check him!

944
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:10,749
Checking vitals.

945
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:13,710
I'm not getting a pulse.
I'm not getting much.

946
01:27:19,175 --> 01:27:22,552
The more we find out about Evelyn Salt,
the less we seem to know.

947
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,012
She has proven a mystery.

948
01:27:25,097 --> 01:27:28,683
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

949
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:33,521
...of the United States of America...

950
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:40,695
...and to the republic
for which it stands...

951
01:27:40,863 --> 01:27:44,532
...one nation, under God...

952
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:49,037
...indivisible, with liberty...

953
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:52,832
...and justice for all.

954
01:27:56,003 --> 01:27:57,879
The lily fold.

955
01:27:58,381 --> 01:28:02,884
In my new life,
I'm trying to be less utilitarian.

956
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:12,936
Someone stopped the missile launch.

957
01:28:13,437 --> 01:28:16,481
President was unconscious,
so it was either you or Winter.

958
01:28:16,649 --> 01:28:20,402
President says Winter started it, so...

959
01:28:20,569 --> 01:28:23,029
...you saved the world?

960
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:27,659
Listen, Salt.

961
01:28:29,745 --> 01:28:31,830
Winter we can figure out.

962
01:28:31,997 --> 01:28:34,791
He led a life. He left a trail.

963
01:28:34,959 --> 01:28:39,254
We'll trace it back.
I will dissect him if l have to.

964
01:28:42,174 --> 01:28:44,926
But Orlov is still out there.

965
01:28:45,845 --> 01:28:48,721
Mike used to say the sweetest thing.

966
01:28:48,889 --> 01:28:53,059
He used to say that his heart...

967
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:55,270
...was a spider web...

968
01:28:55,438 --> 01:28:58,982
...and l was the spider
who lived on top.

969
01:29:00,985 --> 01:29:05,280
And no matter where I was,
I could attach a single thread...

970
01:29:07,283 --> 01:29:10,201
...so l would always be connected.

971
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:14,747
So l could always find my way home.

972
01:29:18,836 --> 01:29:20,962
He told me
whenever l saw a spider web...

973
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:23,840
...l should remember
how much he loved me.

974
01:29:44,028 --> 01:29:46,112
I did nothing.

975
01:29:46,989 --> 01:29:52,076
They killed my husband and l watched
and l did nothing.

976
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,291
For the greater good.

977
01:30:01,337 --> 01:30:05,632
I'm sorry about Mike, but Orlov....

978
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:10,011
-Give me something.
-Why?

979
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:13,097
So you can arrest him?

980
01:30:13,265 --> 01:30:17,393
So your taxpayers can put him
in a pretty little box?

981
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:23,441
His real name is not Orlov.

982
01:30:25,277 --> 01:30:27,028
What is it?

983
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:40,124
They gave us
these teeth in the back....

984
01:30:41,835 --> 01:30:46,923
It's why l killed Winter.
So he couldn't do it himself.

985
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:50,134
Shit!

986
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:54,556
Goddamn cyanide.

987
01:30:55,558 --> 01:30:57,892
Yeah, it's Peabody.
Put me through straight away.

988
01:30:59,395 --> 01:31:02,063
Salt just tried to kill herself. Yeah.

989
01:31:02,231 --> 01:31:03,356
Could be cyanide.

990
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:04,941
Keep her alive, folks.

991
01:31:05,109 --> 01:31:07,318
No, they're trying
to figure that out right now.

992
01:31:11,073 --> 01:31:12,657
Are her airways clear?

993
01:31:13,742 --> 01:31:15,076
Shit.

994
01:31:22,293 --> 01:31:23,876
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

995
01:31:26,755 --> 01:31:28,381
Freeze!

996
01:31:37,808 --> 01:31:39,309
Our father has decided that...

997
01:31:39,476 --> 01:31:41,644
...the time has come...

998
01:31:41,812 --> 01:31:45,315
...for you all to start your new lives.

999
01:31:48,611 --> 01:31:53,281
To prepare for our next attack.

1000
01:32:17,556 --> 01:32:19,641
Can l help you?

1001
01:32:28,651 --> 01:32:30,735
My daughter.

1002
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:35,114
Have you come to kiss the ring?

1003
01:32:39,244 --> 01:32:42,372
I've come to tell you that l'm free.
