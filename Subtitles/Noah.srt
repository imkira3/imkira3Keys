1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,043
<i>From Adam to Seth,
from Seth to Enosh,</i>

3
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,644
Enosh to Kenan, Kenan to Mahalalel

4
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,926
to my father,
Methuselah, then to me.

5
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,251
Today, that birthright
passes to you,

6
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,566
Noah.

7
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,684
My son.

8
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,759
The Creator made Adam in His image,

9
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,531
and then placed the
world in his care.

10
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,883
This is your work now.
Your responsibility.

11
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,371
May you walk alongside The
Creator in righteousness.

12
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,330
So I say to you...

13
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,160
The Shrine of Seth!

14
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,125
Men.

15
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,731
Hide.

16
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,723
We mine here.

17
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,651
The ground is rich with tzohar.

18
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,359
This is The Creator's land.
What are you doing?

19
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
The Creator?

20
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,119
My mines run dry.

21
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,959
My city withers and must be fed.

22
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,083
And what has He done?

23
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,159
He cursed us to struggle

24
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,522
by the sweat of our
brow to survive!

25
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,159
Damned if I don't do
everything it takes

26
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,759
to do just that.

27
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,523
Damned if I don't take what I want.

28
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,163
This relic belongs to the
descendants of Cain now.

29
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,129
The line of Seth ends here.

30
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,684
It is ours. Now dig!

31
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,607
Ham.

32
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,211
What are you doing?

33
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,210
It's pretty.

34
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,406
You see those other flowers?

35
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,765
How they're attached to the ground?

36
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,964
That's where they should be.

37
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,809
They have a purpose.

38
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,281
They sprout.

39
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,239
And they bloom.

40
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,966
The wind takes their seeds
and more flowers grow.

41
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,121
We only collect what we can
use, and what we need.

42
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,086
Do you understand?

43
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,081
Shem.

44
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,961
Ham.

45
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,566
Let's go.

46
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,007
Men. Hide, hide.

47
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,401
Go.

48
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,521
You found our kill.

49
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,199
How fortunate.

50
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,839
But for you... maybe not.

51
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,326
You know how long it
is since we ate meat?

52
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,802
Since we even saw an animal?

53
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,161
Easy.

54
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,083
Please. What do you want?

55
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,566
Justice.

56
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,399
Why did they kill it?

57
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,726
They eat them.

58
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,251
Why?

59
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,410
They think it makes them stronger.

60
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,691
Is it true?

61
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,919
They forget

62
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,122
strength comes from The Creator.

63
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,965
Mama!

64
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,481
Mommy!

65
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,520
See your brothers?

66
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,091
Ham saw men hunting today.

67
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,644
They are getting closer.

68
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,761
How was he?

69
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,599
A little too interested.

70
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,040
Hmm.

71
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,645
He had to see it sometime.

72
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,964
I saw something else.

73
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,124
A flower

74
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,485
bloom from nothing.

75
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,885
Rest.

76
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,325
Perhaps He will finally
make things right.

77
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,691
Methuselah.

78
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,129
Did He speak to you?

79
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,530
I think so.

80
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,171
Will He help us?

81
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,528
He's going to destroy the world.

82
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,841
It's a long and dangerous
journey for the boys.

83
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,521
How do you know your
grandfather's still alive?

84
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,725
I don't. I saw his mountain.

85
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,119
We need to go and find out if
he knows what we're to do.

86
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,641
Shem. Can you help me with this?

87
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,486
We could take the boys and
find a place to hide.

88
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,650
There'll be no hiding.

89
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,244
We should have left already.

90
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,889
Ham, let me show you
how to do that.

91
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,279
Push it in here.

92
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,639
Next time we come through,

93
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,888
we'll know we've got certain
things we might need.

94
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,524
There are cities ahead.

95
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,842
We will not get too close.

96
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,079
Is that a tzohar mine?

97
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,282
It was once. Before
they dug it all up.

98
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,410
Should we go around?

99
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,881
No.

100
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
Do you think they're all dead?

101
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,321
It looks that way.

102
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,200
They must have been
scavenging here.

103
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,325
And someone scavenged from them.

104
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,800
Dada!

105
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,650
Stay close.

106
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,161
Father!

107
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,681
Here!

108
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,485
May I see?

109
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,527
Let me see.

110
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,650
Tell me your name.

111
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,239
You have a name?

112
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,521
Ila.

113
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,519
My name is Ila.

114
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,801
Ila.

115
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,479
You're going to be all right, Ila.

116
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,686
This is Shem.

117
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,959
He's going to hold your hand tight

118
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,525
and he won't let go.

119
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,002
Up the hill! Hurry! Hurry!

120
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,088
We have to go. Now.

121
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,686
Up the hill. Run.

122
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,359
We can't go there.

123
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,371
We have no choice. Hurry!

124
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,121
- Hold, men! Hold!
- The giants!

125
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,926
They'll kill you!

126
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,041
Shem!

127
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,928
Protect your mother,
first and last.

128
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,287
I love you.

129
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,961
Run!

130
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,249
Noah!

131
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,165
Noah!

132
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,279
Noah. Noah. Are you all right?

133
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,683
We are to see Methuselah.
My grandfather.

134
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,281
A child of the old one?

135
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,282
You should have killed them.

136
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,811
- But, Samyaza...
- This is a man, Og.

137
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,845
Do you forget how they
betrayed The Creator?

138
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,045
It is He who sends us!

139
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,563
It lies!

140
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,006
Leave them here to rot.

141
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,721
What are they?

142
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,364
The Watchers.

143
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,565
Dada?

144
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,601
Sleep now.

145
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,444
Sing to me.

146
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,048
I want my daddy to sing to me.

147
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,239
You know, I, too, lost my father

148
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,010
when I was very young.

149
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,085
There's a song he used to sing me
sometimes when I couldn't sleep.

150
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,250
Would you like to hear it?

151
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,521
<i>The moon is high</i>

152
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,039
<i>The trees entwine</i>

153
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,767
<i>Your Father waits for thee</i>

154
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,890
<i>To wrap you in His sheltering wings</i>

155
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,968
<i>And whisper you to sleep</i>

156
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,324
<i>Your Father is</i>

157
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,609
<i>The healing wind</i>

158
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,926
<i>That whispers you to sleep</i>

159
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,567
<i>That whispers as you sleep</i>

160
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,645
It's an ugly wound.

161
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,125
She'll never have children.

162
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,010
If the fever doesn't take her,

163
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,846
I think she'll live.

164
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,130
Follow me.

165
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,367
I'm sorry I frightened you.

166
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,161
Watchers have learned to fear men.

167
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,529
Then why are you helping us?

168
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,841
The Creator formed us
on the second day.

169
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,043
The day He made the heavens.

170
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,479
We watched over Adam and Eve.

171
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,126
Saw their frailty and their love.

172
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,882
And then we saw their fall.
And we pitied them.

173
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,885
<i>We were not stone then, but light.</i>

174
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,731
<i>It was not our place to interfere.</i>

175
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,004
<i>Yet we chose to try
and help mankind.</i>

176
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,925
<i>And when we disobeyed The Creator,</i>

177
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,929
<i>He punished us.</i>

178
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,164
<i>We were encrusted by your world.</i>

179
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,089
<i>Rock and mud shackled
our fiery glow.</i>

180
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,163
<i>Still, we taught mankind
all we knew of Creation.</i>

181
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,050
<i>With our help</i>

182
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,559
they rose from the dust,
became great and mighty.

183
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,731
But then they turned
our gifts to violence.

184
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,159
<i>Only one man protected us.</i>

185
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,319
<i>Your grandfather Methuselah.</i>

186
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,399
<i>We were hunted. Most of us killed.</i>

187
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,966
<i>Those who lived were left
prisoners in these stony shells,</i>

188
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,051
<i>marooned upon this barren land.</i>

189
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,960
<i>We begged The Creator
to take us home.</i>

190
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,801
<i>But He was always silent.</i>

191
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,399
And now

192
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,285
you claim that you
have heard His call.

193
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,882
Samyaza cannot accept this.

194
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,439
A man?

195
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,484
When it is men who broke the world.

196
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,928
But I look at you

197
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,965
and I see a glimmer of Adam again.

198
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,130
The man I knew.

199
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,687
The man I came to help.

200
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,329
Why can't I come?

201
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,684
Because I need you to
look after Mother.

202
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,885
Do you understand?

203
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,560
And you look after your father.

204
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,050
Watch over them.

205
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,204
They are in good hands.

206
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
Grandfather?

207
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,081
Noah.

208
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,889
This is your great-grandfather.

209
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,241
Show him respect.

210
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,771
Tell him your name.

211
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,599
I am Shem.

212
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,926
My eldest.

213
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,606
Come closer.

214
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,606
Let me see you.

215
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,846
You're a lucky boy.

216
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,559
I think you must have
your mother's looks,

217
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,125
not your father's.

218
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,409
Come tell me about yourself.

219
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,246
So,

220
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,971
what do you like most in the world?

221
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,001
Berries.

222
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,319
- What?
- Berries.

223
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,959
Ah, berries, yes.

224
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,164
What can compete with fresh,
ripe berries? Nothing.

225
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,639
Yes, it's been so long I can barely

226
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,649
remember the taste of them.

227
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,771
Ah, tell me, did you bring me any?

228
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,119
No? Oh.

229
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,159
I'm craving them now.

230
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,362
Ah, well, perhaps one day.

231
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,639
You must be tired. It's
a long way up here.

232
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,001
Yeah.

233
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,487
Why not rest?

234
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,891
How perfect.

235
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,886
What we need to discuss
is not for boys.

236
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,961
You know why I've come?

237
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,806
Yes.

238
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,525
Before he walked on,

239
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,486
my father Enoch told
me that one day,

240
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,168
if man continued in his ways,

241
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,167
The Creator would
annihilate this world.

242
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,004
So what I saw is true?

243
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,526
All life blotted out because
of what man has done?

244
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,479
Can it not be averted?

245
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,959
Noah, you must trust
that He speaks in a way

246
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,321
that you can understand.

247
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,086
So you tell me.

248
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,363
Can this destruction be averted?

249
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,927
No.

250
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,366
Oh.

251
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
He sent me here.

252
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,799
Why send me if there's
nothing I can do to stop it?

253
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,766
Well, perhaps He simply sends
you here to share a cup of tea

254
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,405
with an old man.

255
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,399
So, is that all you saw?

256
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,285
The fires of destruction
on this place?

257
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,407
No, not fire.

258
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,606
Water.

259
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,079
Water? Huh.

260
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,199
My father said it would be fire.

261
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,085
I saw water. Death by water.

262
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,725
I saw death.

263
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,043
And I saw new life.

264
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,763
There's something
more, Grandfather.

265
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,609
Something I'm to do.

266
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,280
I know it.

267
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,329
I just didn't see what it was.

268
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,445
New life.

269
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,406
Well, perhaps there is
more for you to see.

270
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,039
Did He not send you here

271
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,402
to drink a cup of tea
with an old man?

272
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,282
The medicine always tastes bad.

273
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,639
- She was the only one moving.
- Was she hurt badly?

274
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,639
She had a big cut on her belly.

275
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,207
Mother helped and I held her hand.

276
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,047
That must have made her feel safe.

277
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,727
Well?

278
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,525
Fire consumes all.

279
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,044
Water cleanses.

280
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,482
It separates the
foul from the pure.

281
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,569
The wicked from the innocent.

282
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,482
And that which sinks
from that which rises.

283
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,571
He destroys all,

284
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,203
but only to start again.

285
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,047
You sure?

286
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,361
Yes.

287
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,002
The storm cannot be stopped.

288
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,999
But it can be survived.

289
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
Yeah.

290
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,129
You may need this.

291
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,686
It's a seed.

292
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,929
From the first Garden.

293
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,405
From Eden.

294
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,970
Remember, Noah,

295
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,767
He chose you for a reason.

296
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,406
Oh...

297
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,519
You can't get me!

298
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,927
Oh, you can't get me!

299
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,406
Dada!

300
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,446
My grandfather lives.

301
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,242
He's helped me see
what we're here to do.

302
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,359
Men are going to be punished

303
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,960
for what they've
done to this world.

304
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,610
There will be destruction.

305
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,130
There will be tragedy.

306
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,246
And our family has been
chosen for a great task.

307
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,089
We've been chosen to
save the innocent.

308
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,126
The innocent?

309
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,766
The animals.

310
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,126
Why are they innocent?

311
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,481
Because they still live as
they did in the Garden.

312
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,847
Yes.

313
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,644
And we need to save enough
of them to start again.

314
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,126
But what of us?

315
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,282
I guess we get to start again, too.

316
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,524
We get to start again in
a new and better world.

317
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,051
But first

318
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,367
we have to build.

319
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,326
Build what?

320
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,643
A great flood is coming.

321
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,799
The waters of the heavens

322
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,411
will meet the waters of the earth.

323
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,801
We build a vessel to
survive the storm.

324
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,525
We build an ark.

325
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,569
Take the traitor back.

326
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,207
He is a child of the old one!

327
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,886
Stop!

328
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,611
There is work to do. Help us.

329
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,566
Help you?

330
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,451
We tried to help your kind once.

331
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,570
And we lost everything
because of you!

332
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,124
Not everything.

333
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,046
We can save what is left.
We can serve Him again.

334
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,768
You treacherous snake!

335
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,409
The Creator.

336
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,485
Children!

337
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,001
What is this?

338
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,006
This...

339
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,724
This is our ark.

340
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,530
We will help this man.

341
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,525
No!

342
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,766
Shem.

343
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,966
Wait.

344
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,846
Please.

345
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,805
It still hurts?

346
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,204
- Ham!
- Shem!

347
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,484
He doesn't have anyone.

348
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,046
Come.

349
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,769
Father, did you see them?

350
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,726
Father?

351
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,571
Yes, Japheth.

352
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,771
It begins.

353
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,320
Ready?

354
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,164
It sleeps.

355
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,000
Gently.

356
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,086
See, that's a boy one
and that's a girl one.

357
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,359
After the storm,

358
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,050
they'll become a
mother and a father.

359
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,046
And the hatchlings will spread
right across the world.

360
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,726
We have to be gentle with them
and we have to be protective.

361
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,479
If something were to happen,

362
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,206
that would be a small piece
of Creation lost forever.

363
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,519
All of these innocent creatures

364
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,881
are now in our care.

365
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,247
It's our job to look after them.

366
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,405
Father?

367
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,805
All the birds are two.

368
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,601
You have Mother, Shem has Ila.

369
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,090
But what of me?

370
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,086
What of Japheth?

371
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,285
Who is there for us?

372
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,519
Did you see how He made the forest

373
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,290
to give us wood for the ark?

374
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,649
How He sent the birds?

375
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,761
So,

376
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,449
hasn't He sent everything we need?

377
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,326
Mother!

378
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,279
What is it? What?

379
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,811
Snakes!

380
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,649
- Snakes are coming, too?
- Yeah.

381
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,169
All that creeps, all that crawls,

382
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,646
all that slithers.

383
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,365
It's all right.

384
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,522
Father! Father!

385
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,529
Don't be afraid.

386
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,402
No one will hurt this boy.

387
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,561
What's your name?

388
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,366
- Ham.
- Ham?

389
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,086
Oh.

390
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,724
I am Tubal-cain.

391
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,764
Do you know me?

392
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,050
You don't know your king?

393
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,919
My father says there can be no king

394
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,770
in The Creator's garden.

395
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,359
Hmm.

396
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,688
Ham, come here.

397
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,328
Do not take my best soldier.

398
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,439
He's nothing of yours.

399
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,639
Look at his hand on that weapon.

400
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,330
I believe he is something of mine.

401
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,367
Ham.

402
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,126
Leave it.

403
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,119
No, he gave it to me.

404
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,481
Do what I tell you.

405
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,849
When I heard talk of
miracles, I dismissed them.

406
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,486
But then I saw the birds with my own
eyes, flying here, and I had to come.

407
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,479
There isn't anything for you here.

408
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,727
No?

409
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,362
This all belongs to me.

410
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,041
This land. This forest.

411
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,042
That stronghold of yours.

412
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,011
Did you really think you could
protect yourself from me in that?

413
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,084
It's not protection from you.

414
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,045
Then what is it?

415
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,846
An ark

416
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,044
to hold the innocent
when The Creator sends

417
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,359
his deluge to wipe out the
wicked from this world.

418
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,679
The Creator does not care
what happens in this world.

419
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,281
Nobody has heard from Him
since He marked Cain.

420
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,051
We are alone. Orphaned children,

421
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,884
cursed to struggle by the
sweat of our brow to survive.

422
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,967
Damned if I don't do everything
it takes to do just that.

423
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,562
Damned if I don't take what I want.

424
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,970
We have met?

425
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,480
I am the son of Lamech!

426
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,048
Eight generations
descended from Seth!

427
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,130
Return to your cities of Cain!

428
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,928
Know we have all been judged!

429
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,759
I have men at my back,

430
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,042
and you stand alone and defy me?

431
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,441
I'm not alone.

432
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,239
Take the children!

433
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,010
Do not fear, my people!

434
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,639
Don't be afraid! Stand!

435
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,285
Hold your line, men.

436
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,805
His minions, uh, they're with you?

437
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,759
Hmm.

438
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,009
Miracles? A deluge, you claim?

439
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,209
Well, perhaps you're right.

440
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,799
Perhaps casting us out of
Paradise was not enough.

441
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,161
Perhaps,

442
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,201
He returns to finish us off.

443
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,005
Well, if He does,

444
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,484
I will ride the storm
in that ship of yours.

445
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,282
There is no escape for
you and your kind.

446
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,964
Your time is done.

447
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,319
- The land is dying.
- Ham.

448
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,800
The cities are dead.

449
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:22,684
Don't listen to him.

450
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,850
My people follow me!

451
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,847
And more will follow them!

452
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,046
I'm not afraid of
miracles, son of Lamech!

453
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,369
If you refuse my dozens now,

454
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,531
I shall return with legions!

455
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,881
Move.

456
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,771
Father?

457
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,250
Will so many really come?

458
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,725
We need to finish
as fast as we can.

459
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,403
The sooner He sends
the rain, the better.

460
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,725
Until then, we're safer inside.

461
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,245
We build.

462
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,081
First weapons, then men.

463
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,807
Feed only those that will fight.

464
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,246
Arm them,

465
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,879
train them,

466
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,606
and there is nothing they can't do.

467
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,091
With an army,

468
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,885
we can crush those giants.

469
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,839
Please, we're hungry!

470
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,639
- Give us meat.
- Our children are starving.

471
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,839
Please help us!

472
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,885
Let us go!

473
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,169
We're starving!

474
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,400
Should I come back?

475
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,561
No.

476
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,082
Do you think those men
are going to attack us?

477
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,721
When the rain comes.

478
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,245
What do you think it'll be like?

479
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,445
I've imagined it.

480
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,604
Seeing that much death,

481
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,291
I'm not sure there are words.

482
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,206
The end of everything.

483
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,966
The beginning.

484
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,250
The beginning of everything.

485
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,360
So what is it?

486
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,442
Whatever he's done or said,
Shem is very fond of you.

487
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,283
Shem needs a woman.

488
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,045
A real woman.

489
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,490
He should have a family.

490
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,485
I can't give any of that to him.

491
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,006
And I'm not going to
deny him those things,

492
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,079
even if he wants me to.

493
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,805
I won't do it.

494
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,321
Besides,

495
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,650
why would The Creator want
a barren girl on His ark?

496
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,489
Ila. Ila.

497
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,163
When we first took you in,

498
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,642
I thought you were
going to be a burden.

499
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,439
And I didn't want to see

500
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,847
anybody else ruined by this world.

501
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,924
But I was wrong.

502
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,166
You're a gift.

503
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,171
A precious, precious gift.

504
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,651
Just don't forget how
precious a gift you are.

505
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,161
I know you'll be going to find
wives for Ham and Japheth.

506
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,319
You should find one for Shem, too.

507
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,885
Ila.

508
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,959
Where do you think you're going?

509
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,681
Please, please don't take my baby!

510
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,922
Let them go! Please!

511
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,039
Sorry, we have to eat!

512
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,399
Don't take my baby! No!

513
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,286
Don't take my baby! No, no,
please will you stop him?

514
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,284
Let them go!

515
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,127
No!

516
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,283
Quit struggling! It'll be easier.

517
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,128
Come with me! Stop struggling!

518
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,208
You! You!

519
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,326
I have two girls! I have
two girls to trade!

520
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,279
Take the girls! Give me the meat!

521
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,130
Give it to me!

522
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,921
What happened?

523
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,039
All of this should
be inside by now.

524
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,199
The storm is coming.

525
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,559
What about our wives?
Where are they?

526
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,879
Did you not hear what I just said?

527
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,206
But when are they coming?

528
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,246
There will be no wives.

529
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,559
What? What? No!

530
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,961
You said that The Creator would
give us what we'll need.

531
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,005
- Help your brother.
- No.

532
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,719
Listen, you can't do this!

533
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,684
You can't. How am I
supposed to be a man?

534
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,930
I said help your brother.

535
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,602
- You want me to stay a child!
- No!

536
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,686
I'm asking you to be a man and
do what needs to be done.

537
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,646
Ham!

538
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,121
Ham!

539
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,765
What are you doing, Noah?

540
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,329
The wickedness is not just in them.

541
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,605
It's in all of us.

542
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,486
I saw it.

543
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,719
No.

544
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,001
Noah.

545
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,004
There's goodness in us.

546
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,639
Look at our boys.

547
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,446
Shem's loyalty. Japheth's kindness.

548
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,527
Ham's integrity. Hmm?

549
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,526
Good men.

550
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,362
They'd be good fathers.

551
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,523
Shem is blinded by desire.

552
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,489
Ham is covetous.

553
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,807
And Japheth lives only to please.

554
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,201
I am no better.

555
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,766
And you?

556
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,167
Is there anything you would not do,
good or bad, for those three boys?

557
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,159
We would both choose to kill in
order to protect our children.

558
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,486
Yes.

559
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,051
We're no different.

560
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,650
We were weak and we were selfish to
think we could set ourselves apart.

561
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,885
We will work,

562
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,209
complete the task,

563
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,891
and then we'll die.

564
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,962
The same as everyone else.

565
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,885
They are children!

566
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,407
They are our children, Noah!

567
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,563
Have you no mercy?

568
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,082
The time for mercy has passed.

569
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,249
Now our punishment begins.

570
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,921
Ham!

571
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,967
Ham!

572
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,245
Grandfather?

573
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,325
Grandfather?

574
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,807
Did you bring me something?

575
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,642
Did Noah plant the seed I gave him?

576
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,801
Yes.

577
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,127
Mmm.

578
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,246
And in all that forest
there were no berries?

579
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,802
Shem promised me berries.

580
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,931
Oh.

581
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,241
I'm sorry.

582
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,439
I didn't know.

583
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,801
Huh.

584
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,400
It's a pity.

585
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,922
Then why did you come here?

586
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,166
It's Noah.

587
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,602
He leaves our boys with no one.

588
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,842
Shem has Ila, but she's barren.

589
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,200
There'll be no other
wives, so no children.

590
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,681
Justice.

591
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,681
The Creator destroys this world
because we corrupted it.

592
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,159
So we ourselves must be destroyed.

593
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,441
No.

594
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,201
I can't believe that's true.

595
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,524
Not when I look at my sons.

596
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,488
All they desire is love.

597
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,639
Isn't that all their
hearts need to be good?

598
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,159
Who is good? Who is wicked?

599
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,647
How am I supposed to
know what is right?

600
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,648
That choice is Noah's.
Not mine. Not yours.

601
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,882
It sounds like he has made it.

602
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,724
So then you will not help me?

603
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,529
I don't know if I even could.

604
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,411
But if I tried, it could cause
pain and possibly tragedy.

605
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,527
And in the end, it would just
come back to Noah again.

606
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,560
Is that what you wish?

607
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,039
I want my sons to have children.

608
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,526
I want them to be happy.

609
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,684
I can't bear to think
of them dying alone.

610
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,570
Out of the way! Coming through!

611
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,285
Whoa!

612
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,131
Please!

613
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,601
Get away!

614
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,359
No. No, no...

615
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,399
It's all right.
It's all right. I'm not...

616
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,806
I'm not going to hurt you.

617
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,088
I have food.

618
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,285
Here.

619
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,606
What do you want?

620
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,405
Nothing.

621
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,085
Are you alone?

622
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,761
Yes.

623
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,686
And you?

624
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,883
I can help you get away.

625
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,041
No.

626
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,442
Well, then, I'll
stay a little while.

627
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,724
If that is all right?

628
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,406
My name

629
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,811
is Na'el.

630
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,241
Shem!

631
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,524
Go and find them and
bring them back.

632
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,407
Be careful.

633
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,605
Ham?

634
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,241
Don't be afraid, granddaughter.

635
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,570
Don't be afraid.

636
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,159
Grandfather?

637
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,441
Yes.

638
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,919
What are you doing down here?

639
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,122
I'm looking for berries.
I have a craving.

640
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,239
Come and help me look for them.

641
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,283
My eyes aren't as good
as they used to be.

642
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,559
I have to find Ham.

643
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,920
There's time enough for that.

644
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,566
Come here.

645
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,605
Come.

646
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,884
Come here and help me.

647
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,803
They're here somewhere.

648
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,122
They're here somewhere, berries.

649
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,839
I know there are berries.

650
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,929
There's nothing here, Grandfather.

651
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,599
- Let me take you to Noah.
- No.

652
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,485
No need for that. You go now.

653
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,291
You go.

654
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,724
Oh, wait. Wait.

655
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,519
Ten years you've been with my own.

656
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,801
With my own family.

657
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,764
Ten years. And you love them?

658
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,002
Shem? And Noah?

659
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,285
He saved my life.

660
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,170
Raised me.

661
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,005
Yes, he did.

662
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,480
Yes.

663
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,802
And you are now as
his own daughter.

664
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,640
My own great-granddaughter.

665
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,525
Ten years in the shadow of my home,

666
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,685
and yet I have never
given you my blessing.

667
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,681
May I?

668
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,041
Ham! Ila!

669
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,040
You can go now. Go to him.

670
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,883
You go. Go now.

671
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,686
Ila!

672
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,366
Ila!

673
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,686
Ila!

674
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,490
We have to get back...

675
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,811
We have to go.

676
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,011
We have to go. Come on. Now!

677
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,799
I am a man.

678
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,843
Made in Your image.

679
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,799
Why will You not converse with me?

680
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,524
I give life.

681
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,681
I take life away. As You do!

682
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,044
And I am like You, am I not?

683
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,999
Speak to me.

684
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,970
Speak to me!

685
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,049
It has begun!

686
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,041
Death comes from the heavens!

687
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,800
This rain

688
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,210
is meant to wash us off
the face of this world.

689
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,529
But we are men.

690
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,768
We decide if we live or die.

691
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,879
We are men!

692
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,004
And men united are invincible!

693
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,770
Do you want to live?

694
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,440
Yeah!

695
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,244
We kill the giants!

696
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,931
We kill Noah!

697
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,090
We take the ark!

698
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,601
Yeah!

699
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,921
Noah!

700
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,406
Where's Ham?

701
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,120
Get it off me, no! Ow!

702
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,924
No, no, no!

703
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,639
We have to get away!

704
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,649
I won't leave you. I won't!

705
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,841
Ham!

706
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,002
Father, help! Help!

707
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,163
- Help her!
- Help me, please!

708
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,760
Please, help me, please!

709
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,241
Please... Someone please help me!

710
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,331
Help me!

711
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,284
No!

712
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,522
Ham! Ham!

713
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,365
Ham!

714
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,521
Ham!

715
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,050
Ham!

716
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,005
Ham!

717
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,166
Ham!

718
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,999
Samyaza!

719
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,248
Samyaza! Samyaza!

720
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,249
- Noah!
- Where is Ham?

721
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,403
Ham is through! Quickly!

722
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,366
Run!

723
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,606
Ham.

724
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,601
Ham!

725
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,611
Faster!

726
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,091
Forward!

727
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,522
Protect your mother.
Protect them all.

728
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,125
Part!

729
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,165
My Creator,

730
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,050
forgive me.

731
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,639
The Creator brings him home.

732
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,041
Ham?

733
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,326
Ham?

734
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,209
Shem. Shem, go inside.

735
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,326
Go inside.

736
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,480
They are upon us. Go inside!

737
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,682
Good-bye, son of Adam.

738
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,890
Son, where are you?

739
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,559
Ham!

740
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,081
Ham?

741
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,931
Ham?

742
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,801
It's all right.

743
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,519
- Shem!
- Father!

744
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,319
Japheth, where are you?

745
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,479
- Ila, I'm here!
- Father!

746
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,887
Mother, where's Father?

747
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,049
Please, Noah,

748
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,607
there must be something we can do.

749
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,208
We can drag ropes.

750
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,766
They cannot all be
soldiers, Father.

751
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,609
They are just people.
And there's room.

752
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,088
There is no room for them.

753
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,362
Soon everything we
knew will be gone.

754
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,170
All that is left of Creation
will lie within these walls.

755
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,846
Outside,

756
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,847
just the waters of chaos again.

757
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,205
You are angry.

758
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,010
You judge me.

759
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,010
Let me tell you a story.

760
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,970
The first story my father told me, and
the first story that I told each of you.

761
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:36,366
In the beginning,
there was nothing.

762
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,689
<i>Nothing but the silence
of an infinite darkness.</i>

763
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,359
<i>But the breath of The
Creator fluttered against</i>

764
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,085
<i>the face of the void, whispering,</i>

765
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,250
<i>"Let there be light."</i>

766
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,211
<i>And light was.</i>

767
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,046
<i>And it was good.</i>

768
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,931
<i>The first day.</i>

769
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,799
<i>And then the formless light</i>

770
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,571
<i>began to take on
substance and shape.</i>

771
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,410
<i>A second day.</i>

772
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,444
<i>And our world was born.</i>

773
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,367
<i>Our beautiful, fragile home.</i>

774
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,445
<i>And a great, warming
light nurtured its days.</i>

775
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,361
<i>And a lesser light
ruled the nights.</i>

776
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,844
<i>And there was evening. And morning.</i>

777
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,885
<i>Another day.</i>

778
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:24,081
<i>And the waters of the
world gathered together,</i>

779
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,803
<i>and in their midst
emerged dry land.</i>

780
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,804
<i>Another day passed.</i>

781
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,879
<i>And the ground put forth
the growing things.</i>

782
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,039
<i>A thick blanket of green</i>

783
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,208
<i>stretching across all Creation.</i>

784
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:41,050
<i>And the waters, too,
teemed with life.</i>

785
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,081
<i>Great creatures of the
deep that are no more.</i>

786
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,243
<i>Vast multitudes of fish,</i>

787
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,563
<i>some of which may still
swim beneath these seas.</i>

788
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,806
<i>And soon the sky was
streaming with birds.</i>

789
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,279
<i>And there was evening.</i>

790
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,079
<i>And there was morning. A fifth day.</i>

791
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,124
<i>Now the whole world was
full of living beings.</i>

792
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,759
<i>Everything that creeps,
everything that crawls,</i>

793
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,803
<i>and every beast that
walks upon the ground.</i>

794
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,327
<i>And it was good. It was all good.</i>

795
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,759
<i>There was light and air and water</i>

796
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,327
<i>and soil, all clean and unspoiled.</i>

797
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,167
<i>There were plants and
fish and fowl and beast,</i>

798
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,759
<i>each after their own kind.</i>

799
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,440
<i>All part of the greater whole.
All in their place.</i>

800
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,759
<i>And all was in balance.
It was paradise.</i>

801
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,088
<i>A jewel in The Creator's palm.</i>

802
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:32,001
<i>Then The Creator made Man.
And by his side, Woman.</i>

803
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,484
<i>Father and mother of us all.</i>

804
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,160
<i>He gave them a choice.</i>

805
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,168
<i>Follow the temptation of darkness</i>

806
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,050
<i>or hold on to the
blessing of light.</i>

807
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,368
<i>But they ate from the
forbidden fruit.</i>

808
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,842
<i>Their innocence was extinguished.</i>

809
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,524
<i>And so for the ten
generations since Adam, sin</i>

810
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,849
<i>has walked within us.</i>

811
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,169
<i>Brother against brother.</i>

812
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,848
<i>Nation against nation.</i>

813
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,409
<i>Man against Creation.</i>

814
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,209
<i>We murdered each other.</i>

815
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,331
<i>We broke the world. We did this.</i>

816
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,529
<i>Man did this.</i>

817
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,362
<i>Everything that was beautiful,</i>

818
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,523
<i>everything that was good,</i>

819
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,565
<i>we shattered.</i>

820
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,406
<i>Now,</i>

821
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,089
<i>it begins again.</i>

822
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,923
Air, water, earth, plant,
fish, bird and beast.

823
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,449
Paradise returns.

824
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,085
But this time,

825
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,204
this time there will be no men.

826
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,407
If we were to enter
the Garden again,

827
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,241
it would only be to
destroy it once more.

828
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,721
No.

829
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,282
The Creator has judged us.

830
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,963
Mankind must end.

831
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,441
Shem and Ila,

832
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,724
you will bury your mother and I.

833
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,931
Ham, you will bury them.

834
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,961
Japheth will lay you to rest.

835
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,770
You, Japheth,

836
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,962
you will be the last man.

837
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,604
And in time you, too,
will return to the dust.

838
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,122
Creation will be left alone,

839
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,482
safe and beautiful.

840
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,283
I'm very sorry about that girl.

841
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,404
And I'm sorry for you.

842
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,439
But we have been
entrusted with a task

843
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,961
much greater than our own desires.

844
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,969
Ham.

845
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,166
Shh.

846
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,727
Noah...

847
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,569
Does he know I'm here?

848
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,568
- Does he know I'm here?
- No, no, no. No.

849
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,888
Why are you helping me?

850
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,964
There was a girl.

851
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,725
I tried to bring her.

852
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,682
But he just let her die.

853
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,241
Ah.

854
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,922
And now you want revenge.

855
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,087
No.

856
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,090
Yes, you do.

857
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,409
Yes, you do.

858
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,689
There's no more land.

859
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,402
Everything out there must be dead.

860
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,770
It had to be what He wanted.

861
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,123
A world without man.

862
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,646
You see that, don't you?

863
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,731
What I see

864
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,121
is how hard this was for you to do

865
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,082
as a man who respects life,

866
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,804
a man who loves his children.

867
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,484
You've been strong.

868
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,970
But it's done.

869
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,490
It's done now.

870
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,928
And you can put that burden down.

871
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,205
Noah.

872
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,446
It's all right.

873
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,851
If your father found
me, he would kill me.

874
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,324
We must be ready,
but I am too weak.

875
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,405
Mmm.

876
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,846
What are you doing?

877
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,883
I must get my strength back.

878
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,519
The beasts are precious.
There are only two of each.

879
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,722
And there is only one of me.

880
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,326
But the rain,

881
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,369
all these miracles, are for them.

882
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,087
Them?

883
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,211
Your father fills a ship with
beasts while children drown.

884
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,526
He belittles you by telling
you you must serve them.

885
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,160
Oh, no.

886
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,600
They serve us.

887
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,722
That is the greatness of men.

888
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,359
When The Creator
finished making the sky,

889
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,086
the ground, the sea,
and this beast,

890
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,890
He wasn't satisfied.

891
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,886
He needed something greater.
Something

892
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,927
to take dominion over
it and subdue it.

893
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,361
Mmm.

894
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,042
So He made us in His image.

895
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,726
Us.

896
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,282
This is your world, Ham.

897
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,646
Seize it.

898
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,606
Ila.

899
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,764
Oh, Grandfather.

900
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,006
What is it?

901
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,603
You're not sick.

902
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,522
But that's impossible.

903
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,120
What?

904
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,691
What is it?

905
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,367
Noah.

906
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,131
It is his grandchild.

907
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,051
What's wrong?

908
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,725
- Father.
- Noah.

909
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,727
We've come to ask
for your blessing.

910
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,364
I don't understand.

911
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,160
I am with Child.

912
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,845
It's not possible.

913
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,206
You're barren.

914
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,359
You can't conceive. How...

915
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,449
- How is that possible?
- Grandfather.

916
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,399
- I asked Grandfather...
- To what?

917
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,090
Undermine The Creator?

918
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,362
To give our children a future.

919
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,251
To give humanity a future.

920
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,961
Have you any idea what you've done?

921
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,523
All those lives! All those people!

922
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,286
For nothing!

923
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,439
Do you know what this
forces me to do?

924
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,321
No!

925
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,688
Please! Please!

926
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,451
Please!

927
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,649
I cannot do this!

928
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,002
Tell me I don't need to do this!

929
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,771
Please.

930
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,846
Have I not done everything
that You asked of me?

931
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,929
Is that not enough?

932
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,687
Why do You not answer me?

933
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,646
Why?

934
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,689
I will not fail You.

935
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,849
I will not fail You.

936
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,724
I will not fail You.

937
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,650
It shall be done.

938
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,764
It shall be done.

939
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,566
Father?

940
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,291
The rains have stopped.

941
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:14,047
The Creator smiles on our child.

942
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,250
The rains have stopped
because of your child, yes,

943
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,890
but He does not smile.

944
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,523
If your child is a boy,

945
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,721
he will replace Japheth, last man.

946
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,246
Ir it is a girl,

947
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,722
who could mature into a mother,

948
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,411
she must die.

949
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,925
Are you mad?

950
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,331
That is my Child!

951
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,123
If you should bear a girl,

952
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,807
in the moment of her birth,
I will cut her down.

953
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,168
Mother!

954
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,285
Mother, my bird!

955
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,049
Nothing. No mud.

956
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,886
Nothing.

957
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,330
We still have to go.

958
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,001
Ila,

959
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,886
there's nothing.

960
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,769
There's nothing out there.

961
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,449
You have food and water
for how long? Weeks?

962
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,850
- A month?
- A month.

963
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,686
Please wait.

964
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,319
Wait until the bird
finds land. Please.

965
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,839
Japheth, send him again.

966
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,520
- He's too tired.
- Then wake another.

967
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,925
Here.

968
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:10,451
Please. One that can
find us a home.

969
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,081
No.

970
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,770
We leave today.

971
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,324
They will die out there.

972
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,485
Not if they stay.

973
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,246
And let you kill their Child?

974
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,451
Noah.

975
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,126
Noah!

976
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,084
I did this.

977
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,646
I did this, Noah!

978
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,641
Please!

979
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,130
Punish me!

980
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,486
Punish me, Noah!

981
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,205
Not them.

982
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,329
Not the child.

983
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,051
Please.

984
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,442
The child is not being punished.

985
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,121
We are all being punished.

986
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,651
All of us.

987
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,962
It's not something I want to do.

988
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,009
It's something I have to do.

989
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,886
It is painful,

990
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,240
but it is just.

991
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,686
Just?

992
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,920
How?

993
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,490
How is this just?

994
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,368
It's a baby, Noah.

995
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,839
If you hold to this,

996
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:32,045
you will lose your sons,
you will lose Ila,

997
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,444
you will lose me.

998
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,722
I love you, Noah.

999
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:47,159
And I have followed you everywhere.

1000
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,725
Through everything.

1001
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,930
I forgave you.

1002
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,319
When everyone was
dead, I forgave you.

1003
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,091
I was ready to die with you.

1004
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,531
But this

1005
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,442
I will never forgive.

1006
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,604
Boy or girl, I will never forgive!

1007
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:09,089
And you will die alone!
Not just alone, but hated!

1008
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:12,410
Hated by everyone you love!

1009
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,449
That is just!

1010
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,250
That is just.

1011
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,131
Oh...

1012
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,606
Oh.

1013
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,601
It's time.

1014
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,446
Bring him through there.

1015
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,530
One blow will finish it.

1016
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,690
Just in case, huh?

1017
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,683
I don't know if I can.

1018
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,319
He killed your woman.

1019
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,919
And now he plots to kill
your brother's firstborn.

1020
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,849
Is that what you want?

1021
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,325
You want your sister
to die on the seas?

1022
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,527
A man isn't ruled by the heavens.

1023
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,808
A man is ruled by his will.

1024
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:58,931
So I ask you, are you a man?

1025
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:10,571
Good.

1026
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:12,882
Because if you're a man,

1027
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,240
you can kill.

1028
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,844
But he won't follow me.

1029
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,368
Thank you, Japheth.

1030
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:35,522
You take care of that baby.

1031
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,608
Don't be afraid, Mother.

1032
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,927
We'll see each other
in the new world.

1033
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:03,801
Father.

1034
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,291
No! No!

1035
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,321
How could you?

1036
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,562
I thought you were good!

1037
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,639
I thought that's why He chose you.

1038
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:30,239
He chose me because He knew
I would complete the task,

1039
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,599
nothing more, son.

1040
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,484
Mother.

1041
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,967
Mother.

1042
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,639
It's your time.

1043
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:45,444
Come. Come with me.

1044
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,079
You're all right.

1045
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,645
Japheth, stand back.

1046
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,690
Come now. Come inside.

1047
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:05,319
That's right. That's right. Shh.

1048
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:09,279
You're all right, Ila.
You're safe here.

1049
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,127
Please keep it inside.

1050
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,802
Your baby's coming.

1051
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,282
Your baby's coming, Ila.

1052
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,359
Don't think about anything else.

1053
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,921
Father! Father, they're awake!

1054
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,764
They're awake! They're
eating each other!

1055
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,769
- The beasts.
- What?

1056
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,400
Come.

1057
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,767
Come!

1058
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:13,046
It's not possible for them to
have woken up without our help.

1059
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,406
Which way, son?

1060
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,764
That's right. That's right.

1061
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,919
The line of Cain.

1062
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,246
I told you,

1063
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,763
I'm not afraid of miracles.

1064
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,807
That's rig ht.

1065
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,321
That's right.

1066
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:32,759
A bit more.

1067
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,171
Boy or girl?

1068
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,961
What's happening?

1069
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,726
There's another.

1070
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:08,007
Two?

1071
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,326
Twins.

1072
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:40,484
Mother, so?

1073
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,041
I'm sorry.

1074
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,889
I'm so sorry.

1075
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,607
Sisters.

1076
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,921
No.

1077
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,687
No!

1078
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,359
No!

1079
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,159
No!

1080
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,886
He will not touch our daughters.

1081
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,648
No! Shem!

1082
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:08,761
Shem!

1083
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,800
I should have killed you
when I killed your father.

1084
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,244
Well, now we finish it.

1085
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:18,847
Now!

1086
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:06,848
The evils of mankind will
not live in this new Eden.

1087
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,402
Leave us! Leave us alone!

1088
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,245
He's mine!

1089
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:31,324
The ark, the beasts, and all
of your women are now mine.

1090
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,242
I will build a new world

1091
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,641
in my image!

1092
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,240
Now you are a man.

1093
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,043
The Creator has not forgotten us.

1094
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:36,050
Her name was Na'el.

1095
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,485
She was innocent.

1096
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,244
She was good.

1097
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,970
It's a boy.

1098
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:05,561
It's a boy.

1099
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,199
- It's a boy.
- Move away.

1100
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,765
It's a boy.

1101
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,491
Where is she?

1102
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,719
Where is she?

1103
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,964
No. No. No.

1104
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,448
You can't.

1105
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:34,124
They're beautiful.

1106
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,166
They?

1107
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,919
You can't kill two.

1108
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,122
He sent us what we need.

1109
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:44,967
Oh, no. No. No!

1110
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,450
You can't!

1111
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,010
No!

1112
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,441
Noah!

1113
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,041
Ila!

1114
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,401
Noah. Please.

1115
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,639
These are my children!

1116
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:08,119
- Your grandchildren!
- I will not be stopped.

1117
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,599
I know I cannot stop
you, but they're crying!

1118
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:13,041
Please don't let them die crying.

1119
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,204
Let me calm them.

1120
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:20,247
Please, just let them be at peace.

1121
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,162
<i>The moon is high</i>

1122
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:36,241
<i>The leaves entwine</i>

1123
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:41,367
<i>Your Father waits for thee</i>

1124
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:49,086
<i>To wrap you in His sheltering wings</i>

1125
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:53,765
<i>To whisper you to sleep</i>

1126
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,771
<i>To wrap you in</i>

1127
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,762
<i>His welcoming arms</i>

1128
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,965
<i>Till the night sky breaks</i>

1129
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:12,082
<i>Your Father is the healing wind</i>

1130
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:17,127
<i>That whispers you to sleep</i>

1131
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,565
<i>That whispers as</i>

1132
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,211
<i>You sleep</i>

1133
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,439
You do not need to see this.

1134
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:36,244
I will hold them.

1135
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,004
Do it quickly.

1136
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,844
Do it quickly!

1137
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,484
I cannot do this.

1138
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:06,005
It's all right.

1139
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,484
Hide your eyes, Japheth.

1140
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,770
- Ham?
- He's here.

1141
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,406
You don't have to go.

1142
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,490
I don't belong here.

1143
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:24,164
For what it's worth,

1144
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:27,691
I'm glad that it
begins again with you.

1145
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,401
Maybe we'll learn to be kind.

1146
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,645
Will he come back?

1147
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:27,248
Some things cannot be unbroken.

1148
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:37,484
I have to know...

1149
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:41,403
Why did you spare them?

1150
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,846
I looked down at those
two little girls,

1151
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,768
and all I had in my heart was love.

1152
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:53,765
Then why are you alone, Noah?

1153
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,927
Why are you separated
from your family?

1154
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:01,171
Because I failed Him.

1155
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,163
And I failed all of you.

1156
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,525
Did you?

1157
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:18,442
He chose you for a reason, Noah.

1158
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,679
He showed you the wickedness of man

1159
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:24,201
and knew you would not look away.

1160
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:28,087
But then you saw goodness, too.

1161
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:33,445
The choice was put in your
hands because He put it there.

1162
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,046
He asked you to decide
if we were worth saving.

1163
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:43,204
And you chose mercy.

1164
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:48,050
You chose love.

1165
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:55,490
He has given us a second chance.

1166
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,449
Be a father.

1167
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:02,242
<i>Be a grandfather.</i>

1168
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:06,607
<i>Help us to do better this time.</i>

1169
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:11,403
<i>Help us start again.</i>

1170
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,051
The Creator

1171
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:26,042
made Adam in His image,

1172
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,562
and placed the world in his care.

1173
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:30,925
That birthright

1174
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,570
was passed down to us.

1175
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,889
To my father, then to
me, and to my sons,

1176
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:45,447
Shem,

1177
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:50,561
Japheth,

1178
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,571
and Ham.

1179
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,801
That birthright is
now passed to you,

1180
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:09,241
our grandchildren.

1181
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,809
This will be your work,

1182
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:21,282
and your responsibility.

1183
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:23,444
So I say to you,

1184
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,763
be fruitful and multiply

1185
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:31,762
