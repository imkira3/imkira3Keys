<i>[Hiccup] Remember what life</i>
<i>used to be like on Berk?</i>

3
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,795
- Dragons.
- [roaring]

4
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,839
<i>[Hiccup]</i>
<i>You had to be crazy to live here.</i>

5
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,134
<i>But we're Vikings.</i>
<i>Crazy is what we do best.</i>

6
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>And I guess I had enough crazy in me</i>
<i>to do something no Viking</i>

7
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>had ever done before.</i>

8
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,143
<i>I trained a dragon.</i>

9
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,104
<i>Life on Berk hasn't been the same since.</i>

10
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>And now, my friends and l</i>
<i>have the greatest job in the world.</i>

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,277
<i>We're dragon trainers.</i>

12
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,904
<i>Living with dragons, it ain't easy.</i>

13
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,242
<i>It brings a new adventure every day.</i>
<i>And there's so much to learn.</i>

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,954
<i>Because if you wanna train dragons,</i>
<i>you have to know dragons.</i>

15
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,957
<i>So, if you hurry, you can join us</i>
<i>in the Great Hall</i>

16
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,585
<i>where we're just about to start</i>
<i>a new class.</i>

17
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,172
- [Astrid] So that's a Gronckle.
- [Hiccup] Correct.

18
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,049
And you cannot tell
its head from its tail.

19
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,843
Right, right!

20
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,471
Gronckles do not like
to be scratched under their chins.

21
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,973
- I found that out the hard way.
- OK.

22
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,393
No scratching under chin. Got it.

23
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,314
What...? Toothless, what's up, bud?

24
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,442
- Oh, hey.
- Whoa! A new dragon trainer!

25
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,445
A new recruit.
Want to train dragons, do you?

26
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,072
- Looks eager enough.
- This one's got potential.

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,700
Aye, we'll see about that.
Here it is.

28
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,246
Book of Dragons. Between these two
<i>covers are the most incredible creatures</i>

29
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,664
<i>you'd ever hope to see.</i>

30
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,168
<i>Some you know, but there</i>
<i>are some you've never seen before.</i>

31
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,839
<i>And you won't last a day out there</i>
<i>if you don't learn the facts in here.</i>

32
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,718
<i>[Hiccup] Gobber, you can't scare us.</i>
<i>We've already trained dragons.</i>

33
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,471
<i>[Gobber] This book contains more</i>
<i>than just training.</i>

34
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,308
<i>It's the key to unlocking</i>
<i>a new world of dragons.</i>

35
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,727
<i>And I don't suppose you know</i>
<i>who started it all...</i>

36
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,229
- [grunts] Oh!
<i>- ...do you?</i>

37
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,024
<i>[Astrid] I thought it had something</i>
<i>to do with Bork the Bold.</i>

38
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,235
- Oh.
<i>- [Gobber] Well-spotted, lass.</i>

39
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,572
<i>But before he was bold, he was known</i>
<i>as Bork the Very, Very Unfortunate.</i>

40
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,159
<i>- [Hiccup] That's an... odd nickname.</i>
<i>- [Gobber] Aye, but apt.</i>

41
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,578
<i>It seemed that everything</i>
<i>Bork touched went wrong.</i>

42
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,413
[grunting] Oy!

43
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,083
- [zaps]
- Whoo-hoo!

44
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,961
<i>[Gobber] Bork was my</i>
<i>great-great-great-grandfather.</i>

45
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,255
<i>- But he started out as a shepherd.</i>
- [bleating]

46
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,383
<i>But his flock got very small.</i>

47
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,802
<i>That fact is, Bork and dragons</i>
<i>didn't seem to mix.</i>

48
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,806
- [dragon howling]
- [grunting, muttering]

49
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,351
<i>- So he gave blacksmithing a try...</i>
- Ouch!

50
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,064
<i>...and had a go at farming.</i>

51
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,985
<i>But he settled for the life</i>
<i>of a fisherman.</i>

52
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,367
Yum.
[whimpers]

53
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,038
- [muttering]
- [meows]

54
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,959
[sighs]

55
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,966
<i>[Gobber] And he used to say,</i>
<i>''If you see a dragon, kill on sight.''</i>

56
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,761
<i>You kids taught us that we</i>
<i>could train a dragon.</i>

57
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,015
<i>But it was Bork who had the idea</i>
<i>to classify them.</i>

58
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,184
<i>And what does Bork say</i>
<i>is the first class of dragons?</i>

59
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,604
<i>[Hiccup] Oh, that's easy. Stoker class.</i>

60
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,398
<i>Now according to the book,</i>
<i>these hot-headed dragons</i>

61
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,901
<i>are furious fire-breathers.</i>

62
00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:00,323
<i>And when training a Terror,</i>
<i>start with a very shiny object.</i>

63
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,074
<i>[Astrid] Oh, he's cute.</i>

64
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,952
- [barking]
<i>- [Gobber] Cute?! Maybe on his own.</i>

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,955
<i>But Bork says if you get</i>
<i>these little Terrors in a group,</i>

66
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,916
<i>it's no picnic.</i>

67
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,669
<i>You see, Terrors are social creatures.</i>

68
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,172
<i>They love to hunt in packs.</i>

69
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,762
<i>Now, what about this brute?</i>

70
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,848
- [man grunting]
<i>- The Monstrous Nightmare.</i>

71
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,768
<i>You can see how this foul beast</i>
<i>got his name.</i>

72
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,856
<i>Nary a Viking has tamed</i>
<i>this fierce creature.</i>

73
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,818
[squealing]

74
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,654
<i>But you know what Bork used to say?</i>

75
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,031
<i>''You fall down, you get right back</i>
<i>on the dragon.''</i>

76
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,576
<i>[Astrid] l bet he didn't know that the</i>
<i>Nightmare can set itself on fire.</i>

77
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,376
<i>And if there's one thing you don't want,</i>
<i>it's an angry Nightmare.</i>

78
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,962
<i>That's why we tried</i>
<i>a more gentle approach.</i>

79
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,339
<i>[Hiccup] lnstead of wrestling</i>
<i>a Monstrous Nightmare,</i>

80
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:02,176
<i>just give him a little respect.</i>
<i>A gentle hand on his snout.</i>

81
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,012
<i>[Gobber] Looks like you kids</i>
<i>have made some breakthroughs.</i>

82
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,224
<i>All right, Fishlegs. Why don't</i>
<i>you tell us about your dragon?</i>

83
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,558
<i>[Fishlegs] Meatlug's my Gronckle,</i>

84
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,562
<i>and Gronckles are tough,</i>
<i>rock-eating, Boulder class dragons.</i>

85
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,314
<i>[Astrid] But how do you</i>
<i>train a Gronckle?</i>

86
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,857
<i>[Hiccup] A Gronckle</i>
<i>won't stay mad at you</i>

87
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,693
<i>if you just feed</i>
<i>him a little dragonnip.</i>

88
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,611
<i>[Fishlegs] Yeah, and like all dragons,</i>

89
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,447
<i>Gronckles are rumoured to have</i>
<i>five stages of maturity.</i>

90
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,658
<i>The first stage is the egg.</i>

91
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,536
<i>Then the tiny teeth.</i>
<i>The short wing.</i>

92
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,288
<i>The broad wing. And the last stage</i>
<i>is the titan wing,</i>

93
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,541
<i>which is extremely rare.</i>

94
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,793
<i>[Gobber] Rare, but a sight to behold.</i>

95
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,796
<i>Let's look at another</i>
<i>from the Boulder class.</i>

96
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,967
<i>The Whispering Death.</i>

97
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,887
<i>Just saying its name</i>
<i>gives you the shivers.</i>

98
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,938
<i>Bork says the Whispering Death</i>
<i>knows only one thing: killing!</i>

99
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,859
<i>He burrows through the dirt and rock,</i>
<i>attacking from below.</i>

100
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,738
- [woman screaming]
- [man grunting]

101
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,199
[man screaming]

102
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,125
[roaring]

103
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,919
<i>[Fishlegs] Their rotating teeth</i>
<i>can bore through anything.</i>

104
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,255
<i>And these Boulder class baddies</i>
<i>are so wicked,</i>

105
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,257
<i>they can breathe rings of fire!</i>

106
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,427
<i>But even though these dragons</i>
<i>have a fearsome reputation,</i>

107
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,512
<i>it turns out they just love</i>
<i>to be brushed.</i>

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,182
<i>[Hiccup] With patience,</i>
<i>any dragon can be trained.</i>

109
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,061
<i>Even this next batch: Fear class.</i>

110
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,772
<i>These dragons are silent,</i>
<i>they're sneaky,</i>

111
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,982
<i>they turn up when you least expect them.</i>

112
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,153
<i>[Astrid] lf Fear class dragons are so</i>
<i>sneaky, how did Bork find one?</i>

113
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:49,116
<i>[Gobber] He did better than find one.</i>
<i>He found the lair of a Zippleback.</i>

114
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,036
<i>Well, actually,</i>
<i>it wasn't he who found it.</i>

115
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,872
<i>It was his trusted sheep Willy.</i>

116
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,877
<i>And what do you know of a Zippleback?</i>

117
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,712
<i>[Hiccup] Got two heads.</i>

118
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:06,008
<i>Twice the danger.</i>
<i>One head releases gas...</i>

119
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,177
<i>...the other ignites it.</i>

120
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,137
<i>[Astrid] And if you feed</i>
<i>both heads at once,</i>

121
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,515
<i>they become</i>
<i>one agreeable dragon.</i>

122
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,850
<i>[Fishlegs] That's right.</i>
<i>lf you want to befriend a dragon,</i>

123
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,353
<i>it's a good idea to start</i>
<i>by feeding it.</i>

124
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,564
<i>And once they're fed,</i>
<i>make sure you play with them.</i>

125
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,274
<i>[Gobber] You kids are full of good tips.</i>

126
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,487
<i>But what happens when you go</i>
<i>from two heads to four?</i>

127
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,906
<i>It's the Venus flytrap of dragons,</i>

128
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,117
<i>the devious Snaptrapper!</i>

129
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,955
<i>[Astrid] The book says that this wild</i>
<i>beast has enticed many a Viking</i>

130
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:41,460
<i>into its deadly trap,</i>
<i>with its sweet smell of chocolate.</i>

131
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:53,222
<i>[Fishlegs] And like all dragons,</i>
<i>the Snaptrapper sheds its scales.</i>

132
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,518
<i>- [Astrid] And its claws.</i>
- [screeching]

133
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,395
<i>But they all grow back.</i>

134
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,070
<i>With all those heads, Bork must</i>
<i>have had four times the trouble.</i>

135
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,490
<i>[Gobber] Aye, that's a fact.</i>

136
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,494
<i>Until one day, Bork made</i>
<i>an interesting discovery.</i>

137
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,079
Huh?

138
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,165
- [roaring]
- [whimpering]

139
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,626
<i>[Gobber] Snaptrappers love rain.</i>

140
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,673
<i>And they can't wait</i>
<i>to play in the mud.</i>

141
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,467
<i>[Fishlegs]</i>
<i>Well, the Snaptrapper is incredible,</i>

142
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,763
<i>but let's see what secrets we uncover</i>
<i>with the next class of dragons.</i>

143
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,516
<i>[Astrid] The Sharp class.</i>

144
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,477
<i>These dragons have</i>
<i>a generous dose of vanity,</i>

145
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,523
<i>and spend a lot of time preening.</i>
<i>My personal favourite is</i>

146
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,567
<i>the Deadly Nadder.</i>

147
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,738
<i>Bork says that Nadders have</i>
<i>the hottest fire in the dragon world.</i>

148
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:55,159
<i>We found the best way to train her</i>
<i>was to approach her carefully,</i>

149
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,828
<i>slowly moving around back</i>
<i>toward her tail.</i>

150
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,331
<i>[Gobber] Her tail? You've gone mad.</i>

151
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:04,043
<i>It's full of poisonous spikes</i>
<i>that can launch at will.</i>

152
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,378
[whimpering]

153
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,512
<i>[Astrid] Yes, but if you</i>
<i>move slowly enough,</i>

154
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
<i>and you show her</i>
<i>you're not a threat,</i>

155
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,018
<i>she'll let you smooth</i>
<i>her tail spikes down.</i>

156
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,395
<i>[Hiccup] There's more</i>
<i>to the Sharp class than just Nadders.</i>

157
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,649
<i>Let's look at what Bork wrote</i>
<i>about the Timberjack.</i>

158
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,361
<i>[Gobber] This dragon attacks</i>
<i>out of the sky with razor-sharp wings...</i>

159
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,904
[roaring]

160
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,866
<i>...and can slice through a forest</i>
<i>of trees like a giant guillotine.</i>

161
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,368
Hmm?

162
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,080
Ow-ee.

163
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,168
<i>[Hiccup] But those long wings of the</i>
<i>Timberjack make it impossible for him</i>

164
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,670
<i>to even scratch his back.</i>

165
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,630
<i>[Fishlegs]</i>
<i>Yep, and if you scratch his itch,</i>

166
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,340
<i>he's your friend forever.</i>

167
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,384
<i>[Gobber] Another brilliant survival tip.</i>

168
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:58,347
<i>A perfect opportunity to teach our new</i>
<i>trainer about this class of dragons.</i>

169
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,432
<i>The Tidal class.</i>

170
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,729
<i>These beasts live in the watery deep</i>
<i>and they can out-swim the fastest ship.</i>

171
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,484
<i>[Fishlegs] Did Bork even know</i>
<i>that the sea was full of dragons?</i>

172
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,902
<i>[Gobber] Not at first.</i>

173
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,322
<i>But he soon found out</i>
<i>that the open sea was no easier,</i>

174
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,660
<i>because if there's one thing that sea</i>
<i>dragons like to eat more than a fish...</i>

175
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,705
<i>...it's a whole boatload of fish.</i>

176
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,249
[grunting, whimpering]

177
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>[Gobber] And after that first sighting,</i>
<i>Bork called it a Scauldron.</i>

178
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,176
<i>As we now know, that sea dragon</i>
<i>fills itself up with water,</i>

179
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,471
<i>then heats it in its giant</i>
<i>cauldron-like stomach.</i>

180
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,475
<i>One blast from that hot water,</i>
<i>and you're finished.</i>

181
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,230
<i>[Hiccup] We found out something</i>
<i>surprising about Scauldrons.</i>

182
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,483
<i>lf you wanna train them,</i>
<i>douse yourself with water.</i>

183
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,320
<i>Turns out they like anything</i>
<i>that reminds them of home.</i>

184
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,946
[laughs nervously]
Stop it! Stop!

185
00:10:56,114 --> 00:11:00,909
<i>[Gobber] Look at what also lurks in</i>
<i>the deep. It's the mighty Thunderdrum.</i>

186
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,954
<i>This beast moves through the water</i>
<i>like a tornado,</i>

187
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,584
<i>and is capable of delivering a sonic</i>
<i>blast of pure dragon power.</i>

188
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,588
<i>The story goes that Bork</i>
<i>got lost ice fishing,</i>

189
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,966
<i>and he stumbled across</i>
<i>a Thunderdrum nest.</i>

190
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,763
<i>That must have been</i>
<i>quite a rude awakening,</i>

191
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,515
<i>because when a Thunderdrum hatches</i>
<i>from its shell,</i>

192
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,644
<i>it makes a sound so loud</i>
<i>it rattles the sky!</i>

193
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,647
[howls, grunts]

194
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,985
[whistling]

195
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,411
<i>[Gobber] Now, here's a class</i>
<i>that might stump you.</i>

196
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,163
<i>[Fishlegs] What symbol is that?</i>

197
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,582
<i>[Gobber] It's a symbol</i>
<i>for the Mystery class.</i>

198
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,460
<i>We don't really know</i>
<i>how these guys work.</i>

199
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,505
<i>That's why they're a mystery.</i>

200
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,007
<i>ls it a tree? ls it a rock?</i>

201
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,551
<i>No, it's the Changewing.</i>

202
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,390
<i>This strange dragon can disappear</i>
<i>into any environment.</i>

203
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,106
<i>[Hiccup] Bork noticed that Changewings</i>
<i>are curious creatures.</i>

204
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,360
<i>And they display mimicking behaviour.</i>

205
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,822
<i>Whatever they see,</i>
<i>they love to copy.</i>

206
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,202
<i>[Gobber] Changewings</i>
<i>are known for their acid breath</i>

207
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,538
<i>and their ability to hypnotise.</i>

208
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,874
<i>But finding one takes a keen eye.</i>

209
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:35,129
<i>[Astrid] Does being able to change</i>
<i>colour mean their skin is softer?</i>

210
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,674
<i>[Gobber] For some, yes.</i>
<i>And it makes them vulnerable to attack,</i>

211
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,636
<i>so these dragons protect themselves</i>
<i>in a strange way.</i>

212
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,097
<i>Like this beauty:</i>

213
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,224
<i>The BoneKnapper.</i>

214
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,936
<i>This odd creature collects the bones</i>
<i>of dead dragons</i>

215
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,106
<i>and makes itself an unusual</i>
<i>coat of armour.</i>

216
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,191
[chuckles]

217
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,110
[dragon snarling]

218
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,279
[roars]

219
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,952
<i>[Gobber] The best way to deal with this</i>
<i>brutal bag of bones is to subdue it</i>

220
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,372
<i>- with force and fear and firepower!</i>
<i>- [Fishlegs] Sure, right.</i>

221
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,459
<i>- That's what you did, Gobber.</i>
<i>- [Gobber] All right, all right.</i>

222
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,586
<i>You give a BoneKnapper whatever it's</i>
<i>looking for and it's just like</i>

223
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,548
<i>an overgrown puppy dog. Why don't we</i>
<i>go on to the next class of dragons?</i>

224
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,426
<i>[Fishlegs] Finally, Strike class.</i>

225
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:26,263
<i>[Hiccup] Every dragon in this class</i>
<i>is characterised by blazing speed,</i>

226
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:30,309
<i>vice-like jaw strength</i>
<i>and extreme intelligence.</i>

227

<i>l give you the Skrill.</i>

228
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,690
<i>This elusive creature</i>
<i>is highly secretive,</i>

229
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,359
<i>and is known to ride lightning bolts.</i>

230
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:43,864
<i>Found only during electrical storms,</i>
<i>it can shoot bursts of white fire.</i>

231
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,870
<i>lf you get too close to a Skrill,</i>
<i>your hair will stand on end.</i>

232
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,499
[bleating]

<i>Let's see what else is in the book.</i>

234
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,961
<i>The Night Fury.</i>

235
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,797
<i>Speed, unknown. Size, unknown.</i>

236
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,634
<i>[Gobber] l guess this book</i>
<i>really does need updating.</i>

237
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,471
<i>[Hiccup] The unholy offspring</i>
<i>of lightning and death itself.</i>

238
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,683
<i>[Gobber] So, Hiccup,</i>
<i>how did you train a Night Fury?</i>

239
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,478
[screeching, roaring]

240
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,688
<i>[Hiccup] First l had</i>
<i>to get his attention.</i>

241
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,651
<i>Then l needed to earn his trust.</i>

242
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,743
<i>Everyone wonders what it's like to fly.</i>

243
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,913
<i>And now,</i>
<i>thanks to Toothless, we know.</i>

244
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,998
<i>These islands are full of dragons.</i>

245
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,001
<i>But I've never seen another Night Fury.</i>

246
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,712
<i>I have so many questions about him.</i>

247
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,465
<i>But I do know one thing.</i>

248
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,218
<i>Toothless didn't just become my friend.</i>

249
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,015
<i>He became the friend</i>
<i>who gave me my purpose.</i>

250
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,310
<i>[Gobber] He's quite the dragon,</i>
<i>I'll grant you that.</i>

251
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,064
<i>So, now you see.</i>
<i>Everything we know about dragons</i>

252
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,442
<i>started with one very</i>
<i>unfortunate Viking,</i>

253
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,486
<i>who had a hunger to learn more.</i>

254
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,071
Ha ha!

255
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,199
<i>[Gobber] Over the years,</i>
<i>curious Vikings like yourselves</i>

<i>have updated the pages,</i>
<i>and in time,</i>

257
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,038
<i>Bork of Dragons became</i>
Book of Dragons.

258

<i>It's now a very big part</i>
<i>of our Viking heritage.</i>

259
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,545
<i>So big, that Bork</i>
<i>the Very, Very Unfortunate</i>

260
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,215
<i>was soon renamed Bork the Bold.</i>

261
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,053
<i>- [Astrid] I bet you wish you knew him.</i>
<i>- [Gobber] Well, I do know him.</i>

262
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,222
<i>The fact is, we all know him.</i>

263

- Thanks to the Book of Dragons.
<i>- [children cheering]</i>

<i>[Hiccup] And I guess one day,</i>
<i>new kids will know us</i>

<i>But in the meantime,</i>

<i>where Bork left off.</i>

<i>finish these Night Fury pages.</i>

<i>- [Fishlegs] Yeah!</i>

<i>Like how fast Toothless can go.</i>

271

Well, to be honest,
I don't know his top speed, but...
