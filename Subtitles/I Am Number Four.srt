1
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,501
Whoo!

2
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:03,467
You know, showboating like that
just makes you look desperate.

3
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:07,269
Yeah, "Look at me. I can flip my ski."
Pathetic.

4
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,401
- Yeah.
- Daniel, that was awesome!

5
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,708
Nicole.

6
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,644
Hey, Daniel, Nicole left, huh?

7
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,814
Should've let me talk to her.

8
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,493
Whoo-hoo!

9
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,093
I love it out here.

10
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,078
The Big Dipper.
It's my favorite.

11
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,742
- Do you know that one?
- No.

12
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,546
I got a D in Astronomy.

13
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,557
So, I never see you with anyone.

14
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,026
Do you have a girlfriend
out of town or something?

15
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,095
Daniel? Daniel?

16
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,042
I want you to feel this!

17
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,784
This is what's coming for you.

18
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,115
Daniel, are you OK?

19
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,918
Oh, my God.

20
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,929
He's a freak.
He's some kind of freak.

21
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,942
Number Three's dead.

22
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,951
You all right?

23
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,820
- Yeah.
- Anyone else see what happened?

24
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:22,366
I told you not to keep this crap.
It just slows us down.

25
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,957
All right, let's go.

26
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,938
Daniel.

27
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,879
<i>This is the part</i>
<i>I hate the most, the running.</i>

28
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,182
<i>But it's the only thing</i>
<i>in my life that's real.</i>

29
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,051
<i>The rest is a lie.</i>

30
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,283
<i>Even Henri.</i>

31
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,257
<i>People think he's my father.</i>

32
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,920
<i>He's not.</i>

33
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:26,523
<i>He's a warrior from my planet,</i>
<i>assigned to keep me alive.</i>

34
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,063
<i>I don't remember my father.</i>

35
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,265
<i>All he left for me</i>
<i>was some kind of box.</i>

36
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,070
<i>Henri says he'll pass it on to me</i>
<i>when the time is right.</i>

37
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,872
<i>I got my first scar</i>
<i>when I was nine years old,</i>

38
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,439
<i>near the border of Mexico.</i>

39
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,281
<i>It woke me from my sleep.</i>

40
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,347
<i>It was the first sign that the</i>
<i>Mogadorians had found us here on Earth.</i>

41
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,126
<i>The second scar</i>
<i>came when I was 12.</i>

42
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,493
<i>I was in Colorado,</i>
<i>in the middle of a spelling bee.</i>

43
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,696
<i>As soon as I felt it,</i>
<i>I knew Number Two was dead.</i>

44
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,700
<i>Last night, I got my third scar.</i>

45
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:14,311
<i>I was just a kid when the Mogadorians</i>
<i>invaded my planet, Lorien.</i>

46
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,815
<i>Nine of us children escaped.</i>

47
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:21,319
<i>We were gifted, meant to protect</i>
<i>our people when we grew up.</i>

48
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,051
<i>We never got the chance.</i>
<i>Everyone was killed.</i>

49
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,159
<i>We are the last of our kind.</i>

50
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,460
<i>Three of us are gone. Dead.</i>

51
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,730
<i>They are hunting us down,</i>
<i>one by one, in order.</i>

52
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,334
<i>I know I'm next.</i>

53
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,507
<i>I am Number Four.</i>

54
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,873
All right, well, so...

55
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,845
Daniel won't be in school
the rest of the semester.

56
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,381
OK. You, too.

57
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,750
Your new ID.

58
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:59,024
And this time, you stay out of sight,
huh? No school, no teams, nothing.

59
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,049
John Smith. Very original.

60
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,290
I don't want to be original.
I want to be invisible.

61
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,295
This time was different.

62
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,327
I didn't just get a scar.

63
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,965
I, uh... I saw Number Three.

64
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,706
I felt the knife, I felt him die.
I could tell we all did.

65
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,314
- The others.
- We should get moving.

66
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,013
Mogadorians could've
already picked up our scent.

67
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:33,121
We're going to Paradise.
I have business to take care of.

68
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,953
It's Bernie Kosar.

69
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,397
Played football.

70
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,266
- Yeah, he played for Cleveland.
- Hm. Good to know.

71
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,070
- Next time, I get to pick the place.
- Yeah.

72
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,536
That's all of it.
I'm going to bed.

73
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,205
Ooh. Hang on.
I need a new picture.

74
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,006
We have to wipe out anything
that hits the Internet.

75
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,383
Say "Paradise."

76
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,484
Oh, shit.

77
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,723
This is why
I need you to be invisible.

78
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,286
Get back inside.

79
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,597
John.

80
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,193
Come on. Come back inside.

81
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,909
Little small for a Mogadorian,
don't you think?

82
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,116
I'm sure he belongs to someone.

83
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,281
He doesn't
have any collar or tags.

84
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,917
Hm. Somebody, somewhere,
must miss you, huh?

85
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,328
Come on.

86
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,093
Another pair of eyes
and ears watching the house?

87
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,133
- I'm gonna need somebody to talk to.
- Talk to me.

88
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,439
Yeah, keep the dog.

89
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,907
What are you gonna call him?

90
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,246
How about Bernie Kosar?

91
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,207
What are you doing up?

92
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,871
I changed my mind.

93
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,779
About what?

94
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,910
Look, uh, as much fun
as you are to be around,

95
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,013
I can't be a prisoner.
Uh, I have to go to school.

96
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,081
- No. No way, too risky.
- Come on.

97
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,683
Number Three was completely
off the grid and the Mogs got him.

98
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,251
- Didn't save him.
- Mm-mm.

99
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,890
Come on.
I'm gonna be safer if I blend in.

100
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,433
I promise I'll keep a low profile.

101
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,662
Look. Even if I let you, and I'm not,

102
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,933
you can't just waltz into school
and start class...

103
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,599
Do you think you're the only one
who can forge documents?

104
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,344
Hm. Do you have a...?

105
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,006
Five days of rations,
spare clothes, GPS, cash.

106
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,711
- What's your name?
- John Smith.

107
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,274
- Where are you from?
- Toronto.

108
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,252
You seem kind of tan for Toronto.

109
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,484
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I know the drill, OK?

110
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,453
You keep this on you.
I'll call you every hour.

111
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,123
If you don't pick up,
I know something's wrong.

112
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,396
- Come on, every hour?
- That, or you can home school.

113
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,461
And I'll be your teacher.

114
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,970
Fine.

115
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,942
Hey, John, don't be stupid.
You keep your head down.

116
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,387
I know how to blend in.

117
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,467
OK, doll. Take a seat.

118
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,971
I'll just print up your schedule.
Back in a jiffy.

119
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,470
I know she's
the star photographer,

120
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,411
but it's not fair
to the other students.

121
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,107
She's using up all the vital supplies.

122
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,982
Emory, come on. "Strangers in
Paradise." At least she's creative.

123
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,543
The pictures on her website
are totally inappropriate.

124
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,113
Mr. Behrman, if you want to keep
the photos, you should just say so.

125
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,558
Keep the photos?
They're already all over the Internet!

126
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,994
It's a violation to post things like
this without people's permission.

127
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,361
You have to do something about this.

128
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,866
Mr. Behrman,
excuse us for a few minutes, OK?

129
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,843
Sarah, this is not like you.

130
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,313
Is there something going on?

131
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,249
- Everything's fine.
- Sarah?

132
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,309
- Honestly.
- Have a seat.

133
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,487
You can't let a few negative students
get you down.

134
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,325
Look, I don't want you to isolate
yourself from the rest of the school.

135
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:28,390
- You should enjoy this year.
- OK, I'll try.

136
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,561
- Good.
- Can I please have my camera back?

137
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,266
No more photos on your website
without teacher and student permission.

138
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,035
OK.

139
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,804
Here's your schedule.

140
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,045
Homeroom is calculus.
That's B-wing, room seven...

141
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:51,886
Oh, Sarah! Could you show our friend
to his locker? He's from Santa Fe.

142
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:56,418
<i>Job fair starts tomorrow.</i>
<i>Everybody, job fair starts tomorrow.</i>

143
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,589
What kind of camera do you use?

144
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,865
Eavesdropping?
That's not gonna win you friends.

145
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,528
- Check it out.
- What?

146
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,704
Tell that to the principal
with a fish tank for an office.

147
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,933
It's kind of hard not to hear.

148
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,443
Sorry. This whole place
is kind of a fish tank.

149
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,908
Well...
Room seven is down the hall,

150
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,581
and, uh, that's your locker right there.

151
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,652
Good luck... um...

152
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,524
Oh, uh, John...

153
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,655
...Smith.

154
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,732
OK. You don't want to tell me your name.

155
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,793
That's fine.

156
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,147
That's really my name.
John Smith.

157
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,950
What's up, man? You new?

158
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,827
Mark James. This is Kevin,
Jackson, Tyler and Max.

159
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,627
- Hey, man, what's up?
- John.

160
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,635
Good to meet you, John.
Where are you from?

161
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,638
- Santa Fe.
- Oh, New Mexico.

162
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,003
Play any ball out there?

163
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,633
- Football?
- Yeah.

164
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,270
- No.
- Play anything?

165
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,473
Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?

166
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,981
Nope.

167
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,612
OK. No, that's cool, man.
That's totally cool.

168
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,622
We could always use more
boosters in the stands, right?

169
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,956
Listen. You need anything,
you ask us, OK?

170
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,019
- We got you.
- I'll keep that in mind.

171
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:42,590
Good talking to you, big guy.

172
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,633
Look who it is.

173
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,865
Watch out, man.

174
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,530
Sorry, Sam.

175
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,543
Loser!

176
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,207
Wait up, fool.

177
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,543
Thanks.

178
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,910
Gotta love the classics.

179
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,750
Homecoming king versus
the science nerd.

180
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,815
Just get better with time, don't they?

181
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,351
- That guy, Mark, he's...
- Soon to be irrelevant.

182
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,887
He's in the third year of
the best four years of his life.

183
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,624
So, she was like, "The solar system's
sun does not revolve around the Earth."

184
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,633
I said, "Yeah, right."

185
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,935
Hey, Spock!

186
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,769
- Nailed it!
- Heads up! UFO, brother!

187
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,140
That had to hurt.

188
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,939
Hey, stay down, man.
Just stay down.

189
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,172
He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.

190
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,715
- Oh, Mommy's coming!
- Oh...

191
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,315
- Right in the face.
- Hey, are you OK?

192
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:46,289
- Assholes.
- Yo, new dude! Little help?

193
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,068
Jesus!

194
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,230
I'm fine! Get off me.

195
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,068
Come on, man!

196
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,098
- You OK?
- No.

197
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,507
That's quite an arm
you got there.

198
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,415
Yeah. Who knew?

199
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,786
So, uh, what's with the UFO thing?

200
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,889
I know it's your first day and all,

201
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,553
but, uh, sooner or later
you'll figure it out.

202
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,755
Figure what out?

203
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,366
I'm definitely not the guy
you want to hang with.

204
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,215
Invisible.

205
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,227
You heard me
when I said that, right?

206
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,357
Yeah. Yeah, because
I remember you being there.

207
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:22,278
<i>Let us face,</i>
<i>without panic, the reality of our times.</i>

208
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,214
<i>The fact that atom bombs</i>

209
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,447
<i>may, some day, be dropped on our cities.</i>
<i>And let us prepare for survival</i>

210
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,545
<i>by understanding the weapon</i>
<i>that threatens us.</i>

211
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,613
Yeah.

212
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,320
How you settling in, bro?

213
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,627
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. That's good.

214
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,037
I see you and Spock are vibing.

215
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,041
Got a bit of a soft spot
for freaks, do you?

216
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,838
Who's talking?

217
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,848
Yikes.

218
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,909
Look. It's cute, it really is.
You are an adorable young man.

219
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,148
But I find it irritating,

220
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,349
so keep it on the bleachers, OK?

221
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,517
- All right.
- Good. That's good.

222
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,254
Also, while I'm here,

223
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,922
I'm gonna let you in on a little tip.

224
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,210
Find your place fast.
Catch the rest of this flick, OK?

225
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,375
Jesus, dude.
You are soaking wet.

226
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,906
John, get up.
Come on. We gotta go.

227
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,007
John.

228
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,576
- John.
- My hands. What...?

229
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,917
- Henri. My hands burn!
- John...

230
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,923
- Look at me and relax.
- What's happening to me?

231
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,549
They called them legacies back home.

232
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,254
You, the nine,
you're the only ones who have them.

233
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,659
- Legacies?
- That's right.

234
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,722
Your parents were members
of the Lorien Garde.

235
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,256
You've inherited their abilities. Gifts.

236
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,460
- Gifts?
- That's right.

237
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,333
My hands light up like road flares.

238
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,931
- And you call that a gift?
- Each legacy has its own function.

239
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,032
There's...
There's more coming?

240
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:35,740
As you breathe and focus,
you're gonna learn to control them.

241
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,682
- OK. OK.
- Just like you're doing, right now.

242
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,050
OK?

243
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,414
How do your hands feel?

244
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:49,584
- Better.
- Good.

245
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,953
So, what now?

246
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,155
Now?

247
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,396
We wait. You're gonna keep
growing stronger and faster.

248
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,165
I need you to be careful.

249
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,299
Right now, you have to focus
your mind. Get some control.

250
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,467
When you can do that,
you can get back to school.

251
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,137
I don't want to raise suspicion.
I still have business here.

252
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,044
In the meantime, your powers
will only draw attention.

253
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,413
You keep yourself in check,
you understand?

254
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,044
So I got all these powers,
but I'm not allowed to use them?

255
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,280
Exactly.

256
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,638
A little early for Thanksgiving.

257
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,269
Paper or plastic?

258
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,264
Whoa.

259
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,752
And you wind it here...

260
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,309
"Strangers in Paradise"?

261
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,445
I know. Arty, pretentious.

262
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,682
Uh... That's not actually
what I was gonna say.

263
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,055
I just needed a name for my website
and it was right there.

264
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,129
You know, they should've
called this town "Ironic."

265
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,192
Ironic, Ohio?
Has a ring to it.

266
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,397
What's up with you?
You look different, or something.

267
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,340
Sarah, come over!
I got a new bike!

268
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,005
OK, I will next week.

269
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,378
- Hold this for a second.
- All right.

270
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,508
Oh, they're so cute.

271
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,677
You know, uh... I mean it.

272
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,312
Uh... Your photographs...

273
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,846
My parents make me babysit
for film money,

274
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:17,054
and those are two of my victims.

275
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,528
You know, I'm, uh...

276
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,998
I'm actually trying to
pay you a compliment, but, uh...

277
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,433
...it's not going so well.

278
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,060
Oh.

279
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,037
Right. Um...

280
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,370
Thank you.

281
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,714
I don't know, I just, um,
see better through this thing.

282
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,679
It's like my own
personal BS detector.

283
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,218
Come on! Let's go!

284
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,229
Excuse me. Did you forget something?
You had two things to do, you know?

285
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,458
- Lock the door and turn off the lights!
- That's Sam's dad?

286
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,591
His stepdad.

287
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,693
Every night
it's the same thing with you!

288
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,476
This is it.

289
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,348
You live here?

290
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,022
Yeah, I grew up here.

291
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,023
- It's just a house.
- I know.

292
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,932
You hungry?

293
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,305
So, John, just moved
from Santa Fe a few weeks ago.

294
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,968
- The Smiths, right?
- Uh, yes, sir.

295
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,104
- And your father's a writer?
- Yes, he is.

296
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,843
Everybody really does know everything
in this town.

297
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,442
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

298
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,783
Question game!

299
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,119
Oh! Sorry, my bad.

300
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,283
- All right, everybody, surrender them.
- Here you go.

301
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,657
All electronic devices.
Come on, Sarah. Thank you.

302
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,854
Hand them over.

303
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,727
- And you.
- Mom?

304
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,733
He'll get it back after dinner.
You'll get it back after dinner.

305
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,328
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.
- All right.

306
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,738
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right?
You bored silly here?

307
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,437
Nah, not with the spring carnival
coming up!

308
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,413
It's fun, and you and your folks
should definitely come.

309
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,745
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

310
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,808
Where's your mom?

311
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,444
- Uh... My...
- Mom.

312
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:26,981
No, it's fine. My dad and mom,
uh, they didn't get married.

313
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,959
Uh, you know, check it out.
Carnival.

314
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,360
Sarah will be there
taking pictures for the paper.

315
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,522
Cheap labor.

316
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,190
- That is not why.
- No.

317
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,030
- She's a very talented photographer.
- Question game!

318
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,162
OK. Keep your voice down,
and we will play.

319
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:44,902
It's a dinner tradition. Otherwise,
we'd never talk about the good stuff.

320
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,341
Worst advice you ever got?

321
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,642
"Pull this."

322
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,907
Oh, stop!

323
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,573
That's really gross.

324
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,843
OK, um...

325
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,148
"Your parents will never know
you're gone."

326
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,211
It worked with your folks.
That's how she got here.

327
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,778
- Stop it. Stop.
- Oh, my God.

328
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,791
- What?
- OK, Sarah, your turn.

329
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:05,591
Oh. Mom telling me that self-tanner
looks totally natural.

330
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,858
She was orange.

331
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,367
Like a traffic cone.
On picture day.

332
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,924
Oh, you should go get that picture.

333
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,231
- We still have the picture!
- John, you are gonna...

334
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,033
Why would you want
to show him that?

335
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,370
I shouldn't have said it.

336
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,534
I think I tore them up.

337
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,280
Sorry about that.

338
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,513
- About what?
- My parents.

339
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:36,015
They were putting on the
"aren't we cool?" show.

340
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,721
They seem very proud of you.

341
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,729
Yeah, and they're already
trying to convince me

342
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,095
to go to the local community college
in Dayton.

343
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,226
They'd love it if I stayed here.

344
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,397
Got into wedding photography.

345
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,441
What do you want to do?

346
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,377
That's my favorite.

347
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,939
It's got all these light leaks

348
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,076
so the photos come out so interesting.

349
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,950
Here, I'll show you.

350
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,992
See that one right there?

351
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,968
That's what I was talking about.

352
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,333
What's this?

353
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,199
Um...

354
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:32,211
That is kind of private, actually.

355
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,881
It's amazing.

356
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,027
- What?
- You...

357
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,788
You're allowed
to look at everyone else...

358
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:52,131
...take our pictures, but, uh...
we're not allowed to see you?

359
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,971
OK.
That's enough.

360
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,946
Seems like you want to run away.

361
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,008
I'll just be happy
when I can get out of here.

362
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,814
I don't know.
I've been to a lot of places.

363
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,355
You don't have to give me the
"there's no place like home" speech.

364
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,981
I've heard it.

365
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,654
No, no. You can go wherever you want,
see whatever you want to.

366
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:22,064
But a place is only as good
as the people you know in it.

367
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,732
I, uh...

368
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,742
I think this is a pretty good place.

369
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,296
Bernie, you dumb dog.

370
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,058
- Does he belong to you?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

371
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,763
Well, hey. Hold on a sec.

372
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,670
Um...

373
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,781
Your turn.

374
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,384
Thanks.

375
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,094
I'm fine.

376
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,605
Heard you made quite an impression
in class yesterday.

377
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,939
Flashlight. It was a dumb prank.
But that class...

378
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,036
- Boring as hell? Yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,244
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but you need to stay off the grid.

380
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,081
- What do you mean?
- It's all over the school.

381
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,486
Mark James and his man-tards
have it out for you.

382
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,580
Sarah may act like one of us...

383
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:54,783
...she's one of them.

384
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,087
He's into Sarah?

385
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,096
More than that.
Nobody can go near her.

386
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,825
They were like the town...

387
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,230
Whoa!

388
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,632
Loser!

389
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:08,570
No... OK, come on...
Oh, God.

390
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,602
- Sucks to be you, bro!
- Seriously.

391
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,236
Want a napkin? Get a cleanup crew!

392
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,047
I wonder who did that?

393
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,316
What a loser.

394
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,048
Leave me alone!

395
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,952
Ah, ah, ah...

396
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,259
Did you have a nice time
last night, John?

397
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:42,129
You see, in football,
a quarterback needs a few things.

398
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,663
Speed, strength...

399
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,438
Mostly, though, you need intuition.

400
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,844
A feeling when things
are going south.

401
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,884
First time we talked,
I should've listened to mine.

402
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:07,562
There you go, John.

403
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,663
Good boy.

404
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,465
Maybe you got some intuition
working for you, too.

405
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,506
That was awesome.

406
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,314
Raided lost and found.

407
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,115
- Nobody loses anything cool.
- You gotta be kidding me.

408
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,386
Dude, it was that or the <i>Hannah</i>
<i>Montana</i> sweatshirt. You got off easy.

409
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,450
So, uh...

410
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,124
...who's in the picture?
- My dad.

411
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,463
The real one.

412
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,339
<i>Where was that taken?</i>

413
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:00,282
Mexico. The Yucatán.

414
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:04,083
We used to go every year looking
for evidence of ancient astronauts.

415
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,514
Ancient astronauts?

416
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,526
Yeah. UFOs and shit.

417
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,619
Freak show stuff.

418
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,357
He called himself an anthropologist...

419
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,958
<i>He was really just a foreman</i>
<i>at the steel mill.</i>

420
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:23,095
<i>He spent all his time preparing</i>
<i>for some kind of alien arrival.</i>

421
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,570
I used to think he was a genius.

422
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,545
Had to, I guess.

423
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,105
Nobody wants to admit
their dad's a freak.

424
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,123
Sam...

425
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,264
Sam.

426
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,399
Oh!

427
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,771
Malcolm, what were you up to here?

428
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,394
Jimmy, Vince,
come on, slow down, boys!

429
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,783
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey!

430
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,363
Mark James decided to fire
a warning shot about you.

431
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:56,708
When you first meet somebody,
do you dump all your stuff on them?

432
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,010
All your mistakes, your secrets?

433
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:04,678
Look, Mark and I, we changed.

434
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,655
I got into photography,

435
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,990
and he wanted me to be
his own personal cheerleader.

436
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:14,555
Said I was becoming a total snob.

437
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:18,032
And when we broke up,
that's what he told everybody.

438
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:22,128
That I was a total bitch.
And everyone listened.

439
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,202
All my friends.

440
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,672
Uh... I'm sorry.

441
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,878
I'm not. I mean, I was...

442
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,048
...but, um, I don't know,

443
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:41,215
I kinda look at it like a total gift.

444
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,158
Got away from all of that.

445
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,931
So, uh, what's the hottest attraction
at this place?

446
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,434
You gotta be kidding me, right?
This...

447
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,100
Don't be scared.

448
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:25,100
<i>Save yourself.</i>

449
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,085
Last year, she was drawn and quartered.

450
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,613
It was awesome.

451
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,624
My God.

452
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,970
Hell's Gate.

453
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,773
Everybody off.

454
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,660
Quite a production.

455
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:35,695
Hm. Small town.

456
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,351
OK. The last part got to me.

457
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,081
What is that?

458
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,685
Don't! Let him go! Let him go!

459
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,027
Stop it!

460
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,424
Hello?

461
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,901
Was that real? Are you all right?

462
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,866
Let me go! Stop it!

463
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,774
Leave him alone!

464
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,868
- No!
- Whoa! Calm down.

465
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,894
- Oh, my God. Just get off me!
- Sarah, come here!

466
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,566
- Idiot! It's you!
- Calm down! Calm down!

467
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,905
- Let go of me.
- You can take off, OK?

468
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,411
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Hey, listen. I will. I will!

469
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,275
Sarah!

470
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,030
Where is she?

471
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,759
It burns, man!

472
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:12,064
Dude, let go of me, bro, it hurts!

473
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,037
She's at Shepherd Falls!
Dude, put me down. What is that?

474
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,266
Where's John?

475
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:24,472
I don't get what happened to us.
I don't. I really don't.

476
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,812
So you have your friend
throw me over his shoulder,

477
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,783
drag me through the woods
to come here,

478
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,846
when all you had to do is ask me!
Like a normal person!

479
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,654
You don't have to tell me
I'm being an asshole, OK?

480
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,957
But you're a problem for me, Sarah.

481
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,965
Yeah, well, you really
should get over that.

482
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:46,469
- Wait. Sarah, wait.
- Just stop it!

483
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,862
You OK?

484
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,550
I hope you can throw
with your left hand.

485
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,886
No, John, stop! Stop!

486
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,300
John. John, stop. Wait.

487
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,364
Hey. I just didn't want you
to break his arm.

488
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,841
It's not you, it's me.
I shouldn't have lost it like that.

489
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,572
Hey.

490
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,812
Will you walk me home?

491
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,021
You should really get that looked at.

492
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:46,860
I will.

493
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,723
I, uh...

494
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:56,803
I think we should talk.

495
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,378
I know. It's crazy.

496
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,015
Mark is insane.

497
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,950
And this is our last year.

498
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,010
Who knows where you'll be
in three months?

499
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,682
Exactly.

500
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,149
Who knows?

501
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,094
So, I guess I'll just...

502
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,029
...see you when I see you?

503
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,529
Yeah.

504
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,503
OK.

505
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,439
Your hand's really warm.

506
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,965
All I think about is you.

507
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,661
All I think about is you, too.

508
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,356
Where did you come from?

509
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,297
All right, Mom! I got it!

510
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,001
- I, uh...
- Yeah, I should go.

511
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,598
Bye.

512
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,341
John! In here.

513
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,913
So, what are you?

514
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,654
You threw those football players
around like it was nothing.

515
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,561
And the hand thing?
That's not human.

516
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,929
So I'm asking you, what are you?

517
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,128
Do I need to threaten you?

518
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,571
All right, 'cause I got
some pictures on my phone,

519
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,039
and they're gonna start
some major questions.

520
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,043
- Give me that.
- No.

521
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,409
You know I can hurt you. Hm?

522
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,159
Knock yourself out.

523
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,365
My entire childhood...

524
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,070
...has been an episode of <i>X- Files.</i>

525
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,572
You know what it's like
to feel something...

526
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,448
...so strong...

527
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,421
...that every day you have
to keep telling yourself

528
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,584
your dad's gonna come back
and take you away from this shithole.

529
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,322
And that everything
we believed in was true.

530
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,863
And that we were not crazy.

531
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,293
Please.

532
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,198
Please.

533
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,145
Your dad was right.

534
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,145
What?

535
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,849
He was right.

536
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,425
About ancient astronauts...

537
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,958
...life on other planets...

538
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,566
...all of it.

539
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,469
Yes! I knew... I knew he
wouldn't just leave us!

540
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:06,471
I mean, they found his truck near the
border of Mexico, and he was just gone.

541
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,347
- Maybe they took him.
- Sam...

542
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,716
If he knew you were here,
he'd come home.

543
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:14,120
- You can't tell anyone.
- No, I-I-I wouldn't.

544
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,352
No, no, no. You gotta promise me.
Nobody knows this.

545
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:20,556
There are others from where I'm from
looking for me.

546
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,928
I'm not safe.

547
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:27,936
Sam! I know you are in there.
Get your ass in the house, now!

548
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,471
Wait until I get inside and then go.

549
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,236
Sam?

550
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,472
I promise.

551
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,743
Yes!

552
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,344
Come on.

553
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,736
Hey, you maniac.

554
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:05,171
- Hello, son.
- Hey, what's with the, uh...?

555
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:10,601
Hello, Dad.

556
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,739
Sheriff James says
some boys got hurt last night.

557
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,874
Couple of them
spent the night in the hospital.

558
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,408
- You said it was four?
- Yeah, four.

559
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:19,512
- On the football team.
- Yeah, that's right.

560
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,890
Of course, none of them are talking.
That includes my own boy, Mark.

561
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:29,725
- Your son is Mark?
- Yeah, that's right.

562
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,791
You know, that was his
throwing arm that got hurt.

563
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,859
He said you were there.

564
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,596
Uh, no. I was actually with a girl.

565
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:42,737
So I wasn't paying any attention.
Um...

566
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:43,803
Sarah Hart?

567
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:52,079
Well, no one wants to be the first
one to say what really happened.

568
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:55,613
But, eventually, someone will.

569
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,354
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you, Sheriff.

570
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,794
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

571
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,679
- Four of them, huh?
- Yeah.

572
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,051
Was it difficult?

573
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,983
Piece of cake.

574
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,654
Good. Means you're getting it.

575
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,720
Go upstairs, pack your stuff.

576
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,162
Because of last night?

577
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,826
Because I don't like people
showing up asking questions.

578
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,927
- And I think this is gonna raise a few.
- "They walk among us."

579
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,871
What is this? Some more
"truth is out there" freaks?

580
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,841
Except that's actually you.

581
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,070
One of the kids must
have caught you on video.

582
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,544
Oh, shit.

583
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,672
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

584
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,012
I can't get through the firewall.

585
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,847
We have to go there
and take it down ourselves.

586
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,045
Mogs see this, just a matter of time.

587
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,419
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

588
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,554
I'm not going.

589
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,724
I'm sorry, what did you say?

590
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,491
I'm not going.

591
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:12,763
OK. If you want to pick
the next place, that's fine...

592
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,530
It's not my fight and it never was!

593
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,868
I can't even remember
a world before this one.

594
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,770
Wait, wait...

595
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,173
...is this because of a girl?

596
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,003
Go upstairs and get your stuff.

597
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,379
- You're not my father.
- No, no, no. He's dead.

598
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:32,252
He died for you.
In fact, you know what?

599
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:36,223
You have no idea how many others
have made sacrifices so you could live!

600
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,782
And it wasn't so you could come here

601
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,021
and experience puppy love
like a real live boy!

602
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,758
I'm not leaving.

603
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,434
John... John!

604
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:48,765
I'm not leaving!

605
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,600
Oh, yeah, I can do that now.

606
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,042
Hey, John!

607
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,462
I'm letting go, OK?

608
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,361
- OK?
- OK.

609
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,438
- On our planet...
- Just tell me why they want to kill me.

610
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:35,975
The Mogs, they don't colonize.
They decimate. And then they move on.

611
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,748
And now, they've moved here.

612
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:43,725
There are few forces that can stop them.
You and the other five can.

613
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,421
You were saved for a bigger purpose.

614
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:49,124
I'm not gonna let you throw that away
for a girl.

615
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,633
She's not just a girl.

616
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,297
I think about leaving her...

617
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,930
...but I can't.

618
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:01,409
And I don't know why.

619
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:09,283
We don't love like the humans.
With us, it's forever.

620
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,220
You never forget.

621
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:22,164
If she is that for you,
then don't let them win.

622
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,564
Or you'll never forgive yourself.

623
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:28,694
Now, we have to go.

624
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,668
I'll take care of the website tonight.
Buy you a day.

625
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:36,576
A day? To say goodbye?

626
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,876
That's more than the rest of us had.

627
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,266
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

628
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,575
Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.

629
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,543
Henri?

630
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,605
Henri? Hello? Henri?

631
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:46,307
<i>No, but come here</i>
<i>and I'll tell you how to find him.</i>

632
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,179
Who are you? Where's Henri?

633
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,118
<i>417 Willard Court,</i>
<i>Warsaw, Indiana.</i>

634
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,229
Come on, come on.

635
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:05,791
I need your help.

636
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,804
So, you guys... you guys don't...

637
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,207
- Abduct people?
- Yeah.

638
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,268
No.

639
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,770
But the other guys,
the ones that are chasing you...

640
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,009
...they do?

641
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:43,895
That's it.

642
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,106
Thanks.

643
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:57,375
Whoa! You brought a gun?

644
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,445
I stole it from Ed.
It might come in handy. Let's go.

645
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,856
- No.
- Dude, I came here to help you.

646
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:07,453
You have. Now, go home.

647
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,376
Whoa!

648
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,178
- What are you doing?
- I'm not bailing.

649
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,983
What if these Mog people took my dad?

650
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:10,459
Holy shit!

651
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,687
But you just dead-bolted it.

652
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,892
- OK. New plan.
- Yeah.

653
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:20,060
You follow that guy and you
text me if he comes back, OK?

654
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,933
Copy that. I'm on it.

655
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:57,189
Henri.

656
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,444
- Are you OK?
- You're not supposed to be here.

657
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,643
- What happened?
- The Mogs set this up.

658
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,517
We need to leave. They're coming.

659
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,523
Everybody stays right where they are
or I'll shoot this kid.

660
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,151
I'll do it!
Get your hands up!

661
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,490
So glad you brought the gun.

662
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:28,193
You're Malcolm's boy.

663
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,797
- Get the lights, will you?
- Shut up! Get your hands up!

664
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,698
Oh!

665
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:48,374
You! You're the one
from the video on our site.

666
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,510
- The one they're after.
- The one who's after?

667
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:54,352
- What's he talking about?
- The Mogs, they've been here.

668
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,721
- This was a trap.
- Yeah.

669
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,227
These dudes, whatever they are, man,
they got plans, know what I'm sayin'?

670
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,559
- John...
- I'm that guy, the conspiracy guy.

671
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,532
Nobody gives a crap what I say.
But this is real, man!

672
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:05,966
John. It's time to leave.

673
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,732
They like it here, Earth. They're gonna
take all this shit, everything!

674
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,102
John! Now!

675
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:13,198
We either do what they say
or we are all gonna die.

676
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:15,710
It's time to go! Now!

677
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,788
John. John! John, no!

678
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,096
John, go!

679
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,600
- Now!
- Go!

680
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,286
Start the car.
Come on! Get us out of here!

681
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,025
- I can't find the keys!
- What do you mean?

682
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,589
- I can't find the keys!
- Come on! Come on!

683
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,665
Guys, what are we waiting for?

684
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,406
- I've lost the keys!
- John, start the engine.

685
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,602
- What?
- You can do it. Start the car.

686
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,610
- Come on.
- Start the car.

687
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,551
Whoa, whoa. Come on, come on!
He's coming! He's coming!

688
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,024
Start the car! Start the car!

689
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,961
Use your magic powers!
Come on! We are so dead!

690
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:18,024
Oh, my God!

691
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,234
Go! Drive the car!

692
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,546
You take this.

693
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:45,359
Malcolm was using it
to track the others.

694
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:48,659
- Wait. So, my dad was...
- He was helping us.

695
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,892
He was supposed to bring us together.

696
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,032
You need to find the others.

697
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,460
Together you'll be more powerful.

698
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:10,917
I can't do this without you.

699
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,283
Yes, you can.

700
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,686
Yes, you can.

701
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:23,754
You have no idea
what you're capable of.

702
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,029
Henri.

703
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,428
Just let me talk.

704
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,760
OK. So, I called you like you said.

705
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,036
I mean, it's not my fault they got...

706
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,798
I mean, we held up our end.

707
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,334
- Hm.
- We're still in?

708
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:46,711
The whole new world order thing?

709
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:50,775
The Locator.

710
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,481
- Where is it?
- OK.

711
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:57,686
All he had was a knife and that rock.

712
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,119
And I put it...

713
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:06,600
- It was over there, man.
- "It was over there, man."

714
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,727
But it's not there now.

715
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:35,225
Cartoons for children.

716
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,858
Where I'm from, men have to work.

717
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,765
Look, I'll work hard.

718
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,498
The disregard that so many of you
have for practical matters,

719
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:48,101
it's... beautiful.

720
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,303
I think we should
all have some fun. Huh?

721
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:55,307
Gadgets.
You call them "toys for boys."

722
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,615
I have a gadget.

723
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:02,555
- Would you like to play with it?
- Uh... No, no. I...

724
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:06,994
It wants to play with you!

725
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:21,904
Need to talk to you.

726
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,935
Any idea where
I might find your friend?

727
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:26,607
He's not who you think he is.

728
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,479
Excuse me?

729
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,548
<i>The Paradise Sheriff's Department</i>

730
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,286
<i>raided the home of two suspects,</i>

731
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:40,090
<i>seizing computers</i>
<i>and several suspicious items.</i>

732
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:43,461
<i>An APB has been issued on</i>
<i>the suspects and anyone with...</i>

733
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:48,459
We need to get out of here.

734
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,933
There's a news thing.

735
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:55,137
The cops think you and Henri
are criminals or terrorists.

736
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,479
We're going back.

737
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,660
I'm outside of
the home here in Warsaw

738
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:15,857
where the mutilated bodies of
two paranormal website operators

739
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,956
were just found a few hours ago.

740
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,797
The police are not saying
if they have any leads

741
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,201
or even why these
brutal murders occurred.

742
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,602
Police have no suspects
at this time...

743
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,807
- I have one of those!
- What?

744
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:39,616
One of those.
I took it from my dad's stash.

745
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,850
- I need you to get it.
- Yeah, yeah.

746
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:45,415
Let me off at Linndale.
Sarah's at a house up there.

747
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,428
I'll call you after.

748
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,862
- And then what?
- Then I get the rock and you go home.

749
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,036
- It's him.
- John?

750
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:06,978
- Did you see that?
- What's he doing here?

751
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:09,676
Yeah, he's here.

752
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:15,583
That's him!

753
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,600
Come on.

754
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,270
Come on.

755
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:01,692
Doesn't seem like your kind of crowd.

756
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:07,769
Not so sure who my
kind of crowd is right now.

757
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:10,403
- Look, just...
- John Smith?

758
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:12,379
I'm such an idiot.

759
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,980
And they're saying that your dad
is some kind of terrorist.

760
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,179
He's not a terrorist.

761
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,187
Tell me the truth.

762
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:24,387
Who are you?

763
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,098
He's upstairs.

764
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,735
All right, guys, out of the way.

765
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,939
You didn't answer my question.

766
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,439
I just came to say goodbye.

767
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,448
- John, wait! What are you... No, John!
- Don't move!

768
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,882
Sarah!

769
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,118
How...

770
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:01,629
- Move! Move!
- Go!

771
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,973
That was awesome!

772
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:22,450
Whoa...

773
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:29,989
What you did is not possible.

774
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,549
Who I am...

775
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,594
...it's all in here.
I took these for you.

776
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:37,393
Wait. Come with me.
Please.

777
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,699
Any idea where they'd be?

778
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,203
I think I know
where she might go.

779
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,684
- Who the hell are they?
- Big-ass linebackers?

780
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:07,188
Holy shit...

781
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,962
No, no, no!

782
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:16,762
Dad!

783
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:33,085
An alcohol-fuelled
young guy like you...

784
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:36,988
...healthy and well-fed.

785
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:40,653
I bet you watch a lot of television,
don't you? Do you? Do you?

786
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,924
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

787
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:45,524
In this situation here,
you're probably thinking,

788
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:48,764
"Maybe I could save the day.
Maybe I could be the hero."

789
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:53,069
But I say... don't do that.

790
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:54,803
OK?

791
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:59,742
Tell me now, where is the boy?

792
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:29,834
These are beautiful.

793
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:45,983
Can you show me?

794
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,188
- No!
- Get in!

795
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:23,887
Let me go! Let me go!

796
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,898
Let go of me!

797
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:39,379
- Hello?
- Where are you?

798
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:40,506
I'm at the high school.

799
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,311
<i>Yeah, you need to get out of there now.</i>

800
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,374
Why? What's happening?

801
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:46,216
Your stunt with the car
is already on YouTube.

802
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:47,686
<i>If they're not right on your ass now,</i>

803
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,451
<i>they will be soon.</i>

804
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,390
Come on.

805
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,587
And don't tell me this is not my fight.

806
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:58,098
My dad probably knew those guys were
coming and that's why they took him.

807
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:01,725
And also, I have your dog.

808
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:03,730
<i>Look, I'm on my way.</i>

809
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:05,262
<i>I'll meet you out front of the school.</i>

810
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,205
<i>You've got to get out now.</i>

811
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:09,368
<i>John?</i>

812
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:10,469
<i>John!</i>

813
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:16,447
Let's go.

814
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:23,252
Let go of me!

815
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,753
Jesus!

816
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:33,598
Sarah! If you're in there, run!

817
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:36,398
Run!

818
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:42,910
Let me go!

819
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,651
Listen to me. I'm not gonna
let them hurt you, OK?

820
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,381
Do you understand me?
Come on.

821
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:11,155
Lt'd be a good idea, cowboy, if you
kept your heroics off the Internet.

822
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:17,733
- Who are you?
- Number Six. Where's your protector?

823
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:21,206
- Dead.
- Yeah. Mine, too.

824
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:22,675
Mogs got her four months ago.

825
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:25,270
- We've been tracking them down.
- Tracking them?

826
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,576
Yeah. Lucky for you, I saved your ass.

827
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:29,879
You should be watching your own ass.

828
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:32,216
Mogs have all the exits covered.

829
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:35,245
Looks like you're gonna
have to fight to get out.

830
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:37,553
- Are you game?
- Yeah.

831
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:40,026
There's a tunnel under the school
that leads to the stadium.

832
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:42,825
Oh, you made friends.
How nice.

833
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:46,196
Let's go.

834
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:50,062
Got any other legacies
I should know about?

835
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:51,696
Stay tuned.

836
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,339
Oh, shit.

837
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:35,214
Oh, shit!

838
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,790
Careful, they'll see us.

839
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,996
And you're going
to need all your energy.

840
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:57,094
- What was that?
- They're comin'.

841
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:59,606
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

842
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:02,132
Whoa! Sam, what are you doing?

843
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,575
Did you see what just
flew out of that truck?

844
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,806
And your dog just shape-shifted
into one of them.

845
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,008
I thought he was gonna eat me.
Here's your rock.

846
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:15,021
Hi! I'm Sam. What's your name?

847
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:17,252
Jane Doe.

848
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,589
That's cool. It's cool.

849
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:19,991
So, are you a number, too?

850
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:23,020
- Who is this tool?
- Sam, focus.

851
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:25,657
What flew out of the truck?

852
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:32,331
Come on! Go, go!

853
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:35,672
Sam. Come on! Go!

854
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,710
Come on! Come on!

855
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:47,151
Come on!

856
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:48,273
Ahh!

857
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:58,255
- Hit me.
- What?

858
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:00,726
With your lumen.
I need to power-up.

859
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,295
Hit me!

860
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:17,107
Red Bull's for pussies.

861
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:21,574
He killed Henri. I want him.

862
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:56,341
Ah!

863
01:30:58,152 --> 01:30:59,551
Four!

864
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:13,859
You're good with your hands.

865
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,903
- Thanks.
- No problem.

866
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:21,705
- My dog, he, uh... he just...
- Yeah, he's a chimera.

867
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:23,903
He came with you from Lorien.

868
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:26,378
Someone had to look after you.

869
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:31,570
You brought a gun?
Are you serious?

870
01:32:31,612 --> 01:32:34,046
- What? It might come in handy.
- This way.

871
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:45,783
Go!

872
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:56,396
- Take her back to the tunnel!
- Got it! Come on!

873
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:05,974
- Holy...!
- Ahh!

874
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,882
I play a lot of Xbox.

875
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:19,216
Oh!

876
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,641
Oh! Ahh!

877
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:55,751
Number Four, I think you
have something I need. Hm?

878
01:34:57,358 --> 01:35:01,727
Oh, thank you for making
this so nice and easy.

879
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:07,029
Think of how quickly we'll finish off
the rest of the planet. It's fantastic!

880
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:10,396
Soon, I'll be done with all of you.

881
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:12,702
Just relax.

882
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:17,874
You can't stop what's coming.
You never could.

883
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:20,005
You have...

884
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,481
...no idea...

885
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:25,151
...what I'm capable of.

886
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:42,699
Ah!

887
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:40,821
John.

888
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:45,793
Fireproof?

889
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:49,333
I told you to stay tuned.

890
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:20,359
All right, give me that.
Come on.

891
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:22,463
Thank you.

892
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:57,493
Oh. Well, that was disappointing.
So, not a tracking device?

893
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,597
No, it was.

894
01:37:59,673 --> 01:38:02,073
- Did you feel that, too?
- Yeah.

895
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:05,305
- We know where we need to go.
- Yeah, we can find the others.

896
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:14,749
- Here.
- Thank you.

897
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,588
I hope this doesn't get you in trouble.

898
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:22,119
Nah. Stuff goes missing from evidence
all the time.

899
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:24,596
My dad won't even know.

900
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:27,533
- You want to be heading west now.
- Why?

901
01:38:27,568 --> 01:38:30,059
Because I told my dad you're going east.

902
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:41,880
- Six, Sam's coming with us.
- What?

903
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:44,746
- No way.
- He's one of us now.

904
01:38:44,785 --> 01:38:47,015
We need to find his father.

905
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:54,025
You slow us down,
I'll shoot you myself.

906
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:56,562
And I believe you.
Could we go now?

907
01:39:02,536 --> 01:39:04,663
You know, I wouldn't leave
if it wasn't, uh...

908
01:39:04,738 --> 01:39:07,502
- Safer.
- Yeah.

909
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,132
I know.

910
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,812
Really sorry about
what happened with Henri.

911
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:15,844
Me, too.

912
01:39:19,219 --> 01:39:21,710
You know I'll find you again.

913
01:39:24,024 --> 01:39:27,016
Probably still be here.

914
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:29,820
It's the people that make the place.

915
01:39:30,597 --> 01:39:32,929
- Right?
- Yeah.

916
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:43,141
Henri warned me that
we only fall for one person.

917
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:46,813
Ever?

918
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:49,081
Ever.

919
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:24,776
<i>This is the first town</i>
<i>I've left without Henri.</i>

920
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:29,170
<i>But it's also the first one</i>
<i>I have a reason to come back to.</i>

921
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:34,043
<i>Henri was right,</i>
<i>we're stronger together.</i>

922
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:37,182
<i>So we will find the others.</i>

923
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:44,056
<i>My planet is called Lorien,</i>
<i>but Earth is my home now.</i>

924
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:48,796
<i>It's as good a place</i>
<i>as any in the universe.</i>

925
01:41:48,836 --> 01:41:51,270
<i>And that's how it's going to stay.</i>
