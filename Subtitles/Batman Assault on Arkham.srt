00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,279
<i>Riddle me this: When is</i>
<i>a door not a door?</i>

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,519
<i>It feels like drowning, doesn't it?</i>

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,879
<i>When the answer is at the edge of your</i>
<i>cortex, but you can't seem to grasp it.</i>

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,759
<i>You're trying my patience.</i>

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,159
<i>The answer?</i>

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,959
When it's ajar.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,764
Here's an easy one. What runs
around a city but never moves?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,926
No? A wall.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,963
<i>What do you want, Nigma?</i>

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,439
I'm in charge, so I'll
ask the questions.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,999
Try to keep up, won't you?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,039
Riddle me this: What belongs to you
but others use it more than you do?

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,359
<i>Your name.</i>

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,919
Huh?

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,719
- You've heard that one.
- No.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,886
I have Google like the
rest of the world.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,759
<i>Why do you talk to</i>
<i>me like this, Waller?</i>

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,519
Simple. I needed to keep you babbling
long enough to pinpoint your position.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,002
My... what?

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,726
Hands in the air where
we can see them.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,559
<i>Take him out.</i>

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,803
Make it hurt.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,519
Riddle me this: Why didn't
I quit when I was ahead?

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,885
What is it? Report.

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
The Riddler is mine.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,768
Switch to night vision.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,008
Secure the perimeter.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,719
Holy crap, it's Batman.

30
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,891
Unh.

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,439
I know you helped him, Nigma.

32
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,605
Tell me where it is.

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,079
I'm invoking priority
level ultraviolet.

34
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,919
Assemble Task Force X.

35
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,051
We have another suicide mission.

36
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,241
Ugh.

37
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,279
Strewth, I got the hangover,
but I don't recall the party.

38
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,079
Aah, crap, not this again.

39
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,479
You too?

40
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,919
It's like a bloody
recurring nightmare.

41
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,519
Looks like we got rookies.

42
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,239
Who are you people?

43
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,319
And why am I in uniform?

44
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,359
No bars, no chains.

45
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,079
Time for meat.

46
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,439
You try it, fish-fingers, and I'll
show you the meaning of cold-blooded.

47
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,399
You're feisty.

48
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,399
Everybody, shut up.

49
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,199
I've been here before.

50
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,679
Ah!

51
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,159
I am leaving.

52
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,483
Stop.

53
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,765
Sit down.

54
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,199
I'm Amanda Waller.

55
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,679
I'm here to indoctrinate you
convicts into our special forces.

56
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,889
Pass.

57
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,159
I killed to keep degenerates
off the streets.

58
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,159
I won't work alongside them.

59
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,439
Fresh air and time off my sentence?

60
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,199
Feel free to keep
calling me up, love.

61
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,999
Task Force X is an off-the-books
government strike team...

62
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,759
made up of convicts with
no hope for release...

63
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,802
serving as expendable agents
for impossible missions.

64
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,279
Succeed and I'll shave
time off your sentences.

65
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,966
If we don't?

66
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,559
You'll be dead.

67
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,159
Any other stupid questions?

68
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,359
Yeah, what's in my neck? A tracker?

69
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,319
Yes. And a powerful
nanotech explosive.

70
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,599
Run away, get yourself
captured, disobey an order...

71
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,406
hell, give me a right answer too slowly,
and I'll blow your head clean off.

72
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,483
You lie.

73
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,325
You would not take all of
this trouble just to kill us.

74
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,927
Try me.

75
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,922
Anyone else?

76
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,127
I didn't think so.

77
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,401
What's so dangerous this time that
you had to send in the newbies?

78
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,799
You're going to break
into Arkham Asylum.

79
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,639
- That's insane.
- Don't want much?

80
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
- Screw that.
- I don't do freaky-deakies.

81
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,759
Yahtzee!

82
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,924
How do we start?

83
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,799
Oh. I like you, cowboy.

84
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,119
You're loco and me likey
your loco-motion.

85
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,839
- Aah!
- What's the plan?

86
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,119
A week ago, while in my employ,
a lowlife calling himself the Riddler...

87
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,999
managed to gain access
to my computer system.

88
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,439
He downloaded a file containing
the identities and histories...

89
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,079
of every current, past and potential
member of the suicide squad.

90
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,919
Including ours.

91
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,119
That's right.

92
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,239
He's threatening to release
them all on the Internet.

93
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,679
You're going to get it back.

94
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,719
Riddler's got one copy and it's
on a thumb drive in his cane...

95
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,319
which is currently locked away
in the Arkham property room.

96
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,199
In the intensive treatment building, right
under the solitary confinement cells.

97
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,639
Good times.

98
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,159
So we get someone inside.

99
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,087
Is it me? Can it be me? Dibs!

100
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,039
She's a wild card.

101
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,599
Harley Quinn has an
encyclopedic knowledge...

102
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,039
of Arkham's layout
and its logistics.

103
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,319
She gonna be okay that
close to the Joker?

104
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,999
I'm fine. We're done.

105
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,679
He's a jerk.

106
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,809
Whatever.

107
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,321
Well, I'm convinced.

108
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,599
You'll be snuck into Gotham.

109
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,482
You'll rendezvous with a power broker
who will set you up for the break-in.

110
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,479
This is as off-the-grid as it gets, so
let's keep the body count to a minimum.

111
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,962
Deadshot, rubber bullets only.

112
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,643
What about The Bat?

113
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,719
He has his hands full
on another case.

114
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,489
In fact, we work it right, we might
be able to take advantage of him.

115
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,639
Waller.

116
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,041
What, Lawton?

117
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,719
Play fair and I'll shoot straight.

118
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,090
Jerk me around and I'll kill you.

119
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,482
Be a good convict, Lawton.

120
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,919
Don't make me blow you up.

121
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,679
I'm clear.

122
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,959
Gas them.

123
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,930
What them?

124
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,884
Huh.

125
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,159
I'm getting tired of this trick.

126
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,919
You and me both, cowboy.

127
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,839
Maybe when we get into Gotham,
I can show you around.

128
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,919
I know some tight places.

129
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,799
- Not interested.
- Hmph.

130
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,239
I told you, Harley.

131
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,279
If you're giving it out,
heave a chunk my way, eh?

132
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,199
Ah. You wish.

133
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,679
Shake your boomer-wang
at the shark guy.

134
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,243
- Dc it, and I'll bite it off.
- Ha, ha.

135
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,446
Come on, Harl. For old time's sake?

136
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,119
Are we gonna have a
problem this time around?

137
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,799
I think we might, mate.

138
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,719
No.

139
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

140
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,719
I don't trust vermin.

141
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,399
Honorless, rudderless,
undisciplined.

142
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,719
They'll never find your body.

143
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,044
Oh, ninjas are awesome.

144
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,211
You think that means we're there?

145
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,639
I hate heights!

146
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,439
Whoo!

147
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,759
We're not gonna make it.

148
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,039
Waller, please!

149
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,599
<i>Remember this feeling, convicts.</i>
<i>I hold your lives in my hands.</i>

150
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,679
You crazy bitch.

151
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,119
Open the damn chutes.

152
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,851
Do it. Now!

153
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,961
Unh. Aah!

154
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,759
Good one.

155
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,924
Good shark.

156
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,405
Gross.

157
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,730
Where's Harley?

158
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,681
Don't worry, I fell on my head.

159
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,969
Great. How do we get to
the rendezvous unseen?

160
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,999
A few more miles.

161
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,999
Keep moving then.

162
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,399
Aah! This is flipping bonkers.

163
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,959
Sloshing through sewage so a guy
dressed like a bat won't spot us?

164
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,445
You wanna head topside,
slick, be my guest.

165
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,049
No, we're practically there.

166
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,764
Yeah, that's what I thought.

167
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,565
Cobblepot.

168
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,359
We're closed. Private party.

169
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,519
Yeah, we're the private party.

170
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,479
This way. He's waiting on you.

171
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,479
Your guests have
arrived, Mr. Cobblepot.

172
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,530
Right, right. Come in.

173
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,199
Welcome to the Iceberg Lounge.

174
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,126
I'm just finishing my supper.

175
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,523
Pardon me, Mr. Cobblepot.

176
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,079
Lawton? Oh, I never pegged
Deadshot for a team player.

177
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,006
Oh, things are tough all over, sir.

178
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,044
That's a good one. Ha, ha.

179
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,439
This man is the best
assassin I've ever seen.

180
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,159
And I only work with the best.

181
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,279
I aim to please, Mr. Cobblepot.

182
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,839
I was told you can
get us into Arkham?

183
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,279
I can indeed.

184
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,519
I've made arrangements to sneak
you into the crazy farm.

185
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,799
Follow them to...

186
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,119
You.

187
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,285
Clown!

188
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,079
You're not still mad about
that truck, are you, Pengy?

189
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,439
Wah-wah.

190
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,279
It feels like you are.

191
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,959
You cost me money, funny girl.

192
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,709
Her and her looney boyfriend
nicked my truck of cigarettes

193
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:09,325
and drove it into the river.
Just for a laugh.

194
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,879
Does it matter that Mr. J and
I aren't together anymore?

195
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,319
Nobody steals from
me and walks away.

196
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,290
It's bad business, love.

197
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,519
You're right, you should kill her.

198
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,279
Hell, I'll kill her for you.

199
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,119
Aw, come on.

200
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,887
Except you know what else
is bad for business, sir?

201
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,319
Double-crossing your clients.

202
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,891
And I would hate for folks to say
Mr. Cobblepot takes your money

203
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,573
and kills your operatives.

204
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,441
Get her out of my sight, Lawton.

205
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,879
There's your files.

206
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,318
Memorize the contents.

207
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,679
You can grab some shuteye
in the rooms above.

208
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,439
You deploy tomorrow night
under the cover of darkness...

209
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,519
and then I never want to see
any of you on my turf again.

210
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,924
Now get the hell out of here.

211
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,719
Ever the charmer, ain't you?

212
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,610
Bite me, Boomer.

213
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,081
Ah. Oi, Lawton.

214
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,999
Nice shave, mate.

215
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,839
We got off on the wrong foot
at the start of this mission.

216
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,730
Hoist a pint with us.

217
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,919
Can't. It's a school night.

218
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,159
Ehh, suit yourself.

219
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,483
How about a friendly
game of darts, then?

220
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,051
Lucky shot.

221
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,679
Right. Let's see you do it.

222
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,923
Yeah! Come on!

223
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,639
Sorry, mate.

224
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,008
Looks like that one
took a bad bounce.

225
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,811
Oh!

226
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,208
Let's call it even, mate.

227
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,759
<i>Louise? It's Amanda.</i>

228
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,319
<i>I have a special</i>
<i>assignment for you.</i>

229
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,679
<i>Something I'd rather keep</i>
<i>between the two of us.</i>

230
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,525
I'm listening.

231
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,399
Welcome back.

232
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,723
- Did you miss me?
- What do you want?

233
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,881
I got an itch I thought you
could help me scratch, cowboy.

234
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,919
Wow!

235
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,846
Oh. Good start.

236
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,720
Ah, what the hell.

237
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,049
Yahtzee!

238
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,639
Here's my stop.

239
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,486
Wish me luck, cowboy.

240
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,571
There's gotta be one
here somewhere.

241
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,799
You know where he
put it, don't you?

242
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,359
Uh-oh.

243
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,171
Where is it, Harley?

244
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,279
No idea what you're talking about.

245
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,119
Answers.

246
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,726
- Now.
- Ugh!

247
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,644
Back off, Bats.

248
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,004
<i>Where is it?</i>

249
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,359
What's he talking about?

250
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,759
Who knows what these wankers
get worked up about.

251
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,079
<i>I don't know. I swear.</i>

252
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,719
I'm not firing blind
against The Bat.

253
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,279
Waller, what the devil's going on?

254
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,959
<i>You don't get to call me up</i>
<i>and demand answers, Deadshot.</i>

255
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,169
What are they talking about?

256
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,799
<i>Joker stole a dirty bomb and</i>
<i>hid it somewhere in Gotham.</i>

257
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,959
<i>Apparently it's large enough that the</i>
<i>radiation would kill half the population.</i>

258
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,799
<i>Batman's torn the city</i>
<i>apart trying to find it.</i>

259
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,806
<i>At one point he thought</i>
<i>Riddler might know.</i>

260
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,959
The Joker has a dirty bomb?

261
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,647
That gives me the chills.

262
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,009
Ice puns? Really?

263
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,639
Waller, this is crap.

264
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,443
<i>I don't care, convict, do your job.</i>

265
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,162
Honestly, B-man, I don't know
where Mr. J puts half of his stuff.

266
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,445
I just wanted a Chatty Boo-Boo doll
before they went on sale tomorrow.

267
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,241
Get her back to Arkham.

268
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,159
Will do, Batman.

269
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,040
Get in there, you nutty broad.

270
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,484
Mwah.

271
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,803
I'm in the middle of lunch, now I
gotta process this dizzy dame?

272
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,087
Crazy, huh?

273
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,964
Why don't I just toss her in
her old cell and come back?

274
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,512
Yeah, right.

275
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:47,479
I got, like, half a dozen new forms to
fill out before you can even come in.

276
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,491
We've got 10 minutes
to plant the device.

277
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,530
Where should I dump her?

278
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,527
Put it through the x-ray machine.

279
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,559
Heh. Don't get much
deader than that.

280
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,689
This one's cold as ice.

281
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,684
Hey, buddy, I got nothing in the
system about accepting a new body.

282
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,562
Yeah. Ha, ha.

283
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
It says, uh, "Not found."

284
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,209
I came from inside. Run it again.

285
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,399
No, somethings wrong.

286
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,121
I'm gonna have to get security.

287
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,599
The junction box is up
ahead so move your ass.

288
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,799
- Harley?
- Huh!

289
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,965
Is it really you?

290
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,079
Shit.

291
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,050
Don't screw this up.

292
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,279
Aren't you even going
to say hello? Heh, heh.

293
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,519
Aw, guys, you gotta see this.
Joker just spotted Harley.

294
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,079
Keep walking.

295
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,799
Tell him to shut up.

296
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,759
Aw, I can tell you're still sore.

297
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,359
At least the bruises
cleared up nicely.

298
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,882
What's your hurry, Harl?

299
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,439
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

300
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,319
Damn it.

301
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,563
Let's move.

302
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,439
Maybe she'll kill him.

303
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,683
I hate you, you bastard!

304
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,679
I'll kill him!

305
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,880
I'll kill him myself for
what he's done to me.

306
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,069
Women. Am I right, officer?

307
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:32,646
Can't live with them, can't
kick them out of a moving car.

308
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,559
You know the rules, buddy.
I gotta phone it in.

309
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,610
She's dead.

310
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,159
How much trouble could she be?

311
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,719
Nothing goes in or out of
Arkham without being OK'd.

312
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,809
But give me a sec, I'll try to get
ahold of the watch commander.

313
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,919
- Run it again.
- I've tried twice, sir.

314
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,721
I can't lose this job because
your system is down.

315
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,479
Come on, you amateurs.

316
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,527
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Sorry,
hon. Bulletproof.

317
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,919
Even better.

318
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,924
Pudding.

319
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,519
Why, Harley, if I didn't know better,
I'd say you're trying to kill me.

320
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,684
We're finished, you and me.

321
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,079
I got someone new
now. Someone better.

322
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,919
Oh, hell. This'll have to do.

323
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,079
Never mind. Just came through.

324
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,448
About time.

325
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,319
Sorry, it's an old system.

326
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,563
No problem.

327
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,282
Let's see what goodies we've got.

328
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,201
Oh, shit!

329
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,329
How...? Oh!

330
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,799
Aah! Me goalies.

331
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,124
- That's payback, you dumb-ass.
- Unh.

332
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,479
Walk it off, Captain Kangaroo.

333
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,439
Come on, we're out of time.

334
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,919
- New guy?
- That's right.

335
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,051
You're not jealous, are you?

336
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,405
That's him.

337
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,679
I know you.

338
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,639
We worked together once.

339
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,611
No, wait, don't tell me,
don't tell me. Hmm...

340
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,759
Deadhead, hmm?

341
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,119
Buckshot? Ha, ha!

342
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,479
Hmph. Aah!

343
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,450
I got her.

344
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,719
You can have her.

345
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,039
Bet you buy your shirts
second-hand too. Ha!

346
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,562
Sir, we've got an
explosion on Level E.

347
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,599
He's still secure, sir.

348
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,279
Is that room service?

349
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,159
Tell them I never got my calzone.

350
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,079
Good. I need every available
security down in the kitchen, stat.

351
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,039
We're on yellow alert.

352
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,569
- You're late.
- Ran into her ex. Grab hold.

353
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,401
Put your back into it.

354
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,559
Hey. Nobody's supposed
to be down there.

355
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,919
We just snuck down
here for a little party.

356
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,199
What kind of party?

357
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,599
Crap, you're Harley Quinn!

358
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,439
Don't move, you crazy bit...

359
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,169
I hate Italian food.

360
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,359
Has that kitchen
fire been contained?

361
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,679
Yes, sir.

362
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,484
<i>- Lawton.</i>
- What?

363
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,479
<i>GPS has you in the</i>
<i>main security hub.</i>

364
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,079
<i>What's going on?</i>

365
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,559
We own it, that's what.

366
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,879
Now we grab the cane.

367
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,519
<i>Don't get too cocky, Lawton.</i>

368
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,919
<i>You're at the point of no return.</i>
<i>You best keep that in mind.</i>

369
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,079
That gas explosion put the whole
bloody asylum on yellow alert.

370
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,439
If the security cameras
make us, we're toast.

371
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,999
So shut down all the security cams.

372
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,639
That's a surefire way
to alert The Bat.

373
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,999
What then? Let him watch
us run around like idiots?

374
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,131
Play yesterday's footage.

375
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,119
Aw. Shark Week had
his first thought.

376
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,329
Shut it, Boomer. Say it again.

377
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,639
Play yesterday's footage
at the same time.

378
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,199
I can do that.

379
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,159
And we can operate
without eyes on us.

380
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,281
- You mean Batman's or Waller's?
- Both.

381
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,639
The intensive treatment building
is there, just across the yard.

382
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,919
Let's move.

383
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,607
Low profile.

384
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,290
Frost. Move your ass.

385
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,479
Top priority are those towers.

386
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,999
I can scale them.

387
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,686
No time.

388
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,279
You do two, I'll do two.

389
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,127
Fine. On my mark. Now.

390
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,328
- You missed.
- Wait for it.

391
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,841
Patrol, I need a sweep
of the yard. Ugh!

392
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,599
Boom! In your face.

393
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,679
He got to his walkie. I'd score
that a miss. You two-bit C-lister.

394
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,844
That's it!

395
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,479
U.S.A!

396
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,370
U.S.A!

397
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,531
Boys, we got company.

398
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,642
- Shark, no.
- Finally, some action.

399
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,399
So much for low profile.

400
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,299
Status report. I've got
you in the exercise yard,

401
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:09,567
but you don't show
up on the cameras.

402
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,999
Must be something wrong
with the system.

403
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,079
Damn it. We're a
little busy right now.

404
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,999
I'll call you back.

405
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,529
Don't yank me around, convict.
Get the cane. Get out.

406
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,247
Yahtzee.

407
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,159
Victor Zsasz, we got
you surrounded.

408
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,879
Please. Please don't hurt me.

409
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,359
Let the girl go
before it gets ugly.

410
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,719
The Zombie's mine to liberate.

411
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,929
I have righteous work to do.

412
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,449
I'm not in the mood tonight, Zsasz.

413
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,159
<i>You seem troubled tonight, sir.</i>

414
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,159
It's Harley, Alfred.

415
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,679
She was acting odd.

416
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,519
<i>Odder than usual, you mean?</i>

417
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,359
Like she was happy to get caught.

418
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,599
<i>Maybe she missed her, uh, pudding.</i>

419
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,839
Maybe.

420
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,919
More likely it's linked
to the Joker's bomb.

421
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,005
Arkham had a yellow
alert this evening.

422
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,046
<i>Everything looks to be in place.</i>

423
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,479
Hmm.

424
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,559
That's Moshell. He
doesn't work Fridays.

425
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,238
Neither does Ferrick.
That's the Thursday crew.

426
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:52,159
This isn't live. They're
broadcasting old footage.

427
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,528
Somethings wrong at Arkham.

428
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,922
No, no.

429
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,519
Enough, Shark! Put him down!

430
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,203
Ouch!

431
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,279
Do I have your attention now?

432
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,287
Don't break cover in the middle
of an operation unless I say so.

433
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,719
Don't ever do that to me.

434
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,805
Or what? You'll chew my head off?

435
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,399
Do it. I'm begging you.

436
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,725
You think any of you have a shot
of getting out alive without me?

437
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,359
That's what I thought.

438
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,439
We're just lucky
this was contained.

439
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,879
Start following orders, all of you.

440
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,999
Why don't you just
calm down, pudding?

441
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,166
Don't call me pudding!

442
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,279
Property room's here.

443
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,767
- Locked.
- Not for long.

444
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,444
Now that's just pathetic.

445
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,439
The warden uses his birthday backwards
for practically all of his passwords.

446
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,919
- How do you know that?
- I used to work here.

447
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,919
Didn't I mention that?

448
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,599
Come on. As what?

449
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,319
As a psychiatrist, silly.

450
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,282
And pal, anyone who throws boomerangs
has some real issues letting go.

451
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,368
<i>Et voilà.</i>

452
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,442
Where do we even begin?

453
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,966
Everyone take a section.
Just start looking.

454
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,045
Bloody hell.

455
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,159
My acid playing cards.

456
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,919
I knew I left them here.

457
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,611
Here's that Batman costume
Mr. J used for the train heist.

458
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,399
Aw.

459
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,804
I've been looking
all over for this.

460
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,402
Here's where it went.

461
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,765
Bingo.

462
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,839
Firefly.

463
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,079
Killer Moth.

464
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,599
Maxie Zeus.

465
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,399
Never heard of any of these tools.

466
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,279
Mr. Freeze's gun.

467
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,011
Score.

468
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,405
Ugh.

469
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,759
Thanks.

470
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,487
It's Batman.

471
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,090
Huh?

472
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,049
No way.

473
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,119
The spoils of war.

474
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,559
Black Spider just
kicked The Bat's ass?

475
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,439
Mate, I'm a little choked up.

476
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,842
Got the thumb drive.

477
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,847
What?

478
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,168
What the hell?

479
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,162
We've been played.

480
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,399
Where's Frosty?

481
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,079
Frost? Damn it.

482
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,130
Frost!

483
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,239
Easy.

484
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,649
I knew Waller would send someone.

485
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,399
I'm too clever for
her to let me live.

486
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,690
Nothing gets past you, genius.

487
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,250
I'll make this fast.

488
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,919
Do you even know why
you're assassinating me?

489
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,039
The Wall says you screwed her and
to make an example out of you.

490
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,649
And that satiated your curiosity?

491
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,879
I don't ask questions.

492
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,439
I don't believe that.

493
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,119
The human mind always
has questions.

494
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,719
My only question is why Waller didn't just
blow your head off with your nano bomb.

495
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,159
It's the same reason
she needs me dead.

496
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,884
Because I know how to diffuse them.

497
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,719
Wait, what?

498
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,759
How do you know she's
with the Riddler?

499
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,128
She was eyeballing him
at the monitor room.

500
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,639
So she's got herself a new guy.

501
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,959
After everything I've done for her.

502
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,959
Ooh, we'll see about that.

503
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,319
I'll make five more just like her.

504
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,959
I'll take her skin and
put someone else in it.

505
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,119
Oh, that perfect creamy skin.

506
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,999
Pull yourself together, man!

507
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,119
She mocked you right to your face!

508
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,046
Even dared to call you...

509
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,839
pudding.

510
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,279
Oh, that darling girl!

511
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,125
She might even deserve me.

512
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,719
Okay, babies, let's cook.

513
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,363
Winner, winner, chicken
dinner. Ha-ha-ha.

514
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,319
Oh, Harley, I take back half the
horrible things I've done to you.

515
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,679
They're gone!

516
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,199
Yeah, we can see that,
Harley, but where?

517
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,519
It's Waller.

518
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,919
<i>- I'm here.</i>
- What are you trying to pull, Deadshot?

519
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,199
- You're not checking in.
- We had a bout with The Bat.

520
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,799
But we're past it.
I got your cane, Waller.

521
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,519
We're just looking for an exit.

522
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,279
So you're all together?

523
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,759
Of course. Why wouldn't we be?

524
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,719
Then why has the Special Crimes unit been
called in to protect the medical center?

525
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,999
<i>Maybe Two-Face got a</i>
<i>pair of hemorrhoids.</i>

526
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,399
We're out of here.

527
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,679
Please don't explode. Please don't
explode. Please don't explode.

528
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,199
Shut up. Where's
that medical center?

529
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,443
We're still on yellow alert.

530
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,766
You hear something?

531
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,089
Let me check.

532
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,159
Hey, remember that time
when Mad Hatter...

533
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,519
Smitty?

534
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,919
- Smitty?
- Boo.

535
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,890
Aah!

536
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,519
Smitty!

537
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,321
Put your hands in the air!

538
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,847
- Aah!
- And boom.

539
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,919
I'm just going to slip into
something more comfortable.

540
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,324
So no peeking.

541
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,559
This is the Special Crimes unit.

542
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,042
Surrender and return to your cells.

543
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,169
Light them up!

544
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,839
That worked well.

545
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,159
Then like the hanged man, we
are at the end of our rope.

546
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,211
Wow, I hate you. Unh!

547
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,082
You can thank us later, losers.

548
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,279
- You all right?
- Somewhat.

549
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,919
Glad you made it.

550
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,119
This better be good.

551
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,279
He knows how to turn off the bombs.

552
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,359
Look familiar?

553
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,119
I can do it, but you've got to
get me into the medical center.

554
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,967
We got maybe five minutes before
Waller figures out what's what.

555
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,559
We get to that room or we're dead.

556
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,199
Should've brought a tank.

557
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,840
We have one.

558
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,959
No heights.

559
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,759
- You're joking.
- I said, no heights!

560
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,970
I'll guide you. Trust me.

561
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,006
I'm crazy, but that's just nuts!

562
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,001
Step on it.

563
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,121
Go to the right.

564
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,564
Let's move.

565
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,689
Did we win?

566
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,564
Let's see now. We'll need
this on. This for back-up.

567
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,409
Grab a chair.

568
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,319
Whee!

569
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,961
How do you diffuse
this bomb, exactly?

570
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,719
It's the electroshock.

571
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,639
It's the what now?

572
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,408
I'm gonna run 1000 volts through
your heads and fry your bombs.

573
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,123
Oh.

574
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,599
Good. Put the chairs in a
circle here around Old Sparky.

575
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:40,599
Oh, I love electroshock! It's a
shiatsu massage for your brain.

576
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,490
Lose those.

577
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,889
I'll keep a lookout.

578
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,771
More cops. Choppers too.

579
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,319
This'll work?

580
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,371
Or give you a grand mal seizure.

581
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,719
I'm clamping you to the chairs
because you're going to wiggle.

582
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,039
I don't trust this fruit loop.

583
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,919
Hmm. A thousand
volts, five bodies...

584
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,799
multiply by five, allowing for
absorption, three-second pulses...

585
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,009
You know what you're doing, right?

586
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,959
Damn it. Don't stop
working. Yeah, Waller?

587
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,639
I am getting reports there's
a break-in at Arkham.

588
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,119
- You're on red alert.
<i>- News to me.</i>

589
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,759
What part of "off the books"
do you not understand?

590
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,359
<i>Are you in the medical center?</i>

591
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,171
We hit a snag.

592
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,089
Batman again?

593
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,447
Spider needed medical attention.

594
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,999
Spider? But he's...

595
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,165
No excuses, Lawton! You get that?

596
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,563
Mm... Uh-huh.

597
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,199
No more crap! No more time!
No more shenanigans!

598
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,519
Uh-huh.

599
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,039
Those scumbags are
trying to screw me.

600
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,085
I never need to do that again.

601
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,359
Are you kidding? I feel great!

602
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,239
Nobody screws the Wall!

603
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,839
- Uh, guys?
- Do it again.

604
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,925
I don't know. Maybe his
skin is too thick?

605
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,561
Best gun ever.

606
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,719
Why'd his head explode?

607
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,039
Because the bomb in his neck
didn't diffuse, you asshole.

608
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,965
So what's his excuse?

609
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,810
Oh, that's rich.

610
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,205
Huh?

611
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,959
Denzel! What have they done to you?

612
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,839
Haven't you solved it yet?

613
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,325
The Black Spider is Batman.

614
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,599
I know that sound.

615
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,970
Someone's flossing their brain.

616
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,519
- Unh.
- Talk! Why are you here?

617
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,685
Amanda Waller wanted
the Riddler dead.

618
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,919
Waller? What's she got...?

619
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,679
I'm here, bitches!

620
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,845
And I brought favors for everybody!

621
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,921
Whoop!

622
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,403
Yahtzee!

623
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,599
I think this was yours, Deadhead.

624
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,445
Finders, keepers.

625
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,719
Pudding! You're free.

626
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,119
Don't you pudding me.

627
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:33,359
I go away and suddenly you've got
new friends. Even picked a new guy.

628
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,479
You got it all wrong, baby.

629
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,239
I was using them to
help you escape.

630
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,759
Who else would I break
into Arkham for?

631
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,561
Nobody, that's who.

632
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,999
It'll be just like old times.

633
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,129
Oh.

634
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,410
Hmm.

635
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:08,763
You. New guy. I don't like
people touching my stuff.

636
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,279
- Go ahead. You're out of bullets.
- I am not.

637
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,799
You are. You're gonna pull the
trigger, and when nothing happens...

638
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,679
I'm gonna punch you in the
throat and bash your brains out.

639
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,844
Three.

640
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,810
Two.

641
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,079
- One.
- Hold on.

642
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,962
Stop counting for a second.
I know there are bullets.

643
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,919
See?

644
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,289
Mate, you just
out-crazied the Joker.

645
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,439
This place is crawling with cops.

646
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,287
- I'm gonna kill Waller.
- Can we get out of here first?

647
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,727
Mallet.

648
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,599
It's right here, Mr. J.

649
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,399
I was keeping it safe
for you the whole...

650
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,321
It's time for a very big bang.

651
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,639
Why the hell are we running?

652
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,119
We're sitting ducks here.

653
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,279
And whose fault is that,
do you suppose, leader?

654
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,279
I've been carrying this team
all night, you douche bag.

655
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,679
- Uh, fellas?
- Really?

656
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,079
- Is that what you'd call it, eh?
- Guys.

657
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,359
- Guys, listen.
- That's what I'd call it...

658
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,519
- you one-gimmick hack.
- Great, let's split up.

659
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,129
- I'm better off on my own.
- Guys. Batman's here.

660
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,159
Joker. Where did he go?

661
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,767
Don't owe you squat, Bats.

662
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,199
Lawton? We can settle
our business later.

663
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,648
Now, where's the Joker?

664
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,402
He and Harley took their
mallet and disappeared.

665
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,919
That's where he's hidden the bomb.

666
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,559
<i>Sibilance, testing. Sibilance.</i>

667
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,399
<i>I know you can see me, Bats.</i>

668
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,159
<i>Hope you brought protection because</i>
<i>I'm about to give Gotham...</i>

669
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,599
<i>a terminal case of tainted love...</i>

670
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,439
<i>and it's really gonna burn.</i>

671
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,199
<i>And just in case you were</i>
<i>thinking of stopping me...</i>

672
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,719
<i>I figured I'd invite some</i>
<i>friends to my big blow-out.</i>

673
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,599
Stop.

674
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,126
Please?

675
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,439
I need to find Joker
and stop that bomb.

676
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,642
Good luck with that, mate.

677
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,279
Gotta get out of here.

678
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,241
Yeah, but what'll get us far
enough to escape that blast?

679
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,448
Well, isn't that convenient?

680
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,361
Out of my way, loser.

681
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,969
Mm.

682
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,919
Mm.

683
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,240
Oh, no, you don't, Lawton.
That's my ride.

684
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,366
Aah!

685
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:56,083
Only one of us is getting out
of here and it ain't you.

686
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,563
I'll get you for this, Lawton!

687
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,159
Get those gates closed.

688
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,726
Where's our backup?

689
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,128
Now that's what I call backup.

690
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,246
We've got it under control,
Batman. You can take...

691
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,239
And I'm talking to myself.

692
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,971
Again.

693
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,408
Going my way, handsome?

694
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,681
Cute kid.

695
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,284
Hope she doesn't take
being an orphan too hard.

696
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,041
Holy crap!

697
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,162
You know she's gonna
kill us, right?

698
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,883
Where's the fricking gas pedal?

699
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,199
Uh-oh. Ha!

700
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,638
Sure. He smacks me
around sometimes...

701
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,919
but you're the one who's
always hurting me.

702
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,288
Now I'm gonna hurt you.

703
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,962
Stop me if you've heard this one.

704
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,169
Listen to me.

705
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,319
Harley, the bomb.

706
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,639
For someone who's not Batman...

707
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,443
you've been a real pain
in my ass. Ha-ha-ha.

708
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,000
Deuces, new guy.

709
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,201
- Have a seat, pudding.
- Aah!

710
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,767
Bang!

711
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,410
Waller.

712
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:27,399
You knew when you sent your little suicide
squad into Arkham, they'd go off script.

713
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,679
Oh, it's just you.

714
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,926
When your bombs didn't ice them,
you figured the S.C.U. would.

715
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,279
All that, just so you
could kill the Riddler.

716
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,799
Let's just say I break a lot
of eggs to make an omelet.

717
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,199
And because you're a messy cook,
the Riddler was able to escape.

718
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,519
I got careless.

719
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,879
- My men will get Nigma next time.
- There is no next time.

720
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,839
No? We're the U.S. government.

721
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,199
Who's going to blow the whistle on us?
The convicts? Who'd believe them?

722
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,839
You? Heh.

723
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,839
You going to start a blog and
expose us? I don't think so.

724
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,449
That's checkmate, Batman.

725
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,319
I'm warning you.

726
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,479
Enough.

727
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:21,279
Don't they need you back
in your squalid little city?

728
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,242
They never did find the
Joker's body, did they?

729
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,770
Punk.

730
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,124
Motherfu...

731
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,169
Bang.

732
01:12:53,305 --> 01:13:53,575
