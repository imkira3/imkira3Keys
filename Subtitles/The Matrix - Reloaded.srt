1
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:29,383
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:49,736
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:13,886
I'm in.

4
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,792
We're almost there.

5
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,921
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:15,007
I understand, sir. It's just that...

7
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:18,552
...I'm scoping some serious
sentinel activity up here.

8
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:59,134
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

9
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:02,429
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

10
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:05,265
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

11
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:09,436
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

12
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,438
What's that, sir?

13
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:13,482
To trust me.

14
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,609
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

15
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:20,823
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

16
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:24,368
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

17
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:25,619
Yes, sir.

18
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:36,713
Still can't sleep?

19
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:40,050
You wanna talk?

20
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:44,763
They're just dreams.

21
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,476
If you're afraid of something...

22
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:51,478
I just wish...

23
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,398
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

24
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:56,400
That's all.

25
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:58,902
I just wish I knew.

26
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,323
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

27
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,533
Here you are.

28
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,162
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

29
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:12,958
<i>These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.</i>

30
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,377
The machines are digging.

31
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,339
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

32
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:22,092
- Mother-
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

33
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,761
How fast are they moving?

34
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:27,306
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

35
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:29,933
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

36
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,645
<i>- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.</i>

37
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,731
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

38
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:38,358
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

39
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,027
- That's right.
- That can't be.

40
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:41,862
Why not?

41
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:45,783
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

42
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:50,704
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

43
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:53,040
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

44
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,708
Niobe.

45
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:59,463
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

46
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,425
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

47
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:06,345
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

48
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:10,307
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

49
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:11,600
What are we gonna do?

50
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,061
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

51
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,980
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

52
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:22,277
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

53
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:25,114
A strategy is still being formulated.

54
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,949
I'm sure it is.

55
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:43,966
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

56
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:46,301
- We should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

57
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,511
I don't know.

58
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:50,472
...however, I must ask one of you
for help.

59
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,353
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

60
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,064
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

61
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,485
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

62
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:06,989
...the Oracle must be consulted.

63
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:17,166
If we return and recharge now...

64
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:21,086
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

65
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:23,130
Do you understand what you're asking?

66
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:26,133
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

67
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,011
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

68
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:32,306
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

69
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:37,019
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

70
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:39,813
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

71
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,899
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

72
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:44,485
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

73
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:45,861
He won't.

74
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:50,199
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

75
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:53,660
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

76
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:55,370
You got 36 hours.

77
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm looking for Neo.

78
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,545
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

79
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:06,965
A gift.

80
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:10,052
You see, he set me free.

81
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:14,723
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

82
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:18,310
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?

83
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:19,937
He gave you this.

84
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,111
He said you set him free.

85
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,406
Is everything all right, sir?

86
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:34,409
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

87
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:36,787
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

88
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,622
Go.

89
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:49,508
Hiya, fellas.

90
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:50,801
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

91
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,219
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

92
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:54,888
- He is still-
- Only human.

93
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,313
Upgrades.

94
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:00,788
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

95
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:03,624
It's happening exactly as before.

96
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,460
Well, not exactly.

97
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:12,299
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

98
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,134
Agents just came out of nowhere.

99
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:17,304
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

100
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:20,390
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

101
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:21,975
Where is he now?

102
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:25,187
He's doing his Superman thing.

103
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:16,613
Where are you?

104
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:24,872
<i>This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.</i>

105
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:33,380
<i>Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.</i>

106
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:35,048
<i>Roger that, Control.</i>

107
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:38,719
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

108
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:42,723
<i>We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.</i>

109
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:51,231
<i>You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>

110
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:53,108
Roger that, Control.

111
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,327
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

112
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:06,246
No place like it.

113
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:24,139
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

114
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,066
<i>The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.</i>

115
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,401
Understood.

116
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:28,662
Captain Mifune.

117
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:30,914
Captain Morpheus.

118
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,917
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

119
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:37,504
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands-

120
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,925
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

121
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:44,678
- Link.
- Sir?

122
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:47,431
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

123
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:49,141
Understood, sir.

124
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:58,734
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

125
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,029
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

126
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:05,407
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

127
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:08,243
What happened?

128
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:11,872
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

129
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,708
Yeah, she can do that.

130
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,043
Neo!

131
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:19,922
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

132
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,049
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

133
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:24,927
You know what they say
about the life you save.

134
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:26,887
I didn't save his life.

135
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,432
Hiya, Neo.

136
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,228
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

137
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:38,065
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

138
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:40,984
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

139
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,820
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

140
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,657
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

141
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:56,083
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

142
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,002
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

143
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:00,629
Let me guess.

144
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,090
<i>I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

145
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:07,636
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

146
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:09,179
I'm sure he has reasons...

147
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:12,683
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

148
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,393
You know, it's fate.

149
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,103
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

150
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,814
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

151
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,525
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

152
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:24,278
You saved yourself.

153
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:43,881
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

154
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,632
I spoke to the other captains.

155
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,635
I wanted to offer you a chance
to explain your actions.

156
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:51,472
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

157
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:53,015
You were given an order...

158
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,225
...to return to Zion.
- I did.

159
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:57,144
You asked for one ship
to remain behind.

160
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:59,980
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

161
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:02,858
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

162
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:06,445
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

163
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,572
I don't want to hear that shit!

164
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:11,408
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

165
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:14,995
I care about one thing: Stopping
that army from destroying this city.

166
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,998
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

167
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:22,753
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

168
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,338
How?

169
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:27,299
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

170
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,094
Not everyone believes what you believe.

171
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,346
My beliefs do not require them to.

172
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:44,441
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

173
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:47,361
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

174
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:50,489
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

175
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:53,826
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

176
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:02,251
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

177
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:18,225
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

178
00:18:18,392 --> 00:18:20,727
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

179
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:24,773
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set
foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

180
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,235
Then I am grateful
that it is not up to you.

181
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,577
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

182
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:39,955
- Captain.
- Councillor.

183
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:43,500
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

184
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,043
The presence of the fleet...

185
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,755
...and the persistence of rumors
must be addressed.

186
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:50,424
The people must be told
what is happening.

187
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:52,301
Of course, councillor.

188
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,265
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

189
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:01,435
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

190
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:04,688
A panic is not what anyone wants.

191
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:08,192
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

192
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:15,365
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

193
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:17,659
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

194
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:22,039
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

195
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:24,083
Consider that in the past six months...

196
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:26,293
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

197
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,463
This attack is an act of desperation.

198
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,467
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

199
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:37,471
I hope you're right, captain.

200
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:40,349
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

201
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:43,102
It is simply a matter of time.

202
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,730
My stop.

203
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:48,315
See you soon.

204
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:49,942
Hopefully not too soon.

205
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:53,278
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

206
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:04,456
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

207
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:07,042
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

208
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:10,546
<i>- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.</i>

209
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:14,925
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

210
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:43,704
<i>Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.</i>

211
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:47,374
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

212
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,626
<i>I have a daughter on the Icarus.</i>

213
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:51,712
No, wait.

214
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:54,381
It's all right. They need you.

215
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,800
- I need you.
- I know.

216
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:59,636
There's time.

217
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,727
Where's my puss-?

218
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:09,229
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

219
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,023
God!

220
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,150
Uncle Link!

221
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:16,904
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

222
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,239
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

223
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:20,949
- Yeah!
- Okay!

224
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:22,826
Okay? All right.

225
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:26,038
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

226
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,415
One, two, three, lift!

227
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:31,752
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

228
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,630
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

229
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:37,758
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

230
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,844
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

231
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:42,846
You be careful with her.

232
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:45,808
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

233
00:21:47,643 --> 00:21:50,020
Out the door! Both of you, march!

234
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:52,231
- Bye!
- Bye!

235
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:00,155
I'm gonna get what?

236
00:22:01,323 --> 00:22:03,158
Every ship up there's
been home two...

237
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:05,661
<i>...even three times more
than the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

238
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:09,540
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

239
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:13,127
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

240
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:14,795
- Why?
- You know why.

241
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:18,132
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

242
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:21,385
Maybe. But it's too late now.

243
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:24,179
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

244
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:27,057
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

245
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:30,185
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

246
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:39,319
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

247
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:42,614
I'm afraid of it.

248
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:46,827
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

249
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,329
It won't.

250
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:51,331
How can you say that to me?

251
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:53,459
Because of Morpheus.

252
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:58,255
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

253
00:22:58,422 --> 00:23:02,634
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

254
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:06,346
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

255
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:09,975
...after being on that ship and seeing
Neo do the things he can do...

256
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:11,852
...I gotta say...

257
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:14,062
...I'm starting to believe him too.

258
00:23:19,193 --> 00:23:21,612
Be careful, Link.

259
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,328
Please be careful.

260
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:39,463
They started yet?

261
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,840
Only Councillor Hamann's
opening prayer.

262
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:45,094
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

263
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,888
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

264
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:52,309
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

265
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,144
...our children.

266
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:57,856
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

267
00:23:58,023 --> 00:24:01,235
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

268
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:04,696
...and who stand here beside us.

269
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:08,575
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

270
00:24:08,742 --> 00:24:11,954
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

271
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:17,501
...but who I believe has something
to say that we all need to hear.

272
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:20,087
I give you Morpheus.

273
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:43,777
Zion! Hear me!

274
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:47,906
It is true what many of you have heard.

275
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:52,077
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

276
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:56,165
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

277
00:24:57,624 --> 00:25:02,296
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

278
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:09,136
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

279
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:14,558
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

280
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:16,894
Why?

281
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:20,147
Because I believe something you do not?

282
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:22,149
No!

283
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:27,404
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

284
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:31,492
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

285
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:34,995
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

286
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:39,833
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

287
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,755
I remember that for 100 years they
have sent their armies to destroy us.

288
00:25:44,922 --> 00:25:51,011
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

289
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:54,890
We are still here!

290
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,690
Tonight...

291
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:07,236
...let us send a message to that army.

292
00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:10,447
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

293
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:14,493
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

294
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,788
...of earth, steel and stone.

295
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:23,210
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

296
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:27,923
Tonight, let us make them remember:

297
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,053
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

298
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,412
I remember.

299
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:01,665
I remember you used to dance.

300
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:06,587
I remember you were pretty good.

301
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:10,591
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

302
00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:14,178
...that will never change.

303
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:17,389
Niobe!

304
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:23,854
Some things do change.

305
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:44,958
Excuse me.

306
00:27:56,804 --> 00:28:00,307
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

307
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:04,478
I was thinking, everyone is here.

308
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,314
Follow me.

309
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:31,894
Neo, what is it?

310
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:34,438
What's wrong?

311
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:38,358
It's okay, you can tell me.

312
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:41,236
Trinity...

313
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:44,198
Don't be afraid.

314
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:46,700
I can't lose you.

315
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:48,744
You're not gonna lose me.

316
00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:55,751
You feel this?

317
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:57,711
I'm never letting go.

318
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:37,584
Good night, Zion.

319
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,421
Sweet dreams.

320
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:52,266
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

321
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,060
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

322
00:32:55,227 --> 00:32:57,312
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

323
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,773
You first.

324
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:13,537
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

325
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:29,344
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

326
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:22,022
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

327
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:25,734
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

328
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:29,738
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

329
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:32,574
So could I.

330
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:38,205
It's nice tonight.

331
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:41,125
Very calm.

332
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:44,044
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

333
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,880
Not everyone.

334
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:51,885
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

335
00:34:52,052 --> 00:34:56,098
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

336
00:34:56,557 --> 00:35:01,270
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

337
00:35:02,729 --> 00:35:05,899
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

338
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:09,236
That you are in fact still human.

339
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:16,744
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

340
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,955
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

341
00:35:20,122 --> 00:35:22,666
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

342
00:35:33,343 --> 00:35:37,806
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

343
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:43,061
That's how it is with people. Nobody
cares how it works as long as it works.

344
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,522
I like it down here.

345
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:51,487
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

346
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:53,489
These machines are keeping us alive...

347
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:56,784
...while other machines
are coming to kill us.

348
00:35:57,201 --> 00:36:02,039
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

349
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:05,417
...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

350
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:08,295
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

351
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:11,924
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

352
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:15,094
And when I look at these machines...

353
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,349
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

354
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:23,519
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

355
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,939
Of course not. How could they?

356
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:29,650
The idea is pure nonsense...

357
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,278
...but it does make one wonder just...

358
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:35,030
...what is control?

359
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,325
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

360
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,163
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

361
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:47,167
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

362
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:49,420
Although if we did,
we'd have to consider...

363
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:51,547
...what would happen to our lights...

364
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:54,383
...our heat, our air.

365
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:59,513
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

366
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,307
No. No point.

367
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:07,104
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

368
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:11,692
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

369
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:13,527
Good point.

370
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:18,407
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

371
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:21,827
There is so much in this world...

372
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:24,913
...that I do not understand.

373
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:31,462
See that machine? It has something
to do with recycling our water supply.

374
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:34,631
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

375
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:38,886
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

376
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:44,892
I have absolutely no idea how you are
able to do some of the things you do.

377
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:49,229
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

378
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:55,235
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

379
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:03,410
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

380
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:08,415
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

381
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,087
It's time to go.

382
00:38:14,046 --> 00:38:16,507
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

383
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:21,095
I don't know. Maybe
the prophecy's true, maybe it's not.

384
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:24,807
All I know is,
that ship needs an operator.

385
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:28,268
Right now, that operator's me.

386
00:38:28,894 --> 00:38:30,979
I know.

387
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:37,611
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

388
00:38:37,778 --> 00:38:40,864
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

389
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:44,118
It's always brought me luck.

390
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:48,414
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

391
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,127
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

392
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:57,464
Just keep it with you. Please.

393
00:38:57,631 --> 00:38:59,716
For me.

394
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:04,430
Okay.

395
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:26,076
- Neo!
- How the hell-?

396
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:28,662
Bane.

397
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:30,164
Is something wrong?

398
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,040
No, I'm fine.

399
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:35,002
I just wanted to catch you to say...

400
00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:37,004
...good luck.

401
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:40,382
Thanks.

402
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:42,968
We'll see you.

403
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:47,639
Neo! Just in time.

404
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:50,142
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

405
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:51,935
I had to give something to Neo.

406
00:39:52,644 --> 00:39:55,355
A gift from one of the orphans.

407
00:39:55,522 --> 00:39:58,942
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

408
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:02,279
He said you'd understand.

409
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:07,076
Thanks.

410
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:17,086
<i>I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.</i>

411
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:19,213
That is correct.

412
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:21,340
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

413
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:22,800
Of course.

414
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:27,554
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

415
00:40:28,138 --> 00:40:30,307
I understand that, commander.

416
00:40:30,474 --> 00:40:33,060
<i>Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?</i>

417
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:38,107
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

418
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:42,903
Be careful.

419
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:14,143
Hello.

420
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:27,990
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

421
00:41:31,034 --> 00:41:35,539
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

422
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:37,499
Apologize for what?

423
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,960
For this.

424
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:39,520
Good.

425
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:45,192
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

426
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,569
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

427
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:51,782
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

428
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:54,201
...until you fight them.

429
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:58,205
Come. She's waiting.

430
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:15,139
Where the hell did they go?

431
00:43:15,514 --> 00:43:18,225
These are back doors, aren't they?

432
00:43:18,392 --> 00:43:21,311
Programmer access.

433
00:43:22,396 --> 00:43:26,150
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

434
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:31,321
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

435
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:35,909
Are you a programmer?

436
00:43:36,076 --> 00:43:38,412
Then what are you?

437
00:43:40,581 --> 00:43:44,084
I protect that which matters most.

438
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:06,982
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

439
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:10,194
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

440
00:44:13,405 --> 00:44:15,783
My goodness, look at you.

441
00:44:16,116 --> 00:44:18,952
You turned out all right, didn't you?

442
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,330
- How do you feel?
- I-

443
00:44:21,497 --> 00:44:25,084
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

444
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,961
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

445
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,800
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

446
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:46,480
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

447
00:44:47,648 --> 00:44:49,566
So...

448
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:54,071
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

449
00:44:54,363 --> 00:44:56,073
You're not human, are you?

450
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,826
It's tough to get any more obvious
than that.

451
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:04,832
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

452
00:45:05,207 --> 00:45:09,420
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

453
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:12,756
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

454
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:15,509
...another kind of control.

455
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:17,261
Keep going.

456
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:20,180
I suppose
the most obvious question is...

457
00:45:20,347 --> 00:45:24,268
...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

458
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,564
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

459
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,401
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

460
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:36,113
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

461
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,076
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

462
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:44,538
Candy?

463
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:49,418
Do you already know if I'll take it?

464
00:45:49,585 --> 00:45:51,670
Wouldn't be much of an oracle
if I didn't.

465
00:45:51,837 --> 00:45:55,048
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

466
00:45:55,215 --> 00:45:59,261
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

467
00:45:59,428 --> 00:46:04,057
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

468
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:12,566
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

469
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:16,904
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

470
00:46:17,154 --> 00:46:19,907
I love candy.

471
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:22,910
But why help us?

472
00:46:23,077 --> 00:46:26,580
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

473
00:46:27,122 --> 00:46:30,209
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

474
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:34,588
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

475
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:40,344
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

476
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:43,180
Look. See those birds?

477
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,809
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

478
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:50,896
A program was written to watch over
the trees and the wind...

479
00:46:51,063 --> 00:46:52,815
...the sunrise and sunset.

480
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:55,943
There are programs running
all over the place.

481
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:00,572
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

482
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:04,576
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

483
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:08,831
Well, you hear about them all the time.

484
00:47:09,415 --> 00:47:12,292
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

485
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:17,381
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

486
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:22,136
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

487
00:47:22,302 --> 00:47:24,638
<i>...is the system assimilating
some program:::</i>

488
00:47:24,805 --> 00:47:29,476
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

489
00:47:29,643 --> 00:47:32,646
Programs hacking programs.

490
00:47:32,813 --> 00:47:35,691
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

491
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:39,820
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

492
00:47:40,237 --> 00:47:44,158
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

493
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:48,871
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

494
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:54,001
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

495
00:47:54,168 --> 00:47:56,837
...or return to the source.

496
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:01,800
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

497
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:04,470
Where you must go.

498
00:48:04,636 --> 00:48:08,849
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

499
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:12,853
...in your dreams, haven't you?

500
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,856
A door made of light?

501
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:21,653
What happens when you go through
the door?

502
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:26,784
I see Trinity...

503
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,120
...and something happens...

504
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:32,206
...something bad.

505
00:48:32,372 --> 00:48:36,376
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

506
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:41,298
- Do you see her die?
- No.

507
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:45,135
You have the sight now, Neo.

508
00:48:45,302 --> 00:48:48,305
You are looking at the world
without time.

509
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:50,891
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

510
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:54,812
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

511
00:48:54,978 --> 00:48:58,148
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

512
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:02,194
No, you've already made the choice.

513
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:04,905
Now you have to understand it.

514
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:06,907
No.

515
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:10,327
I can't do that. I won't.

516
00:49:11,036 --> 00:49:13,414
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

517
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:17,084
Because you're the One.

518
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:22,256
What if I can't?

519
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:24,425
What happens if I fail?

520
00:49:25,008 --> 00:49:28,011
Then Zion will fall.

521
00:49:35,477 --> 00:49:40,357
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

522
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:43,819
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

523
00:49:43,986 --> 00:49:45,028
The Keymaker?

524
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:48,824
Yes. He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

525
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:52,745
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

526
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:56,457
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

527
00:49:56,623 --> 00:49:59,501
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

528
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:04,506
What do all men with power want?
More power.

529
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:08,469
Be there at that exact time...

530
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:11,305
...and you will have a chance.

531
00:50:12,097 --> 00:50:14,349
We must go.

532
00:50:14,516 --> 00:50:19,897
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

533
00:50:20,481 --> 00:50:23,358
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

534
00:50:23,525 --> 00:50:26,278
But for what it's worth...

535
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:30,991
...you've made a believer out of me.

536
00:50:32,284 --> 00:50:34,411
Good luck, kiddo.

537
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:57,309
Mr. Anderson.

538
00:50:58,352 --> 00:51:00,354
Did you get my package?

539
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:02,689
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

540
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:06,735
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

541
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:10,781
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

542
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:13,534
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

543
00:51:14,743 --> 00:51:16,745
Our connection.

544
00:51:16,912 --> 00:51:19,581
I don't fully understand how it happened.

545
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:23,127
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

546
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:25,963
...something overwritten or copied.

547
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,841
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

548
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:32,094
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

549
00:51:32,261 --> 00:51:33,929
And what reason is that?

550
00:51:34,388 --> 00:51:38,350
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

551
00:51:38,517 --> 00:51:41,770
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

552
00:51:41,937 --> 00:51:45,441
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

553
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:47,443
...but it happened anyway.

554
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:51,321
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

555
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:57,911
Afterward, I knew the rules, I
understood what I was supposed to do...

556
00:51:58,078 --> 00:52:01,081
...but I didn't.

557
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:05,419
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

558
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:09,423
...compelled to disobey.

559
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:13,761
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

560
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:17,890
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

561
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:21,268
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

562
00:52:21,435 --> 00:52:26,273
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

563
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:27,983
Congratulations.

564
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:31,070
Thank you.

565
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:36,283
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

566
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:41,622
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

567
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:46,668
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

568
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:50,756
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

569
00:52:50,923 --> 00:52:54,301
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

570
00:52:54,468 --> 00:52:59,306
...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

571
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:02,476
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

572
00:53:02,643 --> 00:53:04,478
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

573
00:53:04,645 --> 00:53:09,358
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

574
00:53:09,525 --> 00:53:11,985
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

575
00:53:12,152 --> 00:53:16,532
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

576
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:20,577
Purpose.

577
00:53:23,664 --> 00:53:25,541
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

578
00:53:28,585 --> 00:53:32,172
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

579
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:21,490
- You.
- Yes, me.

580
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:28,539
Me, me, me.

581
00:55:33,419 --> 00:55:35,087
Me too.

582
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,882
More.

583
00:58:46,153 --> 00:58:48,989
It is inevitable.

584
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:50,824
Come on, get out of there.

585
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:36,370
Are you all right?

586
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:39,373
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

587
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:42,876
- Now there's more than one of them?
- A lot more.

588
00:59:43,043 --> 00:59:46,839
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

589
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:49,466
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

590
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:53,846
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

591
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:56,765
...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

592
00:59:57,683 --> 01:00:01,395
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

593
01:00:01,562 --> 01:00:03,147
It felt like dying.

594
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,358
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

595
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:10,362
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

596
01:00:10,529 --> 01:00:13,073
These points of intersection
are crucial...

597
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,034
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

598
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:20,247
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

599
01:00:20,414 --> 01:00:24,084
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

600
01:00:24,251 --> 01:00:27,588
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

601
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:31,592
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

602
01:00:31,759 --> 01:00:35,763
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

603
01:00:36,054 --> 01:00:40,601
You have our leave to prepare our
defense by any and all means necessary.

604
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:43,437
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

605
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:47,024
<i>...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

606
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:49,777
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

607
01:00:51,403 --> 01:00:55,365
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

608
01:00:55,532 --> 01:00:59,286
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

609
01:00:59,453 --> 01:01:02,998
...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

610
01:01:03,165 --> 01:01:05,501
<i>It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

611
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:08,712
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

612
01:01:08,879 --> 01:01:11,882
Careful, commander.

613
01:01:12,091 --> 01:01:15,427
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

614
01:01:15,594 --> 01:01:19,473
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

615
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,810
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

616
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:25,437
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains-

617
01:01:25,604 --> 01:01:27,314
There's no need for such an order.

618
01:01:27,481 --> 01:01:31,026
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

619
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:36,740
<i>The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

620
01:01:36,907 --> 01:01:41,078
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

621
01:01:42,371 --> 01:01:46,166
<i>Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.</i>

622
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:49,253
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

623
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,880
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

624
01:01:53,298 --> 01:01:54,716
Is there another?

625
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:59,221
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

626
01:01:59,388 --> 01:02:01,265
- Listen-
- Shut your hole, Bane...

627
01:02:01,432 --> 01:02:02,933
...before I put you in one.

628
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:14,528
Is there no other?

629
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:17,197
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

630
01:02:17,364 --> 01:02:20,325
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

631
01:02:20,784 --> 01:02:24,288
<i>Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.</i>

632
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:26,707
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

633
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:32,004
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

634
01:02:36,717 --> 01:02:39,303
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

635
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:40,512
Why?

636
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:45,059
Because some things
never change, Jason...

637
01:02:45,225 --> 01:02:47,561
...and some things do.

638
01:03:03,994 --> 01:03:05,412
What can you see, Neo?

639
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:07,915
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

640
01:03:08,082 --> 01:03:09,666
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

641
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,794
Is that good for us or bad for us?

642
01:03:12,503 --> 01:03:15,631
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

643
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:17,800
Bad for us.

644
01:03:18,217 --> 01:03:19,718
Here we go.

645
01:03:27,726 --> 01:03:30,646
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

646
01:03:31,105 --> 01:03:34,942
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

647
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:36,151
Follow me.

648
01:03:58,132 --> 01:04:04,012
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

649
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:05,597
Right?

650
01:04:05,764 --> 01:04:08,100
And the legendary Morpheus.

651
01:04:08,934 --> 01:04:13,814
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

652
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:17,443
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

653
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,655
Something to eat? Drink?

654
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:24,992
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

655
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:27,661
For the sake of appearances.

656
01:04:27,828 --> 01:04:31,290
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

657
01:04:31,457 --> 01:04:32,833
Who has time?

658
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,545
But then, if we do not ever take time,
how can we ever have time?

659
01:04:40,257 --> 01:04:43,635
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

660
01:04:43,802 --> 01:04:46,722
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

661
01:04:46,889 --> 01:04:51,060
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

662
01:04:51,226 --> 01:04:53,353
...especially to curse with.

663
01:04:57,357 --> 01:05:00,944
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

664
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,282
You know why we are here.

665
01:05:07,034 --> 01:05:11,914
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

666
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:18,170
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

667
01:05:18,462 --> 01:05:20,923
We are looking for the Keymaker.

668
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:26,095
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

669
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:29,223
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

670
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:33,143
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

671
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:39,066
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

672
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:42,403
...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

673
01:05:42,569 --> 01:05:44,696
But do you?

674
01:05:44,905 --> 01:05:47,241
You think you do, but you do not.

675
01:05:47,408 --> 01:05:50,619
You are here
because you were sent here.

676
01:05:50,786 --> 01:05:53,914
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

677
01:05:55,082 --> 01:05:57,418
It is, of course, the way of all things.

678
01:05:57,584 --> 01:06:00,254
You see, there is only one constant...

679
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:04,591
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

680
01:06:04,758 --> 01:06:06,427
Causality.

681
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:08,887
Action, reaction.

682
01:06:09,054 --> 01:06:13,267
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

683
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:15,185
No. Wrong.

684
01:06:15,352 --> 01:06:19,940
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

685
01:06:20,107 --> 01:06:22,192
...and those without.

686
01:06:23,736 --> 01:06:26,905
Look there at that woman.

687
01:06:27,614 --> 01:06:31,535
My God, just look at her...

688
01:06:31,785 --> 01:06:34,455
...affecting everyone around her.

689
01:06:34,621 --> 01:06:39,376
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

690
01:06:39,626 --> 01:06:43,380
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

691
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:47,801
...a very special dessert.

692
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:54,600
I wrote it myself.

693
01:06:54,767 --> 01:06:57,978
It starts so simply...

694
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:02,733
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

695
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:05,402
...poetry.

696
01:07:05,569 --> 01:07:06,987
First...

697
01:07:07,488 --> 01:07:12,910
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

698
01:07:13,494 --> 01:07:16,121
You can see it, Neo, yes?

699
01:07:16,747 --> 01:07:19,333
She does not understand why.

700
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:22,002
Is it the wine? No.

701
01:07:22,169 --> 01:07:24,546
What is it then? What is the reason?

702
01:07:25,172 --> 01:07:27,508
And soon it does not matter.

703
01:07:27,674 --> 01:07:30,677
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

704
01:07:31,637 --> 01:07:37,184
...and all that matters
is the feeling itself.

705
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:40,729
And this is the nature of the universe.

706
01:07:40,896 --> 01:07:43,440
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

707
01:07:43,607 --> 01:07:46,193
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

708
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,364
Beneath our poised appearance...

709
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:55,828
...the truth is, we are completely...

710
01:07:58,705 --> 01:08:01,583
...out of control.

711
01:08:06,922 --> 01:08:11,802
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

712
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:17,683
Our only hope, our only peace, is to
understand it, to understand the why.

713
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:21,270
"Why" is what separates us from them...

714
01:08:21,437 --> 01:08:23,731
...you from me.

715
01:08:23,897 --> 01:08:27,651
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

716
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:31,113
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

717
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,074
Another link in the chain.

718
01:08:34,283 --> 01:08:35,576
But fear not.

719
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:39,621
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

720
01:08:39,788 --> 01:08:42,416
...I will tell you what to do next.

721
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:47,755
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

722
01:08:47,963 --> 01:08:52,217
Her time is almost up.

723
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:56,805
<i>Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.</i>

724
01:08:56,972 --> 01:08:59,475
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

725
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:06,023
The Keymaker is mine, and I see
no reason why I should give him up.

726
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:10,235
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

727
01:09:10,402 --> 01:09:15,115
<i>Please, ma chérie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.</i>

728
01:09:15,282 --> 01:09:18,619
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

729
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:22,247
<i>Cause and effect. Au revoir.</i>

730
01:09:27,294 --> 01:09:30,380
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

731
01:09:39,264 --> 01:09:40,766
Well, that didn't go so well.

732
01:09:40,933 --> 01:09:43,310
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

733
01:09:43,477 --> 01:09:45,604
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

734
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:47,606
Or didn't do something.

735
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:51,026
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

736
01:09:51,193 --> 01:09:54,988
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

737
01:09:57,241 --> 01:10:00,494
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

738
01:10:07,501 --> 01:10:09,586
Get out.

739
01:10:11,505 --> 01:10:17,845
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

740
01:10:18,429 --> 01:10:23,934
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

741
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:28,397
He was so different.

742
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,818
He was like you.

743
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:39,324
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

744
01:10:40,075 --> 01:10:42,369
- What?
- A kiss.

745
01:10:42,745 --> 01:10:43,871
Excuse me?

746
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:49,293
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

747
01:10:51,211 --> 01:10:54,798
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

748
01:10:55,048 --> 01:10:57,009
It's all over you both.

749
01:10:57,676 --> 01:11:02,222
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

750
01:11:03,557 --> 01:11:09,313
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

751
01:11:09,563 --> 01:11:11,398
Just a sample.

752
01:11:11,565 --> 01:11:14,568
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

753
01:11:16,779 --> 01:11:21,742
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

754
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:24,078
Why should we trust you?

755
01:11:24,244 --> 01:11:28,248
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

756
01:11:35,339 --> 01:11:37,466
All right.

757
01:11:37,758 --> 01:11:41,595
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

758
01:11:42,805 --> 01:11:44,848
All right.

759
01:11:51,188 --> 01:11:53,023
Terrible. Forget it.

760
01:11:55,984 --> 01:11:57,444
Wait.

761
01:11:58,362 --> 01:11:59,905
Okay.

762
01:12:36,984 --> 01:12:39,069
Yes.

763
01:12:39,653 --> 01:12:42,156
That's it.

764
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:02,342
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

765
01:13:05,345 --> 01:13:06,722
Come with me.

766
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:39,546
Not again.

767
01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:45,594
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

768
01:13:46,261 --> 01:13:48,639
These fellas work for my husband.

769
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:52,643
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

770
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,353
Aren't you, boys?

771
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,562
Yes, mistress.

772
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:58,440
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

773
01:13:58,607 --> 01:14:02,778
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

774
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:08,534
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

775
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,746
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

776
01:14:17,459 --> 01:14:20,671
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

777
01:14:20,838 --> 01:14:23,424
...or you can stay there and die.

778
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:26,301
He's in the ladies' room!

779
01:14:32,391 --> 01:14:34,309
Hurry.

780
01:14:59,877 --> 01:15:03,046
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

781
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:05,132
I've been waiting for you.

782
01:15:11,972 --> 01:15:15,642
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

783
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,816
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

784
01:15:22,983 --> 01:15:25,986
There is no cause for this. What cause?

785
01:15:26,153 --> 01:15:30,449
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

786
01:15:30,616 --> 01:15:33,327
Lipstick? Lipstick.

787
01:15:33,494 --> 01:15:37,331
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

788
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:41,710
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

789
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:47,299
Woman, this is nothing.

790
01:15:47,466 --> 01:15:53,013
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

791
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,182
Have fun.

792
01:16:01,688 --> 01:16:03,357
All right.

793
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:05,275
All right.

794
01:16:05,526 --> 01:16:08,320
Let us find out where this goes.

795
01:16:08,487 --> 01:16:11,365
You two, get the Keymaker.

796
01:16:17,871 --> 01:16:19,832
That's a nice trick.

797
01:16:20,165 --> 01:16:21,375
I cannot go back.

798
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:23,877
I'll handle them.

799
01:16:24,378 --> 01:16:26,880
Handle us? You'll handle us?

800
01:16:27,047 --> 01:16:30,509
You know, your predecessors
had much more respect.

801
01:16:43,897 --> 01:16:45,941
Okay, you have some skill.

802
01:16:48,152 --> 01:16:50,112
Kill him.

803
01:17:50,297 --> 01:17:52,341
You see? He's just a man.

804
01:20:07,142 --> 01:20:09,895
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

805
01:20:12,022 --> 01:20:16,026
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

806
01:20:16,193 --> 01:20:21,407
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

807
01:20:41,468 --> 01:20:44,847
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

808
01:20:48,976 --> 01:20:50,853
Close it, quick!

809
01:20:55,649 --> 01:20:58,193
Could we move along?

810
01:21:01,739 --> 01:21:03,323
Run!

811
01:21:19,256 --> 01:21:21,592
Step away from the door.

812
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,973
We owe you for that.

813
01:21:30,225 --> 01:21:31,393
Just like new.

814
01:21:31,685 --> 01:21:33,145
Drop your weapon.

815
01:21:38,525 --> 01:21:40,360
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

816
01:21:40,527 --> 01:21:42,071
He can handle himself.

817
01:21:45,157 --> 01:21:46,241
Get in back.

818
01:22:23,904 --> 01:22:25,072
Shit.

819
01:22:25,572 --> 01:22:27,074
<i>- Operator.
- Link, where am I?</i>

820
01:22:27,616 --> 01:22:30,828
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

821
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,414
<i>- Really?
- It'll take me a while to get an exit.</i>

822
01:22:33,914 --> 01:22:34,957
<i>- Shit!
- What?</i>

823
01:22:35,165 --> 01:22:37,835
The twins are after Morpheus and
Trinity. They don't have a way out.

824
01:22:38,001 --> 01:22:41,380
<i>- Where are they?
- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.</i>

825
01:22:58,147 --> 01:22:59,732
<i>- Operator.
- Get us out of here.</i>

826
01:22:59,898 --> 01:23:02,651
<i>- Won't be easy.
- I know. We're inside the core network.</i>

827
01:23:02,818 --> 01:23:05,446
<i>The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>

828
01:23:05,612 --> 01:23:07,698
<i>- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.</i>

829
01:23:07,865 --> 01:23:11,618
<i>- Fine, we'll make it.
- I should- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!</i>

830
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:18,208
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

831
01:23:26,467 --> 01:23:27,634
Hold on!

832
01:23:44,651 --> 01:23:47,154
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

833
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:49,031
Are you watching this, Link?

834
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:52,826
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

835
01:23:53,869 --> 01:23:55,829
Any suggestions?

836
01:23:57,706 --> 01:23:59,708
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

837
01:24:07,174 --> 01:24:10,010
Straight here. You'll hit
a connecting tunnel to the 101.

838
01:24:10,177 --> 01:24:11,553
<i>- Got it.
- You sure about this?</i>

839
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,598
The freeway, I mean. In 14 years
of operating, I've never seen-

840
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:16,767
Link, what did I tell you?

841
01:24:17,059 --> 01:24:19,353
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

842
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,022
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

843
01:24:22,189 --> 01:24:24,358
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

844
01:24:24,525 --> 01:24:27,152
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

845
01:24:27,361 --> 01:24:29,279
Then let us hope...

846
01:24:29,446 --> 01:24:30,823
...that I was wrong.

847
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:43,794
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

848
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:45,587
We've been sent to bring you in.

849
01:24:45,754 --> 01:24:48,841
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

850
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:51,009
<i>- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.</i>

851
01:24:58,559 --> 01:25:00,477
Repeat, they're approaching the-

852
01:25:03,647 --> 01:25:07,860
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

853
01:26:11,548 --> 01:26:12,466
<i>Shots fired.</i>

854
01:26:15,094 --> 01:26:16,970
Move!

855
01:28:06,955 --> 01:28:10,167
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

856
01:28:56,213 --> 01:28:58,215
Trinity.

857
01:28:58,632 --> 01:28:59,758
Get him out of here.

858
01:29:03,387 --> 01:29:05,472
Come on!

859
01:29:22,489 --> 01:29:23,991
Crush him.

860
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,522
Morpheus.

861
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:57,191
He's okay. Keep moving.

862
01:29:58,192 --> 01:29:59,985
Let's go.

863
01:30:05,741 --> 01:30:07,910
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

864
01:30:08,077 --> 01:30:10,412
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle-

865
01:30:10,579 --> 01:30:11,997
Wait.

866
01:30:13,373 --> 01:30:14,833
Cancel that.

867
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,211
You are handy.

868
01:30:17,377 --> 01:30:19,296
Jump on.

869
01:32:46,693 --> 01:32:48,612
- She means nothing.
- Find the exile.

870
01:32:49,863 --> 01:32:50,906
We have them.

871
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,367
<i>One-Adam-twelve, please respond.</i>

872
01:32:59,832 --> 01:33:01,542
Get down.

873
01:35:12,548 --> 01:35:14,174
Gotcha.

874
01:35:14,925 --> 01:35:16,009
She's good.

875
01:35:20,389 --> 01:35:22,683
You are no longer necessary.

876
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:33,068
We do only what we're meant to do.

877
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:38,282
Then you are meant for one more thing:
deletion.

878
01:35:39,241 --> 01:35:41,118
Go kick his ass.

879
01:36:31,168 --> 01:36:33,921
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

880
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:36,131
What is that?

881
01:37:05,994 --> 01:37:08,872
Yes! Yes!

882
01:37:15,462 --> 01:37:18,006
<i>Sir, we have confirmation
from the Icarus.</i>

883
01:37:18,173 --> 01:37:20,592
First two ships are in position
for counterattack.

884
01:37:20,843 --> 01:37:21,885
Good.

885
01:37:22,886 --> 01:37:23,929
Any change?

886
01:37:24,096 --> 01:37:26,849
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

887
01:37:27,015 --> 01:37:30,144
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

888
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:32,855
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

889
01:37:33,689 --> 01:37:35,315
Yes, sir.

890
01:38:07,931 --> 01:38:10,184
<i>There is a building.</i>

891
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:16,023
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

892
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,108
...and no stair can reach.

893
01:38:18,776 --> 01:38:24,865
<i>This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.</i>

894
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:27,367
Hidden places.

895
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:31,330
But one door is special.

896
01:38:31,497 --> 01:38:33,707
One door leads to the source.

897
01:38:42,049 --> 01:38:46,470
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

898
01:38:46,637 --> 01:38:51,141
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

899
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:54,061
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

900
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:57,231
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

901
01:38:57,398 --> 01:39:00,776
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

902
01:39:01,318 --> 01:39:06,073
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

903
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:09,076
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

904
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:12,955
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

905
01:39:13,789 --> 01:39:16,250
<i>There is a power station.</i>

906
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:18,669
<i>It must be destroyed.</i>

907
01:39:18,836 --> 01:39:23,173
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

908
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,595
<i>The core network of the grid
must be accessed.</i>

909
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:31,598
<i>The emergency system
must be deactivated.</i>

910
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:33,183
<i>What do you need us for?</i>

911
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:35,519
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

912
01:39:35,686 --> 01:39:37,438
- There's no time.
- Why?

913
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:40,733
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

914
01:39:40,899 --> 01:39:43,193
But another connection
must first be made.

915
01:39:44,027 --> 01:39:47,865
<i>- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.</i>

916
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:49,616
<i>Just over five minutes.</i>

917
01:39:49,783 --> 01:39:52,035
<i>That is the length and breadth
of the window.</i>

918
01:39:52,202 --> 01:39:54,496
Only the One can open the door...

919
01:39:54,705 --> 01:39:57,624
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

920
01:39:58,876 --> 01:40:00,461
How do you know all this?

921
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:05,799
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

922
01:40:05,966 --> 01:40:11,472
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

923
01:40:22,232 --> 01:40:25,027
Neo, I know something's wrong.

924
01:40:25,694 --> 01:40:27,738
You don't have to tell me.

925
01:40:27,905 --> 01:40:31,658
I just want you to know that I'm here.

926
01:40:35,204 --> 01:40:36,663
All must be done as one.

927
01:40:41,418 --> 01:40:43,087
Can't hurt.

928
01:40:46,632 --> 01:40:48,717
If one fails...

929
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:51,220
<i>...all fail.</i>

930
01:40:51,553 --> 01:40:55,391
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

931
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:00,020
<i>At midnight, we will strike.</i>

932
01:41:00,646 --> 01:41:01,730
Hey!

933
01:41:01,897 --> 01:41:05,859
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

934
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:18,247
Okay, they're inside.

935
01:41:18,414 --> 01:41:20,916
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

936
01:41:23,627 --> 01:41:24,712
Oh, shit.

937
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:33,554
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

938
01:41:35,055 --> 01:41:37,224
<i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>

939
01:41:38,559 --> 01:41:40,561
<i>There are no accidents.</i>

940
01:41:41,937 --> 01:41:46,984
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

941
01:41:47,151 --> 01:41:52,740
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

942
01:41:52,906 --> 01:41:56,410
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

943
01:41:56,744 --> 01:41:59,079
<i>I see purpose.</i>

944
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:08,130
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

945
01:42:08,297 --> 01:42:13,302
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

946
01:42:13,469 --> 01:42:16,805
...the very meaning of our lives.

947
01:42:16,972 --> 01:42:21,143
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

948
01:42:21,727 --> 01:42:23,645
I promise you, if I can, I will.

949
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:28,317
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

950
01:42:29,276 --> 01:42:31,278
...no matter what...

951
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,781
...to stay out of the Matrix?

952
01:42:34,865 --> 01:42:36,658
Why?

953
01:42:44,875 --> 01:42:45,959
Please.

954
01:42:48,045 --> 01:42:49,380
All right.

955
01:42:52,716 --> 01:42:55,219
What is it, Niobe?

956
01:42:55,386 --> 01:42:59,515
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

957
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:02,976
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

958
01:43:03,143 --> 01:43:07,147
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

959
01:43:07,564 --> 01:43:10,192
But how would that be different
from any other day?

960
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:26,166
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

961
01:43:26,417 --> 01:43:29,336
<i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>

962
01:43:29,878 --> 01:43:31,672
<i>...in any place.</i>

963
01:43:31,839 --> 01:43:33,757
Incoming. Incoming!

964
01:43:35,718 --> 01:43:37,344
Incoming!

965
01:43:43,267 --> 01:43:45,728
Now consider the alternative.

966
01:43:45,894 --> 01:43:50,482
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

967
01:43:50,649 --> 01:43:55,070
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

968
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:59,032
Isn't that worth fighting for?

969
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:02,786
Isn't that worth dying for?

970
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:06,331
- Time?
- Three minutes.

971
01:44:06,498 --> 01:44:07,624
Almost there.

972
01:44:27,686 --> 01:44:29,063
It is done.

973
01:44:29,229 --> 01:44:30,522
Find the others.

974
01:44:31,648 --> 01:44:33,901
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

975
01:44:34,068 --> 01:44:36,737
- What about Soren?
- There.

976
01:44:36,904 --> 01:44:38,739
They're still inside, but...

977
01:44:39,615 --> 01:44:40,657
They're not moving.

978
01:45:04,807 --> 01:45:06,725
That's it, let's go.

979
01:45:08,852 --> 01:45:10,687
Call Neo now.

980
01:45:14,650 --> 01:45:17,486
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

981
01:45:21,615 --> 01:45:25,119
Everything is operational. The
emergency system is rerouting power.

982
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,960
Jesus.

983
01:45:33,127 --> 01:45:37,172
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

984
01:45:37,339 --> 01:45:39,299
The hell it is.

985
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:41,385
What are you-? Trinity!

986
01:45:42,678 --> 01:45:45,639
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

987
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:47,975
We're talking less than five minutes.

988
01:45:48,142 --> 01:45:50,644
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

989
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:54,356
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

990
01:45:55,649 --> 01:45:59,653
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

991
01:46:00,821 --> 01:46:03,323
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

992
01:46:06,535 --> 01:46:09,663
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

993
01:46:27,723 --> 01:46:29,308
<i>- Operator.
- I'm in.</i>

994
01:46:29,475 --> 01:46:31,643
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

995
01:46:32,227 --> 01:46:36,398
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

996
01:46:36,565 --> 01:46:41,945
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

997
01:46:42,112 --> 01:46:45,032
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

998
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:50,704
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

999
01:46:50,871 --> 01:46:53,540
I want exactly what you want.

1000
01:46:53,707 --> 01:46:55,793
I want everything.

1001
01:46:56,251 --> 01:46:58,754
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

1002
01:46:58,921 --> 01:47:00,714
Go ahead, shoot.

1003
01:47:00,881 --> 01:47:06,178
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

1004
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:21,193
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

1005
01:47:22,069 --> 01:47:24,113
Hold it right there, little lady.

1006
01:47:33,455 --> 01:47:35,249
If you can't beat us...

1007
01:47:35,416 --> 01:47:37,251
Join us.

1008
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,504
Morpheus!

1009
01:47:54,101 --> 01:47:57,229
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

1010
01:48:10,909 --> 01:48:11,994
One minute.

1011
01:48:21,253 --> 01:48:22,296
Come on.

1012
01:48:23,464 --> 01:48:25,382
Come on.

1013
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:27,843
Please.

1014
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:39,313
Kill them.

1015
01:48:47,196 --> 01:48:48,238
They're in.

1016
01:48:48,405 --> 01:48:50,365
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

1017
01:49:05,923 --> 01:49:08,050
It was meant to be.

1018
01:49:08,217 --> 01:49:13,597
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1019
01:49:22,356 --> 01:49:26,693
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1020
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:35,369
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1021
01:50:27,671 --> 01:50:29,048
Hello, Neo.

1022
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:33,385
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1023
01:50:33,552 --> 01:50:37,181
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1024
01:50:37,431 --> 01:50:38,807
You have many questions.

1025
01:50:38,974 --> 01:50:41,602
Though the process has altered
your consciousness...

1026
01:50:41,769 --> 01:50:43,771
...you remain irrevocably human.

1027
01:50:43,937 --> 01:50:47,524
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1028
01:50:47,941 --> 01:50:51,987
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1029
01:50:52,154 --> 01:50:55,866
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1030
01:50:56,742 --> 01:50:58,368
Why am I here?

1031
01:50:58,535 --> 01:51:02,456
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1032
01:51:02,623 --> 01:51:04,958
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1033
01:51:05,125 --> 01:51:09,213
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1034
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:12,216
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1035
01:51:12,383 --> 01:51:16,845
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1036
01:51:17,179 --> 01:51:19,515
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1037
01:51:19,681 --> 01:51:24,144
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1038
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:28,273
...which has led you, inexorably...

1039
01:51:29,233 --> 01:51:30,484
...here.

1040
01:51:30,651 --> 01:51:34,738
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1041
01:51:34,905 --> 01:51:38,700
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1042
01:51:38,867 --> 01:51:41,495
<i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

1043
01:51:41,662 --> 01:51:43,997
The Matrix is older than you know.

1044
01:51:44,164 --> 01:51:46,709
I count from the emergence
of one integral anomaly...

1045
01:51:46,875 --> 01:51:50,754
...to the emergence of the next.
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1046
01:51:50,921 --> 01:51:53,382
<i>Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.</i>

1047
01:51:53,549 --> 01:51:57,094
<i>There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.</i>

1048
01:51:57,261 --> 01:51:58,554
<i>Either no one told me...</i>

1049
01:51:59,805 --> 01:52:03,809
...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1050
01:52:03,976 --> 01:52:07,271
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1051
01:52:07,438 --> 01:52:10,858
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1052
01:52:11,024 --> 01:52:14,278
<i>You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1053
01:52:14,445 --> 01:52:16,238
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1054
01:52:16,405 --> 01:52:19,575
<i>You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!</i>

1055
01:52:21,869 --> 01:52:23,370
Choice.

1056
01:52:23,537 --> 01:52:25,372
The problem is choice.

1057
01:52:47,603 --> 01:52:51,231
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1058
01:52:51,398 --> 01:52:53,233
Flawless, sublime.

1059
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:56,904
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1060
01:52:57,571 --> 01:52:59,990
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1061
01:53:00,157 --> 01:53:03,494
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1062
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:06,622
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1063
01:53:06,789 --> 01:53:10,793
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1064
01:53:11,502 --> 01:53:15,589
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1065
01:53:16,965 --> 01:53:19,343
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1066
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:21,553
...because it required a lesser mind.

1067
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:27,684
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1068
01:53:28,102 --> 01:53:32,523
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1069
01:53:32,689 --> 01:53:37,486
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1070
01:53:37,653 --> 01:53:43,617
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1071
01:53:44,243 --> 01:53:46,537
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1072
01:53:47,037 --> 01:53:49,331
As I was saying, she stumbled
upon a solution...

1073
01:53:49,498 --> 01:53:51,250
...whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1074
01:53:51,417 --> 01:53:54,420
...accepted the program,
as long as they were given a choice...

1075
01:53:54,586 --> 01:53:58,590
...even if they were only aware of
the choice at a near unconscious level.

1076
01:53:58,757 --> 01:54:02,177
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1077
01:54:02,344 --> 01:54:06,348
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1078
01:54:06,515 --> 01:54:09,226
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1079
01:54:09,601 --> 01:54:13,731
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1080
01:54:13,897 --> 01:54:17,985
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1081
01:54:18,152 --> 01:54:19,945
This is about Zion.

1082
01:54:20,404 --> 01:54:24,074
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1083
01:54:24,241 --> 01:54:28,662
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1084
01:54:28,954 --> 01:54:29,997
Bullshit.

1085
01:54:30,164 --> 01:54:33,333
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1086
01:54:33,542 --> 01:54:40,007
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1087
01:54:40,174 --> 01:54:44,178
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1088
01:54:56,899 --> 01:54:58,192
The function of the One...

1089
01:54:58,358 --> 01:55:01,487
...is now to return to the source,
allowing a dissemination...

1090
01:55:01,653 --> 01:55:04,907
...of the code you carry,
reinserting the prime program.

1091
01:55:05,491 --> 01:55:09,495
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1092
01:55:09,661 --> 01:55:12,915
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1093
01:55:13,082 --> 01:55:17,628
Failure to comply with this process will
result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1094
01:55:17,795 --> 01:55:20,130
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1095
01:55:20,297 --> 01:55:22,883
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1096
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:27,262
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1097
01:55:27,596 --> 01:55:31,683
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1098
01:55:32,476 --> 01:55:36,105
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1099
01:55:36,271 --> 01:55:38,774
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1100
01:55:38,941 --> 01:55:42,820
...to accept responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1101
01:55:49,284 --> 01:55:51,829
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1102
01:55:52,871 --> 01:55:56,709
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1103
01:55:56,875 --> 01:55:58,419
...a contingent affirmation...

1104
01:55:58,585 --> 01:56:01,338
...that was meant to create
a profound attachment...

1105
01:56:01,505 --> 01:56:05,092
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1106
01:56:05,259 --> 01:56:07,594
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1107
01:56:07,761 --> 01:56:10,723
...your experience is far more specific...

1108
01:56:11,056 --> 01:56:13,934
...vis-à-vis love.

1109
01:56:14,935 --> 01:56:16,562
Trinity!

1110
01:56:18,856 --> 01:56:23,193
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1111
01:56:23,569 --> 01:56:24,611
No.

1112
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:29,450
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1113
01:56:29,616 --> 01:56:32,703
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1114
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:36,874
...as both beginning and end.

1115
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:38,542
There are two doors.

1116
01:56:38,709 --> 01:56:42,087
The door to your right leads
to the source and the salvation of Zion.

1117
01:56:42,671 --> 01:56:45,507
The door to your left leads back
to the Matrix, to her...

1118
01:56:45,674 --> 01:56:48,969
...and to the end of your species.

1119
01:56:49,136 --> 01:56:53,515
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1120
01:56:53,682 --> 01:56:57,186
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1121
01:56:57,352 --> 01:57:01,440
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1122
01:57:01,607 --> 01:57:03,358
...the onset of an emotion...

1123
01:57:03,525 --> 01:57:06,862
...designed specifically
to overwhelm logic and reason.

1124
01:57:07,029 --> 01:57:11,658
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1125
01:57:11,825 --> 01:57:18,332
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1126
01:57:23,337 --> 01:57:27,466
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1127
01:57:27,633 --> 01:57:31,345
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1128
01:57:31,512 --> 01:57:35,849
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1129
01:57:36,016 --> 01:57:37,434
We won't.

1130
01:57:44,858 --> 01:57:47,069
We got a serious situation, sir.

1131
01:57:47,528 --> 01:57:48,612
Oh, no.

1132
01:58:48,255 --> 01:58:50,257
- What was that?
- It's moving faster...

1133
01:58:50,424 --> 01:58:51,800
...than anything I've seen.

1134
01:59:42,434 --> 01:59:44,228
Holy shit, he caught her.

1135
01:59:58,158 --> 01:59:59,993
Neo, I had to.

1136
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,912
I know.

1137
02:00:06,959 --> 02:00:09,503
The bullet is still inside.

1138
02:00:20,264 --> 02:00:22,182
Trinity...

1139
02:00:23,392 --> 02:00:25,102
...don't you quit on me now.

1140
02:00:34,278 --> 02:00:36,864
I'm sorry.

1141
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:45,664
Trinity.

1142
02:00:55,632 --> 02:00:57,593
Trinity...

1143
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:59,553
...I know you can hear me.

1144
02:01:00,345 --> 02:01:02,890
I'm not letting go.

1145
02:01:03,057 --> 02:01:04,683
I can't.

1146
02:01:05,893 --> 02:01:08,103
I love you too damn much.

1147
02:01:36,799 --> 02:01:38,092
I can't take this.

1148
02:01:41,845 --> 02:01:44,932
I guess this makes us even.

1149
02:01:57,611 --> 02:01:59,571
I don't understand it.

1150
02:01:59,738 --> 02:02:02,741
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1151
02:02:02,908 --> 02:02:05,953
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1152
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,956
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1153
02:02:09,123 --> 02:02:13,460
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1154
02:02:13,877 --> 02:02:15,504
- What?
- How do you know that?

1155
02:02:15,963 --> 02:02:18,006
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1156
02:02:19,007 --> 02:02:21,844
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1157
02:02:22,010 --> 02:02:25,848
- Impossible. The prophecy tells us-
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

1158
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:30,144
The prophecy was a lie.

1159
02:02:31,353 --> 02:02:34,356
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1160
02:02:34,523 --> 02:02:37,568
It was all another system of control.

1161
02:02:37,735 --> 02:02:40,821
I don't believe that.

1162
02:02:41,155 --> 02:02:43,490
But you said it yourself.

1163
02:02:43,657 --> 02:02:47,661
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1164
02:02:53,834 --> 02:02:56,295
I'm sorry.

1165
02:02:56,462 --> 02:02:59,840
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1166
02:03:00,007 --> 02:03:03,177
...I swear to you it's the truth.

1167
02:03:06,388 --> 02:03:09,099
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1168
02:03:11,310 --> 02:03:12,519
Oh, no!

1169
02:03:21,862 --> 02:03:25,199
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1170
02:03:25,699 --> 02:03:26,950
It's a bomb.

1171
02:03:28,118 --> 02:03:30,329
We have to get out of here. Now.

1172
02:04:07,032 --> 02:04:08,909
I have dreamed a dream...

1173
02:04:11,954 --> 02:04:15,332
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1174
02:04:26,385 --> 02:04:28,637
Here they come.

1175
02:04:28,887 --> 02:04:30,597
Let's go, Morpheus.

1176
02:04:32,015 --> 02:04:35,060
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1177
02:04:42,776 --> 02:04:45,779
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1178
02:04:45,946 --> 02:04:47,948
What?

1179
02:04:48,615 --> 02:04:50,117
I can feel them.

1180
02:05:13,057 --> 02:05:14,641
Neo!

1181
02:05:20,814 --> 02:05:24,401
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1182
02:05:29,656 --> 02:05:31,575
<i>It's the Hammer.</i>

1183
02:05:43,253 --> 02:05:45,964
He's in some kind of coma...

1184
02:05:46,131 --> 02:05:48,384
...but his vitals are stable.

1185
02:05:49,593 --> 02:05:51,512
What about you?

1186
02:05:51,678 --> 02:05:53,806
I'm fine.

1187
02:05:53,972 --> 02:05:56,350
You could use some rest.

1188
02:05:56,517 --> 02:05:58,352
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1189
02:06:05,442 --> 02:06:08,070
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1190
02:06:08,237 --> 02:06:11,115
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1191
02:06:11,281 --> 02:06:14,034
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1192
02:06:14,284 --> 02:06:17,705
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1193
02:06:18,038 --> 02:06:20,582
...until someone screwed it up.

1194
02:06:20,749 --> 02:06:23,377
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1195
02:06:23,544 --> 02:06:27,381
- Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through...

1196
02:06:27,548 --> 02:06:30,759
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1197
02:06:30,926 --> 02:06:33,762
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1198
02:06:33,929 --> 02:06:36,390
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1199
02:06:36,557 --> 02:06:38,308
Who?

1200
02:06:38,475 --> 02:06:42,187
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1201
02:06:42,354 --> 02:06:44,648
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1202
02:06:44,857 --> 02:06:45,941
You found one?

1203
02:06:47,693 --> 02:06:49,403
Only one.

1204
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:45,791
<i>Everything that has a beginning...</i>

1205
02:16:45,958 --> 02:16:47,668
<i>...has an end.</i>

1206
02:16:50,087 --> 02:16:52,965
<i>I see the end coming.</i>

1207
02:16:53,132 --> 02:16:55,384
<i>I see the darkness spreading.</i>

1208
02:16:55,551 --> 02:16:56,927
<i>I see death.</i>

1209
02:16:59,054 --> 02:17:02,057
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1210
02:17:02,224 --> 02:17:04,226
We missed you.

1211
02:17:04,393 --> 02:17:06,228
It ends tonight.

1212
02:17:13,444 --> 02:17:16,572
<i>And you are all that stands in his way.</i>

1213
02:17:18,157 --> 02:17:22,703
<i>If you cannot stop him tonight, then
I fear that tomorrow may never come.</i>
