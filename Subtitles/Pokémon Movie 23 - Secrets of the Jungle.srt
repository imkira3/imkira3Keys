if she had the chance.

[Pikachu] Pi.

Oh, look at that, buddy.

Slow down, Koko.

[Koko] The berries were
almost ripe last time.

734

[Dada] You don't have to rush,
the berries will wait.

[stomach rumbles]

761

What?

762
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,210
I'm so hungry.

763
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,590
Huh?

764
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,460
Hey.

-I think I've got a good idea.
-Huh?

It's not just good. It's a great idea.

767
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,810
We'll make one for ourselves,
a place where berries grow.

768
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,430
Huh?

769
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,980
Say, that makes sense.

770
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,770
I never thought of that.

771
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,070
Let's do it. Great idea!

772
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,570
-Really?
-There are seeds inside this thing, right?

773
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
Let's put it close to home.

774
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,870
They won't bother us.

775
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,790
And once we've got lots of berries,
we can share them with everyone!

776
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,790
Only my son would think of that.

777
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,210
[Dada] Ha, right, it's all decided.

778
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,630
[Koko] Then let's gather
what we can, and go home.

[Cramorant squawks]

796
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,590
[sighs]
Oh, but it's still a funny Pokémon.

797
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,720
Talk about not holding back.

798
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,600
True. But if Pikachu weren't like that,
it wouldn't be perfect for Team Rocket.

799
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,140
Still, there's something disconcerting
about being electrocuted from the inside.

800
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,730
It zaps me just thinkin' about it.

-Flap, flap.
-[Ash] Check it out.

-Pika! Pika!

This one's fast!

Not again.

-Are you a Pokémon trainer by chance?
-Yep.

My name's Ash, and I'm from Pallet Town.

-And this is my partner, Pikachu.

I'm Sharon, a Biotope Company researcher.

-Nice to meet you.
-"Researcher"?

818
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,360
So what are you researching here?

819
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,110
You see, we're gathering samples
to see what components the water contains.

820

Wow. Components are so cool.

You're healed.
All right now, go back home.

891
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,400
[Koko] If they find us, it could get ugly.

[Koko] All we did was borrow the spring!

The spring is our territory! Not yours!

[vine thwacks]

How dare you talk about territory
after you came and ate all of our food!

902
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,650
It's only natural for the strong
to steal from the weak.

903

I know it was wrong.

[Dada] My apologies.

I will make sure this
never happens again. Please.

927

The law is still the law.

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,010
It's too late after it's been broken.

929
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,560
Now leave at once.

[Dada] I can't believe you.

[Koko] They're the ones
that are hoarding everything!

936
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,910
Zarude will always have the Zarude law.

937
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,920
The law allows them to live.

938
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,880
Then who will care for the other
jungle Pokémon?

939
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,470
Jungle Pokémon are great. Nobody knows it.

940
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,100
Flygon picks fights, but it's so strong.
And Ninjask is super, super fast.

Is it really that bad?

944
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,690
[Dada] It is to the Zarude.

945
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,950
Then I guess I'm not a Zarude.

946
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,280
That's why I don't understand the law.

947
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,040
My hands aren't like theirs, or my skin.

948
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,620
You're wrong! You are a Zarude.

949
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,080
Then why can't I use just one single move?

950

-[Koko] Just what am I?

00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,520
Za-za!

1200
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,820
[Mayor] They say Celebi only appears
when all is peaceful.

1201
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,030
So when it doesn't show itself,

1202
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,450
it means that there could be something
very bad going on in the jungle.

1203
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,660
-Man.
-But they also tell another story.

1204
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,790
When Celebi vanishes
somewhere deep within the jungle,

1205
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,290
it's said an egg is left behind.

1206
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,840
It is also said that Celebi
brought the egg here from the future.

1207
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,760
-Yeah, from the future?
-Remember, it's a story.

1208
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,560
[Mayor] It's just that I'd like Celebi
to return to our jungle,

1209
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,560
and for all of these people
and Pokémon to have a bright future.

1210
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,810
It's because of that wish

1211
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,150
that our magnificent fireworks display
takes place.

1212

-Huh?

00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,140
[Ash] Oh, that family?

1221
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,770
-What about them?
-We'll get to see them again next time.

1222
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,400
[boy] Tomorrow? Please?

1223
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,400
[father] I don't think tomorrow
will be possible, not until you're six.

1224
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,860
"Family."

1225

-Huh? What's up?
-Pika!

1227
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,530
-[Pikachu] Pika?
-[Koko] Za, za, za.

1228
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,080
[Ash] What's wrong, Koko?

1229
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,580
-Za, za, zarude.
-You looking for something?

Za!
[grunts]

1232
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,050
[Koko] Ash, Zarude, za, za.

1233
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,590
-Uh, what was that?
-Za, zarude.

1234
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,010
Did you just ask me to come with you?

[Ash] Hey, Koko, how far are we going?

1240
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,490
Zaru-zaruza.

Skwovet! Skwovet!

Skwovet! Skwovet! Skwovet!

1246

[laughs]
That's one's a cutie.

1247
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,590
Zaru, zaru, za, zaruza?

-A Pokémon?
-Pikachu.

1254
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,610
Koko family.

1255
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,160
-Your family has a Pokémon?
-Pika.

1256
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,870
Did you use human language?

1257
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,370
[grunts]
First, you just vanish without a trace.

1258
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,040
-Now, you bring a human?
-[scoffs]

1259
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
-You knew all along.
-[gasps]

00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,300
I'm a human, aren't I?

1261
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,640
Uh… Mm…

1262

-[Koko] Come on, Dada, tell the truth!
-[grunts]

1263

I'm human just like him!
I'm not a Zarude at all, am I?

1264
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,230
Wrong! You're a Zarude!

1265
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,650
Don't lie to me!

1266
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,690
[gasps, groans]

1267
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,360
[Ash grunts, screams]

1268
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,570
Ow.

1269
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,320
What do you think's going on?

1270
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,870
-[Ash] They really do look like a family.
-[Pikachu] Pika.

1271
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,540
I brought Ash here
so I could show him to you.

1272
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,460
And there were a lot more people
like this back there.

1273
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,500
[Koko] They launched something
up into the sky that sparkled.

1274
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,220
Humans and Pokémon watched it together.
Smiled together!

1275
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,430
-Pika.
-Skwovet. Skwovet, skwovet.

1276
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,640
The Zarude can't do that,
you taught me everything!

1277
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,890
You showed me how to get food.

1278
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,100
How to run,
how to swing on vines, all of it.

1279
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,980
So why? Why didn't you
tell me about humans?

1280
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,360
[sighs]
I didn't want to make you sad.

1281
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,740
-Don't give me that!
-Uh-uh.

1282
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,200
Huh?

1283
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,460
I thought I was weird for making friends
with all the Pokémon, but that wasn't it.

1284
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,120
It was because I'm human.

1285
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,090
If it means I can be friends
with Pokémon, I'd rather be human!

1286
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,420
[gasps]

[somber music]

1289
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,140
I knew that this
would happen sooner or later.

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,180
-You're exactly right.
-[gasps]

1291
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,400
You're really a human,
and I'm not your real Dada.

1292
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,020
Now you know.

1293
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,730
Then tell me who I am!

Follow me, then.

1297
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,620
[James] Mm. It appears they put a stop
to this research ten years ago.

1298
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,080
[Jessie] Why is that?

1299
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,090
There was some sort of accident.

1300
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,340
-An accident?
-[emergency alarm blares]

1301
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:16,340
This PC seems to be riddled with security,
so we'll have to employ the doctor's PC.

1302
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,800
Didn't they warn us?

1303
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,020
Not being allowed to enter
the doctor's room is a real red flag.

1304
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,600
There's no doubt
that doc's hiding something.

When I found you, it was raining.

1309
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,870
[Dada] You were alone,
lying in a strange-looking box.

1310
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,200
And there were no other humans around.

1311
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,540
You were wearing this when I found you.

-[necklace clinks]
-Uh…

1313
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,710
Why did you take me with you?

1314
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,680
I honestly don't know.
I never knew my own family.

1315
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,550
I really never knew where I came from.

1316
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,890
You reminded me of me.
I couldn't just leave you there.

1317

[Dada] The baby in that picture is you.

1320
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,950
The two large humans
are probably your real parents.

1321
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,210
-Pipi.
-They look just like you.

1322
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:30,040
I looked everywhere,
trying to give you back to your family,

1323
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,710
and that's how I found this place.

1324
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,510
I think this was probably
your family's nest.

1325
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,800
But by the time I found it,
it already looked like this.

1326
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,510
It was then that I realized
I would be raising you myself.

1327
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,890
[Dada] Looking back, it could be
that decision was a mistake.

1328
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,860
In the end, I still made you sad.

1329

Uh-uh.

1330
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,190
So that's all. I've told you everything.

-Hmm. Yes, I did it.
-No, I get to do it .

00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,770
if there's anything nice
in the doctor's room!

1343

Be careful with that.
It's the only one we have.

00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,300
-[grumbles]
-[Jessie] No!

1354
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,350
[Jessie screams]
Hey, let go! Behave yourself!

1355
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,060
Get away from me! Grow up!

1356
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,480
Bad wacko! Go find your own device!

1357
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,770
[Jessie screaming]
Stop!

1358
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,230
Cramorant! Cramorant! Crama!

1359
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,110
-I've had enough of this.
-That thief has issues.

1360
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,700
-Blah, blah!
-Huh?

1361
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,450
[both gasp]

1362
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,120
-[Jessie, James screaming]
-[Meowth] Oh, no!

1363
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,590
Looking at the two of you,
I started thinking about my own dad.

1364
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:41,880
When I was little, I told some other kids
about my goal, and they laughed at me.

1365
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,340
But my dad told me something
I never forgot.

1366
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,350
"The map to your goal is inside yourself.

1367
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,810
If you give up, your dream's
never gonna come true."

1368
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,810
Now, being on my journey with Pikachu,
I'm starting to get what he meant.

1369
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,070
Don't let it get to you, you're family.
[grunts]

1370
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,070
You can argue,

1371
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,780
but then everything will go back
to normal in no time.

1372
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,740
I'll tell you, families sure
can be a mystery, huh?

1373
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,210
[uplifting music]

1374
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,790
-Huh? What's up?
-Za.

1375
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,500
[objects clatter]

1376
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,380
Za.

1377
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,130
What are you looking for?

1378
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,050
[object clinking]

1379
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,800
-Skwo?
-Pikachu?

1380
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,640
[gasps]
Zaru, zazaru. Zarura!

1381
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,640
Oh, yeah, you wanna find your family.

1382
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,980
[Ash grunts]
I'll help you look.

1383
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,820
-Pikachu!
-Skwovet, Skwovet. Skwovet?

1384
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,440
-[sneezes]
-[Pikachu, Ash gasp]

1385
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,780
Ah. I think I've seen this before.

1386
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,870
See? I met someone
with this mark just today.

1387
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,660
Pika!

1388
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,830
-Zaru?
-Pika.

1389
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,540
I'll bet she knows something about it.

1390
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,000
Koko…

1391
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,050
Go?

1392
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,880
Koko… go.

1393
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,380
Hm.

1394
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,760
[water rippling]

1395
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,230
Elder, is that you? This is rare.

1396
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,980
So, you've told him the truth.

1397
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,480
[Dada] I should have done that
from the start.

1398
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,820
Mm. Are you sure?

1399
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,820
How could I know anything
about being a Dada.

1400
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,700
I never had one, so I never became one.

1401
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,210
We haven't seen Celebi
in a long time, have we?

1402
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,460
Celebi?

1403
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,210
[Elder] The last time I saw it was…

1404
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,010
Ah, yes, just a little bit
before you appeared to me.

1405
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,600
[Dada] Are you saying
that this is my fault?

1406
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,230
Wait till I'm done talking, please.
[vine cracks]

1407
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,440
First, Celebi vanishes, then you appear.

1408
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,480
And then you decide to raise Koko.

1409
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,240
Don't you think there might be
a reason for these events?

1410
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,410
Huh?

1411
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,540
[Elder] You possess your own destiny.

1412
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,870
The answer is known only
to the life-giving waters.

1413
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,670
[Ash snoring]

1414
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,750
[Skwovet snoring]

1415
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,930
[gentle music]

1416
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,350
[Koko] The spring!
Let's take it to the spring!

1417
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,020
We can't! It's dangerous!

1418
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,350
[Dada] How could I ever allow that?

1419
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,560
But I'm holding a Pokémon
who needs our help now!

1420
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,770
I've got to do something!

1421
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,610
[soft sobbing]

1422
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,650
[Dada] All right.

1423
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,200
Let me have it.

1424
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,240
-There's another way we can help cure it.
-Really?

1425
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,540
It's true, now stand back.

1426
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,950
Rufflet.

1427
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,080
-[Rufflet whimpers]
-Huh?

1428
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,460
[Dada hums seriously]

1429
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,460
[vines crack]

[grand music]

1433
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,030
[Koko] Dada!

1434
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:30,530
You all right?

1435
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,820
I'm fine.

1436
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,030
That move really takes it out of you.

1437
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,780
-Rufflet.
-Huh?

1438
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,120
Ruff… Ruff? Rufflet!

1439
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,040
Ruff? Rufflet!

1440
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,710
Wow, you're all better now, aren't you?

1441
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:47,040
-[Rufflet cheering]
-That's incredible!

1442
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,550
How did you do that? Tell me.

1443
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:53,840
It's quite an amazing move
that only certain Zarude are able to use.

1444
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,220
Ask the jungle for help
and it lends you its power.

1445
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,600
But, son, if you use it too much,
it can drain away your life force.

1446
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,900
So use it only
when you absolutely need to.

1447
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,610
Thanks so much, Dada.

1448
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,070
[sighs]

1449
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,200
[lively music]

1450

[lively music continues]

1451
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,940
Uh, delicious Pokémon food.

1452
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,400
There's no one here
to scoff it down but us.

1453
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:57,450
-Pokémon food gives me gas.
-Just search for the winged wacko!

-[Wobbuffet mutters]
-Huh?

1455
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,780
-[James] Who?
-[Jessie] Huh?

1456
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,200
[Meowth] Twerp dead ahead.

1457
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,410
-What would he be doing here?
-Who knows?

00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,840
-[Sharon] Right this way, please.
-[gasps]

1461
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,840
Pika!

1462
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,720
-Look at all this stuff.
-It is impressive.

1463
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,350
-[Ash] Yeah.
-[hums sneakily]

1464
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,140
You sit in those things.

1465
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,850
[sniffs]

1466
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,270
-Za.
-[Zed] Sorry for the wait.

1467
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,860
I am the head of this laboratory.

1468
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,440
My name is Zed.
You have a question for me?

1469
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,110
Uh-huh. My name's Ash,
and this is my partner, Pikachu.

1470
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,740
-Pikachu!
-And this is Koko.

1471
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,830
-Uh…
-[Ash] See.

1472
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,740
We're looking for these people.

1473
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,580
-You know 'em?
-[Zed] Let me see.

1474
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,210
[Ash] We thought they might be
working here at your lab.

1475
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,630
We think it's a picture
of Koko's real parents.

1476
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,250
I wanna reunite them.

1477
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,840
-[Zed] Where did you get this?
-Huh?

1478
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,930
[sighs]

1479
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,760
Then this is Al?

1480
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,300
[all gasp in surprise]

1481
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,760
[Ash] Al?

1482
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,680
The two adults
are Mr. and Mrs. Molybdenum.

1483
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,020
-They used to run this lab.
-[digital clicking]

1484
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,020
And the child they're holding…

1485
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:14,270
-[Koko grunts]
-…is Al, their son.

1486
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Huh?

1487
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,530
Those two were the leaders
of the Healing Spring Research Team.

1488
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,660
You see, the spring
was considered only a legend.

1489
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,790
Although a large number
of research labs pursued it,

1490
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,620
they never actually found it.

1491
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,170
[Zed] However, these two were able
to discover it in the jungle,

1492
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,260
and they even obtained a water sample,
a historic breakthrough.

1493
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,840
-Skwovet?
-Za, zaruza.

1494
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,050
-Ah, um…
-Uh, ah, apologies.

1495
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,720
-Is that really true?
-Correct.

1496
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:50,980
That pendant definitely belonged
to the Molybdenums.

1497
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,810
[Zed] Sharon, scanner, please.

1498
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,150
[Sharon] Yes, sir.

1499
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,900
[Zed] Al, would you mind?

1500
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,990
-[Koko] Ah! Za, za!
-[Zed] Huh? What's the problem?

1501
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,450
Koko was brought up by a Pokémon.

1502
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,910
-He's not good at people language.
-He was what?

1503
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,000
[Zed] Raised by Pokémon?

1504
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,000
But it means he's able
to talk to other Pokémon.

1505
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,250
Unbelievable.

1506
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:14,750
-Doctor, here you go.
-Thank you.

1507
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,550

00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,750
Pikachu's around. We'll catch him later.

1667
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,670
But the only time to crash
Big Mouth's room is when he's not in it.

1668
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:38,510
-I'll be, sound logic.
-So, let's get in the groove and move!

Come on, Dada, tell me, what do we do?

-[metal clonks]
-Huh?

1675
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,990
No good.

1676
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:07,450
Pikachu your tail,
if I can bite through it.

-[both grunting]
-Ash?

1678

Hang on, we're gonna get you outta here.

1679
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:17,710
And rescue the Pokémon,
your dad too, and the jungle too!

1680
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,880
I'm not giving up until we win.

[chuckles]

1684
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,350
They're coming here for one thing,
and that's the Heart Tree.

1685
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,520
[Alpha] I want the rest of you
to report back to the Elder.

1686
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,980
-What about you?
-I'll stop them in their tracks.

1687
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:40,070
Great.

1688
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:45,360
Now, would you like to go
along with me on a little rampage,

1689
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:46,950
just for old times' sake?

1690
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,830
Hmm, good idea.

1691
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,910
If we don't, they'll tear our home apart.

[struggled grunting]

-[researcher] Huh?

Straight from the cab's radio.

Thanks.

On the contrary,

in the center.

My objective isn't the spring.

1810

[Zed] Healing power is nothing more

1811

than bits of energy carried by water
rushing through the tree.

1812
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:43,220
My objective is the tree itself.

1813

And to that end…

1814

01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:10,120
[Alpha] How do we protect
the tree without fighting?

1823
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:11,540
Hmm, but…

1824
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,790
[Alpha] We are Zarude!
We are the strong ones!

1825
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,380
We have no fear!

1826
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,510
The jungle's lifeblood,
lift up your voices!

1827

[Zarude troop growling]

1828
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,590
-Amazing.
-Pika.

1829
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,680
Let's go! For The Heart Tree!

1830
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,680
[thrilling music]

1831
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,310
[Zarude troop] Zarude!

1832
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:33,520
-[Ash] Pikachu, let's go too!
-[Pikachu] Pika!

1833
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,940
Dada, you just rest here.

1834
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,440
[grunts]

1835
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:39,190
Take the human child and run.

1836
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,400
You can't win this.

1837
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:44,410
But the jungle Pokémon,
what happens to them?

1838
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:46,870
I just couldn't bear to lose you.

1839
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:51,080
I know that. That's why I fight!

1840

-[grunts]
-Koko!

1841

-Pika!
-[steady breathing]

[groans]

1843
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:59,630
[Dada] I should have known.

1844
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,760
How can I protect the Pokémon…

1845
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:07,310
protect our home, protect everyone?

1846
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:10,850
How can I protect Koko?

1847
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:15,400
-[squawks aggressively]
-Oh, oh, what did I do to you?

1848
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,940
Stop, Braviary! He saved Rufflet!

1849
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,860
[Dada] That's right! Now go away!

1850
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,990
The nerve, not even a thank you.

1851
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:27,490
They're together again,
that's the important thing.

1852
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:30,240
Families are remarkable.

1853
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:32,250
-Huh?
-You saw it.

1854
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:35,250
It knew I was a Zarude,
and yet it still attacked.

1855
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:38,000
Braviary threw caution to the wind.

1856
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:41,760
That Rufflet should be pleased
with family like that.

1857
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,760
But what about you?

1858
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,470
Who knows, Koko.

1859
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:49,310
There aren't many around
who are stronger than me.

1860
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:50,640
You're right.

1861
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,020
But, if the time were ever to come…

1862
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,100
[Dada] If the time were ever to come…

1863
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:00,860
all I can do is fight.

1864
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,280
Yes, but aren't you taking this too far?

1865

-[grunts]
-[Sharon gasps]

1866
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,990
[Zed] I've gone over this
in my mind, over and over.

1867
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:10,790
[grunts]
So why did they do this?

1868
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:14,540
Humans and Pokémon
share the same life force.

1869
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:17,330
[Zed] Why won't they understand
mine is the correct path?

1870
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,170
It's right here under their noses!

1871
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,920
[water gushing]

1872
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,840
You're all the same.

1873
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:30,010
[Zarude troop taunting]

1874
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,970
Zarude. Lots of them.

1875
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:36,100
-[researcher 1] "Zarude"?
-[researcher 2] They've come for revenge.

1876
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:39,440
[Sharon] We've rekindled their rage.

1877
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,070
Dr. Zed, now look at what you've done!

1878
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,780
We're sorry. We'll be leaving right away.

1879
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,070
-[pilot groans]
-[all gasp]

1880
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:51,120
[Zed] We will not be leaving.
I will show you the truth path.

1881
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,040
I'm afraid your parents
made the wrong decision, Al!

1882
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,870
-[gasps]
-And they paid

1883
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,080
the ultimate price in the end.

1884
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:03,800
-Boss. I think I deserve an explanation.
-Look, Zed.

1885
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,090
It turns out the source
of the healing power

1886
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:08,510
is a great body of energy within the tree.

1887
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:12,560
But there are Pokémon called Zarude
who live on that giant tree.

1888
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,770
There's no doubt that tree
is special to the Zarude.

1889
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:17,730
I ask you to reconsider.

1890
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:20,860
We've searched for it so long,
and now we've found it!

1891
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,650
We're suspending operations
until we find a way to resolve this for

1892
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,650
-the good of both humans and Pokémon.
-[grunts]

1893
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,320
Stopping for a bunch of Pokémon?
What is the matter with you?

1894
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:35,160
Humans and Pokémon
share the same life force.

1895
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,910
We share the same world.

1896
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,960
I'm making the right decision, Zed.
I know it.

1897
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:46,010
[James] Here's a video blog
from ten years ago.

Operations are suspended
on the Healing Spring Project,

1902
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,770
though we could save countless people
with the power of that spring.

[grumbles]

[Zed aggressively breathing]

1908

If I were in charge, I could lead
this research down the path to truth.

1909
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,120
My way is correct!

1910
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,710
If only I had the power,

1911
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:26,380
I could prove to everyone
that my way is the right way.

1912
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,260
Yes, yes, I can.

All for the best.

I will never give up.

1931

I will revive this research
no matter what it takes.

-How could he do that?
-It's so cruel.

1937
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,880
I never knew any of this.

1938
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,840
Al, you were a fortunate miscalculation
on my part.

1939
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,550
But if you insist on intruding,
I will show no mercy to you or the Zarude!

[Dada] I don't have the right
to ask anything of you.

But I have to do my best to help Koko.

and I must do something.

No matter what happens,
I have to do my best to protect Koko.

You are the friends Koko
is so very proud of.

Flygon, he says you pick a lot of fights,
but you're strong.

1957
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:12,540
He says Ninjask is the fastest Pokémon
in the jungle.

1958
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:17,170
And he says that Cottonee
stick together, and don't let go.

1959
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:21,510
I know the Zarude can't win
this fight by ourselves.

But if you combine your strengths
with the Zarude,

1961
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:28,770
I think we could save
both Koko and the jungle.

Please!

01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,290
have even a chance to stop me?

Course, we do!
Because we're working together!

Of course, the trees are the Pokémon,

What's wrong?

2048
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:50,530
Hmm. Earlier, the water
inside the Heart Tree

2049
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:54,740
was forced out, and its power
may have been weakened.

Oh, no. How do I…

Why are you still talking like that?

2066
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:45,960
I've wondered for a long time

whether I was capable of being
a parent or not, but now…

Now what?

I'll tell you one thing.

01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:13,410
If someone I couldn't defeat
ever really were to appear…

01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,570
[Koko] Yeah?

2078
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:18,450
I'd have to protect you
by whatever means necessary.

[Dada] You know, I think
I finally got it figured out.

I already was a father.

2089
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:52,780
To be a parent is to have something

2090
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:56,870
that's even more important
than one's own self.

[Elder] Koko, that isn't possible.

You heard it straight from his mouth.

You are a human.

Nuh-uh, I'm a Zarude. I'm my Dada's son!

And I'm going to save my Dada.

Hold on.

2117
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,300
I think the control system
is on the machine's back.
