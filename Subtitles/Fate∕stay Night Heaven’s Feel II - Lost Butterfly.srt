Saber!

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
Saber!

7
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,170
Saber!

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,610
Saber...

9
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,990
Thank goodness. You're o—

10
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,500
Saber!

11
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,730
Why am I back here?

12
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,630
What...

13
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,550
are you?

14
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,720
Wh-What is...

15
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,580
...an investigation underway.

16
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,090
However, when the police arrived
this morning, they discovered...

17
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:17,090
Today's Topic

18
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:17,090
Partial Cave-in on Enzou Mountain, Fuyuki City

19
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,170
Uhm, Senpai.

20
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,130
Senpai?

21
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,590
Oh, what is it?

29
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,810
Well, Saber-san returned to
her country rather suddenly, didn't she?

30
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,140
Yeah.

31
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,910
But now you don't have to
go out at night anymore, right?

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,870
You don't have to put yourself
in harm's way anymore, right?

33
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,550
Well,

34
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,180
you misunderstand, Sakura.

35
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,600
I wasn't tagging along with Saber's errands.

36
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,600
She was tagging along with mine.

37
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,520
I may be out of the house even more now.

38
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,740
Could you stop waiting for me
by the door when I'm running late?

39
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,160
This is still far from over.

40
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,370
There's still someone in this town

41
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,050
I have to settle the score with.

Ryuudou Temple.

197
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,770
What's that shadow-looking thing's end goal here?

198
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,360
How does it tie back to Zouken?

199
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,070
Is it working under him?

200
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,820
Nah, he's gotta be using it.

201
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:32,410
Welcome to Fuyuki

202
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,120
I'd better hear Tohsaka's thoughts, too.

203
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,670
uki

204
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,670
What?

205
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,380
Oh, you're alive, Mister!

206
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,020
Tell me your name.

207
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,440
What's your name?

208
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,030
I'm Shirou. Emiya Shirou.

209
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,030
Shirou!

210
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,700
Shirou. You're Shirou!

211
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,660
Got it.

212
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,580
Huzzah!

213
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,130
Whoa—H-Hold on a sec!

214
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,590
Don't forget that we're enemies, Illyasviel!

215
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,220
Just call me Illya.

216
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,390
Masters are only allowed to fight at night, right?

217
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,060
I'm here because I wanna chat with you.

218
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,480
Look, chopping a guy in half isn't really
a good way to get them to talk with you.

219
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,940
What do you mean?
That's completely separate.

220
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,900
You were the one who came flying at me
despite how weak you were.

221
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,910
I could kill you on the spot if I chose to.

222
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,580
Without Saber, you wouldn't last a heartbeat.

223
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,340
And...

224
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,590
I've been waiting all this time.

225
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,220
You could at least give me this, right?

226
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,430
You live in that castle in the forest, right, Illya?

227
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,440
All alone?

228
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,690
I have Sella and Liz with me.

229
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,650
I had to pull a fast one on Sella
to come meet you today.

230
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,490
You should feel honored.

231
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,320
Uh-huh...

232
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,080
Can I ask you one more thing?

233
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,410
Does the name "Emiya Kiritsugu" ring a bell?

234
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,920
Illya?

235
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,470
It doesn't. Never heard it before.

236
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,350
I don't know it.

237
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,230
I'm going back.

238
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,940
Illya!

239
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,860
Huh?

240
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,860
Emiya-kun?

241
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,330
Tohsaka.

242
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,630
What a happy coincidence.
I wanted to have a chat with you, too.

243
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,180
Why not do it at school?

244
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,140
Archer, could you make us some tea?

245
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,890
No?

246
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,100
What's with the long face?

247
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,730
Fine, have it your way!

248
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,280
Huh?

249
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,490
Aren't those...?

250
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,540
What are you doing?

251
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,920
Come on, let's get strategizing.

252
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,230
I need to get dinner ready.

253
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,700
Sakura's got a fever and you only tell me now?!

254
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,700
You wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise!

255
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,830
It isn't locked?

256
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,330
Sakura, you up?

257
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,140
Emiya-kun?

258
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,180
For crying out...

259
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,080
Shinji! Let her go right now!

260
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,500
Shinji!

261
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,340
Don't worry, Sakura.

262
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,170
I won't kill him.

263
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,010
But I may need to get a little rough.

264
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,930
Fight Rider.

265
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,060
If you make it out in one piece, she's free to go.

266
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,440
Go get him, Rider.

267
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,110
If you seriously intended to fight,

268
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,070
you shouldn't have come alone.

269
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,280
What's up, Emiya?

270
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,740
Don't be lame and go down that easily, now!

271
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,960
Your endurance has won you this battle.

272
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,430
Looking good. No need to hold back anymore.

273
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,680
It's time to get lethal, Rider!

274
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,980
Nii-san, don't!

275
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,330
Sakura.

276
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,090
Senpai...

277
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,940
Why... How?

278
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,490
Magecraft...

279
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,360
Rider!

280
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,900
Fucking kill him!

281
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,680
What?

282
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,060
T-Tohsaka...

283
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,020
Why?

284
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,110
Emiya-kun and I formed an alliance.

285
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,320
We've been together all day.

286
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,910
Now that you've dragged Sakura into this,

287
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,660
you've made an enemy out of me as well.

288
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,920
Sakura...

289
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,710
Sakura this, Sakura that, Sakura...

290
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,790
It's always Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

291
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,090
Who gives a shit about her?!

292
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,470
I was chosen as a Master, not her!

293
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,470
Get up, Rider!

294
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,640
You piece of...

295
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,520
No...

296
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,990
Rider, no...

297
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,820
Make it stop!

298
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,410
Sakura—

299
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,790
Emiya-kun, get down!

300
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,220
No way...

301
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,310
Is that really Rider?

302
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,190
Now that's more like it, Rider!

303
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,450
Wipe the floor with them!

304
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,200
Hey, Rider!

305
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,250
So that's how it is.

306
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,500
The Matou bloodline has dried up.

307
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
They can't produce anyone who can use magecraft.

308
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,800
I figured Zouken summoned Rider
and handed her over to Shinji,

309
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,100
but in truth, it was much simpler than that.

310
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,810
Tohsaka?

311
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,480
The person most suitable to be
a Master in the Matou family now...

312
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,190
That would be the Matous' legitimate heir,
their magus of this generation.

313
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,740
And that would be you, Sakura.

314
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,910
Sakura's a Master?

315
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:26,710
You transferred your Command Spells and
used one to make her obey Shinji's orders, huh?

316
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,170
That's how Shinji became Rider's Master.

317
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,840
Hey.

318
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,090
And in exchange you forfeited
your rights as a Master,

319
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,100
making you just another magus.

320
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,390
Where do you think you're looking?

321
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:49,610
That little trick was only possible because the Matous
created the Command Spells. Right, Sakura?

322
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,910
Hey! I'm right here!

323
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,330
We still have unfinished business!

324
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,460
One more time, Sakura!

325
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,630
Give me command rights again!

326
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,630
What's with this dumbass goody-two-shoes act?!

327
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,640
You still have one Command Spell! Just use that!

328
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,520
Shinji, if she runs out of Command Spells,
Rider will be free.

329
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,520
At that point, even a tome
would just burn up immediately.

330
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,900
You were controlling her
with borrowed Command Spells.

331
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,240
You were never a Master in the first place.

332
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,000
Shinji...

333
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,630
Yeah, I knew.

334
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,800
I knew! I damn well knew, okay?!

335
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,010
I knew I wasn't cut out for it!

336
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,310
So you have to do it.

337
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,440
You have to kill them in my stead, Sakura.

338
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,070
No, Nii-san.

339
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,620
Let's stop this.

340
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,080
You broke your promise.

341
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,460
You said you wouldn't kill Senpai!

342
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,330
So let's end this!

343
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,750
All right, fine.

344
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,510
You can die with them for all I care.

345
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,900
Sakura!

346
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,320
Senpai... no...

347
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,150
Don't look at me...

348
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,540
Sakura...

349
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,670
Looks like she's lost control.

350
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,350
Get away from here!

351
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,010
If she gets struck with mana
the wrong way, she won't turn back!

352
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,940
Don't get in my way.

353
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,650
Listen to me, Rider!

354
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,360
Your lord has gone out of control.

355
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,820
If we don't deal with this,
she'll burn through all her mana and die!

356
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,280
Then we need only provide her
with mana faster than she loses it.

357
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,410
Looks like swapping lords
did little to change your nature!

358
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,140
A bounded field?

359
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,270
Stop...

360
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,610
Please stop, Rider...

361
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:25,240
This isn't what I summoned you for!

362
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,410
I can't obey that order.

363
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,040
I must prioritize your life above all else.

364
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,230
No way...

365
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,320
Mystic Eyes of Petrification!

366
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,230
Tohsaka!

367
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,790
Tohsaka!

368
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,480
No!

369
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,030
Sakura...

370
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,210
Sakura!

371
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,590
Emiya-kun, how are you feeling?

372
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,260
Tohsaka!

373
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,850
Awake at last, I see.

374
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,770
I have just finished treating Matou Sakura.

375
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,780
Is Sakura...

376
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
Is Sakura okay?

377
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,030
Calm down.

378
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,070
Rider and I brought her here.

379
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,530
Kirei, how's Sakura's condition?

380
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,370
Not stable, but her life is
no longer in immediate danger.

381
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,420
Wait a second. What happened to your Magic Crest?

382
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:53,050
I had no choice but to use it all to treat Matou Sakura.

383
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,890
All of it?

384
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,560
Now, about the results of my treatment...

385
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,020
Crest Worms?

386
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,820
What are those? Uh...

387
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,910
Think of them as living Magic Circuits.

388
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,200
Once a Crest Worm sinks its teeth into you,

389
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:21,080
it penetrates the entire body, eating your life away.

390
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,380
It pierces and dampens the skin with its mucus,

391
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,550
sating its hunger by elevating
and destroying the pleasure centers.

392
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:39,100
As a result, any woman preyed upon by these insects

393
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,110
will be entirely violated in both body and mind.

394
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,690
Matou Sakura is no excep—

395
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,860
That's enough!

396
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:54,200
I thought you required an explanation.

397
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:02,870
As long as those things remain within her body,
her life force—her mana—will be leeched without end.

398
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,710
Left alone, she will lose her life.

399
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,090
But you said the surgery succeeded!

400
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,170
Not entirely.

401
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,340
She has been in this state for eleven years.

402
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,930
One wrong move during the extraction,
and her body will give out.

403
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,150
To fully remove the Crest Worms would truly
require a miracle akin to the Holy Grail.

404
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,740
Tohsaka...

405
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,540
As Fuyuki's supervisor, I have to dispose of her.

406
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,930
Dispose of her? Matou Sakura, you mean?

407
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,470
Yes. A magus who's lost control
of their power can't be allowed to live.

408
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,730
She's nothing but an insane Master now.

409
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,820
Will you go through with that,
even if she is your sister by blood?

410
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,950
Sister?

411
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,830
The Tohsakas actually bore two children.

412
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,800
But magecraft can only be passed down to one.

413
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,510
I inherited the magecraft of the Tohsakas.

414
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,930
Sakura was adopted by the dying
Matou family as heir to the Makiri line.

415
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,600
Then—

416
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,900
Sakura and I are blood-related sisters.

417
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,860
Not that we've ever treated each other as such.

418
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,200
Wait, Tohsaka.

419
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,990
That's all the more reason to...

420
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:10,540
If we leave her be, history will just repeat itself.

421
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,800
Except it'll be random passersby
paying the price this time.

422
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,060
So I have to kill her before that happens.

423
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,100
You win, Sakura.

424
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Here, have this.

425
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,260
This makes the second time I've received
something important from someone special.

426
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,750
Sakura...

427
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,580
I have to find her before Tohsaka does.

428
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,670
But once I do, what do I...

429
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,300
Good evening, Shirou.

430
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,190
I thought we were supposed to fight at night.

431
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,610
You're not a Master anymore.

432
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,400
I already know everything that happened.

433
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,360
Rider's Master collapsed,
and now there's only two left.

434
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:49,790
You want to save Rider's Master,
but can't find her, right?

435
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,080
I know!

436
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
You look like you're on the verge of tears.

437
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,600
Illya, aren't you angry at me?

438
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,810
No, I'm not.

439
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,350
I'm on your side.

440
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,360
You're on my side?

441
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,870
When you asked about Kiritsugu this morning,
I lied. I actually do know him.

442
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:39,000
I was born to win the Holy Grail War,
but my personal goal was to kill you and Kiritsugu.

443
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,460
But I've changed my mind.

444
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,800
If you want to protect someone dear to you,

445
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,600
I'll be on your side.

446
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,770
It's only natural to want to
protect the girl you like, is it not?

447
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,730
I know all about it.

448
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,930
Now I've lost every last place I can call home...

449
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,030
Sakura.

450
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,490
Senpai...

451
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,410
Sakura.

452
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,540
Let's go home.

453
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,460
You're still not over your cold, right?

454
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,380
I can't.

455
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,630
That potion back then wasn't poisonous or anything.

456
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,220
It was just a medicine that heightens my senses.

457
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:20,230
It took that little for me
to lose my mind and hurt you!

458
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,360
I'm not hurt one bit.

459
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,610
I'm perfectly fine.

460
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,950
I'm a magus of the Matou family—I hid that from you.

461
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,370
I never told you I was a Master, either.

462
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:41,540
I only started going to your house
out of fear for my grandfather!

463
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,670
I lied to you the whole time,
only pretending I wanted to help you!

464
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,760
I always thought

465
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,600
that I didn't deserve to be by your side.

466
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:04,730
Every time I thought that, I considered leaving
and just pretending I didn't know you the next day.

467
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,570
If we saw each other in the hallway,
I'd just walk right past you.

468
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,200
I'd also make sure to ignore you after school.

469
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,910
Then I'd go home and forget everything again.

470
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
But I couldn't!

471
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,960
It was scarier than when I tried cutting myself.

472
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,550
I was too scared to deceive you,
and too scared to stop!

473
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,970
Everything around me scared me.

474
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,850
I couldn't take a single step.

475
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,190
I didn't know what to do!

476
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:52,530
I didn't want to let go of the times we shared...

477
00:34:53,990 --> 00:35:02,290
Nothing else in life ever held any meaning to me.

478
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,010
She's all I want to protect.

479
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
The one I hold most dear.

480
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,180
If I want her to stop shedding tears...

481
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:29,270
If nobody else will blame Sakura,
if she has to do it herself...

482
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,070
I'll take her by the hand
and drag her into the sunlight.

483
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,030
Even if no one else will forgive her...

484
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,420
I'll forgive you in your stead.

485
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,880
Come on, don't cry.

486
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,760
I know full well what a bad person you are.

487
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,940
I don't know when I'll lose my mind like that again.

488
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,690
I'm sure I'll end up doing something I'll regret.

489
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,110
What kind of home could there be
for someone like me?

490
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,040
This is your home.

491
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,760
I... I...

492
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,510
I'm not a virgin.

493
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,730
My first time was long, long ago.

494
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:57,360
And to top it off, these weird things
have been touching me since.

495
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,950
I don't deserve your protection!

496
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,000
I'll protect you.

497
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,420
No matter what happens,
even if you feel like ending everything,

498
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,550
I'll be there to protect you, Sakura.

499
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,510
Senpai...

500
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,560
I'll be your personal superhero.

501
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,820
No, Senpai.

502
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,240
If you do that, I'll end up hurting you.

503
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,040
You'll get hurt.

504
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,960
Let's go home.

505
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,980
Sakura.

506
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,740
Nee-san...

507
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,080
Tohsaka-senpai...

508
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,180
Emiya Shirou.

509
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,900
If you plan to uphold your
prior convictions, then so be it.

510
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,230
I know where that leads.

511
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,660
But if you choose to follow this path,
Emiya Shirou will have no future.

512
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,330
You will lose absolutely everything.

513
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,720
You must be tired.

514
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,180
Get a good night's sleep.

515
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,350
Okay.

516
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,310
What's wrong, Sakura?

517
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,690
You got a fever?

518
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,690
Well, you were getting soaked out there.

519
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,320
It's... not a cold...

520
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,740
I'm running a bit low on mana.

521
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,420
Is there anything I can do for you?

522
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,210
Uhm...

523
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,130
Uhm...

524
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,970
Could you...

525
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,720
No, all I need is a little bit of your blood.

526
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,180
Uh-huh...

527
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,770
Will this work?

528
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,440
Yes.

529
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,680
You good now?

530
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,850
Great.

531
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,980
Then, uh...

532
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,690
Good night.

533
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,730
Good night.

534
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,000
No.

535
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,000
Any more than this,

536
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,290
and I'll just hurt him...

537
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,870
Sakura, can you prep the soup stock?

538
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,490
Sure.

539
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,290
What should we do with the spinach?

540
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,420
Let's dress it with sesame seeds.

541
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,080
Sakura, eggs please.

542
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,130
Here.

543
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,300
Thanks for the food.

544
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,940
Feels like it's been a while since we've done this.

545
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,770
Indeed.

546
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,030
Not gonna eat?

547
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,200
No need to be shy.

548
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,450
We don't need to absorb nutrients like you do.

549
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,580
Really? Saber ate a bunch.

550
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,790
Yup!

551
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,340
Your customs and I do not mix.

552
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,800
Oh, well, in that case...

553
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,690
So, about our plans moving forward.

554
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,400
I want Sakura to win and use the Holy Grail.

555
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,110
But I think she should stay holed up inside.

556
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,410
It's too dangerous to have her
see Zouken face-to-face.

557
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,960
Your assessment is correct.

558
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,670
But how do you plan to defeat that magus?

559
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,470
I propose we work with other Masters.

560
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,970
Who else is left?

561
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,520
Tohsaka and Archer, you and Rider...

562
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,770
Zouken has Assassin...

563
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,770
Other than that, there's Illya and...

564
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,860
Berserker...

565
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,870
Will you be okay?

566
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,830
Yeah, probably.

567
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,750
Don't go outside, okay?

568
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,130
Are you regretting this?

569
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,390
After all that's happened, I can't regret anything.

570
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:25,520
Rider, if it gets too dangerous, bring Senpai home.

571
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,230
But Sakura,

572
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,360
I believe the priest warrants
more caution than that old man.

573
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,410
You're right.

574
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,910
I was actually thinking the same thing.

575
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,410
But don't worry, Rider.

576
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:52,130
He doesn't stand a chance against me.

577
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,590
All right, then.

578
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,470
Senpai...

579
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,450
That's it. I just have to make sure
he doesn't go outside anymore.

580
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,330
Then he'll never be in danger again.

581
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:21,680
Huh? What am I thinking?

582
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,580
Well, this poses a problem.

583
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,880
Am I supposed to follow it?

584
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,930
Huh?

585
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,980
It's gone.

586
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,410
What's it doing here?

587
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,540
You're a cowardly Servant, not unlike your lord.

588
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,960
Neither of you are willing to fight me.

589
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,420
Your life is simply too precious to you.

590
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,220
Indeed it is,

591
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,890
for I seek immortality.

592
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,470
Behold my body.

593
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:39,600
It's prone to rot, emits a foul odor, and is quick
to lose all my accumulated knowledge.

594
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,240
Can you comprehend the pain of rotting alive?

595
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,120
No human exists who does not fear death.

596
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:58,670
But if it will grant my wish,

597
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:05,760
I'd be more than happy to kill off
every human in the world, one by one.

598
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,720
I'm floored.

599
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,100
How could you have lost sight
of yourself this badly, Makiri?

600
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,480
Remember our precious wish.

601
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,530
Remember what led us to long for a miracle.

602
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:36,540
Remember why we humans attempted to
reach a domain man cannot tread.

603
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,840
That was an impressive recital for a mere puppet.

604
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,550
But you may have taken imitating
your ancestors too much to heart.

605
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,840
Enough of this tomfoolery.

606
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:58,810
I, the great Matou Zouken, have come
to claim the Einzberns' Holy Grail.

607
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,630
No, Berserker!

608
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,580
Tohsaka? How come?

609
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,910
I see great minds think alike, huh?

610
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,860
You've gotta be kidding!

611
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,460
Get away from there!

612
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,550
If that thing catches you, there's no coming back!

613
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,320
And so it's decided.

614
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,900
I leave the rest in your hands.

615
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,700
Don't squander this opportunity
to erase that Einzbern girl.

616
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,920
Berserker!

617
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,010
Illya!

618
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:57,570
Archer, I swear...

619
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,910
Berserker...

620
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,760
If you want to touch them,
you'll have to go through me first.

621
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,600
Archer.

622
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,020
I'm counting on you.

623
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,510
This is the end for you.

624
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:15,440
Even the purest of Heroic Spirits
cannot resist that mass of curses.

625
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,320
As you are now, you're no different
from the vengeful spirits filling this forest.

626
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,380
Berserker!

627
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,020
This is bad.

628
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,190
Berserker...

629
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,360
Berserker...

630
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,860
Berserker!

631
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:50,630
No...

632
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,380
No!

633
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,630
I have fulfilled my duty.

634
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,970
You may handle the rest.

635
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,220
You have my gratitude.

636
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,430
Now I can make up for my blunder.

637
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,650
Saber!

638
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,500
Illya!

639
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:22,770
That's as far as you go.

640
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,600
You've served your purpose.

641
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,490
Can't even kill one little boy without
one of your fancy surprise attacks?

642
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:37,860
Pathetic.

643
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,910
How did you manage to get here?

644
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,790
I wonder.

645
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:46,830
Archer!

646
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,540
Hurry!

647
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,500
If that thing catches up to you, you're done for.

648
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,520
We can talk later. Run, boy!

649
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:09,650
Now that you've taken Illya's hand,
you'd better hold on to it 'til the end!

650
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,400
Let's go!

651
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,180
How?

652
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,180
How can you still move?

653
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,350
Surely you know!

654
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,270
Unlike the others, I am no upstanding hero.

655
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:56,820
As I am not pure, I can tolerate
a certain amount of taint.

656
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,280
I am, myself, a twisted Heroic Spirit!

657
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,890
Good job, Archer!

658
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,430
You can go back to spirit form now.

659
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:29,640
Let's hurry and get out—

660
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:31,440
Tohsak—

661
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:32,440
Huh?

662
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:40,780
No...

663
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,410
Archer!

664
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,160
Tohsaka!

665
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,840
Get moving already, you fools!

666
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:09,350
It's gathering mana.

667
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,100
At this rate, we'll...

668
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:16,020
Tohsaka, run!

669
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:28,830
I am the bone of my sword.

670
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:31,950
Steel is my body.

671
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:38,380
I have created over a thousand blades.

672
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:47,340
Rho Aias!

673
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:47,340
The Seven Rings that Cover the Fiery Heavens

674
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,720
Shirou...

675
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,350
Why?

676
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,810
Sh-Shirou!

677
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,940
Shirou!

678
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:42,940
Shirou!

679
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,200
This is as far as I go.

680
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,790
You did great, Tohsaka.

681
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,690
Are you sure about this?

682
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,240
If you go through with that, you will...

683
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:30,490
I don't have to think twice about it.

684
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:34,030
If I sit idly by, two will disappear.

685
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,410
But by doing this, one will certainly be saved.

686
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,930
I'm home, Sakura.

687
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,100
Oh, right.

688
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,930
Yeah, I guess this isn't really a pretty look.

689
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,650
I, uh, got a bit of a scratch.

690
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,530
It looks worse than it actually is
'cause it's all wrapped up,

691
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,030
but it's nothing to worry about.

692
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,870
Oh, I ran into Tohsaka while I was there.

693
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,160
She helped me out, so we agreed to a ceasefire.

694
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:21,620
And this girl here is Illya.

695
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,380
Uhm, sorry to spring this on you...

696
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,170
Sakura?

697
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,760
Can you move your arm?

698
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:35,970
No.

699
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:37,720
Not surprised.

700
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:42,190
It's downright insane to transplant
a Servant's body parts onto a human.

701
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:45,020
Listen closely.

702
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:49,690
If you use that arm even once,
Archer's Magic Circuits will activate.

703
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:54,200
Your body can't withstand that influx of mana,

704
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,160
so it'll collapse from the inside out.

705
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,200
Then this cloth is...

706
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,790
It's a seal.

707
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:07,710
Thanks a bunch, Tohsaka.

708
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:11,130
Huh? Where'd that come from?

709
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,470
I only plan on teaming up with you
until we've dealt with Zouken,

710
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:20,140
and it's simply more convenient
for me to have her in sight.

711
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:25,350
I'm glad you're also keeping Sakura in mind.

712
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,940
Look, that's not what—

713
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,990
I'm glad I became a Master. Else we would've
never even known about each other.

714
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:40,240
That's where you're wrong.

715
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:47,750
I don't know about you, but I've been
aware of you for quite a while now.

716
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,800
It was about four years ago, I'd say.

717
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:57,800
You were doing running high jumps until sundown.

718
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,560
I was there.

719
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:06,310
There was this idiot who
kept trying jumps he couldn't do.

720
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:08,980
And I was gawking at him like one, too.

721
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:15,650
It's in my nature to give up
the moment I decide I can't do something.

722
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,910
I'm rather cold at heart.

723
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,330
But, you know, I'm a magus.

724
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:26,500
Right when I was contemplating
if that was what I wanted to do in life,

725
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:30,090
I ran straight into my polar opposite.

726
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:31,880
It really threw me for a loop.

727
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,730
Don't take them.

728
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,410
Don't take my memories from me.

729
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,380
Ow.

730
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:30,230
Who knows? Maybe it'll be the same
as always once I take the cloth off...

731
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:53,960
No...

732
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:00,180
This is not good.

733
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,310
Shirou.

734
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,570
I have a question for you.

735
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:23,450
Sakura's at her happiest when you're there for her.

736
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:26,660
She holds no other wishes.

737
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:30,910
I want her to live past this war.

738
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:34,790
I've grown rather fond of her.

739
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:43,930
Shirou, will you be on Sakura's side?

740
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,640
No matter what may come?

741
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:55,270
Senpai...

742
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:00,240
Sakura?

743
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:08,290
Oh, you need mana?

744
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,040
Come in and give me a second.

745
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:15,000
Let's see, what did I do with my box cutter?

746
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,490
S-Sakura?

747
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:55,120
Senpai, why do you protect me?

748
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,790
Because...

749
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,550
I wanted you to be with me.

750
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:13,230
I need you. I couldn't even imagine us being apart.

751
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:18,360
Do you see me as family?

752
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:24,440
Or do you see me as a girl?

753
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,870
Yeah. I love you, Sakura.

754
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,460
Then make love to me.

755
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:55,230
Senpai, am I tainted?

756
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,520
Is there something wrong with me?

757
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:06,450
Simply coming into your room reduced me to this.

758
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:11,740
Even if I try to console myself, I can't suppress it.

759
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:16,120
I can't think of anything but you.

760
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:20,210
I'm so disgusting.

761
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,920
No. You aren't disgusting at all.

762
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,470
You're beautiful.

763
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,220
Senpai...

764
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,630
I'm horrible.

765
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:13,350
When Nee-san took you away earlier,

766
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:16,140
I was so afraid.

767
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:36,200
I'm sorry for not noticing.

768
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,000
Senpai...

769
01:14:58,430 --> 01:14:59,520
Sakura...

770
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,320
I love you, Senpai.

771
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,370
It is time for the blessing.

772
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,040
Blessing?

773
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,090
For what?

774
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,670
For the other Holy Grail in the process of being born.

775
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:37,850
It bears within it all the evils of the world,

776
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:41,890
unwittingly brought forth by Man.

777
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:45,190
The distinction between good and evil.

778
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:51,860
Rather than ponder that dilemma, what if one were to
give birth to something that held the answer?

779
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,950
The answer is nigh.

780
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:02,750
Even if this question were to be
blasphemy against God,

781
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:07,500
I will stand before Him, and with all my soul,

782
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:11,260
I will kill even the Lord.

783
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,600
I couldn't live with myself if I were just freeloading.
The least I could do is make breakfast.

784
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,240
I'll go help Tohsaka-senpai.

785
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,030
Ah, Sakura.

786
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,620
Yes?

787
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,620
Uhm, try calling Tohsaka...

788
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:46,040
Hmm, what to do?

789
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:54,130
Nee-san, I'll wash these vegetables.

790
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:56,630
Yeah, thanks a...

791
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:08,310
Does it sound weird, Nee-san?

792
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,980
Oh, I w-wouldn't say w-weird...

793
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:27,330
Illya, can we talk about you-know-what in my room?

794
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,710
What's this you-know-what?

795
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:35,130
I figure we need a secret weapon or two.

796
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:40,260
Archer's arm holds knowledge of the Einzberns.

797
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:46,180
Tohsaka said we might be
able to put it to use somehow.

798
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:51,100
I don't really care about Kischur Zelretch's leftovers,

799
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:58,030
but I'm sure a magician's treasures will be lovely.

800
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,780
Kischur Zel...

801
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,620
Senpai.

802
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:12,040
Uhm, thank you.

803
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,960
I only ever watched her from afar,

804
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,970
so never in my wildest dreams did I imagine
I'd get to call her Nee-san again.

805
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:29,060
Did you two not hang out
after you went to the Matous?

806
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,560
No.

807
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:37,650
We just knew that we were sisters,

808
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:41,240
and tried our best not to
come into contact with each other.

809
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:49,160
Besides, if she knew about my magecraft,
she'd come to hate me.

810
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:53,420
Hate? How come?

811
01:18:57,170 --> 01:19:03,260
The Matou family's techniques have always
been limited to taking from others.

812
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:08,180
All they do is steal.
They have no teachings about accepting others.

813
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:13,810
Do you hate the Matous' magecraft?

814
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:18,780
Sure, their teachings are harsh,

815
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:23,280
but they're nothing compared to what you go through.

816
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:29,910
I've seen the training you do at night.

817
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:35,960
I wanted to stop you so many times.

818
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,510
The things you put yourself through
are too dangerous.

819
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:47,430
It's as if you're stabbing yourself in the throat.

820
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,190
It isn't something anyone forced on you, either.

821
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:55,940
You decided to keep that routine up yourself.

822
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:02,280
I can confidently say that
you're the strongest of us all.

823
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:09,450
Not because of your magecraft,
but because you're pure of heart.

824
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:23,420
I could tell from the moment we first met

825
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:29,890
that you'd never betray anyone.

826
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:41,440
You took everything from me, Emiya!

827
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,010
Why?

828
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:09,840
Why won't anything happen?

829
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:29,570
MULTIPLE BODIES FOUND IN SHINTO CENTRAL PARK

830
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:29,570
Today's Weather

831
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:26,900
We now move on to the next headline.

832
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,330
Multiple bodies thought to be homicide victims have
been discovered at Shinto's Central Park in Fuyuki City.

833
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,330
See, look!

834
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,290
Those weeds have turned black.

835
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,580
Then that means the shadow did it?

836
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,790
Is this Zouken's handiwork?

837
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,090
I'm not sure.

838
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,760
I don't think he'd leave so much evidence behind.

839
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:58,350
That's odd. I can't taste anything.

840
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:07,190
He's so warm.

841
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,280
It's okay. I can still feel him.

842
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:18,870
I wish this moment could last forever...

843
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,120
The lovely girl went on a lovely walk.

844
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:08,210
Bobbing to and fro, her head
was clear, no real goal in mind.

845
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:10,840
And so she shook from side to side.

846
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,470
Go, go.

847
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:14,590
And sang with a chuckle.

848
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:15,970
Go, go.

849
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:23,140
And the empty limbs rolled
along the ground like paper balloons.

850
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:28,570
And floating through the air
would have to wait until she grew up.

851
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,570
Go, go.

852
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,860
Go, go.

853
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,620
Go, go.

854
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,600
Someone came up to her and squeaked.

855
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:09,270
It roared at her in laughter.

856
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:12,860
She had no reason to be scared of it!

857
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:34,050
The shrill laughter echoed throughout the room,

858
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,890
so her empty stomach growled.

859
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:54,650
You've been busy, I see.

860
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,530
Had you only died as I told you to,
it would've saved us both the trouble.

861
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:15,420
So shiny and pretty...

862
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,400
This has gone on long enough.

863
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:32,270
Know that this is an act of mercy.

864
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:56,920
What? You yet cling to life?

865
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:01,640
I see your shadow isn't the only thing that's changed.

866
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:34,130
You dare presume to make me kneel?

867
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,200
Damned mongrel!

868
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:33,020
How could you have grown so...

869
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:06,090
Did you see that?

870
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:08,720
Huh?

871
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,040
Shirou!

872
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:37,040
Come to the living room! Now!

873
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:48,510
At 10:08 PM today, a widespread blackout
occurred near Shinto Station.

874
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:49,180
SHINTO STATION

875
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:54,680
The authorities have also received reports of
people going missing or vanishing into thin air,

876
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,850
among other unexplained incidents, around this time.

877
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:06,530
Sakura!

878
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:10,120
Don't move. I'll go get a first aid kit!

879
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:12,330
Saku—

880
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:18,870
Shut it out.

881
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:21,710
Stop.

882
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:33,010
They're nothing alike.

883
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:39,850
There are currently over sixty confirmed victims.

MULTIPLE MISSING PERSONS IN SHINTO

1070
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:49,990
How's Sakura?

1071
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:52,780
Alive.

1072
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,580
But...

1073
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,580
But... what?

1074
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:06,050
Sakura's body looks like it's
put together well on the surface,

1075
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,630
but the muscles in her arms and legs are in tatters.

1076
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:12,550
It's as if she died and was glued back together.

1077
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:17,350
I can't tell you who killed her,

1078
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:21,310
but the pain may have destroyed
not just her body, but her mind as well.

1079
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:27,110
We don't have a second to waste
if we want to beat Zouken and the shadow.

1080
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,860
Let's do what we can right now.

1081
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:38,910
But, Shirou,

1082
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:45,630
if it turns out that Zouken and that shadow
aren't actually working together,

1083
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,630
what will you do?

1084
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:03,190
Good morning.

1085
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:06,440
Are you still in there, Sakura?

1086
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:10,740
Where did you get that soul from?

1087
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,120
Assassin and Rider are still alive.

1088
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:17,410
I'd be surprised if you were full already.

1089
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:26,380
Sakura, do you know what's going to happen to you?

1090
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:32,430
No. What's going to happen to me?

1091
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:36,800
You'll die. There's no saving you.

1092
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:51,070
I'm home! I made some free time to hang out!

1093
01:31:52,150 --> 01:31:55,360
Huh? Shirou? You around?

1094
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,200
Who's that?

1095
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:05,710
I swear. Whatever happened to Shirou?

1096
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:08,210
He needs to be here for you.

1097
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:15,090
Hey, don't push yourself.

1098
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:20,640
Senpai said he would protect me.

1099
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:26,900
But I'm sorry.

1100
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:32,610
It's my fault his dreams were shattered.

1101
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,490
Why?

1102
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:43,830
Because I'm a bad person.

1103
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:49,840
Shirou's the kinda guy who'll
get mad at you for doing bad things.

1104
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:55,880
You want to fix that part of you, right?

1105
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:57,510
Yes.

1106
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:00,930
Then you have nothing to worry about.

1107
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:05,600
Shirou's dream is to be a superhero, right?

1108
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:09,270
It's only natural he'd have
someone he wants to protect.

1109
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:13,980
But shouldn't he treat everyone equally?

1110
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,240
If Shirou's trying to be like Kiritsugu-san,

1111
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:21,240
then it's fine for him to have this special someone.

1112
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:29,250
Kiritsugu-san played favorites all the time, y'know?

1113
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:39,260
Even after moving here, he was always abroad.

1114
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:44,140
He kept going out until
he couldn't even move anymore.

1115
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:51,980
There must've been someone
he really wanted to see.

1116
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:00,950
It hurts a lot if you can't see that special person.

1117
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:04,120
Superhero or not.

1118
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:15,130
So make sure you always hold Shirou close by, okay?

1119
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:34,860
Will you betray him?

1120
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:45,740
Will you betray your past self?

1121
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:53,960
Wait...

1122
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,920
Stop...

1123
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:03,390
If you will betray him,

1124
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,260
you must...

1125
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:09,770
Stop!

1126
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:23,490
No...

1127
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:25,990
I couldn't...

1128
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,960
Emiya Shirou, I presume?

1129
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:38,500
My magus wishes to speak with you.

1130
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:58,150
You arrived much faster than I expected,

1131
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,480
son of Emiya.

1132
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:02,950
Zouken...

1133
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,530
I only have one thing to say to you:

1134
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:10,240
Let Sakura go, right now.

1135
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,080
Let her go?

1136
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,370
I suppose that is one way of putting it.

1137
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:24,220
Emiya Shirou, I called you here to ask a favor of you.

1138
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:28,720
I wish for you to kill the shadow.

1139
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:34,020
Isn't that thing in cahoots with you?

1140
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:36,350
Cahoots?

1141
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:40,320
That thing cannot be reasoned with.

1142
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:44,950
As of last night, I cannot even pacify it.

1143
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:53,870
Oh, but before we continue,
I must tell you what that shadow is.

1144
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:59,710
Simply put, it's the contents of the Holy Grail.

1145
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:04,920
The wills overflowing from the gate
are what we call the Grail.

1146
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,470
That's what that shadow is.

1147
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,510
The shadow and... a gate...

1148
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:17,850
I asked you to kill the shadow,
but that would prove difficult.

1149
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:23,940
However, you can kill the gate.

1150
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:30,070
It would see right through myself or the Tohsaka girl.

1151
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:33,450
Servants are its feed.

1152
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,290
Stop...

1153
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:43,380
I planted a shard of the Grail in it and raised it
as the Matous' Holy Grail for the past ten years.

1154
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,300
The only one left who can kill it is...

1155
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,010
Shut up!

1156
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:52,050
Surely you've realized by now

1157
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:56,390
that it is awfully similar to Sakura.

1158
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:09,530
That doll who does nothing but exist
will die at the hands of the man she loves.

1159
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:11,620
She could ask for no better end.

1160
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:15,080
We're running out of time.

1161
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:18,870
When Sakura's consciousness grows faint,

1162
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:23,290
the Holy Grail she unconsciously
borrowed will rise to the surface.

1163
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:28,510
The disaster from ten years ago will be recreated.

1164
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:38,060
If Sakura is to be saved, she must endure until
the time limit for the Holy Grail War runs out.

1165
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:43,020
Following precedent,
that would be about four more days.

1166
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:45,320
What do you think?

1167
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:48,030
Will Sakura be able to hold out?

1168
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:50,030
She will.

1169
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:51,820
She definitely will!

1170
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:56,660
But the same cannot be said for others.

1171
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:01,710
She may have eaten her fill last night,

1172
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:05,420
but she will strike again as early as tomorrow.

1173
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:12,930
How many days will it take for her
to finish feeding on the people of this city?

1174
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:16,680
Surely you understand.

1175
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:20,350
Strike down evil for the sake of the many.

1176
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:24,520
If you wish to become Emiya Kiritsugu,

1177
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:30,820
then Matou Sakura is your enemy.

1178
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:56,930
Sakura, you up yet?

1179
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:01,770
Yes.

1180
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:05,940
Good morning, Senpai.

1181
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,300
Hey, Sakura.

1182
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:20,890
Is there anything you wanna do
after the battle is over?

1183
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:27,140
I can't really think of anything.

1184
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:31,440
As long as I'm with you,
I'm fine with anything.

1185
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:36,650
Then how about we go somewhere fun?

1186
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,070
Where would you like to go?

1187
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:48,170
Well, I suppose I'd like to go flower-viewing...

1188
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,170
Gotcha.

1189
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,050
I promise we will.

1190
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:15,110
I'll create a warm illusion with a frozen heart.

1191
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:21,780
When winter passes and a new spring arrives,

1192
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:27,410
we'll go see the cherry blossoms together.

1193
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:48,350
Yes.

1194
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:50,560
Go see the cherry blossoms...

1195
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:54,730
Senpai.

1196
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,150
My name is Matou Sakura.

1197
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:01,320
Here, have this.

1198
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:04,830
This makes the second time I've received
something important from someone special.

1199
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,200
I'll...

1200
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,200
A superhero?

1201
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:06,700
Senpai...

1202
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:10,750
I didn't want to let go of the times we shared.

1203
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,870
I wish this moment could last forever...

1204
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:11,210
Senpai.

1205
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:11,870
Senpai!

1206
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:13,790
Senpai!

1207
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:15,880
Senpai...

1208
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,220
Will you betray him?

1209
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:15,600
Yeah. I will.

1210
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:50,560
Thank you, Senpai.

1211
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:53,350
You've given me so much.

1212
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,190
Thank you, Nee-san.

1213
01:44:58,150 --> 01:45:01,570
I'm happy I could call you that again.

1214
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:06,570
Fujimura-sensei, thank you for everything.

1215
01:45:09,570 --> 01:45:13,330
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

1216
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:24,590
Rider, thank you for not killing Senpai.

1217
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:29,800
Sakura...

1218
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,980
By my final Command Spell...

1219
01:45:39,150 --> 01:45:41,360
Please, Rider...

1220
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:51,780
I'll be the one to stop Grandfather.

1221
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:54,580
It may have taken me a long time,

1222
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:58,620
but I can't cause any more trouble than I already have.

1223
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:04,300
Morning, Sakura.

1224
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:07,170
Wait, what?

1225
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:32,240
Hi there, traitor.

1226
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,040
Took you long enough to come crawling back.

1227
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:46,590
Uhm, Nii-san, I...

1228
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,470
Hold this for me.

1229
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,310
It's nothing dangerous.

1230
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:06,820
So pretty...

1231
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:15,160
You're something else, Sakura.

1232
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:24,290
You might even surpass Tohsaka someday.

1233
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:30,970
Nii-san...

1234
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:42,850
Get off your high horse.

1235
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:46,520
You're nothing but my plaything.

1236
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:53,240
I've made another mistake.

1237
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:57,030
That's why something horrible
is going to happen to me.

1238
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,290
It's okay.

1239
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,670
I just have to put up with it for a while, like usual.

1240
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,880
Put up with it, put up with it,
put up with it, put up with it...

1241
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:12,510
Sakura.

1242
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:14,970
No!

1243
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:23,100
No. I belong to Senpai now!

1244
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:26,150
What's this crap?

1245
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:29,690
Looks like he's trained you good!

1246
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:31,940
No!

1247
01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:34,070
Hey!

1248
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:35,360
What's wrong with you?

1249
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,820
Why does this always happen to me?

1250
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:39,240
Behave yourself! Hey!

1251
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,450
That thought always lingered in my mind.

1252
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:44,500
I've hated him for so long.

1253
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:54,550
Why does the world around me hate me so much?

1254
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:01,760
Hey, I'd better tell Emiya, too.

1255
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:07,100
I should tell him how much you've clung to me so far

1256
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:13,440
and how dirty you are in bed!

1257
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:21,080
The world would be better off without him.

1258
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,140
Nii-san...

1259
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:47,370
Sakura!

1260
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,240
Please give me your pity

1261
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,240
awaremi wo kudasai

1262
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:27,660
Touch me the way you would a fallen baby bird

1263
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:27,660
ochita kotori ni sotto fureru you na

1264
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:30,420
And caress me with that same sadness

1265
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:30,420
kanashimi wo kudasai

1266
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:33,750
Let your eyes fill with tears, glance gently down upon me

1267
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:33,750
namidagunde mioroshite

1268
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:37,090
And whisper those sweet words of pity

1269
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:37,090
kawaisou da to kuchi ni dashite

1270
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:42,640
I won't mind if you kick me over with your shoes

1271
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:42,640
kutsu no saki de korogashitemo kamawanai wa

1272
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:46,430
Tell me it's okay to be sullied

1273
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:46,430
yogoretetemo ii kara to

1274
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:49,930
By holding my mud-covered hand

1275
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:49,930
dorodarake no te wo totte

1276
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:53,980
Say, let's form a circle and dance!

1277
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:53,980
nee wa ni natte odorimashou

1278
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:58,400
Let's go and eat up

1279
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:58,400
mezawari na uzou muzou wa subete

1280
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:01,450
All of those eyesores

1281
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:01,450
tabete shimaimashou

1282
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:09,120
Can I add spices until the dish is ruined?

1283
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:09,120
supaisu wa taegatai kurai ga ii wa

01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:28,770
The scared little bird

01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:28,770
obieta kotori wa

1292

sayonara nante ienakute

1294
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:37,940
It falls silent, an act to beg for more love

1295
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:37,940
ai wo kou shigusa from damarikonde

1296
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,940
Yet still thinking it's being modest

1297
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,940
tsutsumashii tsumori de ita

1298
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:43,240
Lie, lie—It's a lie

1299
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,870
Not a lie, it hurts too much

1300
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,870
not a lie mou tsurai

1301
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:48,330
Cover me in wounds

1302
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:48,330
sanzan kizutsuite

1303
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:55,250
Anyone would want to live in a gentler world

1304
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:55,250
yasashii sekai ni dare datte yukitai wa

01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:59,550
hitotsu ni tokete shimaimashou

1307
01:52:59,590 --> 01:53:04,050
Let hate and love get all jumbled up

1308
01:52:59,590 --> 01:53:04,050
nikushimi mo aijou mo mushamusha to

1309
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:07,050
And let's stuff our cheeks full with it

1310
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:07,050
hoobatte shimaimashou

1311
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:14,730
Inside this sweet, sweet pot of chaos

1312
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:14,730

01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:33,910

01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:33,910
aimai ni warau kara

1321
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,710
I want to be with you again

1322
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,710
aitai to omou no yo

1323
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:41,420
I know you're here to stay with me

1324
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:45,170
I just want to be loved

1325
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:45,170

1326
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:48,930
Lie, lie, lie, you're to be with me

1327
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:52,640
There, where the thunder blooms

1328
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:52,640
raimei no saku tokoro

1329
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:56,390
A miserable, heavenly feeling

1330
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:56,390
santantaru heavenly feeling

1331
01:53:56,440 --> 01:54:01,440
Let love be all that remains

01:53:56,440 --> 01:54:01,440
ai dake nokoreba ii

1333
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:28,840
Silently, nothing but sadness keeps snowing down on me

1334
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:28,840
shinshin to kanashimi dake ga furitsumoru

1335
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:36,310
Both wishes and regrets are just being crammed inside me

1336
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:36,310
ganbou mo kaikon mo tada umetsukusu

1337
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:43,770
Even the scars of our fateful spring day

1338
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:43,770
kizuna musunda tooi haru no hi wo

1339
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:52,580
Have fully faded away

1340
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:52,580
kizuato sae mo kieteshimau no

1341
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:57,710
At last, within my sparkling dream

1342
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:57,710
yagate kirakira yume no naka

1343
01:54:57,750 --> 01:55:01,670
The dying light

1344
01:54:57,750 --> 01:55:01,670
kuchiteyuku hikari wa anata ni

1345
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:05,210
Should one day reach you

1346
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:05,210
todoku hazudakara

1347
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:09,630
My tears won't stop

01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:09,630
