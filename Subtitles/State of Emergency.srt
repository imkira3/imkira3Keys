Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

Emilie.

Where are we?

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Somewhere off from Hills Road.

10
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,500
What's happening?

11
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,200
I don't know.

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,500
<i>This is an emergency broadcast issued

13
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, Jesus.

14
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
You're hurt.

15
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,000
- Emilie, you're hurt.
- I'm fine.

16
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, uh...

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,500
Tell me what to do, all right?
How do I... how do I fix it?

18
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
You can't.

19
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,500
I love you, Jim.

20
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,200
No. No. No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, we're gonna fix you, all right?

21
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,500
I'm gonna get you to a hospital,
and everything is just gonna be fine.

22
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,500
Okay? So just... Emilie, hold on.

23
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Emilie.

24
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,500
Emilie, wake up!

25
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Wake... Wait...

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Don't go.

27
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,000
Please don't go.

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,500
Hello.

31
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
<i>Try not... to Montgomery County.</i>

32
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,500
<i>Well, according to live witnesses
regarding the recent events</i>

33
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,500
<i>currently taking place in Montgomery
County, where an explosion has happened.</i>

34
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,300
<i>We're trying our best
to bring you new information,</i>

35
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,500
<i>but we really don't know
what is going on.</i>

36
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
<i>Earlier this morning,
at approximately 7:30, reports came in</i>

37
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,900
<i>that there was an explosion
on the outskirts of Montgomery County.</i>

38
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,800
<i>Now, we don't know if this was an act
of terrorism or merely an accident.</i>

39
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,400
<i>It's too early to say at this point.</i>

40
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
<i>To hopefully fill us in on what is going
on, we'll go live to one of our analysts</i>

41
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
<i>whos reporting to us via satellite phone
from just outside Montgomery County.</i>

42
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,000
<i>Bill, are you there?</i>

43
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,800
<i>Uh, yes, Amy, thank you.
Uh, we don't know much as of right now.</i>

44
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,200
<i>All that we can tell you is
the military isn't letting</i>

45
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,500
<i>anybody in or out of the county.
In fact, it's quite frightening that...</i>

46
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,500
<i>...military officials and helicopters,
literally coming from every direction.</i>

47
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
<i>...appearing out of nowhere, and
they're not telling us what's going on.</i>

48
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,400
<i>Cell phone communication
seems to be down.</i>

49
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,400
<i>Landline phones only seem to be working
within the county.</i>

50
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,900
<i>This is believed to be
a part of the military's procedure</i>

51
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
<i>in quarantining this town.</i>

52
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,500
<i>Now, we've been hearing
that there is smoke visible.</i>

53
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,300
<i>Can you fill us in on that?</i>

54
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,700
<i>Uh, yes, I'm standing
just on the outside</i>

55
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,100
<i>of the western border of Montgomery
County and when I look towards the east,</i>

56
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,100
<i>I see a massive cloud of smoke
coming from the ground.</i>

57
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
<i>Now I can only guess...
that's what is causing this panic.</i>

58
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,200
<i>I-I've noticed that
the military is wearing gas masks.</i>

59
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,200
<i>They're actually rounding up reporters
to leave the area.</i>

60
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,000
<i>And, uh, quite frankly...</i>

61
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,900
<i>I am trying to get...</i>

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
<i>Hold on, hold on one second, Amy.
There's something happening.</i>

63
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,300
<i>- There's a man walking towards us.
- Bill, are you there?</i>

64
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,500
<i>Uh, there's a man walking towards us
right now, with nothing on...</i>

65
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,000
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

66
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,500
<i>Jesus!</i>

67
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,000
<i>They just... they just shot a guy
that was trying to cross...</i>

68
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,500
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

69
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,000
<i>Hey, what's going on? What happened?</i>

70
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
<i>Bill.</i>

71
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,500
<i>Bill, talk to us, please.</i>

72
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,000
<i>Can somebody tell me what's going on?</i>

73
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,100
<i>...a large number of military aircraft
taking off from Clark County Airport.</i>

74
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,500
<i>Uh, which is a bordering county
to Montgomery County.</i>

75
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,000
<i>I'm standing just south of
the airport's main runway, and I'm so...</i>

76
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,400
<i>...all around me. Uh, they're starting
to take off, and I'm starting to see</i>

77
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,900
<i>helicopters in every direction,
as they rise to the skies around me.</i>

78
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,900
<i>Uh, suddenly, some are beginning
to now appear off a distance, and, uh,</i>

79
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,700
<i>I would guess it has to be restrictive
to aircraft, uh, airborne at this time.</i>

80
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,000
<i>There're so many that I can't even count
them all. It truly is a fascinating...</i>

81
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,500
Hey!

82
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,500
Hello!

83
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is somebody behind there?

84
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,000
I know somebody's in there!

85
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,500
I have a gun and I'm not afraid
to use it, so come out right now!

86
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,000
This is your last chance!
Come out right now!

87
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,000
Shit!

88
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,500
♪ Wa-sSsSs-u;P ♪

89
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,500
Please.

90
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Hello.

91
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,000
Are you the person in the barn?

92
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,500
Who is this?

93
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,500
Thank God. I've tried every number
in the book to get a hold of somebody.

94
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I heard gunshots. Are you okay?

95
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
How do you know where I am?

96
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,000
Your lights.
We're just down the hill from you.

97
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,500
We're in the warehouse
just to the north.

98
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,500
Hey, Julie, flip the lights.

99
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
You see us?

100
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Yeah.

101
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,000
I think he will need this.
How many are in your group?

102
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,500
Just me. You?

103
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,500
There's three of us. We've been
holding up pretty good down here.

104
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,700
You're the first person
we've been able to contact

105
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,500
since this whole thing started.

106
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,000
We have plenty of food and water.
Should last us at least a week or so.

107
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,500
How're you holding up?

108
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,500
Not good.

109
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,500
Well, you're more than welcome
to join us if you want.

110
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,500
Do you care for the hike?

111
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,500
Think we're in luck.
I don't think they saw you.

112
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm Scott. We talked on the phone.

113
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,500
You got a name or should I just call you
"guy I talked to on the phone"?

114
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
- Jim.
- Well, nice to meet you, Jim.

115
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,500
- Nice to meet you too.
- Well, how about a grand tour?

116
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,000
So, what do you think?

117
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Nice, huh?

118
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,000
It's big.

119
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,500
- Scott.
- Oh, yeah, Jim, this is my wife, Julie.

120
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,500
It's so nice to meet you.
Would you care for something to drink?

121
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,500
- Water would be great.
- Sure thing.

122
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,000
Well, Jim, come make yourself at home.

123
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
As you can see here, we got
plenty of square footage to go around.

124
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,700
All the exits are, uh...

125
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,500
securely locked from the inside, so
only way in and out is, uh, with a key.

126
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,500
Got no windows, so we can
keep the lights on as long as we want.

127
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,500
We got power running from the generator
right over there.

128
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,500
It's gotta fill up from time to time.

129
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,500
- Wow, this is great.
- Yeah, we were lucky.

130
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
My neighbor actually owns the place.

131
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,000
Frankly, it was the only place
I can think to go to.

132
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,000
What's upstairs?

133
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,500
Mainly offices. We keep
most of our supplies up here though.

134
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,000
In case one of those things gets in,

135
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,500
we can retreat up here
and barricade ourselves in.

136
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,500
Actually, the only way up here
is through that door down there.

137
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,500
Think of it as a, uh,
last line of defense.

138
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Who is that?

139
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, that's Ix.
She's not the easiest to talk to.

140
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,000
- What happened to her?
- We don't know exactly.

141
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
When Julie and I were headed here,

142
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
we found her hunkered down in
a storm drain on the side of the road.

143
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,000
At first, we thought
she was one of them, but then she spoke.

144
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,500
Asked her if she wanted to join us, so
that's why she's here.

145
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,500
She'll warm up to you, eventually.
Just give her some time.

146
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,500
- Scott.
- Yeah?

147
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,300
Ask Jim if he's hungry. I feel so rude
for not offering any food.

148
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
All right, honey.

149
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,500
You hungry?

150
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Sorry.

151
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,500
It's okay. We have plenty to go around.
Don't worry about it.

152
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,000
Julie cleaned your shirt for you.
Think she did the best she could here.

153
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,500
Thanks.

154
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, I hope this cot is, uh,
comfortable enough for you.

155
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,000
And, uh, sorry
if the sheets smell like crap.

156
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,000
Pretty much all we can find around here.

157
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,000
It's great.

158
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,000
You know,
just think of it like summer camp.

159
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Except,
you can't really go outside and play.

160
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,000
- Get some sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.
- Yeah.

161
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Hi.

162
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,400
<i>Yeah, yeah, I still remember that,
actually, but, uh, we're actually, uh,</i>

163
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,900
<i>just hitting 6:30, and we have some, uh,
great music planned today,</i>

164
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
<i>and if you stay tuned for later,
we're gonna have our late-day drawing...</i>

165
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,500
You look handsome.

166
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,000
What are you doing up?

167
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,000
I have something for you,
and I couldn't wait.

168
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,500
Oh, is it that time of the year already?

169
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,500
I thought we said
we're gonna save our money for the move.

170
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,000
It's not expensive, please.

171
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,000
Okay, but hurry, I'm gonna be late.

172
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,000
What is it?

173
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, my God, where'd you find this?

174
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,500
I stopped in at John's store to say hi,
and saw it sitting on the top shelf.

175
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,000
I knew you had to have it.

176
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,000
It's just exactly like the one
I had as a kid.

177
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,000
I knew you would love it.

178
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,000
And don't worry
if you didn't get me anything.

179
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,500
Not a big deal. It was just
something to brighten your day.

180
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,000
- I did get you something.
- You didn't forget?

181
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,000
- Two years is hard to forget, Em.
- Okay, where is it?

182
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,900
- Tonight.
- No, come on, please.

183
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,900
What, you just... you wanna know
where it is? Not to open, just to look.

184
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Promise.

185
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,500
Okay, top drawer.

186
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,500
Been waiting a long time
to give you that.

187
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Seems like I've been waiting
since the first day I met you.

188
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,000
Figured what...
what better time than today, you know?

189
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,500
Happy anniversary.

190
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,500
Can I open it?

191
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,500
Tonight.

192
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,000
Can I at least give you an answer?

193
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
No.

194
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,000
I have to...

195
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,700
Okay. Looks like, uh,
we're both gonna be working today.

196
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,100
Isn't today your day off?

197
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,500
Yeah, well, accidents don't, uh,
don't take a day off.

198
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,500
Hey, you know what you could do?

199
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,500
- You can make the bed.
- Hmm? What's up?

200
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,200
- I can't...
- Right.

201
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,800
You know what?
I'm already gone, so I can't...

202
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,000
- Yes, um, okay, love you.
- Love you too.

203
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,500
Sorry.

204
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,000
Didn't mean to scare you.

205
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,000
- Do you need to be alone? I can...
- No.

206
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,100
It's all right.

207
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,000
How about a drink?

208
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

209
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Yeah, we've counted seven so far.

210
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,000
All around the building.

211
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,500
Some closer than others,
and more seem to show up each day.

212
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,000
It's crazy to think that
they might be people we know.

213
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,500
Why aren't we like them?

214
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,500
You know, Julie and I asked ourselves
that same question.

215
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,500
Neither one of us
can think of a logical answer.

216
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,500
So, what's your story?
How'd you end up here at the warehouse?

217
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,500
When I heard the sirens, I headed over
to Robert Benningson's house.

218
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,500
My neighbor across the street.

219
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,500
Door was cracked when I got there.

220
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,000
Something wasn't right
about the whole thing.

221
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,000
We were close with he and his wife,
so I just...

222
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,000
walked in when they didn't respond
to my knocking.

223
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,500
When I got in,
I heard a noise from the back room.

224
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,500
Something I've never heard before.

225
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,000
Curiosity kinda got the best of me so...

226
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,500
I went back there to see what it was.

227
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,000
Opened the door.

228
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,500
And there was Robert.

229
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,000
Then I saw something, I was just...

230
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
I'll never forget.

231
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,000
Anyway, I knew he owned this place,
so I grabbed the keys and...

232
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,000
headed here.

233
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,500
I won't keep you. You need some sleep.

234
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,500
What did you see?

235
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,000
What was he doing when you found him?

236
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,500
Eating his wife.

237
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,500
- Hey, Jim, you find anything?
- Yeah, lots of stuff.

238
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,500
- Jesus.
- Look at this.

239
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,000
The answer to all of our problems.

240
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,900
Wow, this stuff has been here a while.

241
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,500
- You find anything in the other rooms?
- Yes, check it out.

242
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,000
Found it in one of the closets.
Maybe if we can run power to it,

243
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,500
then it might pick up
some radio channels from outside.

244
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,500
That's good news, man.

245
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,000
- Well, you hungry?
- Scott, I'm always hungry.

246
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,500
All right, I'll tell Julie
to whip us something up.

247
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,800
You want the soup or the stew?

248
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,000
- I'll have whatever you're having.
- Stew it is.

249
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,000
What are you listening to?

250
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Tape?

251
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,500
- We haven't been introduced, I'm Jim.
- Do I look like I give a shit?

252
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Sorry.

253
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Just thought I'd say something.

254
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,700
Trying to be friendly.

255
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,500
Yeah, well, you tried.
Now, can you just leave me alone?

256
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,000
Okay.

257
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,000
Where'd you get that?

258
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
- I found it.
- Well, where did you find it?

259
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,500
In the other room.

260
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,000
Was it in a big red bag?

261
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,200
Look, those are my goddamn candy bars.

262
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,500
You take any more, I'll cut
your dick off in your sleep, you got it?

263
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,400
<i>In a press conference
early this morning,</i>

264
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,600
<i>military officials issued a statement
claiming that </i>

265
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,600
<i>the effects of this disaster seem to
have been caused by an airborne agent.</i>

266
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,300
<i>Either chemical or viral,
and most likely one that was engineered.</i>

267
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,100
<i>Scientists have determined that
the agent was most likely released</i>

268
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,900
<i>in the explosion which occurred
in the western part of the county</i>

269
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,300
<i>just a few days ago.</i>

270
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,400
<i>Now, the big question on everyone's mind
is: What was the cause of the explosion?</i>

271
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
It's gotta be the chemical factory.

272
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,500
I can't think of anything else
that could be behind this.

273
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,500
- What are you ranting about over there?
- TV said there was an explosion.

274
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,000
- Yeah, so?
- So, that black cloud we saw...

275
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,000
That was in the direction
of Reseda County, right?

276
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,100
Yeah.

277
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,100
That side of the county just happens to be

278
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,500
the home of one of the largest chemical
weapons factories in the country.

279
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,500
Jesus.

280
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,200
Probably used to make
nerve agents and stuff, right?

281
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,700
Yeah, nerve agents, chemical weapons.

282
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,400
They shut it down in the 80s. Poured all
those chemicals into huge holding tanks.

283
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,000
- Said they were unstable or something.
- They didn't shut it down good enough.

284
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,500
Yeah.

285
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,000
Got one.

286
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,500
- Where?
- Just south of the water tower.

287
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,500
- Where do they keep coming from?
- I don't know.

288
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,500
As long as they're out there,
then that's all I care about.

289
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,500
What I would do is
just take 'em all out, right now.

290
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:20,500
- How many does that make?
- Eleven, not counting the south side.

291
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,900
- Scott, honey?
- Yeah.

292
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,500
Would you mind bringing down
more water? We're running low.

293
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,500
- Sure, honey.
- Thank you.

294
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,500
Even in the apocalypse,
she's got me doing chores.

295
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,800
<i>...But what you failed to mention,
was what the situation is.</i>

296
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,700
<i>We have been receiving phone calls
all day from people around the country,</i>

297
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,500
<i>simply asking, as if we, the media,
knew what was going on...</i>

298
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,500
I didn't take any more
of your candy bars.

299
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,500
- No, man, couldn't sleep.
- Join the club.

300
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,500
What's that?

301
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,500
Nothing.

302
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,500
- Want to sit?
- Next to you?

303
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
No.

304
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Fine.

305
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,000
It's Alix. Most people just call me Ix.

306
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,500
- Al-Ix.
- Oh.

307
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,000
Who is she?

308
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,500
Her name was Emilie.

309
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Can I see?

310
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,000
She's pretty. What happened?

311
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,500
I don't really wanna talk about her.

312
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,500
So, what happened to you?
What's your story?

313
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,500
It's complicated.

314
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,500
It's complicated
or you just don't wanna talk about it?

315
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,500
It's complicated
and I don't wanna talk about it.

316
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,500
Okay.

317
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,500
I, uh...

318
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,500
had to move back in with my parents
about a year ago.

319
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,000
Living in the city
wasn't exactly working out.

320
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,800
I, uh, couldn't get a job,
had no friends, no money.

321
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,900
And, uh,
my parents gave my old room back.

322
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,500
Yeah, like until I got on my feet but...

323
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,500
that didn't last for long.

324
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,700
I came home one night,

325
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,000
and they sat me down, and they said
they didn't approve of my behavior.

326
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,000
I stormed out
and I stopped talking to them.

327
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,000
And now I can't even tell 'em I'm sorry.

328
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,000
I can't even tell 'em
that I actually love them.

329
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,000
I was a terrible daughter.

330
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,000
Hey, hey. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

331
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,000
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

332
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,000
Besides, you're not the only one that
feels like they don't have any friends.

333
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,000
This may come as some of a shock to you,

334
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,500
Emilie was the only friend that I had.

335
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,000
Just a week ago,
I had my whole life figured out.

336
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,500
I was gonna ask the girl
that I love to marry me.

337
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,000
Move out of this town.

338
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
Start a new job.

339
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,500
And make those friends, you know?

340
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,000
Instead, I'm...

341
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,000
hiding...

342
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,500
for my life, in a warehouse.

343
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,000
And I lost the only friend that I had.

344
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,000
Maybe we could be friends.

345
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,000
I'd like that.

346
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,000
Came from the back door.

347
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,000
Jim... Jim...

348
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,500
- What should we do?
- Go upstairs and lock the door.

349
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,600
You don't open the door unless
you hear our voices from the outside.

350
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,100
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

351
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Go now!

352
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,500
So, what do you think?

353
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,500
Stay here.

354
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,100
What do you see?

355
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,000
I don't see anybody.

356
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,000
Please let me in.

357
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,000
What's your name?
Where did you come from?

358
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm looking for my daughter.
Have you seen her?

359
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,500
- No.
- Please let me in. I need to come in.

360
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,000
What do you think? Should we let her in?

361
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,500
We should let her in.

362
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:42,400
Where did you come from?
Have you seen any of those things?

363
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,500
I came from town. I managed
to get pass them. Please let me come in.

364
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,000
- Something's not right with her.
- Would you be if you're out there?

365
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,800
- Give me the flashlight.
- What?

366
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,000
Give it to me.

367
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,000
Your eyes.

368
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,500
Please let me come in.

369
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,400
- Get outta here or we'll shoot!
- Let me in!

370
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,500
- Shoot her, Jim.
- Get outta here, right now!

371
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,000
- Let me in!
- Shoot her, Jim. Shoot her!

372
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,400
<i>At approximately 6:30 this morning,</i>

373
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,900
<i>a small battalion of marines was
deployed on a search-and-rescue mission</i>

374
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,200
<i>on the western borders
of Montgomery County.</i>

375
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,200
<i>They believe that
the process will be slow,</i>

376
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,000
<i>but are determined
to find any survivors.</i>

377
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,000
Hey.

378
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,000
Hi.

379
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:50,000
TV says they sent out a search team. I
don't know what that means for us but...

380
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,500
- It's good news.
- Yeah.

381
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,500
Um, look, I just wanted to say
thank you, for last night.

382
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,000
Appreciated your comfort.

383
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,000
Not exactly used to people
listening to my problems, so thank you.

384
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,000
- You're welcome.
- Cool.

385
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,400
<i>And we're continuing to see more
and more airdrops fall from the skies</i>

386
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,000
<i>over Montgomery County.
Now, each one of these airdrops</i>

387
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,000
<i>is filled with food, water and, uh,
other survival gear...</i>

388
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,500
Raptor, do you copy me?

389
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,000
Raptor, copy.

390
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,316
Heading 257.

391
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,500
I'm out of candy bars.

392
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,500
You okay?

393
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,500
Um, yeah, I'm just
a little bit flustered, that's all.

394
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,000
Jim! Jim, get down here!

395
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
What is it?

396
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,500
- It just started going off.
- ...27259.

397
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,700
Copy that.

398
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,000
There-there was nothing and then...
voices.

399
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Anybody got eyes on Raptor?

400
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,500
Yeah, we're-we're
actually en route right now.

401
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,401
What's your, uh, current heading?

402
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
- What is that?
- Heading 270, over.

403
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,900
- Copy that, heading 270.
- Turn it off.

404
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
- What?
- I said turn it off.

405
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,500
What the hell did you do that for?

406
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,500
- What is it?
- Helicopters. We're going home!

407
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,500
I can see 'em!

408
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,500
They're too far away.
They can't see the sign.

409
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,500
The hell with this.

410
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,500
Scott. Scott, no!

411
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,000
Scott! Scott, no!

412
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,100
Hey!

413
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,000
Help! Hey! Down here!

414
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,000
Scott, get back inside!

415
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,500
Help! Hey! Down here!

416
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,500
Scott!

417
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,000
Shit.

418
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,000
What the hell were you thinking
out there?

419
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,500
You saw the helicopters.
I was just trying to get...

420
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,500
I don't give a shit what you were
trying to do, Scott! You put us at risk!

421
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,300
Not to mention how many of those things
probably saw that we were in here.

422
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,300
Hey! Who the hell put you in charge?

423
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,900
Remember it was us that invited you here.

424
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
We were doing just fine without you.

425
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,000
We give you food, water.

426
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,000
- I'll do whatever I want.
- Ix.

427
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,000
I was trying to get us out of here.

428
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,000
Hey, guys!
There's something wrong with Ix!

429
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,000
What's wrong with her?

430
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,100
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

431
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,800
- Goddammit, get away from her!
- Get the hell offa me!

432
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,500
Quit it, you guys!

433
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,000
Alix... Alix...

434
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,000
Is she dead?

435
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,100
- She's in shock.
- Way to go, "doctor."

436
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,000
- Is she sick?
- No.

437
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,000
Um, then, what is it?

438
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
- How is she doing?
- Not good. Barely spoken a word.

439
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,000
So, what do we do now, Jim?

440
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:29,500
I don't know. We don't know how long
we're gonna be here until help arrives.

441
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,500
Could be weeks.

442
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,000
Well, I'm aware of that,
but it doesn't help our situation.

443
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,000
- Then, I'll go get some.
- That's crazy.

444
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,800
The nearest drugstore
is on the other side of town.

445
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,500
I go and get the medicine.
I come back. I'll be back by sundown.

446
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,000
You will never make it.

447
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,000
What about the airdrop?

448
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,500
What?

449
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,400
The airdrop.
TV said that they had medicine in them.

450
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,500
Surely they would have insulin, right?

451
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,500
What's she talking about?

452
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,500
What airdrop?

453
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,300
Before we saw your light in the barn,

454
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,600
we saw planes fly over, dropping things
out of the back, attached to parachutes.

455
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,700
Thought it was just supplies
or something, but didn't really care.

456
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,400
- It was too far away to concern us.
- Where'd they drop it?

457
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,000
Uh, just to the southwest of us,
over in this area.

458
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,300
Couldn't be more than a mile or so away.

459
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,500
Then, that's it.

460
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,000
Jim, it's suicide. We wouldn't make it
pass all those things.

461
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,000
- Then, I'll go alone.
- Jim.

462
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,500
Look, I'll grab what I can,
and I'll come back.

463
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,500
I can't just sit here
and watch her die.

464
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
I'll need you to clear me a path.

465
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,500
Think you can handle that?

466
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,000
I'll do what I can, but once you're over
that hill, you're on your own.

467
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,600
Just remember, if you get into trouble
with those things, don't run.

468
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,400
It'll only draw more attention
to yourself.

469
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,000
Thanks for reminding me.

470
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,100
Now, you only have about
another 40 minutes of sunlight,

471
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,700
so I suggest you get what you need
and hurry back.

472
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:54,000
- Okay. Any other advice?
- Yeah, don't die.

473
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,000
All right, all set down there?

474
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,500
- Ready when you are.
- All right, here we go.

475
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,300
Shit.

476
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,000
Go!

477
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,000
Scott.

478
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,000
Scotty.

479
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,500
What's your location? Jim. Jim!

480
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,500
Jim, can you hear me?

481
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,000
Jim, come in.

482
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,500
Shit.

483
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,000
How is she?

484
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,500
I think she's gonna be okay.
She just needs some rest.

485
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,000
So, how do you know so much
about this stuff anyway?

486
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,000
my fiance, Emilie, was a nurse.

487
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,000
Guess I just picked up a few things
along the way.

488
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,500
It's a good thing you did.

489
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,500
Mmm, so good.

490
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,500
I don't know how much more
of that canned stuff I could take.

491
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,500
Better not let Julie hear you say that.

492
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,000
I never said anything, but...

493
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I'm gonna let you know that I really
appreciate what you did back there.

494
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,500
You know, when you had my back
when that thing attacked me.

495
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,500
- You would've done the same thing.
- Uh, I'm not so sure I would have.

496
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,000
I was just so scared out there.

497
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:04,000
You know, my muscles
just stopped working. I froze.

498
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,000
You, on the other hand...

499
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,000
You've got something I don't.
I mean, you reacted.

500
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,000
You saved my life.

501
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,000
Well, I'm gonna turn in.

502
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,000
Been a long day of
"nothing to look forward to."

503
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,000
Good night, Scott.

504
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,000
Good night, buddy.

505
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,000
- What happened?
- Welcome back.

506
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,000
I was having the worst nightmare.

507
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,500
Can't be any worse than
the nightmare we're having right now.

508
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,500
How're you feeling?

509
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,000
All right, I guess.

510
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,000
Should've told us, Alix.

511
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,500
You had us worried.

512
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,500
You had me worried.

513
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,000
Sorry.

514
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,500
It's okay.

515
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,000
She was lucky to have you.

516
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,000
I was lucky to have her.

517
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,500
- You need anything?
- No.

518
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
You sure?

519
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah.

520
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:16,000
Okay then, go back to bed.
You need a lot more rest.

521
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:20,000
- We'll talk again at breakfast, okay?
- Okay.

522
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,500
Okay.

523
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,000
Jim?

524
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,500
Julie, get outta here!

525
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,000
Jim! Jim! Go get Ix!

526
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:26,000
- Go! I'm behind you!
- Okay!

527
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,000
Say something.

528
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,000
Say something!

529
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,500
Hi.

530
01:22:55,400 --> 01:23:01,000
Uh, apparently, the chemical plant
was the cause of all of this.

531
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:06,000
A cooler in one of the holding tanks
malfunctioned.

532
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,700
The chemicals were very aggressive
on the nervous system, but it...

533
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,500
it didn't seem to have the same effect
on everyone.

534
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,500
I am sure there were survivors.

535
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,000
But, they couldn't defend themselves
long enough to be rescued.

536
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
A search beacon was activated
when you opened the airdrop.

537
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:34,000
And a helicopter
full of marines was deployed.

538
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,000
If it hadn't been for your bravery,
we might not have found you.

539
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:49,000
We, uh, we've done a lot of tests
and bloodwork, and...

540
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:55,000
we've decided that there's no reason
for us to detain you and the others.

541
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,500
I am really sorry
for what you guys have gone through.

542
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:04,500
We're gonna do everything we can
to get you back on your feet.

543
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,000
Do you have any questions?

544
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,500
Where are my friends?

545
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
