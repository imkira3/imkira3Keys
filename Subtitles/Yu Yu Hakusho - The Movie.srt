1
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:28,390
In a crowded city, as I
bump shoulders, I'm all alone

2
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:34,960
On an endless prairie, as the
wind whistles by, I'm all alone

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,470
Which one is it that makes me
want to cry more, I wonder

4
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:49,780
Marking it with twin circles,
I feel a bit more grown-up!

5
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,550
It must be, that when I run
into these terribly difficult walls,

6
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,220
and unexpectedly, for whatever reason,

7
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:05,760
the courage and power to break
through rises up from within

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,970
All because of how, when I run
into these terribly difficult people,

9
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:20,610
they show me kindness, I bet!

10
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,910
Thank you very much!

11
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,690
Yusuke!

12
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,370
Give it up. No matter how
many of you gang up on us,

13
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,000
you're no match for us.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,970
That's right. It's too hot for this.

15
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,340
Shut up! If we can just get rid
of you, this town will be ours!

16
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,510
Everyone, get them!

17
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,720
What's the use? Let's hurry
and take care of this.

18
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,990
--Yeah.
--Yusuke!

19
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,620
Bad news! Bad news!

20
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,230
Hey! Watch out!

21
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,320
I've got bad news!

22
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,910
What is this?! That was dangerous, you know!

23
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,210
Come with me! Something
terrible has happened!

24
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,380
Now, look, this is our summer vacation.

25
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,250
If this is another one of Koenma's
usual orders, I'm not following it.

26
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,380
It is about Koenma-sama!
He's been kidnapped!

27
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,350
What? Koenma?

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,100
Hey, if you keep crying, we're
never gonna find out what's up.

29
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,400
What happened?

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,670
Come on, tell us.

31
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,910
R-Right.

32
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,280
As it happens, Koenma-sama was
all dressed up for summer vacation...

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,350
That guy is the sort who dresses up?

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,080
...and we all accompanied him
to the beach of the Dead Sea.

35
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,030
Ah, this is heavenly... thongs and everything...

36
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,030
After a nap, as Koenma-sama was
enjoying some watermelon-splitting...

37
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,400
What is this?!

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,280
My name is Garuga. I am taking Koenma.

39
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
If you want to save him,

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,390
bring the Gold Seal to the
Valley of Magma by sundown today.

41
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,830
If you're not there by then, Koenma will die!

42
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,990
It all happened so quickly...

43
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,970
What is this "Gold Seal" thing?

44
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,140
Let's see... Huh...?

45
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,730
Here it is.

46
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,620
This is King Yama the Great's Gold Seal.

47
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,250
It proves that he rules the Spirit Realm,
and must never leave here.

48
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,030
If this were to fall into
the hands of someone bad,

49
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,800
there would be a complete
breakdown of order.

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,130
Chaos would be unavoidable.

51
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,970
Yama the Great might even be
driven out of the Spirit Realm.

52
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,510
So we're supposed to exchange this
Gold Seal for Koenma's life, huh?

53
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,810
Yama the Great doesn't even take
the Gold Seal with him on business.

54
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,320
But Koenma-sama will be...

55
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,480
Ah, I don't know what to do!

56
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,890
Good grief, that little brat
is always a problem, huh?

57
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,500
Ah! Yusuke! N-No, you can't!

58
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,830
No, Yusuke-san, you mustn't!

59
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,740
But without this, I can't go rescue Koenma.

60
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,540
I'm not really up for this, but as
long as I bring back both Koenma

61
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,310
and the Gold Seal, no problem, right?

62
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,880
There's no time to lose.
Botan, show me the way to get there!

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,320
You got it. Let's hurry.

64
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,690
Huh? Where did that dope Hiei go off to?

65
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,090
Hmm? He was here until just a moment ago.

66
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,660
Such an insensitive jerk. But don't you worry.

67
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,100
Kuwabara the man will save
that poor Koenma for you!

68
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,540
Oh, yeah! I'll have to ask
Kurama-san to help, as well!

69
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,960
No! No!

70
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,730
Your foolish subordinates
have exited the judgment gate.

71
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,800
Who is that?! Who's there?!

72
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,960
Have you forgotten me?

73
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,440
"Garuga"

74
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,240
Koashura!

75
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,440
"Koashura"

76
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,640
Hey, Garuga...

77
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,610
Yes, Koashura-sama.

78
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,980
What's the big idea, putting me through this?!

79
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,820
Ha! I, Koashura, am going to
replace you, Koenma, you numbskull,

80
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,620
and enter into the judgment gate!

81
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,090
You're going to what?!

82
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,060
I'm going to get my hands on the Gold Seal,

83
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,660
and put my stamp on all kinds of documents!

84
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,000
You can't have that, huh?

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,600
No, I can't! I can't have that! Don't do it!

86
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,310
If I have my Gold Seal taken from me,
my old man, Yama the Great,

87
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,570
will not just let me off with a spanking!

88
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,440
That crumbling rock there will
only last until sundown, I'd say.

89
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,830
If that Gold Seal doesn't get here before then,

90
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,790
you're going to go kerplunk into the magma!

91
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,110
Hurry! Please hurry!

92
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,380
Yow!

93
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,380
Hey, what are you doing?!

94
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,860
Who are you guys?

95
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,030
This land is under the
control of the Jaki Goblins.

96
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,500
We will not let you pass through unanswered.

97
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
We don't have time to mess
around with you right now.

98
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,200
Catch you later.

99
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,210
Word is that you've got
Yama the Great's Gold Seal.

100
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,150
What?

101
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,740
Why don't you hand it over to us?

102
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,540
Urameshi!

103
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,340
We've got no time! Run, Kuwabara!

104
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,070
Yeah!

105
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,390
Shotgun!!

106
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,410
Yusuke!

107
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,550
Are you sure your people that you're
relying on will actually get here?

108
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,540
What?! Have you done something
to Yusuke and the others?!

109
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,590
I'm not telling!

110
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,960
What?! Come on, Koashura!

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,430
Ow! Hot!

112
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,160
Ow!! Hot!!

113
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,800
You dumbass! Don't send it my way!

114
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,610
Why are you doing something so terrible?!

115
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,480
Ha! Why don't you ask yourself that question?!

116
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,650
How cruel was that thing you
did to me?! This is my revenge!

117
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,090
Nyah! Nyah!

118
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,870
Hey, Kuwabara, how do you
suppose those guys back there

119
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,440
knew that we were carrying the Gold Seal?

120
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,010
Yeah. It's too soon for
word to have gotten around.

121
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,210
We've probably already fallen
into an enemy trap. If that's true...

122
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,840
Botan, watch out!

123
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,980
--Kuwabara!
--Damn it! What are these?!

124
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,390
It's the Yokai Jugan! Yusuke, over there!

125
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,030
Hand over the Gold Seal, nice and easy!

126
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,200
Rei-gun!!

127
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,900
What?!

128
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,550
You bastard!

129
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,180
I, Shobi, will be taking this.

130
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,210
Give that back!

131
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,050
Botan!

132
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,700
I've caught you.

133
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,500
That cage you're in will
continue to grow back forever.

134
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,100
I'll start by dealing with the girl.

135
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,540
Take this!

136
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,100
Botan!

137
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,950
Who is that?! Who's interfering?!

138
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,920
All you can do is control dead wood.

139
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,690
You're not up to the task of dealing with us.

140
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,250
Kurama!

141
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,370
Hiei! What are you doing here?!

142
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,270
I couldn't just leave this to you.
Not when the Gold Seal is involved.

143
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,800
Here!

144
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,140
Let us deal with these guys! Get moving!

145
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,980
I owe you one!

146
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,040
Hey, don't let them escape!

147
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,620
You're not going any further.

148
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,590
Rose Whip!!

149
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,840
Is Yusuke going to make it in time?

150
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,640
Who knows?

151
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,910
You gave the Gold Seal to Yusuke

152
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,010
because you think he'll make it in time, right?

153
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,850
Hmph, so don't ask.

154
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,860
Oh, the sun will set any moment now!
We have to increase our speed!

155
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,760
You dumbass, this is all we can manage now!

156
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,630
Ah! Here come more of them!

157
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,370
Damn it, what do we do?!

158
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,200
Nothing to do but keep going!

159
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,940
I'll wipe you guys out!

160
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,670
Who do you think you're dealing with?!

161
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,850
Who do you think I am?!

162
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,030
The Valley of Magma is just past there!

163
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,730
Damn, we're not gonna make it
in time! Urameshi! Grab onto me!

164
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,030
Extend, Rei-ken!

165
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,070
Go, Urameshi!

166
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,720
Help!

167
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,330
Hey, if we don't save him soon,
Koenma really is going to die.

168
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,570
What are you talking about?
We should let him die, shouldn't we?

169
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,370
What?

170
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,770
It's their fault for not getting here in time.

171
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,240
But...

172
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,070
Wait!

173
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,540
I brought the Gold Seal!

174
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,090
Yusuke!

175
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,520
Hurry up and save Koenma!

176
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,960
Hey, Garuga, let him go.

177
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,970
Now, hand over the Gold Seal.

178
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,600
Here.

179
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,750
So this is Yama the Great's Gold Seal?

180
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,220
I finally did it!

181
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,260
Koenma, you're finished now!

182
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,830
I'm going to make you my gofer,

183
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,320
and work you to death for the rest of your life!

184
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,130
The Gold Seal! The actual Gold Seal!

185
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,810
Hey, Garuga, what are you doing?!

186
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,640
This Gold Seal is now mine!

187
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,980
What?!

188
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,650
And I will rule over the Spirit Realm!

189
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,120
Ah! Are you disobeying my orders?!

190
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,780
I have no need for you any longer.

191
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,990
You bastard! You mean you
set this whole thing up?

192
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,860
Give that Gold Seal back to me!

193
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,660
Ha! You think you can take it back from me?

194
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,100
I'll take you out with one shot!

195
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,970
Rei-gun!!

196
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,100
Gotcha!

197
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,610
Yusuke!

198
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,060
How do you like the force
of my reflective mirror?

199
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,330
If you fight me, there's no way you can win!

200
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,120
"Yasha"

201
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,030
That's one of the Yokai on
the most wanted list, Yasha!

202
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,200
My arm... Botan, get Koenma.

203
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,400
You're in my way! Die!

204
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,850
Koenma-sama!

205
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,050
Botan!

206
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,020
You bastard...

207
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,170
Oh, you can raise your spirit
power through anger, can you?

208
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,390
How do you like this?!

209
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,460
I wish I could compliment you
on doing so well with your injury,

210
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,420
but that won't work!

211
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,030
Yusuke!

212
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,890
Yusuke!

213
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,340
That will teach you your place.

214
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,750
That's where they are!

215
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,850
Well, what will it be?

216
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,020
Beneath you is a bottomless river
of magma. Care to go for a swim?

217
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,430
--Hiei!
--Yeah.

218
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,450
W-Wait up!

219
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,710
Wait up.

220
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,180
Impossible! After the
kind of beating I gave you,

221
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,310
there's no way you should be able to stand.

222
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,610
Why do you risk your life for that little brat?

223
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,990
Well, Koenma is the one
who brought me back to life.

224
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,510
Yusuke...

225
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,690
So you owe him your life, huh?

226
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,130
In any case, I can't allow you
to have the Gold Seal.

227
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,340
Get those two now, while we can.

228
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,830
Yeah!

229
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,210
You don't know when to die.

230
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,680
I'll see that there's no trace left of you!

231
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,850
This will finish you!

232
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,180
Rei-gun!!

233
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,250
You fool!

234
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,690
Die!

235
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,530
What?!

236
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,950
--Yusuke!
--You did it!

237
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,350
No, not yet.

238
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,930
Damn it, that was a sneaky trick!

239
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,300
But don't think you can
defeat me with just that.

240
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,890
Damn, it didn't work.

241
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,300
You'll pay for that!

242
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,100
This is the last of my power!

243
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,280
Die!

244
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,320
Take a close look at your own body!

245
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,060
What? My reflective mirror won't open!

246
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,720
Take this! Rei-gun!!

247
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,160
Urameshi!

248
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,890
I did it...

249
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,470
Yusuke!

250
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,810
Yusuke!

251
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,840
Botan!

252
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,460
Oh! It's the Gold Seal!

253
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,680
Once we get back to the judgment gate,
I'll dress these properly.

254
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,210
Yeah.

255
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,220
Koashura, why would you go and
pull something this outrageous?

256
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,780
You said something or other
about getting revenge.

257
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,030
Hey! Don't try to cry it away!

258
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,830
Well, well, when Koenma and I

259
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,900
were going to Spirit Realm
Kindergarten together...

260
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,970
...as I was about to give a
present to Kotennyo-chan,

261
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,080
who I liked, on her birthday...

262
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,810
What is it you wanted to talk
to me about, Koashura-kun?

263
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,310
Oh, well, you see...

264
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,580
Kotennyo-chan!

265
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,250
Here! It's a present!

266
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,250
Thank you, Koenma-kun. Mwah!

267
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,500
Someday, I'll get you for this.

268
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,440
What?! A childhood spat?!

269
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,100
Well...

270
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,540
You are one troublemaking little punk!

271
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,610
Wah! You hit me on the same spot again!

272
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,350
In any case, the Gold Seal
is back safe and sound,

273
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,750
and this mission was a complete success.

274
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,850
So what's become of Koashura?

275
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,120
Hmm, since the Yokai Yasha
gave him such a good beating,

276
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:48,630
he got off with the usual 10,000 spankings,
together with Koenma-sama.

277
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,030
It's no laughing matter.

278
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,600
If you hadn't splashed him
with magma back there,

279
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,740
keeping him from bouncing
your Rei-gun back at you,

280
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,070
there's no telling what would
have become of the Spirit Realm.

281
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,070
Huh? Yeah, that was quite a fluke.

282
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,250
What?!

283
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,750
A fluke?!

284
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,450
Well, yeah, but it all worked
out okay, so who cares, right?

285
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,220
Hey, don't go laughing it off!

286
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,960
Yusuke!

287
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,800
Oh, that's right, I've got a date
I'm supposed to be going on!

288
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,900
Bye, guys!

289
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,430
--Whoa, just a minute, Yusuke!
--Hey, Urameshi!

290
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,120
As my heart is about to burst,

291
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,130
the mild wind that blows
against us is gentle

292
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,430
Facing each other, hand in hand,

293
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:05,440
the usual twilight
envelops us and melts away

294
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,450
Isn't it funny? They're not
even the slightest bit alike,

295
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:17,780
your smiling face, and mine

296
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:24,460
But right now, it feels like
I'm looking in a mirror

297
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:30,800
I am not feeling sad;
everything is fine, after all

298
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:37,140
There, hiding within an offhanded
greeting, lies a "thank you"

299
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,410
Sayonara, bye bye,
take care of yourself

300
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,910
This is the line I'm drawing between us,

301
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,850
so catch it, if you would

302
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:55,650
Sayonara, bye bye,
take care of yourself
