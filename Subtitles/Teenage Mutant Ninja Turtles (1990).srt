00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,290
Much more than
just a series of small, isolated incidents...

3
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,660
...it's now apparent that an organized
criminal element is at work.

4
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,545
And at the moment, business is good.

5
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,800
So good, in fact,
that there appear to be no eyewitnesses...

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,760
...to any of these crimes.

7
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:54,300
With complaints ranging
from purse-snatching...

8
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,970
...to breaking and entering...

9
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,265
...police switchboards
have been swamped...

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,060
...with the angry voices
of more and more citizens...

11
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:04,315
...who have fallen prey
to the recent surge of crime...

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,190
...that continues to plague the city.

13
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:26,335
Instead of getting better,
things have actually gotten worse.

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,960
Even more alarming is the baffling...

15
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,760
...and often bizarre nature
of these crimes.

16
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:36,345
Merchandise
of every size and description...

17
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,720
...from skateboards to stereo systems...

18
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,850
...has been disappearing
from store shelves and storage areas...

19
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,520
...at an alarming rate.

20
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,772
Aah...

21
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,360
Even the victims themselves
rarely catch a glimpse of the thieves.

22
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,864
Many don't even know
they've been victimized until it's too late.

23
00:01:56,032 --> 00:02:00,744
In fact, police have yet to come up
with a single eyewitness.

24
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,621
Only a few vague reports...

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,708
...of young boys or teenagers
at the scenes have been filed.

26
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,963
But whoever is behind these crimes,
one thing is certain.

27
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:16,718
These are much more than just a series
of random isolated incidents.

28
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,349
Come on. Hurry up.

29
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,485
Mm.

30
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,070
Good.

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,703
Crimes without criminals?

32
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,580
An invisible gang at work?

33
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,248
Who are we gonna call?

34
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,585
Unfortunately,
the police are the only ones available...

35
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:54,339
...to combat what some are already dubbing
"the silent crime wave."

36
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,092
But perhaps the most
disturbing silence...

37
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,761
...is that coming from city hall.

38
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,432
April O'Neil,
Channel 3 Eyewitness News.

39
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,809
You gotta stop working so hard, April.

40
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,687
What, and give up
all this glamour? Ha-ha-ha.

41
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,773
- Good night.
- Good night.

42
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,978
Bad timing.

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,855
You're telling me.

44
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,067
- Get her purse. Hey, get her purse.
- Get away from me!

45
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,486
- What do you think... Help!
- Get herjewelry.

46
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,488
- Hurry up.
- Get the money. I got her watch.

47
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,583
Whoa.

48
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,801
What the hell's going on?
Thought I'd seen it all.

49
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,345
Ready.

50
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,391
All right. You tough guys.

51
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,519
Roll over here. How did you
get yourself into this, huh, kid?

52
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,521
- You all right, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,857
Listen, rest right here
while we deal with these guys.

54
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,158
- Ted, give John a hand.
- What you got there?

55
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,536
Oh, man.

56
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,706
Come on, no fighting.

57
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,874
- Untie me.
- Let's get them in the car.

58
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,793
Damn.

59
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,070
Spectacular.

60
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,449
- We were awesome, bros.
- Far out. Ow!

61
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,992
Yes, dudes and dudettes...

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,578
...major league butt-kicking
is back in town.

63
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,746
Oh, yeah.

64
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,627
Awesome.

65
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,005
Ha-ha-ha. Righteous.

66
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,465
Bossa nova!

67
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,467
- What?
- Huh?

68
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,552
Bossa nova?

69
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,763
- Chevy Nova?
- Oh.

70
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,433
Excellent.

71
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,144
- Yeah.
- All right.

72
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,147
- Come on, let's move it. I'm starving.
- Ooh.

73
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,567
Ooh. We're talking
major pizza attack here, dudes.

74
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,778
Pizza. I need it.

75
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,279
Oh, baby.

76
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,864
Oh, man.

77
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,699
All right.

78
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,119
- Evening, bros.
- Whoo!

79
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,121
- Give me three.
- You got it.

80
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,379
We were great. I can't believe it.

81
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,423
Damn!

82
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,137
All right. Shh, shh.

83
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,473
Ha-ha.

84
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,851
We have had our first battle,
Master Splinter.

85
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,270
They were many, but we kicked...

86
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,233
- We fought well.
- Mm-hm.

87
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,236
- Were you seen?
- Mm-mm.

88
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,448
In this you must never lapse.

89
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:54,204
Even those who would be our allies
would not understand.

90
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,457
Our domain is the shadow.

91
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,835
Stray from it reluctantly.

92
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,378
For when you do...

93
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:06,007
...you must strike hard and fade away...

94
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,302
...without a trace.

95
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,013
I lost a sai.

96
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,641
- Then it is gone.
- But I can get it back. I can.

97
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,853
Raphael, let it go.

98
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,022
Hey.

99
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,488
Your ninja skills are reaching their peak.

100
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:35,203
Only one truly important lesson remains,
but must wait.

101
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:40,041
I know it is hard for you
here underground.

102
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,836
I want a large thick crust
with double cheese...

103
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,379
...ham, pepperoni.

104
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,383
Your teenage minds are broad, eager.

105
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:53,346
But you must never stop practicing
the art of ninja...

106
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,476
...the art of invisibility.

107
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,060
Oh, but no anchovies.

108
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,229
And I mean no anchovies.

109
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:05,025
You put anchovies on this thing
and you're in big trouble, okay?

110
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,234
Michaelangelo!

111
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,820
That'll do. And the clock's ticking, dude.

112
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,869
You are still young...

113
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,373
...but one day, I will be gone.

114
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,877
Use my teachings wisely.

115
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,797
I suggest we all meditate now...

116
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,550
...on the events of this evening.

117
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,728
Yeah.

118
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:47,150
Yeah.

119
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,195
Ninjitsu.

120
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,364
Well, this is like meditating.

121
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,869
Hey, Raph, where you going?

122
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,205
Out to a movie.

123
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,124
That okay with you?

124
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,960
Yeah.

125
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,301
Sock it to me, baby.

126
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,489
- How you doing?
- Fine.

127
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,826
Nice night.

128
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,869
Mm-hm.

129
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,372
Pizza dude's got 30 seconds.

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,207
Mm-hm.

131
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,921
Hey, Mikey, did you ever think
about what Splinter said tonight?

132
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,632
I mean, about what it would be like...

133
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,927
...you know, not having him?

134
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,804
Hmm.

135
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,267
- Time's up. Three bucks off.
- Mm.

136
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,773
Okay.

137
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,950
Now, 122, 122 and an eighth?

138
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:23,872
122 and an eighth. Terrific.

139
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,666
Where the heck is 122 and an eighth?

140
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,377
You're standing on it, dude.

141
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,505
Just slip it down here.

142
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,222
Give me that.

143
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,186
Hey, this is a 10. The tab's 13.

144
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,063
You're two minutes late, dude.

145
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,690
Oh, come on. I couldn't find the place.

146
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,443
Wise man say, "Forgiveness is divine...

147
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,197
...but never pay full price for late pizza."

148
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,701
I gotta get a new route.
And I thought I delivered everywhere.

149
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,205
Yes, friends, the new Turbo Ginsu.

150
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,082
It dices, it slices...

151
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,752
...and yet makes French fries
in three different...

152
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,295
Whoops!

153
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,922
Mm. Kids.

154
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,009
Hmm.

155
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,806
- There's a joke on the...
- I know.

156
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,769
Ugh.

157
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,397
Where do they come up with this stuff?

158
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,282
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,368
- Come back here.
- Somebody stop them.

160
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,248
- Where's the...?
- What?

161
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,582
- Huh?
- Huh.

162
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,460
Mm-mm.

163
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,796
Whoa.

164
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,096
What the hell was that?

165
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,431
I don't know.

166
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,643
Now, that was a crime,
you purse-grabbing pukes...

167
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,895
...and this is the penalty.

168
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,817
Two minutes for slashing,
two minutes for hooking...

169
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,528
...and let's not forget
my personal favorite...

170
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,239
...two minutes for high-sticking.
Aah!

171
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,994
How about a five-minute game misconduct
for roughing, pal?

172
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,247
Hey, Bogie,
now, who died and made you referee?

173
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,207
You did yourjob, now let me do mine.

174
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,917
These JV lowlifes need a lesson.

175
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,669
Not like that they don't.

176
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,755
Not from you.

177
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,845
Well, it looks like you're the one
who needs to be taught a lesson, pal.

178
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,849
Class is Pain 101.
Your instructor is Casey Jones.

179
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,685
Look, I don't wanna fight you.

180
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,520
Well, tough rocks, pal.

181
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,734
A Jose Canseco bat?

182
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,154
- Tell me you didn't pay money for this.
- Ooh.

183
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,864
That's it.

184
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,200
Was a two-for-one sale, pal.

185
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,622
- Hey, what are you, some sort of punker?
- Huh?

186
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,792
God, I hate punkers.

187
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,753
Especially bald ones
with green makeup...

188
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,714
...who wear masks over ugly faces.
- That's it.

189
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,883
- Ooh.
- New batter.

190
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,676
Strike one.

191
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,553
Whoa. Whiffer.

192
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,391
- Ooh. Uhn!
- Home run.

193
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,561
Raphael wins.

194
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,231
One-nothing!

195
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,694
Well?

196
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,696
New game, roundhead.

197
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,493
- Cricket.
- Cricket?

198
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,537
Nobody understands cricket.

199
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,414
You gotta know what a crumpet is
to understand cricket.

200
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,416
I'll teach you.

201
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,256
- Ooh...
- See? Six runs.

202
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,430
So long, freak. I got work to do.

203
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,599
Freak?

204
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,227
Freak!

205
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,026
What the heck was that?

206
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,780
Looked like sort of a big turtle
in a trench coat.

207
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,241
You're going to LaGuardia, right?

208
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,659
Come back here.

209
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,077
I'm not finished with you.

210
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,497
Damn!

211
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,303
Raphael.

212
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,138
Come sit by me.

213
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,056
Couldrt this wait till morning?

214
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,059
You will listen now.

215
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:09,324
My master Yoshi's first rule...

216
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,994
...was possess the right thinking.

217
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,331
Only then can one receive...

218
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:21,669
...the gifts of strength,
knowledge and peace.

219
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:29,510
I have tried to channel your anger,
Raphael...

220
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,096
...but more remains.

221
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,516
Anger clouds the mind.

222
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:41,022
Turned inward,
it is an unconquerable enemy.

223
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,360
You are unique among your brothers...

224
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:50,531
...for you choose
to face this enemy alone.

225
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:56,162
But as you face it, do not forget them.

226
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,666
And do not forget me.

227
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:07,215
I am here, my son.

228
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,219
Come on, April, you could've
called me last night, you know?

229
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,390
Call it a quirk, but I like to know when one
of my best reporters has been mugged.

230
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,392
I wasn't mugged, Charles.

231
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,938
Besides, I knew you'd just worry and then
rush over here like you did this morning.

232
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,107
From now on,
security is gonna escort you...

233
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,235
...to that Stone-Age van of yours
every night.

234
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,445
- Yes, sir.
- I'm not kidding, April.

235
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,407
Ugh. Hey, Danny, how's school going?

236
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,409
- Fine.
- Oh, wonderful.

237
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,121
So wonderful I have to drive him there
every morning now...

238
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,456
...just to make sure he goes.

239
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,625
See?

240
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,003
That's what he does
when he wants to ignore me.

241
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,587
Sticks his head in those things.

242
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,592
I wonder where the hell
he got those things, anyway.

243
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,095
Charles, give the kid a break.

244
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,599
Just what is going on out there, April?

245
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,853
I've never seen anything like this before.

246
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,105
Like the city's falling apart.

247
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,191
It's getting so you can't step outside
in the daytime anymore.

248
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,235
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

249
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,738
After everything I've heard
out of Little Tokyo...

250
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,699
...Sterns is gonna have some answering
to do this afternoon.

251
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,994
Look. Just take it easy, okay?

252
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,621
He's already got the mayor
breathing down my neck.

253
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,750
We are presently executing a plan
of redeployment...

254
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,668
...that will minimize response time...

255
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,255
...while maximizing coordination
between patrol units...

256
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,800
...in a decentralized networking scheme.

257
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:38,014
Huh. I'm not sure I understood all that,
Chief Sterns.

258
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,599
Would you mind repeating it...

259
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,351
...in English, perhaps?

260
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,482
What that means, Miss O'Neil,
is that we have everything well in hand.

261
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,193
- You know why crimes have been escalating.
- Guys, look.

262
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,738
- That's her.
- No, I didn't say that either. Miss O'Neil...

263
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:58,117
...if you would stick to asking questions,
there would be a lot...

264
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,662
- Mmm. I'm in love.
- What do you know about an organization...

265
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,290
...known as The Foot Clan?

266
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,335
There is no evidence
to link such a name to these incidents.

267
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,255
Are you denying that such an organization
known as The Foot exists?

268
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,257
I'm not denying anything.

269
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,594
Again, you're putting words
into my mouth.

270
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,722
- Find her.
- It often seems that somebody ought to.

271
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,266
- Silence her.
- Miss O'Neil...

272
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,645
- She's great.
- An understatement as usual.

273
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,814
- You're telling me.
- The girl is a fox.

274
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,275
Look at the local weather
for this vicinity as it stands at this hour.

275
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,862
O'Neil, get in here.

276
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,782
Time me.

277
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,167
Just what is it you hoped to accomplish
out there besides busting my chops?

278
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,880
I think you know just as much as I do
about this Foot Clan...

279
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,466
...and I don't think
you're doing anything about it.

280
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,301
You expect me to waste manpower...

281
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,679
...because a few immigrants
are reminded...

282
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,807
...of something that supposedly happened
years ago in Japan?

283
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,350
Have you got something else?

284
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,521
Are you trying to tell me
how to do my job?

285
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,526
One-oh-seven, a new record.

286
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,215
Oh, great.

287
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,717
Just great.

288
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,189
We've been waiting for you, Miss O'Neil.

289
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,274
What?

290
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,152
Am I behind
on my Sony payments again? Ha-ha-ha.

291
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,323
Your mouth may yet bring you
much trouble, Miss O'Neil.

292
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,908
I deliver a message.

293
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,413
- Hah!
- Shut it.

294
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,128
All right. That's it.

295
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,650
Are you crazy?

296
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,404
Yeah, Leo, I'm crazy. Okay?

297
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,072
A loony. Okay?

298
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,282
Why?

299
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,201
Why? Why? Oh, I don't know.

300
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,911
Because I wanted to redecorate.

301
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,164
You know, a couple of throw pillows,
a TV news reporter.

302
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,833
- What do you think?
- Ahem.

303
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,168
Raphael, what are you doing?

304
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,130
She got jumped in the subway.
I had to bring her here.

305
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,215
It's the newslady.

306
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,342
Can we keep her?

307
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,139
- Bring water, cold washcloth, pillow.
- Far out.

308
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,110
Oh...

309
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,743
Hi.

310
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,916
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm dead.

311
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,877
- I'm dead, aren't I?
- It's okay.

312
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,087
No, I'm dreaming. I must be dreaming.

313
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,841
Okay. Now, those guys
in the black pajamas, they jumped me.

314
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,384
And that rat...

315
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,262
...I saw you in the parking lot.
That explains you.

316
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,766
- And you guys... Um...
- Hmm?

317
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,853
...I have no idea where you came from.

318
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,940
If you will please just sit down
and calm yourself.

319
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,234
I will tell you where we came from.

320
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,486
It talks.

321
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,781
It is really quite simple, Miss O'Neil.

322
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,867
And he knows my name.

323
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,827
Perfect.

324
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,080
Fifteen years ago...

325
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,124
Why don't I ever dream
of Harrison Ford?

326
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,757
For 15 years now, we have lived here.

327
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:11,722
Before that time,
I was a pet of my master Yoshi...

328
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,393
...mimicking his movements
from my cage...

329
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,313
...and learning the secret art of ninja.

330
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,276
When we were forced
to come to New York...

331
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:29,782
...I found myself for the first time
without a home...

332
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,912
...wandering the sewers,
scavenging for whatever I could find.

333
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,123
And then, one day...

334
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,000
...I came upon a shattered glass jar...

335
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,586
...and four baby turtles.

336
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,296
- That was us. Heh-heh.
- Shut up.

337
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,466
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

338
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:52,847
The little ones were crawling
into a strange glowing ooze...

339
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,517
...from a broken canister nearby.

340
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,312
I gathered them up in an old coffee can...

341
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,692
...and when I awoke the next morning,
I received a shock...

342
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,070
...for they had doubled in size.

343
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:12,533
I too was growing,
particularly in intellect...

344
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,454
...and I was amazed
at how intelligent they seemed.

345
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:21,167
But nothing could have prepared me
for what happened next.

346
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,169
One of them spoke.

347
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,796
Pizza.

348
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,673
More words followed...

349
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,259
...and I began their training...

350
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,804
...teaching them all that I had learned
from my master.

351
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,890
Radical. Radical. Radical.

352
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,560
And soon I gave them all names...

353
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,854
...Leonardo...

354
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,190
...Michaelangelo...
- That's me.

355
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,858
...Donatello...

356
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,569
...and Raphael.

357
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,868
I'm not dreaming, am I?

358
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,370
No, I'm afraid not.

359
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:06,879
Ew. Are you guys sure
you know where you're going?

360
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,255
11th and Bleecker?

361
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,425
Nope. This is only 9th Street. Ha.

362
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,635
- Get it?
- Yuck.

363
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,553
Okay.

364
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,151
Ah...

365
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,862
I'd like to invite you all in...

366
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,950
...but I really don't have anything to offer
you guys except for frozen pizza.

367
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,452
Let's go for it.

368
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,121
You said the magic word.

369
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,708
- You guys eat pizza?
- Doesrt everybody?

370
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,752
Yeah, well...

371
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,796
...all right.

372
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,090
Hey, did she say pizza?

373
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,133
- So you live in an antique store?
- Yep.

374
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,426
Pizza.

375
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,512
Well, above, actually.

376
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,765
What do you guys like on your pizza?

377
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,475
Just the regular stuff.

378
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,227
Flies, stink bugs.

379
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,772
It was a joke. Ha-ha.

380
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,156
Yeah, well, maybe I'll fight Apollo...

381
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,992
...maybe I won't, you know?

382
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,326
What do you think?

383
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,579
- Adrian!
- Ha-ha-ha.

384
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,163
Hey, I got another one.

385
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,917
- This is totally cool.
- Oh, no, not Cagney.

386
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,504
Mmm. You dirty rat.

387
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,172
You killed my brother.

388
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,383
You dirty rat. Mmm.

389
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,011
Whoo-hoo. Ha-ha-ha.

390
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,847
That must be Splinter's favorite. Ha-ha-ha.

391
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,475
Huh?

392
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,438
- It was a joke.
- Hmm?

393
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,116
And speaking of which,
we better get going.

394
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,701
He worries.

395
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:05,080
Oh. Well, I don't know what to say.

396
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,875
- Will I ever see you guys again?
- Indubitably.

397
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,711
That depends
on how fast you stock your pizza.

398
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,172
- Deal.
- See you around.

399
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,758
- Bye.
- Later.

400
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,058
Ha-ha. No doubt about it. She loved us.

401
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,726
It was the impressions, dudes.

402
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,394
- You wish.
- Hold it.

403
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,912
Splinter.

404
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,817
What's wrong?

405
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,276
Splinter.

406
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,248
555-5215.

407
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,047
- Hello.
- Hello.

408
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,382
Charles Pennington?

409
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,008
Yeah. Who's this?

410
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,761
You got a son named Danny, Charles?

411
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,697
Who is it?

412
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,950
- It's me, Charles.
- It's my boss.

413
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,661
Can you guys...

414
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,456
...hide?

415
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,795
Charles, what's up?

416
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,130
April...

417
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,798
...listen.

418
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:25,804
I've... You have been working awful hard
on this story lately.

419
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,892
Why don't you take it easy for a while?
Just... Just...

420
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,020
Just let somebody else handle it.

421
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,857
Just for a little while, you know?

422
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,735
Charles, what are you talking about?
It's my story. No way.

423
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,487
Look at you. You're exhausted.

424
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,863
I just had a rough night.

425
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,824
Let somebody else help you
cover city hall.

426
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,701
Charles, that's ridiculous.

427
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,369
What's with you today?

428
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,914
Nothing's with me today.

429
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,291
I just thought you might like a little help.

430
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,709
Well, I don't.

431
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,671
- Hand me a towel, will you?
- Where do you keep the towels?

432
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,091
- Charles, no.
- What's wrong?

433
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,929
I just... I just don't want you to see
my unsightly bathtub ring. Okay?

434
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,348
Just out, out, out.

435
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,141
I have to get ready for work.

436
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,310
Are you sure you won't reconsider
some help?

437
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,979
Hey, Danny,
will you tell your father to relax?

438
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,856
I wish.

439
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,028
Just don't push any buttons today.
Okay?

440
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,826
- That was close. Whoa!
- Hah!

441
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,037
Time to switch to decaf, April.

442
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,373
I don't get it, Danny.

443
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,918
I make enough money to provide
for both of us and you're stealing.

444
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,127
Why?

445
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,588
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

446
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,216
What were you doing
with a car stereo anyway?

447
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,509
Or don't you know?

448
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,427
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

449
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,347
Not as sorry as you're gonna be
after school.

450
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,600
Danny, damn it.

451
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,519
Danny, come back here.

452
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,680
How are you doing?

453
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,313
Check it out, man.
Anything you guys want, we got it.

454
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,982
Anything you want to do...

455
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,693
...do it. Know what I'm saying?
Anything.

456
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,321
You got any cigarettes?

457
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,283
Regular or menthol?

458
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,791
Read them and weep, boys.

459
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,253
- Full house.
- Oh, no.

460
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,967
Mmp! Mm-hm.

461
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,639
Go. Play.

462
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,768
All right.

463
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,855
- Hah!
- Oh!

464
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,983
- Hah! Hah!
- Aah! Ooh!

465
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,193
How's this look?

466
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,364
- Hah! Hah! Hah!
- Ooh.

467
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,866
You. Hm!

468
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,162
Mm.

469
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,883
Good.

470
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,519
Never lower your eyes to an enemy.

471
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,854
Yes, Master Tatsu.

472
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,404
All right.

473
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,200
Yeah. I am.

474
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,473
Master Shredder.

475
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:06,144
Money cannot buy the honor
which you have earned tonight.

476
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,361
You make us all proud.

477
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:22,369
Only effort, discipline, loyalty...

478
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,789
...earn the right to wear the dragon dogi.

479
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:31,336
You are here
because the outside world rejects you.

480
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,338
This is your family.

481
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,134
I am your father.

482
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:44,307
I want you all to become full members
of The Foot.

483
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,185
There is a new enemy...

484
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:52,107
...freaks of nature
who interfere with our business.

485
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:56,403
You are my eyes and ears. Find them.

486
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,615
Together we will punish these...

487
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,076
...creatures.

488
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,787
These...

489
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,039
...turtles.

490
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,625
Master.

491
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,139
This is beginning to sound
less and less...

492
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,017
...like your common,
garden-variety subway mugging.

493
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,769
- Exactly, June.
- Boy, she's a good reporter.

494
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:34,274
- She's a babe.
- Organization known as The Foot.

495
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,859
I'm sorry, The Foot?

496
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,446
Yeah, I know it sounds like
a funky club for podiatrists...

497
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:43,158
...but I've been speaking with Japanese-
Americans in the past few days...

498
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,785
...who say that our crime wave
is reminiscent...

499
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,371
...of a secret band of ninja thieves...

500
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,415
...who once operated in Japan.

501
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,417
Are the police looking into this?

502
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,628
I've included everything
in my statement...

503
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,130
...but I doubt very much
that Chief Sterns...

504
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,133
...is taking this possible connection
seriously.

505
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,638
- I see. Well, perhaps if any of our viewers...
- Oh, God.

506
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,640
Mr. Pennington, Chief Sterns' office.

507
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,017
- Contact local police
or get in touch with us...

508
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,478
Pennington, I thought we had a deal!

509
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,648
You still haven't told us
how you got away from your attacker.

510
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,067
It's really quite incredible.

511
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,946
Some citizens of New York
actually came to my rescue.

512
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,658
Who says everyone in the Big Apple
looks the other way?

513
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,285
Seriously,
I would like to take this opportunity...

514
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:31,498
...to thank one of those individuals
in particular.

515
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,834
And if he's watching, thanks, Raphael.

516
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,171
Studly.

517
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,589
Hey, look. Nyak-nyak.

518
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,383
I think he's blushing. Heh.

519
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,842
I am not.

520
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,928
I think he's actually turning red.

521
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,100
- Uh, hmm. Maybe not.
- Mm-hm.

522
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,353
So, what do we do now?

523
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,898
- What do you mean, what do we do now?
- Splinter's out there somewhere.

524
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,025
I know Splinter's out there.

525
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,568
- Fight?
- Fight.

526
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,778
- Kitchen?
- Kitchen.

527
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,614
- Yeah.
- So, what are we gonna do about it?

528
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,157
What can we do about it?

529
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,493
April's our only link to these guys.

530
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,204
We have to wait
until she comes up with something.

531
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:17,002
Oh, so that's the plan
from our great leader, huh?

532
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,837
Just sit here on our butts.

533
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,881
I never said I was your great leader.

534
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,800
Well, you sure act like it sometimes.

535
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,220
Yeah? Well, you act like a jerk sometimes,
you know that?

536
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,223
And this attitude of yours
isn't helping anything.

537
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,393
Well, maybe I'll just take my attitude
and leave!

538
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,186
- Why don't you?
- I will.

539
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,521
- Good.
- Great.

540
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,065
Go ahead. We don't need you.

541
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,236
Pork rind?

542
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,196
Pork rind.

543
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,699
Damn!

544
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,244
Hah!

545
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,747
Ha-ah!

546
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,033
Go.

547
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,534
Move it, will you?

548
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,453
You're letting him blow right by you.

549
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,497
- Can you believe this guy?
- Hmm?

550
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,290
Come on. Don't just...

551
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,293
Ninja-kick the damn rabbit.
Do something.

552
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,920
Hey.

553
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,465
- April, hey, you were great.
- Thanks, Mikey.

554
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,510
Ho... She called me Mikey.

555
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,225
Hear anything yet?

556
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,102
Not yet.

557
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,813
They're gonna repeat the interview
at 5 and 6.

558
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,566
And we're gonna have to wait and see
if it helps generate any new information.

559
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,318
Mmm.

560
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,779
Hey, I told them to call me here
immediately...

561
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,989
...if anyone calls the station.

562
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,574
Thanks, April.

563
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,661
We really appreciate,
you know, everything.

564
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,995
Yeah.

565
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,665
Hey, forget it.

566
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,418
Where's Raphael?

567
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,678
Well, I was gonna give you guys
a tour of the store.

568
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,098
- Shall we go get him?
- No.

569
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,934
- He just needs to blow off some steam.
- Yeah.

570
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,689
You guys must be studying
the abridged book of ninja fighting.

571
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,740
Come on, come here. Come here.

572
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,038
I mean, come on.

573
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,041
How do you guys expect to beat me?

574
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,672
Good answer.

575
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,885
I only keep it open part-time,
mostly for my dad.

576
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,053
Heh. He loved junk.

577
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,973
I don't know.
It's dumb to lose money on a business...

578
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,350
...just because you miss your father.

579
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,436
No, it isn't.

580
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,731
Ready?

581
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,409
- This place has everything.
- Yup, just about.

582
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,620
Shh.

583
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,664
Eeeee.

584
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,626
Aah!

585
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,007
Hasrt Raph been gone a long time?

586
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,593
No. He does it all the time. He likes it.

587
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,180
Are you sure?

588
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,100
Don't worry.
He'll probably be back any minute.

589
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,728
Raph!

590
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,355
Is he...?

591
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,232
- No, he's alive. Barely.
- Oh, God.

592
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,786
- Hey, what the...?
- Whoa.

593
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,372
And I thought insurance salesmen
were pushy.

594
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,879
Ohh. A fellow chucker, eh?

595
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,383
What?

596
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:38,096
Oh-woh-oh. Oh-oh.
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Wah!

597
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,401
Oh.

598
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,199
Hmm-hmm.

599
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,620
Hah.

600
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,624
Keep practicing.

601
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,969
Take that.

602
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,270
Hey, one of these guys must know
where they're holding Splinter.

603
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,023
So don't knock them all out.

604
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,942
I don't think that will be a problem, Leo.

605
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,872
Gotcha.

606
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,628
Hey, Donnie, Wheel of Fortune, dude.

607
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,344
Bisen-tos. Now!

608
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,764
I guess they're not game show fans.

609
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:06,351
- And I thought everybody loved Vanna.
- Aah! Whoa!

610
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,065
California roll. Ooh.

611
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,233
Oh, what a spaz.

612
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,736
- Missed again.
- Good thing they aren't lumberjacks.

613
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,945
No joke.

614
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:21,741
The only thing safe in the woods
would be the trees.

615
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,622
Guys, I'm not so sure if this is,
structurally speaking...

616
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,583
...such a good time
for your buddies to drop in.

617
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,341
- Uh-oh.
- Aah!

618
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,137
Oh, whoa. Wipeout.

619
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:49,936
- Huh?
- Hmm?

620
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,773
- Hmm.
- Oh, no.

621
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,235
Mm.

622
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,037
Ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Oh!

623
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,456
Ooh. Ooh.

624
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,796
Hey, hey, hey.

625
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,260
Hai!

626
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,484
Man, we could really use
Raph right about now.

627
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,952
Now what?

628
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:56,878
Oh. You guys mind telling me what you're
doing to my little green pal over there?

629
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,421
Mm?

630
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,966
Oh, who is the babe?

631
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,427
Who the heck is that?

632
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,472
Wayne Gretzky on steroids?

633
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,766
Attack.

634
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,152
Aaa-aaa-aah!

635
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,785
Come on, we got to get out of here.

636
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,169
Help me. There used to be
a trapdoor here to the basement.

637
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,171
Yeah, come on, you ugly muggers.

638
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,964
Come on.

639
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,468
We're getting out of here.

640
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,224
Gangway, men.
I'll take care of these guys.

641
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,896
- You coming?
- I'll cover you.

642
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,356
Good idea.

643
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,070
Hi, this is April.

644
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,030
- Leave a message after the beep.
- What?

645
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,491
April, it's Charles.

646
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,369
I'm sorry.
I don't know how else to say this.

647
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,662
You're fired, April.

648
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,958
I'm sorry. I know this comes as a blow.

649
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,169
- You can say that again, Chuck.
- Come on.

650
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,255
Bye, guys, got to run.

651
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,427
Ninja, vanish.

652
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,353
Oh.

653
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,973
What are these freaks?

654
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,268
How do they know how to fight like this?

655
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:23,357
You will answer.

656
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:28,154
Then hang there until you die.

657
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,815
Whoa.
Master Tatsu, stop, please, please.

658
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,651
Please, no.

659
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,702
Shinsho.

660
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,623
You'll be all right. You'll be all right.

661
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:45,773
How can a face so young
wear so many burdens?

662
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,693
So you can talk.

663
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,364
Yes, and I can also listen.

664
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:58,077
Some say that the path
from inner turmoil...

665
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,872
...begins with a friendly ear.

666
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,583
My ear is open...

667
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:08,879
...if you care to use it.
- No, I don't think so.

668
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,007
What is your name?

669
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:13,801
Danny.

670
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,762
And have you no one to go to, Danny?

671
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,055
No parent?

672
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,516
My dad couldn't care less about me.

673
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,936
I doubt that is true.

674
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,273
Why?

675
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:33,779
All fathers care for their sons.

676
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,459
- How's Raphael?
- Not so good.

677
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,170
Hey, didn't they use this place
in The Grapes of Wrath?

678
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,213
Very funny.

679
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,925
I told you,
I haven't been up here in years.

680
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,309
Can you fix it?

681
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,025
Does that answer your question?

682
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,487
I mean, the block's got a crack in it
the size of the San Andreas.

683
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,322
- Wonderful.
- Ah.

684
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,034
Well, I guess
I've got some walking to do.

685
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,535
What for?

686
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,121
Our nearest neighbor
is about four miles away.

687
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,916
I need to get to a phone,
and I need to call my boss.

688
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,501
You mean Charles?

689
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,710
How did you know that?

690
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:33,089
Well, he left a message on your machine
just before we got out.

691
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,590
And?

692
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,136
Well, hey, you just saved yourself
an eight-mile round-tripper.

693
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,680
You were fired.

694
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,682
I'm...

695
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,477
- I just saved myself?
- Yeah.

696
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,853
- Uh-oh.
- What did you do?

697
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,314
Did you take classes in insensitivity?

698
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:54,026
- I was just trying to break it to you easy.
- Oh, well, you failed miserably.

699
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,404
Hey, Broadzilla, you wouldn't be here
if it werert for me, okay?

700
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,199
Oh, and what do you want?
Do you want a thank you?

701
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,702
No. It's me who should thank you
for that privilege, right?

702
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,830
- Fine. Thank you.
- Yeah. No, thank you.

703
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,791
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

704
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:14,839
Gosh, it's kind of like Moonlighting,
isn't it?

705
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,465
- Heh.
- Mm-hm.

706
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,394
It's strange being back on the old farm.

707
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:32,565
Even after all these years,
it still feels like home.

708
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,569
My amazing new friends
have suffered their first real defeat.

709
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,945
That's bad enough...

710
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,657
...but they've also lost the opportunity
to find out about their mentor...

711
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,286
...and I'm sure that hurts them
much more than anything else.

712
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:48,914
Each of them deals with this confusion
in his own way.

713
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,917
Donatello has found someone
to latch onto.

714
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:55,171
Not even close, zip neck.

715
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,924
The Professor and Mary Ann,
happily ever after.

716
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,926
No way, atomic mouth.

717
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,803
Gilligan was her main man.

718
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,139
They'd be married
and have six kids by now.

719
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,516
Gilligan was a geek, barfaroni.

720
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,853
- You're the geek, camel breath.
- Dome head.

721
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,855
Hmm!

722
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,024
Elf lips.

723
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:20,362
Let's give this a try,
see if this transplant worked, fungoid.

724
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,616
- All right, here it goes. What are we on?
- Uh...

725
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:24,992
- G.
- Heh.

726
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,619
Here goes, gack face.

727
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,913
I'm ready, hose brain.

728
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:41,008
It worked. Uh... Hey.

729
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:46,639
Leonardo, meanwhile,
has kept a constant vigil with Raphael.

730
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,343
He'll be okay.

731
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,350
And then there's Casey Jones...

732
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,811
...a 9-year-old trapped in a mars body.

733
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,815
He might almost be cute
if it wasn't for that pigheadedness.

734
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,150
Donatello.

735
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,986
He's out with the others...

736
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,613
...they're exercising.

737
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,907
Doing something together, I don't know.

738
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,993
You want some help?

739
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,956
- Ah.
- Hey, I am your man. I am Mr. Fix-it.

740
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,708
All right.

741
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,585
- Let's go.
- Lead the way, toots.

742
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:03,048
- Toots?
- Oh... Babe?

743
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,884
Sweetcakes?

744
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,555
Ah! Princess.

745
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,099
Do you want to throw me a clue here?
I'm drowning.

746
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,226
You know what? That's okay.

747
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,021
- I'll take care of it myself.
- Fine, that's up to you.

748
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,190
Just don't come around here
asking for my help anymore.

749
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,067
See, I wouldn't ask for your help...

750
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:26,905
...if you were the last thing
on the face of this planet.

751
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,742
It's coming along nicely.

752
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,584
- Hey.
- What?

753
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,254
Raph.

754
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,257
You're awake. How do you feel?

755
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:49,803
What's a guy got to do
to get some food around here?

756
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,264
Hey. Hey, he's awake.

757
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,974
He wants some food.

758
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,518
Bring some food.

759
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,812
You're gonna be okay, Raph.

760
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,481
You're gonna be okay.

761
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,858
Yeah, yeah, all right, Leo.

762
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,110
Get a grip, will you?

763
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,612
Listen, Raph.

764
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,783
About what I said before...

765
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,702
...you know...

766
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,789
...about not needing you and all, like...

767
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,582
Leo...

768
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,292
...don't.

769
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,045
Oh, boy, we missed you.

770
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,131
It's a Kodak moment.

771
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,226
The turtles are four once again...

772
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,144
...and yet, still not whole.

773
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,898
A lingering doubt remains.

774
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,776
An unknown
which they can't bear to face...

775
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,237
...their greatest fear.

776
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,824
Splinter!

777
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,040
Your empire flourishes, Master Shredder.

778
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,835
- No, no, no, that's a stereo.
- What more from the rat?

779
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,002
Nothing.

780
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,963
He will not speak.

781
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,507
And the boy who led us to the turtles?

782
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,343
He is still missing.

783
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,679
I do not understand.

784
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,723
Why do the turtles trouble you, master?

785
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,601
They have not been seen for many days.

786
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:25,149
Something about the way
you described their fighting.

787
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,402
Something familiar.

788
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,196
Something...

789
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,076
...from the past.

790
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,063
- Ointment?
- Mm-mm.

791
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,523
Hey, guys.

792
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,275
Hmm.

793
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,072
Oh, God.

794
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,699
Funny, Mikey.

795
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,557
Leonardo.

796
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,142
Hah. Splinter.

797
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:28,730
What Russian novel,
embracing more than 500 characters...

798
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,149
...is set in the Napoleonic Wars?

799
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,317
War and Peace.

800
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,236
He's alive.

801
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,612
- Hey.
- Thanks, spaz.

802
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,656
Splinter's alive.

803
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,825
We know, Leo. Of course he is.

804
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,326
We all think he's alive.

805
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,495
I don't think.

806
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,330
- I know.
- Huh?

807
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,540
Huh?

808
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,964
Leo...

809
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,092
...if you dragged us
out here for nothing...

810
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,678
Don't worry. I came prepared.

811
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,096
- Put those away.
- Heh-heh.

812
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,472
Heh.

813
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,686
Now, everybody close your eyes
and concentrate.

814
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,022
Concentrate hard.

815
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:40,510
I am proud of you, my sons.

816
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:43,180
Tonight you have learned...

817
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:48,101
...the final and greatest truth
of the ninja...

818
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:53,649
...that ultimate mastery
comes not of the body...

819
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,193
...but of the mind.

820
01:00:56,361 --> 01:01:01,823
Together, there is nothing
your four minds cannot accomplish.

821
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,116
Help each other.

822
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,911
Draw upon one another.

823
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,917
And always remember
the true force that binds you...

824
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,797
...the same as that
which brought me here tonight...

825
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:23,011
...that which I gladly return
with my final words.

826
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:26,515
I love you all, my sons.

827
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:36,483
Huh. Huh? Uh... Huh.

828
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,056
So you actually played professionally?

829
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,601
Before I got hurt, less than a year.

830
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,980
I'm sorry.

831
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,982
- So was I.
- Ah-ah-ahem.

832
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,737
Guys, I told you...

833
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,489
...I hate it when you do that, all right?

834
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,992
What is it?

835
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,078
It's time to go back.

836
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:54,269
Oh, no. Oh.

837
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,937
- Home sweet home.
- Ha-ha.

838
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,147
Yuch.

839
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:00,275
I know what it's like to travel
without a green card.

840
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,526
This isn't bad.

841
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,196
Nice place, guys. In fact, l...

842
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,616
Are you coming or not, dude?

843
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,914
This is great, it's great.

844
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:17,375
First it's the farm that time forgot,
and now this.

845
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,629
Why don't I ever fall in
with people who own condos?

846
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,883
Guess it's hard to get
good maid service in a sewer.

847
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,427
Maybe you guys should try Roto-Rooter.

848
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,222
Would you quit complaining?
It's just for the night.

849
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:33,225
I still don't see
why we don't get started right away.

850
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,143
It's been a long drive, Raph.

851
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,230
And before we go out advertising
to The Foot that we're back...

852
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:41,066
...we could all use a few hours' sleep.
Yeah.

853
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,402
I know, you're right. I'm just...
What's that?

854
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,491
- Danny?
- Don't shoot.

855
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,244
- I don't think it's loaded, kid.
- Danny...

856
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,787
...what are you doing here?

857
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,248
- Where'd he come from?
- Beats me.

858
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,958
I ran away from home.

859
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,503
Oh, God,
your father's gonna have kittens.

860
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,588
- Does this thing work?
- No.

861
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,549
No, please don't call.

862
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,676
Just let me stay here the night with you.

863
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,594
We can call in the morning. I promise.

864
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,264
- Danny, listen, your dad, he's...
- Hold on, hold it.

865
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:17,060
Okay, now, what is all this talk
about spending the night down here?

866
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,354
You're a claustrophobic.

867
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,276
- Do you want a fist in the mouth?
- Mm-mm.

868
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,528
I've never even looked
at another guy before.

869
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:30,824
What he means is that
you're afraid of enclosed areas.

870
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,118
Afraid?

871
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:38,331
- What, me? Is that what you think?
- Mm-hm.

872
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:43,795
Ah. Hey, I don't have to take this stuff
about being afraid.

873
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,134
I'm gonna sleep in the truck.

874
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,686
Jeez, these are good.

875
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:00,979
Thanks.

876
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,981
Do you think maybe I could have one?

877
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,317
- Sure, why not?
- Thanks.

878
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,069
Oh, man, I could really go...

879
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,697
...for a little deep-dish action
right about now.

880
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,241
I had some pizza down here
the other day.

881
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,493
- There might be some left over.
- Mm? Mm? Uh-huh.

882
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,329
- Wa-ah. Wa-ah-aah!
- Ha-ha-ha.

883
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,499
- Well?
- Question.

884
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,503
- Yeah?
- Do you like penicillin on your pizza?

885
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,839
Oh! Ugh.

886
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,645
"Afraid of enclosed areas."

887
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,715
You are here...

888
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:14,386
...because the outside world rejects you.

889
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:17,097
And you have no one to go to, Danny?

890
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,974
This is your family.

891
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,811
All fathers care for their sons.

892
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,632
Nice shot, man.

893
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:37,093
I need a cigar.

894
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,596
Where is my cigar?

895
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,978
Hey.

896
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,647
Great how you did that, it rocks.

897
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:03,828
I have not seen you for days.

898
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:08,666
Yeah, I've been down at my hideout
a lot lately.

899
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:14,380
And do you now hide
from your surrogate family as well?

900
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,259
I don't know.

901
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,345
I too...

902
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,014
...once had a family, Danny.

903
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,184
Many years ago...

904
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,728
...I lived in Japan...

905
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,773
...a pet of my master, Yoshi...

906
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,776
...mimicking his movements
from my cage...

907
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:39,531
...and learning
the mysterious art of Ninjitsu...

908
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:44,536
...for Yoshi was one of Japars
finest shadow warriors.

909
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:50,375
His only rival was
a man named Oroku Saki...

910
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,670
...and they competed in all things...

911
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:59,634
...but none more fiercely
than for the love of a woman.

912
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,928
Tang Shen.

913
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,141
Shers love was only for my master...

914
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:09,352
...and rather than see him
fight Saki for her hand...

915
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,229
...she persuaded Yoshi...

916
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,065
...to flee with me to America...

917
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,734
...but Saki vowed vengeance.

918
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:19,070
I remember it well.

919
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,739
As my master returned home...

920
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:25,785
...to find his beloved Shen
lying on the floor.

921
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,538
And then he saw her killer.

922
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:32,250
Saki wasted no words,
and during the struggle...

923
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,751
...my cage was broken.

924
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:37,338
I leapt to Saki's face,
biting and clawing...

925
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,257
...but he threw me to the floor...

926
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:43,011
...and took one swipe with his katana,
slicing my ear.

927
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:48,766
Then he was gone and I was alone.

928
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:55,481
Whatever happened to this Oroku Saki?

929
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,651
No one really knows...

930
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:03,781
...but you wear his symbol
upon your brow.

931
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:37,148
What are you doing in there, boy?

932
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,816
Nothing.

933
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,453
Where have you been?

934
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,830
Nowhere.

935
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,166
You're lying to me.

936
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,795
- No.
- And you're hiding something as well.

937
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,421
Shaah!

938
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:27,865
They're back.

939
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,954
Master.

940
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,165
There will be no mistake this time.

941
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,042
I go myself.

942
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,128
And the rat...

943
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:42,380
...kill it.

944
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:44,841
Come on, men.

945
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,556
- Hey, what do you want?
- Shh, shh.

946
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,974
Recognize me now, kid?

947
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,727
- Hey, what's the deal?
- You got to come with me.

948
01:11:55,894 --> 01:12:00,148
- What are you talking about come with you?
- They're gonna kill Splinter.

949
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:49,072
Hee-hee-hee. No sweat.

950
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:54,118
Gosh, I do hope there's more of them.

951
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,874
- Huh?
- Ah.

952
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,085
Good.

953
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,470
Well, where are the keys?

954
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:18,142
Who are you?

955
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,685
Hey.

956
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,148
- Ahh.
- The name's Casey Jones.

957
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,944
A friend.

958
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,826
Let's get out of here.

959
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,096
A little to the right. A little to the left.

960
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,098
One more time.

961
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,350
A little bit more like that.

962
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,352
And stop. Perfect.

963
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,521
Aah!

964
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,315
- You're a natural, sis.
- Thanks.

965
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,151
Ha! Ha-ha! Ha!

966
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:20,329
Now, you know, a little Primatene
might just help to clear that up there.

967
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,625
That's gonna cost you, Tinker Bell.

968
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,213
I don't think that you're listening.

969
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:41,934
You know, I'm starting to pick up
on a little language barrier thing going here.

970
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:03,915
Fore.

971
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,719
I'll never call golf a dull game again.

972
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,018
Gangway.

973
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,782
Showoff.

974
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,702
What are we just standing here for?
Let's get him.

975
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:47,124
Do you want to be first, junior, huh?

976
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,960
We have a loyalty to The Shredder.

977
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:50,962
The Shredder uses you.

978
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,633
He poisons your minds
to obtain that which he desires.

979
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:02,557
He cares nothing for you
or the people you hurt.

980
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,226
We're a family.

981
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:10,398
Family? Is that what you said? Family?

982
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:14,443
You call this here...

983
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,779
...and that down there, family?

984
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:31,335
Casey.

985
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:56,485
Hey, dudes, where you going?

986
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:57,820
Hai!

987
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,991
Ha! Hey, Donnie, looks like this one's
suffering from shell shock. Ha!

988
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,784
Hmm. Too derivative.

989
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:08,164
Boy, I guess we can really shell it out.

990
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,207
Too clich

991
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:14,211
Well, it was a shell of a good hit.

992
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:17,256
I like it. Step up.

993
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:21,677
Awesome. Ha! Ha! Ha!

994
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,140
Hey, where do you think you're going?

995
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:31,896
- Hey.
- Hmm.

996
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,398
Hey, wait for me.

997
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,776
Whoop! Yaah!

998
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:40,112
God, I love being a turtle!

999
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,459
Ha-ha! Yee-ha!

1000
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,591
Oh!

1001
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:06,055
Come on, come on.

1002
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:27,785
Aw. No more?

1003
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:40,548
Nyah. Nyak-nyak.

1004
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,970
Does anybody have any idea
about who or what this is?

1005
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,430
I don't know...

1006
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:49,765
...but I'll bet it never has to look
for a can opener.

1007
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:56,147
You fight well in the old style...

1008
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:58,816
...but you've caused me enough trouble.

1009
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,111
Now you face...

1010
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,779
...The Shredder.

1011
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,741
- The Shredder? Heh.
- Uh...

1012
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,535
Maybe all that hardware's
for making coleslaw.

1013
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,662
I got him.

1014
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,795
- This guy's good.
- Yeah.

1015
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:22,173
- Why don't you go next?
- Thank you.

1016
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:29,513
Uh... Match you for it?

1017
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:32,808
One, two, three. Mm.

1018
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,685
- Damn.
- Great. Wah!

1019
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,856
Come on.

1020
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:48,073
So much for family, huh?

1021
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,495
Yeah, I'm just so hungry, you know.

1022
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,331
Now...

1023
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,708
...at exactly what point...

1024
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,960
...did we lose control here?

1025
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:04,048
Maybe somebody ought to tell him
that we're the good guys.

1026
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,508
- Yeah.
- Any thoughts?

1027
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:07,551
I've only got one thought.

1028
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,887
This guy knows where Splinter is.

1029
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,228
Looks like your boys
are going to need a little...

1030
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,439
Where did he go?

1031
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,544
Oh, boy.

1032
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:43,629
Leftovers.

1033
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,688
Yee-ha!

1034
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,117
It's a talent.

1035
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:31,552
Where's Splinter?

1036
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:36,223
- Ah. The rat, so it has a name.
- Huh?

1037
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,476
It had a name.

1038
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,314
You lie.

1039
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:47,318
Do I?

1040
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,160
He dies.

1041
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:59,830
- Huh?
- Weapons.

1042
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,127
- Now.
- Oh.

1043
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,887
Fools. Ha-ha.

1044
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:19,350
The three of you might have
overpowered me with the loss of but one.

1045
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:24,021
Now your fate will be his.

1046
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,606
No.

1047
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,108
Oh.

1048
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,069
Splinter.

1049
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:35,199
- Aah.
- Yes, Oroku Saki.

1050
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,368
I know who you are.

1051
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,372
We met many years ago...

1052
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:44,458
...in the home of my master...

1053
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,126
...Hamato Yoshi.

1054
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:54,551
It's him.

1055
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,806
You.

1056
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:04,853
Now I will finish
what I began with your ear.

1057
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:21,704
Death comes for us all, Oroku Saki...

1058
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:25,082
...but something much worse
comes for you.

1059
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,751
For when you die, it will be...

1060
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,596
- Without honor.

1061
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,141
Oops.

1062
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,403
- Splinter, are you okay?
- Oh, Splinter.

1063
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,156
Oh, Splinter, we were so worried.

1064
01:23:58,783 --> 01:23:59,783
Kids.

1065
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:10,335
- I can't wait...
- I was there. I saw the whole thing.

1066
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:13,255
- All right.
- Whatever.

1067
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:16,050
Okay, okay, move along here.

1068
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,975
You, you, come here.

1069
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:28,103
- Tell me when it's on.
- Hold the battery.

1070
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:30,564
All right, guys, let's get to it.

1071
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,483
Brian, it's over.

1072
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:35,652
- It's over.
- April.

1073
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,571
- April. April, here.
- Danny.

1074
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,239
- See you later.
- What's this for?

1075
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,866
It's something I owe you.

1076
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,035
- Trust me.
- Come on, let's move it back.

1077
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:44,953
You there, come here.

1078
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,791
Dad.

1079
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:50,375
Danny?

1080
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:53,504
Danny.

1081
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:55,422
God, where have you been?

1082
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,050
I've had the whole city looking for you.

1083
01:24:58,218 --> 01:24:59,760
Are you all right?

1084
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,720
- Are you okay, Danny?
- It's okay, Dad.

1085
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:04,681
I'm okay, really. I'm okay.

1086
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:06,558
And Dad?

1087
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:09,186
It's just Dan now, okay?

1088
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,023
Dan?

1089
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:16,235
Come on, folks.

1090
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:19,154
- Come on.
- What have you been up to?

1091
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:21,865
I want some stretchers in here.
Get some doctors.

1092
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,660
Don't move. Get those kids.
Don't let them get away.

1093
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:28,205
April, I told you
there were circumstances.

1094
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:31,208
I really need you to cover this.

1095
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:34,211
I don't know, Charles, you know...

1096
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,714
Did you know that May Williams
over at Channel 5 has her own office?

1097
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,133
You can have an office.

1098
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,218
Yeah, well,
she has her own corner office.

1099
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,053
- You can have a corner office.
- Well.

1100
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:46,223
She's one of the highest-paid
field reporters in New York City.

1101
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,559
Now you are.

1102
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,566
You are a tough negotiator, Charles.

1103
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:58,527
All right, I want some answers.

1104
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:03,323
Now, what in God's name
happened out here tonight?

1105
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,909
Somebody better talk to me.

1106
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:08,203
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1107
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:12,040
Go check out the East Warehouse
over at Lairdman Island.

1108
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,084
You'll get your answers there.

1109
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:17,254
How are you doing, lady?

1110
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,256
All right, let's go.

1111
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,012
I've been looking all over for you.

1112
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,598
Oh, Casey, hi.

1113
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:29,266
"Hi"?

1114
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,517
You...

1115
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:35,272
I look like
I just called Mike Tyson a sissy.

1116
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,815
Yeah?

1117
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,775
And all you say is hi?

1118
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,113
What?
You don't need an ambulance, do you?

1119
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:45,407
No, but I was...

1120
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:49,203
Will you just shut up and kiss me, okay?
I got a report to do.

1121
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:54,124
- I love it when you're pushy.
- Yeah?

1122
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:55,876
Yeah.

1123
01:26:57,253 --> 01:26:58,420
Whoo-hoo.

1124
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:01,298
Nine-point-nine-five.

1125
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,091
All right, April.

1126
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:05,719
All right, Casey.

1127
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,471
Yeah, that's the way to go.

1128
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,516
We were awesome.

1129
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:14,311
- Bodacious.
- Yeah.

1130
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,355
- Bitching.
- Yeah.

1131
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:18,565
Uh...

1132
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,359
- Gnarly.
