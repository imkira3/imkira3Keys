1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,125
The Inquisition has finally
delivered Spain to the Templars.

3
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,804
Sultan Muhammad and his people
still hold out in Granada.

4
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,771
But if his son, the Prince is captured...

5
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,045
he will surrender the city
and the Apple of Eden.

6
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,441
Do you Aguilar De Nerha

7
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,771
swear to honor our Order
in the fight for freedom?

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,963
To defend mankind against
the Templars' tyranny

9
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,249
and preserve free will?

10
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,920
I swear.

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,562
If the Apple falls into their hands

12
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,416
the Templars will destroy everything
that stands in their way.

13
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,523
Protest, dissent, our right
to think for ourselves...

14
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,806
Swear to me that you
will sacrifice your life

15
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:39,690
and the lives of everyone
here to keep it from them.

16
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,970
Yes, mentor.

17
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,967
Our own lives are nothing.

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,322
The Apple is everything.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,288
The spirit of the eagle,
will watch over the future.

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,400
Where other men blindly follow the truth

21
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,119
remember...

22
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,043
Nothing is true.

23
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,206
Where other men are limited
by morality or law

24
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,039
remember...

25
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,690
Everything is permitted.

26
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,002
We work in the dark to serve the light.

27
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,484
We are Assassins.

Dad?

47

Your blood
is not your own, Cal.

48
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,243
They found us.

49
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,210
Live in the shadows.

50
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,724
Go! Go, now!

51
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,163
You here
to save my soul?

52
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,084
Something like that.

53
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,970
I understand
it's your birthday.

54
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
Yeah.

55
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,923
The party's
just getting started.

56
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,045
Sit down.
You're making me nervous.

57
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,362
"Oh, Lord,
wash away my sin...

58
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,130
"and I'll be clean...

59
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,370
"once again."

60
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,531
You're not much
for the Bible, are you?

61
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
Be it known
that Callum Lynch...

62
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,724
has been found guilty
of capital murder...

63
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,804
and is sentenced to die
on this day...

64
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,645
October 21st, 2016.

65
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,849
Does the prisoner wish to
make a final statement?

66
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,321
Tell my father
I'll see him in hell.

67
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,646
My name is
Dr. Sofia Rikkin.

68
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,047
At 6:00 p.m.
yesterday evening...

69
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,807
you were executed
and pronounced dead.

70
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,203
Insofar as anyone in the
world knows or cares...

71
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,687
you no longer exist.

72
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,280
It's better
that you sit.

73
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,566
My eyes.

74
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,441
What you're feeling right now
is normal, if uncomfortable.

75
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,370
Cal...

76
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,883
I'm here to help you.

77
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,281
And you're here
to help me.

78
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,091
Let him go.

79
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,401
Don't touch him.

80
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,321
Go ahead, do it.

81
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,485
Jump.

82
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,922
You're not
a prisoner here, Cal.

83
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,490
I'm here to protect you.

84
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,846
If you listen to me,

85
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,649
everything is going
to make sense.

86
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,689
But you need
to trust me.

87
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,845
Where am I?

88
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,968
You're in
a rehabilitation wing

89
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,520
of the Abstergo Foundation
in Madrid.

90
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,489
A private organization

91
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,881
dedicated to the
perfection of humankind.

92
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,966
With your help...

93
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,203
we can pioneer new ways
to eradicate violence.

94
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,729
I had this.

95
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,450
Your father
wants him in.

96
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,883
He's my patient.
This is my program.

97
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,049
Prepare the Animus.

98
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,729
- Are the blades prepared?
- Right here.

99
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,256
And we've confirmed
their provenance?

100
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,640
They belonged to Aguilar,
recovered at his burial site.

101
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,121
What are these?

102
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,724
Assume
final preparations.

103
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,001
Our regression...

104
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,562
<i>Andalucía,</i> 1492.
Record everything.

105
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,805
Arm's ready.

106
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,321
What is this?

107
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,486
I'm sorry, Cal. This is not
the way I like to do things.

108
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,880
Then don't do it.

109
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,810
Insert epidural.

110
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,004
What do you want from me?

111
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,605
Your past.

112
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,125
Listen to me
carefully, Cal.

113
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,169
You're about to
enter the Animus.

114
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,801
What you're about to see,
hear and feel...

115
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,609
are the memories of someone
who's been dead for 500 years.

116
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,966
Wait a minute!

117
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,927
You can't change
what happens, Cal.

118
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,483
Engage scanner.

119
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,366
Status?

120
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,206
Scanning DNA chains.

121
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,850
Searching for time frame.

122
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,124
First memory match locked.

123
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,044
DNA match identified.

124
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,324
Stay with it, Cal.

125
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,043
Attempt synchronization.

126
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,201
We found him.

127
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,761
We found Aguilar.

128
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,843
Synchronization achieved.

129
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,481
There.

130
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,851
Commence regression.

131
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,004
Our mission is the boy.

132
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,124
It's the Prince.

133
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,889
Which household harbored the boy?

134
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,000
I alone.

135
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,926
Nobody else knew he was there.

136
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,010
Hang his family and make him watch.

137
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,845
Burn the whole village.

138
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,365
With the Prince of Granada as captive

139
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,965
his father the Sultan will
surrender his rebellious city

140
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,522
the last safe haven for the infidels.

141
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,605
God will punish his people's heresy.

142
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,731
Finally Spain will be
under one Templar rule.

143
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,321
Stay with the memory, Cal.

144
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,886
Aguilar!... The boy, Aguilar... The boy

145
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,405
Aguilar! The child!

146
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,931
Pull him!

147
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,842
Commence rehabilitation.

148
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,207
Run a systems check
and log his condition.

149
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,685
You did well, Cal.

150
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,616
Looking back, it's clear

151
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,926
that the history
of the world...

152
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,526
is a history of violence.

153
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,569
Last year, the economic impact
of antisocial behavior...

154
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,208
was $9 trillion.

155
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,530
We believe that man
today experiences...

156
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,920
a measure of aggression...

157
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,051
for which he finds
no acceptable outlets.

158
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,851
Now imagine...

159
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,408
if all these costs could be
channeled elsewhere...

160
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,403
So the regression went well?

161
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,122
Lynch is the one.

162
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,760
A direct descendant
of Aguilar.

163
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,367
Everything was clear in
there for the first time.

164
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,210
...what we all
dream of...

165
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,449
a more peaceful world.

166
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,807
I see you stole
my lines again.

167
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,803
I only steal
from the best.

168
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,209
And the Artifact?

169
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,441
The Apple.

170
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,971
It's within our grasp.

171
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,441
What happened in there?
Why did you pull him?

172
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,641
I had to.

173
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,121
We have
to keep him healthy.

174
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,442
Earn his confidence.

175
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,284
And I know
he'll lead us to it.

176
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,481
Push him.

177
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,806
That's not
how the Animus works.

178
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,161
Here you go.

179
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,090
Thank you.

180
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,162
1917, Rutherford
splits the atom.

181
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,481
1953, Watson and Crick
find the double helix.

182
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,084
2016...

183
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,841
my daughter finds the
cure for violence.

184
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,002
You've always been
brighter than me.

185
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,649
Now I'm late.

186
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,202
I have to report
to the Elders.

187
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,168
Francisco Rizi's
Grand Inquisition...

188
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,927
1492.

189
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,889
War,
religious persecution...

190
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,883
and the closest
Father Torquemada,

191
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,001
or any of our Order...

192
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,810
came to finding
the Apple of Eden.

193
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,041
How are you, my friend?

194
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,481
Well...

195
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,330
Your Excellency.

196
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,402
Next week
when the Elders meet...

197
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,723
we shall vote to discontinue
your Abstergo project.

198
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,651
We feel that giving you
three billion annually

199
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,529
would be better spent
elsewhere.

200
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,570
Three billion is
nothing compared to...

201
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,250
We've won.

202
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,928
People no longer care about
their civil liberties.

203
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,606
They care about their
standard of life.

204
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,963
The modern world has outgrown
notions like freedom.

205
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,401
They're content
to follow.

206
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,483
The threat remains...

207
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,040
while free will exists.

208
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,443
For centuries,
we've tried,

209
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,656
with religion,
with politics...

210
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,091
and now consumerism...

211
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,248
to eliminate dissent.

212
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,445
Isn't it time
we gave science a try?

213
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,126
My daughter is closer
than we've ever been.

214
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,442
How is your
beautiful daughter?

215
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,283
She has traced the
protectors of the Apple.

216
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,804
Where?

217
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,409
<i>Andalusía,</i> 1492.

218
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,961
The descendants?

219
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,122
All the bloodlines
have died out.

220
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,050
Bar one.

221
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,646
We've traced his back
500 years...

222
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,928
to the Assassin's Brotherhood.

223
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,363
The hallucinations are what
we call the Bleeding Effect.

224
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,011
Images of
your regression...

225
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,881
layer themselves over your
present-day field of vision.

226
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,890
If you allow me...

227
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,485
I can teach you
how to control them.

228
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,730
Stand down.
I have this.

229
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,724
Let her be.

230
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,521
What is it?
The machine?

231
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,489
It's genetic memory.

232
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,323
By using the Animus...

233
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,166
we can relive lives of those
who made us who we are.

234
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,245
What I saw in there...

235
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,930
it felt real.

236
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,445
It was.

237
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,521
In a way.

238
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,444
Don't mess with me.

239
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,091
I feel different now.

240
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,131
Why the aggression?

241
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,089
I'm an
aggressive person.

242
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,964
What kind of prison
is this?

243
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,522
It's not a prison, Cal.

244
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,445
You'll learn more
if you cooperate.

245
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,564
Let me go.

246
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,731
I'm hungry.

247
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,645
Come with me.

248
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,845
What is this?

249
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,280
I know everything
about you, Cal.

250
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,850
Your medical data,
your psychological profile...

251
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,686
the mutations
in your MAOA gene.

252
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,003
I know about the foster
homes, the juvenile halls.

253
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,849
You're living proof
of the link

254
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,126
between heredity and crime.

255
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,607
How did you find me?

256
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,571
We found Aguilar.

257
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,611
And when you were arrested,
your DNA matched his.

258
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,081
Who's Aguilar?

259
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,841
Your ancestor.

260
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,929
His family
were Assassins.

261
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,049
They were burned at the stake
by the Templars, Torquemada...

262
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,282
and the black knight
you saw, Ojeda.

263
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,045
Aguilar took up
the Assassins' cause.

264
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,561
Do you get out much?

265
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,880
More than you.

266
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,484
And the others in here...

267
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,881
are they lab rats too?

268
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,521
They're Assassins.

269
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,882
Murderers,
like their ancestors.

270
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,481
Like you, Cal.

271
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,368
All born with a
predisposition to violence.

272
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,241
Murderer?

273
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,647
You killed a man.

274
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,246
A pimp.

275
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,924
Would you kill again?

276
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,611
Happy families.

277
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,930
She must be very proud.

278
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,445
I wouldn't know.

279
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,602
She was killed
by an Assassin.

280
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,451
Like your mother.

281
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,041
Sorry.

282
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,681
My old man killed my mother.

283
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,885
And how does
that make you feel?

284
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,451
Like killing him.

285
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,044
Either we let it affect us
for the rest of our lives...

286
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,441
or we do something
about it.

287
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,960
You turned to violence...

288
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,244
I turned to science.

289
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,842
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.

290
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,646
I believe it exists.

291
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,811
The Bible tells us
it contained

292
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,042
the seed of man's
first disobedience.

293
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,040
But there are those of us
who believe...

294
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,209
that God, or some
ancient civilization...

295
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,527
has left us a road map
to understand

296
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,005
why people
are violent.

297
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,046
Aguilar was the last person

298
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,600
known to have had it
in his possession.

299
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,011
We need you to find out
where he hid it.

300
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,684
I thought I was
here to be cured.

301
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,010
Violence is a disease,
like cancer.

302
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,561
And, like cancer...

303
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,484
we hope to control it
one day.

304
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,601
Violence is
what kept me alive.

305
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,082
Well, technically,
you're dead.

306
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,327
I'm hungry.

307
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,441
What's in it
for me?

308
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,896
Once my research
is complete...

309
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,002
there is no reason
to keep you here.

310
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,410
I get my life back?

311
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,121
Better.

312
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,165
A new one.

313
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,246
You're hungry.

314
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,851
You don't know
who he is, what he is.

315
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,604
That's a dangerous man.

316
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,330
Give him a little
more time, Emir.

317
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,050
The man might prove to have
some noble blood in him yet.

318
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,090
How about here, sir?

319
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,730
It's an open menu, but we
do recommend the chicken.

320
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,330
What can I
get you, Mr. Lynch?

321
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,402
It's an open menu, but we
do recommend the chicken.

322
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,810
I'll have steak.

323
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,291
Steak for the pioneer.

324
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,526
Who are you?

325
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,209
They call me Moussa.

326
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,489
But my name is Baptiste.

327
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,726
I'm dead 200 years now.

328
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,010
Voodoo poisoner.

329
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,811
I'm harmless.

330
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,689
Ah. They're watching you.

331
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,046
Waitin' to see
who you are, pioneer.

332
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,484
Have you met him yet?

333
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,003
Have you met him yet?

334
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,564
We are the last to protect
the Apple, my friend.

335
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,883
Make the wrong choice...

336
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,811
you gonna send us all
to infinity.

337
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,161
This...

338
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,487
belongs to you.

339
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,206
Progress requires sacrifice.

340
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,688
You're gonna lead them
right to it.

341
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,890
No. I'm going to eat it.

342
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,408
In quality, find peace.

343
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,570
What the fuck
is going on?

344
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,847
He has to go back
in the Animus.

345
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,966
Now.

346
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,360
He needs more time
before he goes in again.

347
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,131
We don't have time.

348
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,927
Why?

349
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,764
I won't risk his life.

350
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,568
Then I'll have to find
someone else to do it.

351
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,286
You're up, slugger.

352
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,611
I'm crazy.

353
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,166
<i>♪ I'm crazy ♪</i>

354
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,370
<i>♪ Crazy for
feeling so lonely ♪</i>

355
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,285
They're getting him
back in again.

356
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,724
Then we should stop him
before he betrays us.

357
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,281
Set the date for the 6th.

358
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,376
<i>♪ Why do I let myself... ♪</i>

359
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,970
If his condition
deteriorates,

360
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,087
pull him out.
<i>♪ ...worry? ♪</i>

361
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Your father...

362
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,520
I don't care
what my father said.

363
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,487
<i>♪ What in the world
did I do? ♪</i>

364
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,244
Cal, listen to me.

365
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,527
Listen to me!

366
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,601
<i>♪ Crazy for crying ♪</i>

367
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,776
You have
to stay with Aguilar.

368
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,290
<i>♪ Crazy for crying ♪</i>

369
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,568
Stay in sync with him
or it could be dangerous.

370
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,726
<i>♪ And I'm crazy
for loving you ♪</i>

371
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,527
Soon they will march on Granada.

372
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,647
Sultan Muhammad is weak.

373
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:08,650
He'll surrender the Apple and betray
the Creed for the Prince's life.

374
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,923
Love makes us weak.

375
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:26,169
I would gladly sacrifice my flesh and
my blood so that the Creed lives on.

376
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,531
When I die today don't waste your tears.

377
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,691
The Lord spake

378
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,887
and he said

379
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,161
if a man abide not in me

380
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,482
he is cast into the fire

381
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,004
and he is burned.

382
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,488
For decades

383
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,731
you have lived in a land torn apart

384
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,721
by religious discord.

385
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,681
But soon

386
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,528
thanks to God and the Inquisition

387
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,086
we will purge this disease!

388
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,691
The sinners before you

389
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,729
sought to defend the
heretic Prince of Granada

390
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:39,404
the last heathen stronghold
in our holy war.

391
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:47,091
And so today before our King and Queen

392
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,239
I swear that we shall wash ourselves clean

393
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,447
in the holy fire of God!

394
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,328
Behold God's will!

395
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,485
You will watch your mentor burn

396
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,489
and then you will die the slowest.

397
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,844
Not to ourselves but to the future

398
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,729
give glory.

399
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,726
He's synchronizing.

400
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,171
Damned heretics

401
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,846
don't let them escape!

402
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,487
Go!

403
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,561
Ha!

404
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,367
Jump!

405
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,161
Complete desynch.

406
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,086
Get him down!

407
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,284
Where are the medics?

408
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,161
It's okay.
It's okay, Cal.

409
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,209
Stay with me, Cal.

410
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,725
Stay with me.
It's okay. Hurry up!

411
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,651
Okay. Okay. Look at me.

412
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,720
It's okay, look at me.

413
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,764
I can't feel my legs.

414
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,125
The paralysis is temporary.

415
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,685
What's the bad news?

416
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,680
It caused
a neurological split,

417
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,125
but we got you through it.

418
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,286
This time.

419
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,005
I'm gonna die in here,
aren't I?

420
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,361
No.

421
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,002
Not if you go in there
of your own free will.

422
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,524
I can't do this.

423
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,681
Yes, you can.

424
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,681
The Apple...

425
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,241
you're the only one left
who can find it.

426
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,888
We can put an end
to pain, Cal.

427
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,210
For everyone.

428
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,401
Where'd you get this?

429
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,560
My father
recovered it...

430
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,120
from the scene
of your mother's murder.

431
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,210
And brought it here
for safekeeping.

432
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,249
Safekeeping?

433
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,250
You stole it.

434
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,680
It's your mother's necklace.
I wanted you to have it.

435
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,931
Why was he there?

436
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,040
To save her.

437
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,730
From who?
Her own people.

438
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,968
What's it got to do
with you?

439
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,131
Assassins and Templars

440
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,720
have been at war
for centuries.

441
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,609
I aim to change that.

442
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,842
That's right, I forgot.

443
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,411
We're here
to combat aggression.

444
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,404
I don't think
I like your methods.

445
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,801
I'm a scientist.

446
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,525
I'm here to be
cured of violence.

447
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,611
Who's gonna cure you?

448
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,804
We're feeding the beast.

449
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,169
We're making him stronger.

450
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,165
I'm Dr. Rikkin.

451
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,006
Alan.

452
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,650
I look after things here
in Abstergo.

453
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,008
Like to keep things
in the family, huh?

454
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,681
Yes.

455
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,921
I'm sorry if we've caused
you any discomfort.

456
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,566
Is there anything I can do?

457
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,086
How about you let me
out of here?

458
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,210
That's something
I can't manage.

459
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,884
I'm here to make a deal.

460
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,006
We need the Apple.

461
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,289
And we need you
to get it for us.

462
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,847
You've been desynching
in the Animus.

463
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,731
We need you
not to do that.

464
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,244
Sending me
back to the machine?

465
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,121
No.

466
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,568
You've already shown us
what we needed to see.

467
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,564
Will you
let us free then?

468
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,401
What do you hope to gain
from the newcomer?

469
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,680
Something that'll
benefit us all.

470
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,570
You too, Moussa.

471
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,920
What have you
done to them?

472
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,896
It's what happens...

473
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,729
if you don't enter
a regression

474
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,650
of your own volition.

475
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,721
Do you recognize this?

476
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,449
It's an Assassin's blade.

477
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,082
This is the actual one...

478
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,851
that your father used to
take your mother's life.

479
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,650
He's here, you know.

480
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,122
A mother's death,
Cal...

481
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,090
Not something a boy should
ever be made to see.

482
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,926
This is wrong.

483
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,250
You left me
no choice.

484
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,171
He has to go in of his own
free will, you said that.

485
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,885
I had to negotiate.

486
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,724
You mean manipulate.

487
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,889
I assured the Elders we would
have the Apple for London.

488
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,206
That's in two days.

489
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,528
He doesn't want to know
his past or his father.

490
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,921
He wants
to destroy them both.

491
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,889
We're not in the business
of creating monsters.

492
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,085
We've neither created them
nor destroyed them.

493
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,965
We've merely abandoned them
to their own inexorable fate.

494
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,731
You're your
mother's son.

495
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,125
What does that mean?

496
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,121
The blood that flows through
you is not your own.

497
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,444
It belongs to the Creed.

498
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,687
Your mother knew that.

499
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,369
She died
so the Creed may live.

500
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,086
Remind me how, exactly.

501
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,961
What you saw...

502
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,841
I did.

503
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,121
You murdered her.

504
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,456
I took her life rather
than have it stolen

505
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,527
by that machine.

506
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,325
A man grows with the
greatness of his task.

507
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,845
I ought to have
killed you.

508
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,207
I couldn't.

509
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,646
Well, here.

510
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,487
Take it.

511
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,288
Do what you couldn't do
30 years ago.

512
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,802
It's in
your hands now, Cal.

513
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,921
This is what they want.

514
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,126
Spill my blood...

515
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,168
but do not go back
into the Animus.

516
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,047
Why?

517
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,721
The Apple...

518
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,567
contains the genetic code
for free will.

519
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,563
They will use it
to destroy us.

520
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,245
I'm gonna find it...

521
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,965
and watch them
destroy you...

522
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,811
and your Creed.

523
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,882
You cannot
kill the Creed.

524
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,011
It's in your blood.

525
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,610
The Apple is everything.

526
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,848
Your mother died
to protect it.

527
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,769
She had no choice.

528
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,161
I do.

529
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,724
You're gonna
kill the Creed!

530
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,801
Take me to the Animus.

531
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,246
Put me in.

532
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,770
Prepare the Animus.

533
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,291
Voluntary regression.

534
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,491
Do you know how Assassins
came to be named?

535
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,766
From an Arabic word.

536
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,040
<i>"Hashashin."</i>

537
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,488
They were
society's outcasts...

538
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,563
those who stole...

539
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,404
who murdered
in cold blood.

540
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,650
People ridiculed them.

541
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,804
Rebels, fools,
drug addicts.

542
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,571
But they were wise.

543
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,045
They used this reputation...

544
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,362
to hide a dedication
to principles...

545
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,883
beyond those of even
their strongest enemies.

546
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,565
And for that...

547
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,203
I admire them.

548
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,409
But you're not
one of those men...

549
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,046
are you?

550
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,966
Let's find out.

551
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,366
Commencing regression.

552
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,249
This is my life's work.

553
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,691
It's my life.

554
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,767
For the Creed.

555
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,365
Our own lives are nothing.

556
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,888
All that matters is what we leave behind.

557
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,771
Sultan...

558
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,682
Surrender the Apple.

559
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,288
Your Assassin protectors are gone.

560
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,850
The Creed is finished.

561
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,491
My son.

562
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,966
Here lies the seed of
man's first disobedience

563
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,887
of free will itself.

564
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,691
Thanks to the Apple of Eden

565
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,730
the known world

566
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,805
will be ushered into a new age

567
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,324
one of peace

568
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,682
in which all the warring
populations of mankind

569
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,050
shall bow in perfect obedience

570
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,806
to our one Templar rule.

571
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,919
The Apple.

572
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,729
Give it to him

573
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,801
now

574
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,850
For the Creed.

575
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,360
Go

576
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,925
Forgive me.

577
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,728
It's over.

578
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,642
Leap of Faith.

579
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,601
Where are we?

580
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,682
It looks like
a military port.

581
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,248
Cádiz, Palos de la Frontera.

582
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,808
Assassins have died for this

583
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,404
protect it with your life.

584
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,640
I am a friend of the Creed.

585
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,247
Take it to your grave.

586
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,321
I swear.

587
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,042
What is it? Translation?

588
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,485
"Following the light
of the sun,

589
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,128
"I shall leave
this old world behind."

590
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,967
It's Christopher Columbus.

591
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,605
Where is he buried?

592
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,523
His remains
were returned to Spain.

593
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,123
His tomb
is in Seville Cathedral.

594
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,730
We found it.

595
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,648
Hey, All Stars.
Come here.

596
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,126
Pick one.

597
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,766
Any one.

598
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,161
Breach in the common room!

599
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,407
Seal the Animus.

600
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,561
Is it a memory?

601
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,321
No.

602
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,921
Come on!

603
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,601
Transport?

604
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,125
Standing by.

605
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,649
Protect the Animus.
Purge the facility.

606
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,729
I need to get you
out of here first.

607
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,281
No!

608
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,043
We have to leave, Sofia.

609
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,481
No!

610
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,601
No!

611
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,884
You're not alone, Cal.

612
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,211
You never were.

613
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,404
Wake and bake, my protector.
Come on.

614
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,920
Where other men...

615
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,764
blindly follow the truth...

616
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,567
remember...

617
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,764
Nothing is true.

618
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,081
Where other men
are limited...

619
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,049
by their morality or law...

620
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,721
remember...

621
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,967
Everything is permitted.

622
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,683
We work in the darkness
to serve the light.

623
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,003
We are Assassins.

624
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,768
What now, pioneer?

625
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,721
We fight.

626
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,891
Your Excellency.

627
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,440
All the glory
will go to your father.

628
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,361
But we both know
who found it.

629
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,723
Your time
will come, my child.

630
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,090
They'll give you
a Nobel Peace Prize for this.

631
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,208
Better start
writing your speech.

632
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:15,965
I've read yours.

633
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,921
And?

634
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:25,247
"If we eradicate free will,
we eradicate the Assassins...

635
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,131
"the cancer that has menaced
society for centuries."

636
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,928
It's not my best work...

637
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,484
but it gets
the point across.

638
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,326
We've been
looking for solutions.

639
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,481
You've eliminated
the problem.

640
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,164
So my program...

641
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,164
Has brought order to society
for the first time.

642
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,209
I'm accountable for this.

643
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,009
You've already been
accounted for.

644
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,162
Our work belongs
to the Elders.

645
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,084
This is their
finest hour.

646
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,604
You lied to me.

647
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,525
I've always known
that in your heart...

648
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,287
you were a scientist first
and a Templar second.

649
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,844
Your recent work
has impressed us much...

650
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,844
but it has confirmed
our belief that mankind...

651
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,169
cannot be redeemed.

652
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:35,448
So you've
thought of everything.

653
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,008
Not quite. My speech...

654
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,369
it could do with one of
your elegant openings.

655
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,848
"Now I am become death...

656
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,281
"the destroyer of worlds."

657
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,042
Not sure I could
make that work.

658
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,369
It is with
great pleasure tonight...

659
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,809
that I introduce the architect
of our ancient Order's future.

660
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:24,405
Please welcome the CEO
of the Abstergo Foundation...

661
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,244
Dr. Alan Rikkin.

662
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,401
With the recovery
of the Apple...

663
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,608
we are now in possession of...

664
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:51,448
a complete genetic roadmap
to humanity's instincts.

665
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,766
Any impulse towards
independence...

666
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,962
Resistance or rebellion...

667
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,690
will be crushed.

668
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,046
Any predisposition
that might oppose

669
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,531
our march of progress...

670
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,363
can now be eradicated.

671
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,889
All I have to do
is shout.

672
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,289
I'm here to help you.

673
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,807
And you're here
to help me.

674
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,328
I can't help you anymore.

675
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,806
What about
all those great plans?

676
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,164
Cure violence.

677
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,243
Combat aggression.

678
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,728
That's not
going to happen.

679
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:49,921
You started this, Sophie.

680
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,288
You don't get
to walk away.

681
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,526
We both know
what happens next.

682
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,967
Not everything
deserves to live.

683
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,125
I can't do this.

684
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,125
Yes, you can.

685
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:33,090
But it is not to ourselves,
but to the future...

686
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,003
that we must give glory.

687
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:39,404
A future purged
of the Assassin's Creed.

688
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,405
Ladies and gentlemen...

689
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,449
the Apple of Eden.

690
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,444
I did this.

691
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,210
I will retrieve the
Artifact for the Elders.

692
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,521
Lynch, I want for me.

693
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,765
It is not to ourselves,

694
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:09,571
but to the future,
that we must give glory.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
