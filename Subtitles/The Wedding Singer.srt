All right, everybody, come on.

3
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:25,855
Out on the dance floor.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,687
Oh ho ho! Look at the happy couple.

5
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:30,022
No exceptions.

6
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:31,493
Up out of your chairs.

7
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,587
Whoo!

8
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:36,286
Yeah!

9
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:41,059
Oh, I can feel all the happiness in here.

10
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:44,097
All right!

11
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:48,335
Man, look at him go.

12
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:50,344
Go! Go!

13
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,845
# If I #

14
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:56,647
# I get to know your name #

15
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:00,083
# If I #

16
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:05,490
# Could trace your private number, baby #

17
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:07,686
# All I know is that to me #

18
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,354
# You look like you're lots of fun #

19
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:11,363
# Open up them lovin' arms #

20
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:15,128
# I want some, want some #

21
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:17,727
# I set my sights on you #

22
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,533
# And no one else will do #

23
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:22,199
# And I #

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,075
# I got to have my way now, baby #

25
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,444
# All I know is that to me #

26
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:32,278
# You look like you're lots of fun #

27
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:33,976
# Open up them lovin' arms #

28
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:36,451
# Watch out, here I come #

29
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:40,217
# You spin me right round, baby, right round #

30
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:41,745
# Like a record, baby #

31
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,088
# Right round, round, round #

32
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:47,857
# You spin me right round, baby, right round #

33
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:49,295
# Like a record, baby #

34
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:51,925
# Right round, round, round #

35
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:54,434
Hey, somebody get some pants on that kid.

36
00:01:56,805 --> 00:01:58,328
Whoo-hoo!

37
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:01,000
# And I #

38
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:03,100
# I got to be your friend #

39
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:06,112
Grandma Molly, I'm talking to you.

40
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:08,614
# And I #

41
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:14,086
# Would like to move in just a little bit closer #

42
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,951
# All I know is that to me #

43
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,853
# You look like you're lots of fun #

44
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:19,858

00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:33,435
# You spin me right round, baby, right round #

50
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,529

51
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:42,876
# I want your lo-o-o-o-o-ove #

52
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,313
# I want your love #

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,409
# O-o-o-o-o-ove #

54
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:50,748
Uncle Morty!

55
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:51,774
Yeah!

56
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:54,015
# All I know is that to me #

57
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:55,852
# You look like you're lots of fun #

58
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,586
# Open up your lovin' arms #

59
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,991
# Watch out, here I come #

60
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:03,929
# You spin me right round, baby, right round #

61
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:05,329

00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:07,766
# Right round, round, round #

63
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:11,463
# You spin me right round, baby, right round #

64
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:12,994
# Like a record, baby #

65
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,666
# Right round, round, round #

66
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:19,076
# You spin me round and round #

67
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:21,409
# And rounddddd #

68
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:23,038
Very nice.

69
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:24,946
Yeah.

70
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,644
Good job, lady. You were shakin'.

71
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,242
Whoo!

72
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,811
It is gonna be fun today.

73
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:33,761
Now the best man's gonna come up here and say a few words...

74
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,961
so let's put our hands together for the groom's brother David.

75
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,599
Whoo!

76
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,069
All right, Dave.

77
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,696
Oof!

78
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,499
Whoa!

79
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,133
Um...

80
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,673
when my brother Harold...

81
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:56,616
asked me to be the best man at his wedding, I was like, "Whoa.

82
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,915
"Of course, man...

83
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,682
"'cause you've always been there for me."

84
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,313
- Aww. - That's right.

85
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:06,315
Like when I was in rehab...

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,953
and like the time I couldn't find my car.

87
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:10,155
Ha ha!

88
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:13,860
'Cause Harold, you know, he's always been the dependable one.

89
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,457
I've always...

90
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,492
been the screwed-up one. Right, Dad?

91
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,265
Ha ha.

92
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:22,741
"Why can't you be more like your brother?

93
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:25,641
"Harold would never beat up his landlord."

94
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,680
He's drunk as shit.

95
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:31,648
Whoops.

96
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:35,045
But, uh...

97
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:37,485
a little news flash, Pop. Ha.

98
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:38,852
Harold ain't so perfect.

99
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,292
Remember that time in Puerto Rico...

100
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:45,192
when we picked up those two, uh...

101
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,856
well, I guess they were prostitutes, but I don't remember paying.

102
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,524
OK, how 'bout that?

103
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:50,998
How 'bout that? Yeah. How 'bout it?

104
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:52,021
Terrific.

105
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:55,161
I'm a person, too, Pop, god damn it! I'm a person, too!

106
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:56,568
You're a moron!

107
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:58,368
Ooh.

108
00:04:58,407 --> 00:04:59,930
OK.

109
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,203
The best man, everybody.

110
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:03,267
Best man. The better man.

111
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,800
Ooh!

112
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,804
Uh... hey...

113
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,373
we've all done crazy things in our life, so...

114
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:15,383
He's playing the guitar now. Isn't that great?

115
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:18,254
- Ha ha ha. You're doing good. - Yeah? Sounds good?

116
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,316
It's because I'm the best guitar player in the world.

117
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,849
Yeah. Self-taught.

118
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:24,692
No lessons, thank you very much, Pop.

119
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:25,856
All right.

120
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,389
They'll be divorced in a year.

121
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:29,923
Very good.

122
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,960
I think, uh, we all know that when you fall in love...

123
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:36,030
the emptiness kind of drifts away.

124
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:37,836
That's all I'm talking about.

125
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:40,867
I've, uh, done some crazy things in my life, too...

126
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:43,744
but then I met a very special girl...

127
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,680
a girl who I'm actually marrying next week.

128
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,508
Thank you, thank you.

129
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:52,647
So all I'm saying is that when you fall in love, like you guys...

130
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:55,919
the emptiness drifts away because you find something to live for:

131
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,118
Each other.

132
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,890
And the way I've seen you two looking into each other's eyes all day long...

133
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,829
I can tell that you're gonna live for each other...

134
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,024
for the rest of your lives.

135
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,090
- Aww! - Yeah.

136
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:07,123
So cheers.

137
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:08,567
- Cheers. - Cheers.

138
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,092
Yeah.

139
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:11,900
Whoo.

140
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,032
That's a good wedding singer.

141
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,873
OK, well, now on behalf of Mr. And Mrs. Harold Veltri...

142
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,041
you guys have a nice dinner.

143
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,313
George Stitzer here's gonna take over on lead vocals...

144
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,750
so take it away, George.

145
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:40,028
# Give me time #

146
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:46,469
# To realize my crime #

147
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:53,575
# Let me love and stay #

148
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,578
- Ugh. - Jesus.

149
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:57,169
Scary.

150
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:05,082
# I have danced #

151
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:08,680
Ooh, I like her.

152
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:12,284
# Inside your eyes #

153
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:17,286
# How can love #

154
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:21,289
# Be real? #

155
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:26,268
# Do you really want to hurt me... #

156
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:29,331
Good save, wedding singer.

157
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,603
Good job.

158
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:33,868
Hey, Sammy, how come you're not out with your limo? What's up?

159
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,606
That new waitress. That's what's up.

160
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:38,343
Is she in trouble. She's gonna get it...

161
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,181
and she doesn't even know it, and I'm gonna give it to her.

162
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,813
Ha. Take it easy, man. Who is she?

163
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:45,321
She's Holly Sullivan's cousin.

164
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:46,947
If she's half as easy as Holly...

165
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:48,719
I'll close this deal by the end of the week.

166
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,989
Oh! Ohh.

167
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,791
Mmm, I don't think that's gonna happen.

168
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:55,160
Oh, please. It's her first day.

169
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:56,687
Always takes them at least three weeks...

170
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,563
to realize they shouldn't date anyone at work.

171
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:00,432
For some reason, you like being the guy...

172
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,959
that helps them realize that, don't you?

173
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:03,527
Yes, I do.

174
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:05,630
You want to be like Fonzie, don't you?

175
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:07,198
Yes, I do.

176
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,972
You're on your way.

177
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:14,778
# Do you really want to hurt me? #

178
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:18,148
# Do you really want to make me cry? #

179
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,654
I like old Coke better than New Coke...

180
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,918
because it's old, and so am I.

181
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:24,889
# Don't turn around, oh-oh-oh #

182
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,551
Yes!

183
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,355
# Der Kommissar's in town #

184
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:29,759
Prime rib, please.

185
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:31,855
More prime rib. Always the prime rib.

186
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:33,091
Make them eat the fish.

187
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:35,122
Andre, can I have three prime rib?

188
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:37,567
Your wish is my command, madame.

189
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:41,863
How come he's so nice to you?

190
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:44,704
I let him look at my boobs at the Christmas party last year.

191
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:47,108
Not my finest half-hour...

192
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:50,204
but it's been a pleasant working environment ever since.

193
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:52,539
No.

194
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:57,347
So, how's your first night going, cuz?

195
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:59,685
It's just that being at this wedding...

196
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,691
is making me realize that Glenn is never going to set a date...

197
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,420
and I've been wearing this ring for two years...

198
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,950
and I feel like an idiot.

199
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:09,395
Hey, you know what you must do?

200
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:10,761
Relax.

201
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,390
Go to it.

202
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:13,627
Huh?

203
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:16,398
# Ja! Ja! Ja! #

204
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:19,531
I just feel stupid for moving here to be closer to him.

205
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:22,303
OK, I think you need a break. Go out back and get some air.

206
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:23,366
I'll cover your tables.

207
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:27,279
- You OK? - Huh?

208
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:29,509
- You going to throw up? - Yeah.

209
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,038
Come with me, man.

210
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,652
# Give me time #

211
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:46,129
What?

212
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,829
Here we go. Here we go.

213
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,630
Here we go. Come on. Come on.

214
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,158
You got it.

215
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:55,171
There. Hey.

216
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,433
Is he a friend of yours?

217
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:58,269
Me? No, no. Actually, I couldn't let him do it...

218
00:09:58,308 --> 00:09:59,774
in front of his family.

219
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:02,169
Wow.

220
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:05,180
Well, I'm glad I got to see it.

221
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,408
- OK. You all through? - Yeah.

222
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:11,851
Going to wait a few years before you drink again?

223
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:12,979
Yeah.

224
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:14,784
All right, remember... alcohol equals puke...

225
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:17,451
equals smelly mess equals nobody likes you.

226
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:20,284
Hey, no, I... I got it from here.

227
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,919
No, actually, you know what? You go this way...

228
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:23,691
and you go this way. It's for the best.

229
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,756
It's all right. Take it easy. See you later.

230
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,767
Sleep it off, pal. All right.

231
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:30,395
Hey, you know, wedding singer?

232
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:32,131
A-whoo!

233
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,532
OK.

234
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:40,101
- Are you drinking, too? - No.

235
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:41,874
It's Coca-Cola.

236
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:44,815
Are you sure? There's no rum in that Coca-Cola?

237
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm not a big drinker...

238
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:50,047
and if it was, I'd be puking in there more than that kid.

239
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:52,453
Oh, I don't think anybody could puke more than that kid.

240
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:53,855
I think I saw a boot come out of him.

241
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:57,717
You're the wedding singer.

242
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,059
Yeah. How you doing? I'm Robbie.

243
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:01,620
I'm Julia.

244
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,963
I'm actually waitressing at your wedding next week.

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,125
Cool.

246
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:06,794
That's a beautiful ring you have there.

247
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:08,030
Are you getting married, too?

248
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:13,136
Actually, I don't know how serious the guy is...

249
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:15,142
who gave this to me.

250
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:19,943
Right now, I feel like I'm doomed to wander the planet alone forever.

251
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,312
Oh, no.

252
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,476
Kind of like the Incredible Hulk, huh?

253
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,382
Yeah...

254
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,751
only I'm not helping people.

255
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:30,655
That's not true, because I saw you inside.

256
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:31,749
You were helping people.

257
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:35,318
You were giving them fish and coffee and forks.

258
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,885
People can't eat without forks.

259
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,159
And they can't drink without a fish.

260
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,928
That's right. I think... What does that mean?

261
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,697
I don't know. You lost me back at the Hulk.

262
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,794
Hey.

263
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,429
Hey, Robbie, you better get back in there.

264
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,099
They're starting to turn on George.

265
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,472
- Sit down! - You suck!

266
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,533
You suck!

267
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,068
He's got to learn a new song.

268
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,274
But, uh, OK, well, it was nice to meet you.

269
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:01,045
It was nice meeting you, too. And if I do ever get married...

270
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,813
maybe you'll sing at my wedding.

271
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,547
Oh, man. It's a deal.

272
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:05,986
- OK. - OK, take care.

273
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:11,451
# There was love #

274
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:12,517
Yeah.

275
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:15,121
- # All around # - Nice.

276
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:16,926
# But I never #

277
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:19,456
# Heard it singing #

278
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:20,797
Very nice.

279
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:22,894
# No, I never #

280
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:24,928
# Heard it at all #

281
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:25,996
Pretty.

282
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,634
# 'Til there was #

283
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:29,938
# You #

284
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,273
Much better.

285
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:32,869
Man, you're going to blow everybody away...

286
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,437
at your fiftieth anniversary party.

287
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:38,713
If I sing to Frank without making any mistakes...

288
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:40,719
he would know how hard I've worked...

289
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:44,280
and how much I still love him after all these years.

290
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:46,086
I hope fifty years from now...

291
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:48,150
Linda and I are as happy as you two guys.

292
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:49,420
Oh, you will be.

293
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:51,394
It runs in your family.

294
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,795
You're a born romantic, just like your father was.

295
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:54,991
Yeah?

296
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:58,196
I know they'll be looking down on you tomorrow.

297
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,600
I hope so.

298
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:01,103
Are you nervous?

299
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,833
I'm actually not that nervous, you know?

300
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:05,137
I'm around weddings all the time. It's going to be fun.

301
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:06,972
Oh, not about the wedding...

302
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,943
about the wedding night.

303
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:11,811
Will this be your first time with intercourse?

304
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:13,576
Uh...

305
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:15,174
Well... no, don't be ashamed.

306
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:18,778
You know, when I got married, I wasn't a virgin.

307
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:22,085
I already had intercourse with eight men.

308
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:25,854
You know, that's actually something I don't want to know about.

309
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,657
That was a lot back then.

310
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:29,856
That would be like 200 today.

311
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:33,128
Yeah. Uh, it's 5:00. I'm going to get going.

312
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:34,828
Oh, but your payment.

313
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:37,632
My payment. Uh... can I get it to go?

314
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:39,934
Oh, you're such a sweet boy...

315
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:42,965
letting an old woman pay you with meatballs.

316
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,567
Oh, yeah, well, they taste so good...

317
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,373
it's like I'm ripping you off, Rosie.

318
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:49,710
I don't have any clean tupperware.

319
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:52,080
All right, well, definitely next time, OK?

320
00:13:52,118 --> 00:13:54,483
Don't be silly. Now hold out your hands.

321
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,749
- You want to... - Yeah. Do it.

322
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:57,845
OK.

323
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:00,448
Oh. Cool.

324
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:04,185
- Thanks a lot. - Oh.

325
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,230
Now, please...

326
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,529
take a bite so that I can watch you enjoy.

327
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,468
That's my favorite part.

328
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:16,131
OK. Well... I'll go with the right one.

329
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,536
Heh heh. That looks good.

330
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:25,441
That's a good meatball. That's a good meatball.

331
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:27,277
Oh! Now...

332
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:30,307
listen to me, Robbie Hart.

333
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:33,514
You're going to be a fine husband.

334
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:36,147
Well, I hope so, Rosie. Thank you.

335
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,622
OK, well, I'm going to leave.

336
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:40,285
I'll see you at the wedding, all right?

337
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:51,892
Well, thank you for coming in and taking me to lunch.

338
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,561
Look at the picture of that girl. See that?

339
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,332
You're a lot prettier than that girl...

340
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:58,839
and she's getting married.

341
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:01,671
What does pretty have to do with getting married?

342
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,733
Everything. You got to get married...

343
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,575
before your hips start spreading and you get facial hair...

344
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,639
which, by the way, comes from your father's mother.

345
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:12,709
Looks like Magnum, P.I., for God's sake.

346
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:15,778
Well, I can't make Glenn set a date.

347
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:17,379
Well...

348
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:19,084
you're going to hate this idea...

349
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:24,563
but I think you should consider a fake pregnancy.

350
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:25,824
I'm exiting the car.

351
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:27,456
Look, it's just a means to an end.

352
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,797
Believe me, in five years, he'll thank you for it.

353
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:49,916
Perhaps we should call her.

354
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:51,816
Uh...

355
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:54,515
she's probably got a make-up problem or her dress or something.

356
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:57,286
I know her. She likes to look her best. It'll be OK.

357
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:13,495
- Robs? - Hey, sis.

358
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,768
Hi, Robs.

359
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,902
I just got off the phone with Linda's mom.

360
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,173
Linda's not there, but...

361
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,736
there was a note.

362
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,304
A note?

363
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,043
Everything all right?

364
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,553
Yeah, she's OK.

365
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:33,182
It basically indicated that Linda was...

366
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,126
not coming today.

367
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:42,654
So, it was a bad note.

368
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,093
Did she say why?

369
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,563
I am so sorry, honey.

370
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:53,700
It's OK.

371
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:56,434
You want me to say something?

372
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,275
No.

373
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:00,574
Just give me a second.

374
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:02,276
I'Il... I'll be right back.

375
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,478
Oh, my God, she's not showing up.

376
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:19,555
Don't worry, man.

377
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,590
Everything's going to be all right.

378
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:24,228
It's OK. It's OK.

379
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:27,067
No!

380
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:30,703
Oh, God!

381
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:31,965
She's gone!

382
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:39,075
# Come on, it's a nice day #

383
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:41,107
# For a white wedding #

384
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:43,279
You can't catch me!

385
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:46,118
I'm going to get you and chop you up!

386
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,784
Can we turn this crap off, please?

387
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:51,623
That's right, Robbie. You have to let it out, man.

388
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:53,288
- Let what out? - Your feelings.

389
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:56,661
You know, about what that lousy bitch did to you today.

390
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,258
Don't call her that, because we're going to get back together...

391
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,269
and then there's going to be weirdness between you and me...

392
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:03,396
so just watch it.

393
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,564
I made this for you, Uncle Robbie.

394
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,836
Oh, thanks, Freddy Krueger.

395
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:10,173
That's not nice.

396
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,338
Very creative, though.

397
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,903
Go back to the boiler room.

398
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,313
I just wish I knew where she was, you know?

399
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:23,345
Man, he's taking it pretty bad.

400
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,516
I mean, he's acting like a real robot...

401
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,321
a zombie or something.

402
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,294
He's been wanting to get married since the third grade.

403
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,991
It makes sense. That's when Mom and Dad died.

404
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,931
He wants to start a family of his own.

405
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,059
Hey, check out the cake.

406
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:39,626
There's only a little groom on top.

407
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:40,933
Mmm.

408
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:46,375
# Look for somethin' left in this world #

409
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:51,370
# Start again #

410
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:01,051
Hey. You're late.

411
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,353
I'm sorry.

412
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,018
I just couldn't do it.

413
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,290
Well...

414
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,230
if you need some more time, I guess I can wait.

415
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:14,766
No, I don't need more time, Robbie.

416
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:16,167
I don't ever want to marry you.

417
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,230
Jeez, you know, that information...

418
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:25,472
might have been a little more useful to me yesterday.

419
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:29,405
I've been talking to my friends the last couple of days...

420
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:31,245
Oh, here it comes.

421
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:34,844
And I think I figured out what's been bothering me.

422
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,047
I'm not in love with Robbie now.

423
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,650
I'm in love with Robbie six years ago...

424
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:42,852
Robbie, the lead singer of Final Warning...

425
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:44,861
when I used to come and watch you from the front row...

426
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:47,056
in your spandex pants...

427
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,225
your silk shirt unbuttoned...

428
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,330
licking the microphone like David Lee Roth.

429
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:55,770
I still got the spandex. I'll put them on right now.

430
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:57,670
The point is, I woke up this morning...

431
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:01,039
and I realized I'm about to marry a wedding singer.

432
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:03,567
I am never going to leave Ridgefield.

433
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:05,512
Why do you need to leave Ridgefield?

434
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:08,607
We grew up here. All our friends are here.

435
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:10,777
It's the perfect place to raise a family.

436
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:13,309
Oh, yeah. Living in your sister's basement with five kids...

437
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:15,151
while you're off every weekend doing wedding gigs...

438
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,123
at a whopping sixty bucks a pop?

439
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:18,715
Once again...

440
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,728
things that could have been brought to my attention yesterday!

441
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,862
The fact is, we grew apart a long time ago.

442
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,991
Mm-mmm.

443
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,468
You just wanted to get married so badly, you didn't care to who.

444
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,630
That's not true. I love you.

445
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:37,268
Come here. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

446
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,709
Hey, Linda.

447
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:41,769
You're a bitch.

448
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,475
Thanks, Petey. Go back to the house.

449
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:52,685
He... He might have Tourette's syndrome.

450
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:54,088
We're looking into it.

451
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:57,889
I got to go.

452
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:02,055
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:19,972
# 99 luftballons... #

454
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:22,915
Aah!

455
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,975
- Glenn! - Don't be so jumpy.

456
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,647
These are for you.

457
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,246
Thank you.

458
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,151
They're beautiful.

459
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,755
I have something else for you.

460
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,034
Two airplane tickets to Las Vegas?

461
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,937
# Da dum de dum, da dum de dum #

462
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,272
Oh, my God, Glenn! Oh, my God!

463
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,799
I know you wanted to set a date...

464
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,971
so I went to the travel agent, and I set it.

465
00:21:57,348 --> 00:22:00,783
Glenn, I love you so much, but Las Vegas? I thought...

466
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:02,876
Jules, it's the romance capital of the world.

467
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,478
I just don't want a big wedding...

468
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:07,216
you know, hundreds of people we don't know...

469
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:09,247
that are just there for the free drinks...

470
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:11,350
and all-you-can-eat buffet.

471
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:13,361
They might as well be in Vegas.

472
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:18,028
OK.

473
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:22,928
Las Vegas it is, and it'll be great.

474
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:24,767
Jules...

475
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,568
are you going to do the girl thing?

476
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:28,165
You're going to act happy...

477
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:29,903
and you're going to be pouting on the inside?

478
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:33,070
No. I'm happy.

479
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:39,217
All right.

480
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:40,912
Let's get married here.

481
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:43,815
I know that's what you want.

482
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:45,720
Thank you, Glenn.

483
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:47,054
Thank you.

484
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,559
It's more important to you anyway.

485
00:22:48,594 --> 00:22:49,855
Thank you.

486
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:52,954
And I promise I will give you the most beautiful wedding...

487
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,760
and even you'll have a good time.

488
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,596
Mm-hmm.

489
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:59,692
# Pass the dutchie on the left-hand side #

490
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:02,170
# Pass the dutchie on the left-hand side #

491
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:03,229
# It a-gonna burn #

492
00:23:03,274 --> 00:23:05,332
# Give me the music, make me jump and prance #

493
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:06,467
# It a-go done #

494
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,034
# Give me the music, make me rock in the dance #

495
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:11,136
# You play it on the radio #

496
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,910
# And so me say we a-go hear it on the stereo... #

497
00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:21,578
Hey, it's about time his best friend showed up.

498
00:23:21,623 --> 00:23:23,351
So, how's he doing?

499
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,824
I don't know, man.

500
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,919
He's been down in the basement since it happened...

501
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:29,929
five days now.

502
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:34,161
I think he's having some kind of a mental situation...

503
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:36,692
you know, an episode or something.

504
00:23:36,736 --> 00:23:38,134
All right.

505
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:40,570
# I said, pass the dutchie #

506
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,597
Hey, you better do something, because I don't want to be known...

507
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:44,871
as the brother-in-law of the town nut job.

508
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:46,343
I got enough problems already.

509
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:48,538
Oh, shit, I got water all over myself.

510
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,811
# I would do most anything #

511
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:54,253
# To get you back by my side #

512
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,383
# But I just keep on laughing... #

513
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:58,914
Hello?

514
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:02,118
Hey, Robbie.

515
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:05,925
You all right?

516
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:10,527
# Boys don't cry #

517
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,166
Hey, these sheets are soft. You use Downy?

518
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:18,505
No.

519
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,875
All Tempa-Cheer.

520
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:22,880
You can wash your clothes at any temperature...

521
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:25,041
and the colors don't run together.

522
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:28,142
- Really? - Yeah. Now leave me alone.

523
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:31,812
You have to go back to work.

524
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:35,086
You know there's going to be over a hundred drunk girls...

525
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,250
at this wedding tonight.

526
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:37,816
I've got nothing to offer anybody.

527
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:41,159
I haven't done jack shit since high school.

528
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:43,222
Why would any girl ever marry me?

529
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,960
Marry you?

530
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,991
I'm just trying to get someone to play with your ding-dong.

531
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:53,433
# Holiday #

532
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,839
# Celebrate #

533
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:04,081
# Holiday #

534
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:06,950
# Celebrate #

535
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:11,052
# If we took a holiday #

536
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,116
# Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah #

537
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,490
# Took some time to celebrate #

538
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:17,461
# Come on, let's celebrate #

539
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:20,021
# Just one day out of life #

540
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,657
# Holiday #

541
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,929
# It would be #

542
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:27,267
# It would be so nice #

543
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,705
# Everybody spread the word #

544
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:30,901
# Come on #

545
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:34,104
# I live in my sister's basement #

546
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:35,202
# Come on #

547
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:38,541
He just had his heart broken.

548
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,380
Why would he even think about coming back to work?

549
00:25:41,418 --> 00:25:43,044
I don't know.

550
00:25:43,086 --> 00:25:45,713
# Celebrate #

551
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:59,456
You guys are off to a great start, don't you think?

552
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:02,526
I mean, Cindy showed up...

553
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,163
so, right away, Scott, you got to be pretty psyched, right?

554
00:26:06,574 --> 00:26:09,133
Hey, buddy, I'm not paying you to hear your thoughts on life.

555
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:10,472
I'm paying you to sing.

556
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:15,672
Well, I have a microphone, and you don't...

557
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:20,414
so you will listen to every damn word I have to say!

558
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:28,256
You know, it's funny.

559
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:31,819
Some of us will never, ever find true love.

560
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:34,262
Like, take, for instance...

561
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,663
me.

562
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:38,769
And I'm pretty sure that guy right there.

563
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:43,201
And that lady with the sideburns.

564
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:47,634
And basically everybody at table nine.

565
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:49,041
Huh?

566
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:51,341
But the worst thing is...

567
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:53,280
that me...

568
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:54,942
fatty...

569
00:26:54,984 --> 00:26:57,383
sideburns lady...

570
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:59,181
and the mutants over at table nine...

571
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:01,211
Aw.

572
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:04,520
Will never, ever find a way to better the situation...

573
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,686
because...

574
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:10,389
apparently, we have absolutely nothing to offer...

575
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:11,954
the opposite sex.

576
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:13,556
Mm-hmm.

577
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:16,068
You are the worst wedding singer in the world, buddy!

578
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,659
Sir, one more outburst...

579
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,466
I will strangle you with my microphone wire.

580
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:20,563
You understand me?

581
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,272
Now let's cut the stupid cake...

582
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,244
because I know the fat guy's going to have a heart attack...

583
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,643
if we don't eat again soon.

584
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:35,544
And while we do that, here's a little mood music for you.

585
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,182
# Whoo-hoo! #

586
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,161
Cindy and Scott are newlyweds.

587
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:46,718
Whoopi-dee-do!

588
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:53,033
# He loves her #

589
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,697
# But she loves this guy right here #

590
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:58,365
# And he loves somebody else #

591
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:01,341
# You just can't win #

592
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:03,344
# And so it goes #

593
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:06,312
# Until the day you die #

594
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:08,815
# This thing they call love #

595
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,113
# Is gonna make you cry #

596
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:12,345
I hate you.

597
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:14,411
# I've had the blues #

598
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:17,218
# The reds and the pinks #

599
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:19,885
# One thing's for sure #

600
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:21,916
Love stinks?

601
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:23,553
# Love stinks #

602
00:28:24,697 --> 00:28:26,163
# Yeah, yeah #

603
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,256
Love stinks!

604
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,961
# Love stinks #

605
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:31,629
# Yeah, yeah #

606
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:32,659
Love stinks?

607
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:35,331
# Love stinks #

608
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:36,840
# Yeah, yeah #

609
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,364
Love stinks!

610
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,570
# Love stinks #

611
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,738
# Yeah, yeah #

612
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,881
Drug addict! Degenerate!

613
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,180
# Love stinks #

614
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,948
# Love stinks #

615
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:52,784
# Love... Love stinks #

616
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:55,483
# Love stinks! #

617
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:13,839
Hey.

618
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,240
Hey.

619
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:19,302
I was wondering what happened to you.

620
00:29:21,214 --> 00:29:23,113
Did everybody leave?

621
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:26,545
Pretty much, except for a few cops...

622
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:29,282
that are still interviewing some witnesses.

623
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:31,548
OK.

624
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:36,822
I'm going to get the hell out of here.

625
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,921
OK, so it was your first wedding back...

626
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:42,398
Of course things are going to be a little shaky.

627
00:29:42,434 --> 00:29:44,958
A little shaky? I hate weddings.

628
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:48,233
I hate the bride. I hate the groom.

629
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:51,138
I want them to be miserable, because that's what I am.

630
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:53,335
No. You're the best.

631
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:56,937
At what? People eat prime rib, and I sing.

632
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:00,472
I mean, it's a joke. I can't do this anymore.

633
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:04,384
Glenn and I set the date...

634
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,387
so you have to play our wedding.

635
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,013
Congratulations.

636
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,354
I... I just can't do it, all right?

637
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:18,832
Well, I'm having an engagement party in two weeks...

638
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:21,095
and I really want you and Sammy to come.

639
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:31,707
# Ohh ohh #

640
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:33,712
# Hold me now #

641
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:35,941
# Whoa, oh #

642
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:38,278
# Warm my heart #

643
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:42,583
# Stay with me #

644
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:44,611
Oh, good, you're here.

645
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:47,124
Robbie's here! Let's move it!

646
00:30:47,158 --> 00:30:48,522
Now, the kids have been fed...

647
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,685
but if they want snacks, there's ice pops in the freezer...

648
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:52,388
or they can have microwave popcorn.

649
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,157
Good.

650
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:55,389
Are you going to the engagement party tomorrow night?

651
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:57,228
Yeah, I'll probably go.

652
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:00,899
Come on, Andy, move your ass!

653
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:02,870
Hang on, huh? I'm watching Dallas.

654
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:05,339
I think J.R. Might be dead or something. They shot him.

655
00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:06,397
Good night.

656
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:08,432
- Love you. - Love you.

657
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:10,535
Time to make the donuts.

658
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,739
- I made the donuts. - Dunkin' Donuts.

659
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:14,612
Hello.

660
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:16,445
Hey, Uncle Robbie's here.

661
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:21,049
Hey... ohh, the goofball brothers.

662
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,750
Is it true that you're in the middle of a nervous breakdown?

663
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:25,087
No.

664
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,718
Nervous breakdown, nervous breakdown.

665
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,887
- Who said that? - Everybody's been saying that.

666
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,159
Everybody? You're eight years old. You only know your parents.

667
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,597
What are you talking about?

668
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:36,362
Is it true that you're gonna end up in a mental institution?

669
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:38,528
Cuckoo's nest, cuckoo's nest.

670
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:39,696
No.

671
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:41,797
Hey, hey, hey, kids. Shh.

672
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:45,037
Now, remember what we talked about?

673
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,374
All right.

674
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:49,208
Go over there and watch some television.

675
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:51,180
Can I speak to you for a second, Rob?

676
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:52,842
- Everybody... - Yeah.

677
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:57,719
You know, I've been thinking about what happened to you...

678
00:31:57,755 --> 00:31:59,153
and believe me, it's all for the best.

679
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,213
Yeah.

680
00:32:00,257 --> 00:32:02,884
I mean, I know you were in love and everything, but that wears off.

681
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:06,361
You see, me and your sister, we used to be wild.

682
00:32:06,396 --> 00:32:08,454
She was very adventurous...

683
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:13,127
and we got into some crazy shit, but now the thrill is gone.

684
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:16,432
If we do get a second alone together, we usually go to sleep.

685
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:18,268
- Yeah? - I mean, if it's a special occasion...

686
00:32:18,307 --> 00:32:21,935
she might, uh, she might do this exotic dance for me.

687
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:22,964
What?

688
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,738
And sometimes she might, uh...

689
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:26,902
you know, work with my nipples a little bit.

690
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:30,576
All right, enough. Go out. I'll take care of the kids.

691
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:31,878
Yeah.

692
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:34,852
I don't know what I just said, but I said something.

693
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,453
# Time #

694
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,024
Women got a thing about marriage. I mean, if you want to stay with them...

695
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:47,827
eventually you're gonna have to marry them.

696
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,426
That's the point that I'm at. No big deal.

697
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,525
There she is.

698
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,934
The girl who finally beat me into submission.

699
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,429
That's right. August 5 is less than 3 months away.

700
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,941
We've got a lot of planning to do.

701
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,569
Um, do you think it would be better...

702
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,512
if maybe you took over all the arrangements?

703
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:08,005
Well, I'd like to do it together.

704
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:09,779
Yeah.

705
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:12,787
But you like this stuff. It's really not my thing.

706
00:33:14,323 --> 00:33:16,882
I mean, God forbid I screw up the wedding flowers.

707
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:18,290
How could I live with myself?

708
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:19,587
Hey, he's gonna be so wasted...

709
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:21,185
he's not even gonna know flowers are at the wedding.

710
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:22,718
Oh, yeah. Up high.

711
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:26,631
Hey, Glenn, I hear you're gonna have your bachelor party...

712
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:29,363
Friday night before the wedding. Gonna be all right with that?

713
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:31,836
I mean, you might miss Miami Vice.

714
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:33,896
Nope. Summer. Reruns.

715
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:35,373
I'm all set.

716
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:37,842
Oh, great.

717
00:33:40,747 --> 00:33:42,976
All right, nice house.

718
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:46,007
I told you this guy was loaded.

719
00:33:46,052 --> 00:33:47,712
Yeah, I know. But in and out, though, man.

720
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,379
I don't want to be here very long.

721
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:50,751
All right, let me just pick up a chick...

722
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,085
and we'll get out of here.

723
00:33:52,124 --> 00:33:53,852
What do you think of the jacket?

724
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:57,554
I don't know, man. I would lose that glove. You look nuts.

725
00:33:57,595 --> 00:33:59,721
There's Julia.

726
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:03,457
Let's go say hello.

727
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:06,895
Hi, you guys.

728
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,631
I'm so glad you came.

729
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,935
Jason, this is Robbie and Sammy...

730
00:34:10,974 --> 00:34:13,441
and this is my fianc?Glenn.

731
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:15,705
- Hey, congratulations, Glenn. - Thank you.

732
00:34:15,744 --> 00:34:18,211
Robbie Hart. Oh, man...

733
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:20,680
I heard what happened to you at your wedding.

734
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:23,741
That was so cold. You must have felt like shit.

735
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:26,345
No. It felt really good.

736
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:28,013
Thanks for bringing it up, man.

737
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,522
You know, my parents died when I was ten.

738
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:30,921
Would you like to talk about that?

739
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:33,119
Why would we want to talk about that?

740
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,593
I don't know.

741
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:36,254
Hey, oh, somebody needs a drink.

742
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:38,456
Actually, I'm not a big drinker.

743
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:40,294
Well, I am. How about an Alabama slammer?

744
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:41,459
Sounds like a plan.

745
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,434
Meet me at the bar. I gotta piss first.

746
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,733
Hey, yeah, have a few drinks and, you know, drive home.

747
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,237
Hey, Julia, thanks for inviting us.

748
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:51,537
I'm just glad you guys came.

749
00:34:51,577 --> 00:34:53,100
I mean, we get to hang out at work so much...

750
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:55,305
but we don't get to talk 'cause we're always so busy.

751
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:59,305
Well, we should make time to talk, don't you think?

752
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:05,017
You know what? The first time this guy saw you...

753
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:07,318
he told me he was gonna hit on you.

754
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:09,917
- Really? - That's not true.

755
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,757
Yeah, it is. You told me she was in trouble.

756
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:15,592
She was gonna get it, and she didn't even know it.

757
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:17,695
He's teasing. I would never say that.

758
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,333
What? You said you were gonna give it to her.

759
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:22,343
- Give me what, exactly? - Yeah.

760
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:23,843
You're a jerk.

761
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:26,369
What do you mean? You didn't know she was engaged.

762
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:28,313
So now you're not gonna give it to me?

763
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,010
Very funny.

764
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:31,517
Say hi to your brother Tito.

765
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,357
So, how are you doing?

766
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:40,825
I'm doing better. I don't know.

767
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,886
How are you and Glenn doing with the wedding plans?

768
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,659
Uh...

769
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:48,996
Glenn isn't really...

770
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,092
He's... He's very busy right now.

771
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:51,932
You know, he works on Wall Street...

772
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,233
and you know how that is nowadays.

773
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:57,241
Wall Street, stocks and stuff?

774
00:35:57,276 --> 00:35:58,765
Yeah. Actually, he's in bonds.

775
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,835
And he barely has time to sleep, let alone plan a wedding...

776
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,539
so I'm kind of doing this on my own.

777
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:06,640
But I went to Marshall's for the floral centerpieces.

778
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:09,151
You went to Marshall's? Man, you should go to Tony's.

779
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:11,848
They're cheaper, you know, and they've got a great selection.

780
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:14,913
All right. Well, thank you for the tip.

781
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:17,221
You know, it's a shame you won't be doing weddings anymore.

782
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,624
We won't get to hang out as much.

783
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:21,027
Nah, we'll get to hang out.

784
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:22,654
There's other things to do at the reception hall...

785
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:24,426
besides weddings, right?

786
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:28,735
# Oy, oy, bar mitzvah #

787
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,896
# Mazel tov #

788
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,442
# Oy, oy, bar mitzvah #

789
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:40,411
# Mazel tov #

790
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:44,712
# Oy, oy, bar mitzvah #

791
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,914
# Mazel tov #

792
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:50,615
# Ya ya ya #

793
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:51,644
# L'chaim! #

794
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:54,989
OK, let's keep the fun rolling. Take it away, George.

795
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:01,258
- Yeah! - Who's this?

796
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:11,302
# Do you really want to hurt me? #

797
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,140
You seem kind of sad.

798
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:17,646
Why don't you get out there and dance, buddy?

799
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,408
I asked that girl over there.

800
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:21,040
She turned me down.

801
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:24,018
She said she didn't dance with losers.

802
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:26,748
Oh, man. That hurts.

803
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,654
But, you know, why would you want to dance with somebody...

804
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:32,352
who doesn't want to dance with you? Right?

805
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,459
Listen, don't worry.

806
00:37:35,497 --> 00:37:38,090
You're gonna meet a girl who treats you right someday.

807
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:39,462
I promise you. OK, buddy?

808
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:43,128
How you guys doing? All right?

809
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,296
Fellas, I want you to meet a friend of mine...

810
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:47,134
by the name of Julia Sullivan.

811
00:37:47,173 --> 00:37:50,938
Hiya, Julia. Could you come out here for a second?

812
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,575
- Say hi to Julia, everybody. - Hello.

813
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:59,049
Now, who of you out there would like to dance with this fine-Iooking woman?

814
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:00,675
- Oh, me! Me! - Yeah!

815
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:05,613
I'd like to do more than dance with her.

816
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:08,685
Wow, Julia.

817
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:10,750
Sounds to me like you got your pick...

818
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,785
of any man in this room to dance with...

819
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,855
so I want you to take your time...

820
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:19,664
and find amongst all these young studs here tonight...

821
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:22,899
the coolest, most un-Iosery guy in the bunch.

822
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:24,530
OK.

823
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:25,971
Pick me, pick me.

824
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:27,338
Feel my love, baby.

825
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:30,106
Please pick me. Please, Julia.

826
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:31,874
Oh, please.

827
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,549
May I have this dance?

828
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,454
Ahhh!

829
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,786
OK, pal, have fun.

830
00:38:57,136 --> 00:39:00,696
# I can only give you love #

831
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,866
# That lasts forever #

832
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:06,570
# And a promise to be near #

833
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,841
# Each time you call #

834
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:14,112
# And the only heart I own #

835
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,142
# For you and you alone #

836
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,620
# That's all #

837
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,917
Ohh!

838
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,082
# That's all #

839
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:22,215
Uh-oh.

840
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:26,159
# All I have are these arms #

841
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:27,924
# To enfold you #

842
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:29,726
Just go with it.

843
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:35,135
# And a love time can never destroy #

844
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,034
Take it, George.

845
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:10,922
Come here, big red.

846
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,274
# If you're wondering what I'm asking #

847
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:21,242
# In return, dear #

848
00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:23,006
# You'll be glad to know #

849
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:28,381
# That my demands are small #

850
00:40:28,418 --> 00:40:32,979
# Say it's me that you'll adore #

851
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:35,353
# For now and ever more #

852
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,517
# That's all #

853
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:42,996
# That's all #

854
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:45,658
To the new lord of the ladies!

855
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:49,232
You're a lovely dancer.

856
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:58,176
- Are you gonna tell Glenn? - About what?

857
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:01,043
About you and that kid, and him squeezing your tush.

858
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,515
Well, he did have very strong hands for a thirteen-year-old.

859
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:05,710
I could see that.

860
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:07,445
Hey, listen, by the way...

861
00:41:07,486 --> 00:41:09,248
thank you for recommending Tony the florist.

862
00:41:09,288 --> 00:41:11,551
Not only were his flowers beautiful, but he didn't overcharge me.

863
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,489
Good. I'm glad.

864
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:17,016
And a new girl in town could certainly use that kind of help on everything.

865
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:19,221
You got Holly and your mother, right?

866
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:22,459
Well, my mother lives fifty miles away...

867
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,262
and Holly's not into that kind of thing...

868
00:41:24,302 --> 00:41:26,462
so that really only leaves one person.

869
00:41:26,503 --> 00:41:28,026
George?

870
00:41:31,441 --> 00:41:32,464
No.

871
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:36,501
I would, but, you know, I just... I can't.

872
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:38,239
I understand.

873
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,577
I just don't know how to go about this.

874
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:44,244
I'm afraid I'm gonna pay $500 for a half-eaten wedding cake.

875
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:48,015
I really gotta concentrate on getting some more gigs.

876
00:41:48,056 --> 00:41:50,717
I mean, there's only four Jewish families in this town.

877
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:58,089
Oh, all right.

878
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,597
Yay.

879
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:00,997
# It's all I can do... #

880
00:42:01,034 --> 00:42:04,662
I have never done it for that cheap.

881
00:42:04,704 --> 00:42:08,070
Hey, I know for a fact you gave Eric Lamensoft that price.

882
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:10,336
I did not.

883
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:12,536
Faye, look at me.

884
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:15,238
Look me in the eyes. I'm right here, Faye.

885
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,337
Don't look away.

886
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:18,871
Tell me, did you give him that price or not?

887
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,111
Mmm.

888
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:22,175
Mmm.

889
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:25,881
OK. Just that one time. OK, so you got me.

890
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:28,288
Hey, you know, can I say something?

891
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:31,885
I deal with a lot of people, but you two look truly happy.

892
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:34,828
You're gonna make it. I know. Believe me.

893
00:42:34,864 --> 00:42:35,852
How do you know?

894
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:38,332
Well, you know, you can just look at a couple...

895
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:40,198
and you can tell right away...

896
00:42:40,236 --> 00:42:42,829
that they're gonna stay together forever.

897
00:42:42,871 --> 00:42:45,805
Like, uh, Donald and Ivana...

898
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:48,434
and Woody and Mia...

899
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:51,877
and Burt and Loni.

900
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:53,470
Oh, well, we're not getting married.

901
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:56,505
That's right. Actually, we're brother and sister.

902
00:42:56,551 --> 00:42:57,608
Oh, so that's it.

903
00:42:57,652 --> 00:43:00,119
Oh, 'cause I could sense a closeness.

904
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,579
You know, the weird thing is...

905
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,281
when we were growing up, we didn't get along...

906
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:04,983
'cause I used to do this to her a lot.

907
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:06,651
Ow!

908
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:09,627
Aah!

909
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:12,960
We're gonna go now. Come here, sis.

910
00:43:12,998 --> 00:43:15,363
Hey, your ass is grass.

911
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:17,459
I'm telling Mom when we get home.

912
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:22,093
Whoo!

913
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,936
# Yes, it's ladies' night #

914
00:43:23,975 --> 00:43:26,067
# And the feeling's right #

915
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,838
# Oh, yes, it's ladies' night #

916
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:30,438
# Oh, what a, oh, what a night #

917
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,140
# Yes, it's ladies' night #

918
00:43:32,182 --> 00:43:33,842
# And the feeling's right #

919
00:43:33,884 --> 00:43:36,750
Man, I've never seen it from this perspective before.

920
00:43:36,787 --> 00:43:38,219
Is this what I look like?

921
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:40,881
No, no. No, you're much better than him.

922
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:42,651
He's ridiculous.

923
00:43:42,692 --> 00:43:44,454
# One, hoo #

924
00:43:44,493 --> 00:43:47,518
# Hoo, hoo, hoo #

925
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:49,893
# Romantic lady #

926
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:54,265
# Single baby #

927
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:59,261
# Mmm, sophisticated mama #

928
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:03,969
# Come on, you disco lady #

929
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:05,272
# Send me a line, mama #

930
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,972
# Yes, it's ladies' night #

931
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:09,378
# Oh, what a night #

932
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:11,177
# Chaka Khan #

933
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:13,309
Thank you. This is Jimmy Moore...

934
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:15,912
saying that ain't no sock in my crotch.

935
00:44:15,955 --> 00:44:17,444
OK, take four, everybody.

936
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,347
Jimmy, that was really good, man. Thank you.

937
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:22,882
- Hey, no. Thank you. - For what?

938
00:44:22,928 --> 00:44:24,690
For quitting.

939
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,495
Or... should I thank Linda?

940
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,261
My business has tripled.

941
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:37,268
Well, you've just inspired me to hire a DJ.

942
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,967
So thank you.

943
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,270
Oh.

944
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,801
Well, good luck finding a DJ...

945
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,111
who can move and shake like this.

946
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:55,584
How did you become a wedding singer?

947
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:59,388
I think I got into it to make some money...

948
00:44:59,427 --> 00:45:01,257
until my music career took off.

949
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:03,489
And you want to be a rock star?

950
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:07,694
I kind of just wanted to be a songwriter, you know?

951
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:10,224
I think that's the hardest thing, to write a song.

952
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,363
A song that... you know, when people hear it...

953
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:17,102
they go, "Ohh, I know what that guy was feeling when he wrote that."

954
00:45:17,143 --> 00:45:18,268
Have you written anything lately?

955
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,504
Yeah, I guess.

956
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:22,103
Will you play it for me?

957
00:45:22,148 --> 00:45:24,012
You don't want to hear it. It's not good.

958
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:25,606
No, I'm sure it is.

959
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,210
It's just... I wrote half of it when I was with Linda...

960
00:45:29,254 --> 00:45:32,051
and I wrote the other half after we broke up...

961
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,057
so it's a little uneven, you know?

962
00:45:34,091 --> 00:45:35,648
I don't mind.

963
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:37,182
I'd like to hear it.

964
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:39,854
Yeah, all right.

965
00:45:39,897 --> 00:45:41,761
Yay.

966
00:45:46,235 --> 00:45:50,102
OK, I just want to warn you that, uh, when I wrote this song...

967
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:53,039
I was listening to The Cure a lot, so...

968
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:54,598
OK.

969
00:45:54,643 --> 00:45:55,802
Here we go.

970
00:45:57,412 --> 00:46:00,471
# You don't know #

971
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:02,414
# How much #

972
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,917
# I need you #

973
00:46:04,952 --> 00:46:09,650
# While you're near me #

974
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,749
# I don't feel blue #

975
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:17,160
# And when we kiss #

976
00:46:17,197 --> 00:46:21,565
# I know you need me, too #

977
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,865
# I can't believe I found a love #

978
00:46:25,904 --> 00:46:30,169
# That's so pure and true #

979
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:33,802
# But it all was bullshit #

980
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:38,304
# It was a goddamn joke #

981
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:42,751
# And when I think of you, Linda #

982
00:46:42,786 --> 00:46:46,846
# I hope you fuckin' choke #

983
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,985
# I hope you're glad #

984
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:53,926
# With what you've done to me #

985
00:46:54,997 --> 00:46:56,827
# I lay in bed #

986
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:58,992
# All day long #

987
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:02,195
# Feeling melancholy #

988
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:05,103
# You left me here #

989
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,073
# All alone #

990
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:10,941
# Tears running constantly #

991
00:47:10,978 --> 00:47:15,380
# Oh, somebody kill me, please #

992
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:19,350
# Somebody kill me, please #

993
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:21,249
# I'm on my knees #

994
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:23,447
# Pretty, pretty please #

995
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:26,480
# Kill me #

996
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:30,120
# I want to die #

997
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:37,795
# Put a bullet in my head #

998
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:40,897
I liked it.

999
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,499
He's losing his mind.

1000
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:49,771
And I'm reaping all the benefits.

1001
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:03,189
Thank you for the ice cream. It always cheers me up some.

1002
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:04,987
It's my pleasure.

1003
00:48:05,026 --> 00:48:07,357
I feel weird being in this place.

1004
00:48:07,395 --> 00:48:09,419
You know, Linda and I used to come here all the time.

1005
00:48:09,463 --> 00:48:11,054
We used to get chocolate shakes.

1006
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:13,258
May I ask what happened with Linda?

1007
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:18,328
She wasn't the right one, I guess.

1008
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:21,464
Did you have any idea she wasn't the right one...

1009
00:48:21,508 --> 00:48:22,701
when you were together?

1010
00:48:22,742 --> 00:48:25,539
I should have.

1011
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,380
Uhh, I remember we went to the Grand Canyon one time.

1012
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:32,649
We were flying there, and I'd never been there before...

1013
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:33,850
and Linda had...

1014
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:37,519
so you would think that she would give me the window seat...

1015
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:40,189
but she didn't.

1016
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:43,165
Not that that's a big deal, you know?

1017
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,565
But just... there were a lot of little things like that.

1018
00:48:45,602 --> 00:48:48,195
- I know that sounds stupid. - Not at all.

1019
00:48:48,238 --> 00:48:50,171
I think it's the little things that count.

1020
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:52,697
How did you know that Glenn was the right one?

1021
00:48:56,011 --> 00:48:57,705
The right one.

1022
00:48:57,746 --> 00:49:00,612
I always just envisioned the right one...

1023
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:03,708
being someone I could see myself growing old with.

1024
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:06,275
Yeah.

1025
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:11,485
And Glenn will be a really good-Iooking older man...

1026
00:49:11,526 --> 00:49:13,117
like Blake Carrington.

1027
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,218
I'm gonna probably look like Buddy Hackett.

1028
00:49:15,262 --> 00:49:15,920
Ha ha ha ha!

1029
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,526
# What I want, you've got #

1030
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:25,035
# But it might be hard to handle #

1031
00:49:25,071 --> 00:49:27,834
# Like the flame that burns the candle #

1032
00:49:27,874 --> 00:49:31,309
# The candle feeds the flame #

1033
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,175
# Yeah, yeah, what I got, full stock #

1034
00:49:34,212 --> 00:49:37,112
# Of thoughts and dreams that scatter #

1035
00:49:37,149 --> 00:49:39,241
# And you pull them all together #

1036
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:42,047
# And how I can't explain #

1037
00:49:42,086 --> 00:49:43,677
# Oh, yeah #

1038
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:45,210
# Well, well, you #

1039
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:50,889
# You make my dreams come true #

1040
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:56,960
# Well, well, well, you #

1041
00:49:58,134 --> 00:49:59,225
# Oh, yeah #

1042
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:02,362
# You make my dreams come true #

1043
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:05,368
# Oh, yeah #

1044
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:08,771
# On a night when bad dreams #

1045
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,401
# Become a Screamer #

1046
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:14,209
# When they're messin' with a dreamer #

1047
00:50:14,248 --> 00:50:17,774
# I can laugh it in the face #

1048
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:20,251
# Twist and shout my way out #

1049
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,584
# And wrap yourself around me #

1050
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:25,317
Of course I'm gonna hire him. Not only is he your best friend...

1051
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,018
but he's the only limo driver in town.

1052
00:50:29,061 --> 00:50:31,858
Yeah. I just like having fun with him.

1053
00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:35,489
OK.

1054
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:39,025
Wow. Look at him go.

1055
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,761
# Listen to this #

1056
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:43,432
Better move it, man.

1057
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,236
You're not gonna make it.

1058
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,014
You hit two cones. Those could have been people.

1059
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,713
Those could have been guests at her wedding.

1060
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:02,483
They were cones.

1061
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:08,690
# Every day, every day, every day #

1062
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,425
# Every day I write the book #

1063
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:16,928
# Chapter one #

1064
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:19,268
That was fun today. Wasn't that fun?

1065
00:51:19,306 --> 00:51:21,136
That was fun.

1066
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:22,971
I got the job, right?

1067
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,172
Yeah, you did. It's August 5, a week from today.

1068
00:51:26,646 --> 00:51:28,636
Cool. Hey, someone left a jacket in the back.

1069
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:31,214
That's Julia's jacket.

1070
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:34,083
Remember? She took it off on Noxon street.

1071
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,848
She said it's not jacket weather anymore.

1072
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:37,877
Uh-oh.

1073
00:51:37,923 --> 00:51:38,946
What?

1074
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:41,322
- You like her. - No, I don't.

1075
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,919
Of course you do. She's a cool chick with a hot ass.

1076
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:46,327
How's this? You talk about her ass again, I'll break your neck.

1077
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:49,423
Anyway, she told me she likes you.

1078
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:52,663
Really? She said that?

1079
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,135
No.

1080
00:51:55,405 --> 00:51:56,632
I mean, think about it.

1081
00:51:56,673 --> 00:51:58,970
It's gonna be your first kiss as a married couple.

1082
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:01,169
It's perfectly acceptable to open your mouth.

1083
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:04,077
I just would not want to do that in a church...

1084
00:52:04,113 --> 00:52:06,342
in front of God and all of our relatives.

1085
00:52:06,382 --> 00:52:09,817
I mean, it would gross them out to see me like...

1086
00:52:09,852 --> 00:52:13,446
No one will ever solve that.

1087
00:52:15,923 --> 00:52:17,890
Hi.

1088
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:19,983
You forgot your jacket in the limo.

1089
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:22,154
Thank you for bringing it back. That's so nice of you.

1090
00:52:22,196 --> 00:52:23,924
Yeah, it was.

1091
00:52:23,964 --> 00:52:26,932
OK, I'll see you later, all right? Have fun today.

1092
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:27,990
Hey, wait. Wait a second.

1093
00:52:28,035 --> 00:52:29,899
Maybe...

1094
00:52:29,936 --> 00:52:31,869
maybe he can help us.

1095
00:52:31,905 --> 00:52:33,201
You're the expert on this.

1096
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:35,206
We were just having a debate about wedding kisses.

1097
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,869
I say that it's OK for it to be an open-mouth kiss.

1098
00:52:38,911 --> 00:52:41,071
And I say that it's the type of occasion...

1099
00:52:41,113 --> 00:52:43,137
where people dress up, so it's not appropriate.

1100
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:45,239
- I see. - What do you want to do?

1101
00:52:45,283 --> 00:52:48,649
I mean, thin, tight mouth, and it's over?

1102
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:51,917
No. Thin, partially opened...

1103
00:52:51,955 --> 00:52:53,182
no tongues, over.

1104
00:52:53,223 --> 00:52:55,053
No tongue? Please.

1105
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:57,321
God, there has got to be a little tongue.

1106
00:52:57,361 --> 00:52:59,260
Well, maybe a little tongue.

1107
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:01,786
Not porno tongue. Church tongue.

1108
00:53:01,831 --> 00:53:03,627
Church tongue. I like that.

1109
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,360
Church tongue? What... What is that?

1110
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:08,198
I don't know how to describe it.

1111
00:53:08,237 --> 00:53:10,136
Well, show me.

1112
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:14,808
Not on me.

1113
00:53:14,843 --> 00:53:17,072
Hey, how about on him?

1114
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:18,703
You don't mind, do you?

1115
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:20,839
- I, uh... - Come on, just hold still.

1116
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:22,313
Julia, go ahead.

1117
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,979
Come on. We're all adults here.

1118
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,817
I'm gonna have to see it...

1119
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:37,556
if I'm gonna make an educated decision.

1120
00:53:39,765 --> 00:53:42,392
Well, if it's for educational purposes.

1121
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:43,900
Good. OK.

1122
00:53:43,936 --> 00:53:45,095
All right, you ready?

1123
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:48,105
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1124
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,437
You may kiss the bride.

1125
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,026
Wow.

1126
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:20,761
That...

1127
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:22,632
was... great.

1128
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,900
Julia, you should do that at the wedding.

1129
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,931
I gave her the jacket.

1130
00:54:29,943 --> 00:54:31,534
Hey, Jules. Hey, Holly.

1131
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:32,703
- Hi. - Hey.

1132
00:54:32,746 --> 00:54:34,007
Hey.

1133
00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:36,810
I kissed her, but it didn't mean anything.

1134
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:39,373
I just brought her the jacket.

1135
00:54:40,553 --> 00:54:41,780
Kissed who?

1136
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:44,653
Oh, me.

1137
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,384
Who hasn't?

1138
00:54:48,593 --> 00:54:53,029
I got you something. It's called a CD player.

1139
00:54:53,064 --> 00:54:54,655
It cost me, like, 700 bucks...

1140
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:57,428
but the sound quality is outstanding.

1141
00:54:57,468 --> 00:54:59,298
You want to play a record?

1142
00:54:59,336 --> 00:55:02,827
No, Jules, it doesn't play records. It plays CDs.

1143
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:04,999
It's a CD player.

1144
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,405
I'll be upstairs hooking it up.

1145
00:55:06,443 --> 00:55:12,074
Julia! Oh, my God, Robbie is so amazingly cute.

1146
00:55:12,115 --> 00:55:14,605
I think I should go out with him.

1147
00:55:18,687 --> 00:55:20,176
Yeah, I mean, why not?

1148
00:55:20,222 --> 00:55:23,281
You're single, and he's single. It makes sense.

1149
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:27,192
Well, hey, if you don't want me to, I won't do it.

1150
00:55:27,228 --> 00:55:30,321
Why would I not want you to?

1151
00:55:30,364 --> 00:55:32,422
Good, then I'm going out with him.

1152
00:55:32,467 --> 00:55:34,366
Who you going out with?

1153
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:35,867
Robbie.

1154
00:55:35,902 --> 00:55:38,165
Good. That guy needs to get laid.

1155
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:40,729
Excuse me. Just because he's going out with me...

1156
00:55:40,774 --> 00:55:42,263
doesn't mean he's gonna get laid.

1157
00:55:45,044 --> 00:55:47,136
All right, he probably will.

1158
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,668
I mean, do you think he'll go out with me?

1159
00:55:48,714 --> 00:55:50,943
Yeah. Jules is chums with him.

1160
00:55:50,983 --> 00:55:52,449
She'll fix it up, won't you, Jules?

1161
00:55:52,484 --> 00:55:53,780
Hey, you guys, you know what would be fun?

1162
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:56,012
Let's... Let's all go on a double date.

1163
00:55:56,054 --> 00:55:57,179
OK.

1164
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,377
You sure you know what you're doing up there?

1165
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:12,179
Don't worry. You've got to stay in shape...

1166
00:56:12,218 --> 00:56:14,082
so other men will look at you.

1167
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,247
That way your husband knows you're still attractive.

1168
00:56:17,289 --> 00:56:20,018
Yeah, well, just don't drop a dumbbell on your head.

1169
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:21,218
Mm. Ha ha.

1170
00:56:21,259 --> 00:56:25,592
So, you still haven't been dating anyone new, have you?

1171
00:56:26,164 --> 00:56:27,858
No, not yet.

1172
00:56:29,234 --> 00:56:31,827
Is it your confidence?

1173
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:34,666
Are you nervous about your penis?

1174
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:37,002
Huh? What?

1175
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:40,271
Well, are you nervous about showing a new girl your penis?

1176
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:42,970
You were comfortable showing it to Linda...

1177
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:46,503
but now you might have to show your penis to someone new.

1178
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:49,847
What's the matter with you? Don't... Don't talk about that.

1179
00:56:49,885 --> 00:56:54,412
You know, I was at your bris when you were a baby...

1180
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:56,082
and I saw it.

1181
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:59,854
It wasn't huge, but it had some size.

1182
00:57:00,394 --> 00:57:02,190
So don't worry about it.

1183
00:57:02,229 --> 00:57:04,093
I'm not worried about it. Next subject, quick.

1184
00:57:04,131 --> 00:57:07,122
- It had good shape. - What's the matter with you?

1185
00:57:07,168 --> 00:57:09,362
And when they cut the extra skin off...

1186
00:57:09,402 --> 00:57:11,892
the penis itself was very clean.

1187
00:57:11,938 --> 00:57:15,065
Well, that's great. Jeez.

1188
00:57:15,108 --> 00:57:17,598
I'm going to ask a girl out when I'm ready, Rosie.

1189
00:57:17,644 --> 00:57:21,044
Oh, well, let me help you practice until you are.

1190
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,412
Now, I'll be a young girl, and you be Robbie.

1191
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,076
So, ask me out.

1192
00:57:26,118 --> 00:57:27,914
I don't want to do this.

1193
00:57:27,952 --> 00:57:29,543
Hello, sir.

1194
00:57:29,587 --> 00:57:31,178
Hello.

1195
00:57:31,222 --> 00:57:34,019
Is there something you want to ask me?

1196
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:37,993
OK. Would you like to go to dinner with me sometime?

1197
00:57:38,028 --> 00:57:40,427
No. Your penis is too small.

1198
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:45,956
Ha ha ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1199
00:57:46,002 --> 00:57:48,196
As I said, it had some size.

1200
00:57:48,237 --> 00:57:49,328
OK.

1201
00:57:49,371 --> 00:57:51,565
Oh, Robbie.

1202
00:57:51,607 --> 00:57:53,540
You'll know when you meet the right girl...

1203
00:57:53,576 --> 00:57:56,442
because it's not how you feel about her...

1204
00:57:56,478 --> 00:58:00,937
it's how she makes you feel about yourself.

1205
00:58:03,418 --> 00:58:05,351
That makes a lot of sense.

1206
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:07,580
All that other stuff was ridiculous...

1207
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,053
but that made a lot of sense.

1208
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:14,890
Ah, well, look who we have here. The precious angel.

1209
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:17,361
Hi, Rosie.

1210
00:58:17,396 --> 00:58:19,192
How are the lessons going?

1211
00:58:19,232 --> 00:58:21,756
Well, I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.

1212
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:25,167
Yeah, she's starting to scare less and less people when she sings.

1213
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:28,137
Oh, Robbie, you're so funny.

1214
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:30,037
You two talk.

1215
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:33,168
I'm going to do some more military presses.

1216
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:36,407
OK. Everything all right?

1217
00:58:36,447 --> 00:58:38,311
Yeah. Actually, um...

1218
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,179
I came by to ask you something though.

1219
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:41,444
Yeah? What's up?

1220
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:42,678
Um...

1221
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:49,015
Would you like to go out on a date with Holly?

1222
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:55,293
Oh, yeah? You want me to go out on a date with Holly?

1223
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,524
Yeah.

1224
00:58:57,566 --> 00:59:01,001
It'll be a double date. Glenn and I are going to go, too.

1225
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:02,730
Oh, yeah?

1226
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:05,801
Oh, yeah, Holly's nice.

1227
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,466
Yeah.

1228
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:12,475
And she's single, and you're single.

1229
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:14,840
Yeah.

1230
00:59:16,449 --> 00:59:18,712
Come on, it'll be fun.

1231
00:59:18,752 --> 00:59:21,686
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

1232
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:31,922
# How does it feel #

1233
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:35,625
# To treat me like you do? #

1234
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:38,863
# You place your hands upon me #

1235
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:42,269
# And told me who you are #

1236
00:59:42,873 --> 00:59:46,364
# I thought I was mistaken #

1237
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,071
# I thought I heard your words... #

1238
00:59:49,813 --> 00:59:52,303
Robbie, you look so cute tonight.

1239
00:59:52,348 --> 00:59:54,747
Thank you.

1240
00:59:54,784 --> 00:59:57,616
I like these rubber bracelets. You look like Madonna.

1241
00:59:57,653 --> 00:59:59,950
Yeah, well, that's the idea.

1242
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,790
Here you go.

1243
01:00:06,828 --> 01:00:09,523
So, Robbie, how's your business going?

1244
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:13,158
I'm actually working on a game plan right now.

1245
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,292
You should look into the bond market.

1246
01:00:15,336 --> 01:00:16,495
That's where the money is.

1247
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:17,594
Glenn's in junk bonds.

1248
01:00:17,638 --> 01:00:20,663
No, Jules, it's high-yield bonds.

1249
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:22,833
Do I tell people you're in junk waitressing?

1250
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,842
Uhh.

1251
01:00:24,877 --> 01:00:28,141
My grandmother gave me a savings bond when I was a kid.

1252
01:00:28,181 --> 01:00:33,311
I get $25 in 1993, so that'll be good.

1253
01:00:33,352 --> 01:00:34,613
Whoa.

1254
01:00:35,287 --> 01:00:38,153
So we totally look like a couple.

1255
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:39,850
I mean, don't you think we look great together?

1256
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,083
Yeah.

1257
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:44,719
David Bowie playing. He's the best.

1258
01:00:44,762 --> 01:00:46,422
You know, I think he's coming to town in September.

1259
01:00:46,464 --> 01:00:49,159
I love David Bowie.

1260
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,429
# When I get excited #

1261
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:55,562
# My little China girl #

1262
01:00:55,605 --> 01:00:56,730
# She says #

1263
01:00:56,773 --> 01:01:00,936
# Oh, baby, just you shut your mouth #

1264
01:01:00,976 --> 01:01:03,603
Shut your mouth. All right.

1265
01:01:03,646 --> 01:01:05,442
We all know the words.

1266
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:08,415
God, I love David Bowie. He is so sexy.

1267
01:01:08,449 --> 01:01:10,939
You think the "time to make the donuts" guy is sexy.

1268
01:01:10,985 --> 01:01:13,544
That guy is funny.

1269
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:16,215
You know who else I think is sexy?

1270
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:19,123
Robbie Hart.

1271
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:22,284
Mmm, that's good. Thank you very much.

1272
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:23,590
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1273
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,565
Excuse us, guys. We'll be right back. It's OK.

1274
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:31,526
She'll feel better once she yaks.

1275
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:34,094
I hope so.

1276
01:01:43,615 --> 01:01:45,946
So, uh...

1277
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:47,882
Sunday's the big day, huh?

1278
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:49,384
I don't even know your last name.

1279
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,716
It's Gulia.

1280
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:52,618
Gulia.

1281
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:56,156
Julia's last name's gonna be Gulia.

1282
01:01:56,192 --> 01:01:58,250
Julia Gulia. That's funny.

1283
01:01:58,294 --> 01:02:00,193
Why is that funny?

1284
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:02,888
I don't know.

1285
01:02:02,932 --> 01:02:04,626
# Shhhhh #

1286
01:02:07,969 --> 01:02:09,265
# She says #

1287
01:02:09,304 --> 01:02:10,770
Are you excited?

1288
01:02:12,874 --> 01:02:15,137
Yeah. She's paid her dues, been with me four years.

1289
01:02:15,176 --> 01:02:17,166
I owe it to her to get married.

1290
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:19,735
You had the Long Island iced tea.

1291
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:24,739
Plus, you know, you probably, uh, you want to get married.

1292
01:02:26,486 --> 01:02:28,385
I don't want to break up.

1293
01:02:28,421 --> 01:02:29,978
Plus she was with me before I made my money...

1294
01:02:30,023 --> 01:02:32,354
so I know I can trust her.

1295
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:41,827
That is a luscious ass right there, isn't it?

1296
01:02:41,867 --> 01:02:43,333
Mmm. My God.

1297
01:02:45,336 --> 01:02:47,599
That's grade-A, top-choice meat.

1298
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:50,697
Like to bite right through that thing. Rrr.

1299
01:02:50,742 --> 01:02:52,368
You know, chew on it.

1300
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:54,433
But we can't get chicks like that anymore, you know?

1301
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:55,774
We're too old.

1302
01:02:55,812 --> 01:02:57,642
Speak for yourself. I'm not too old.

1303
01:02:57,681 --> 01:02:59,011
I can still get chicks like that.

1304
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:01,448
Not that hot, though, right?

1305
01:03:02,518 --> 01:03:03,506
I've gotten hotter.

1306
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,009
Ten years ago.

1307
01:03:07,323 --> 01:03:09,790
Try ten days ago.

1308
01:03:09,825 --> 01:03:11,917
Really?

1309
01:03:13,228 --> 01:03:14,285
As hot as that?

1310
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:18,321
Hotter... and younger.

1311
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,896
How do you do it, man?

1312
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:23,868
I mean, how do you do it without getting caught?

1313
01:03:26,273 --> 01:03:28,604
Julia is totally preoccupied with the wedding.

1314
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:30,131
I mean, she doesn't know what's going on.

1315
01:03:30,176 --> 01:03:32,507
Oh, man.

1316
01:03:32,545 --> 01:03:34,603
You know what sucks, though?

1317
01:03:34,647 --> 01:03:36,705
Once you get married, the party's over, right?

1318
01:03:36,749 --> 01:03:38,238
I mean...

1319
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:39,773
I work in the city, man.

1320
01:03:40,986 --> 01:03:42,748
And I work long hours.

1321
01:03:42,788 --> 01:03:45,813
Yeah, that's something.

1322
01:03:47,826 --> 01:03:50,555
Hey, guys. Julia's feeling a little under the weather.

1323
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:52,151
Told you she was gonna yak.

1324
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:54,527
Yeah, you called it.

1325
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:57,032
Why don't you go get your car and meet us out front?

1326
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,436
Oh, God. I forgot my purse.

1327
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:07,537
Here. Do me a favor and put her in the car with Glenn, OK?

1328
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,703
- OK, no problem. - It's OK. It's OK.

1329
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,138
I puked.

1330
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,674
OK. Don't worry.

1331
01:04:17,718 --> 01:04:19,582
I vomited in my hair.

1332
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,677
All right.

1333
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:23,484
Does my hair smell bad?

1334
01:04:25,426 --> 01:04:27,985
# Love my way... #

1335
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:29,892
No, it smells good, actually.

1336
01:04:31,898 --> 01:04:33,125
Just feel better, all right?

1337
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:35,963
# I fall low #

1338
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:37,662
# When my mind goes there #

1339
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:42,203
Hi, Glenn.

1340
01:04:44,577 --> 01:04:45,565
OK.

1341
01:04:46,644 --> 01:04:48,406
Don't puke in the car, all right?

1342
01:04:50,048 --> 01:04:51,344
It'll stink for a week.

1343
01:04:53,718 --> 01:04:56,481
- Bye, Robbie. - Bye, Julia.

1344
01:04:58,422 --> 01:05:01,652
# I fall low #

1345
01:05:01,692 --> 01:05:05,491
# When my mind goes #

1346
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:09,155
# Love my way #

1347
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:10,822
# It's a new... #

1348
01:05:17,138 --> 01:05:18,900
Holly, what do you think of this Glenn guy?

1349
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,634
Do you think he's trustworthy?

1350
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:23,837
- Yeah, he better be. - Yeah.

1351
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:25,072
Who cares about Glenn?

1352
01:05:26,914 --> 01:05:28,346
You know what I keep thinking about?

1353
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:29,712
What?

1354
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:33,014
That soft kiss from the other day.

1355
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,119
It looked... really nice.

1356
01:05:36,155 --> 01:05:38,748
Oh, yeah.

1357
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:40,314
Did it feel good?

1358
01:05:42,896 --> 01:05:45,159
I don't know. I don't...

1359
01:05:45,197 --> 01:05:46,458
I don't remember.

1360
01:05:46,498 --> 01:05:49,261
Could I refresh your memory?

1361
01:05:59,243 --> 01:06:00,231
Mmm.

1362
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:02,702
Yummy.

1363
01:06:06,182 --> 01:06:09,309
So, you know Julia's staying at Glenn's tonight.

1364
01:06:11,087 --> 01:06:12,144
Oh.

1365
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:14,916
Look, Robbie, I know...

1366
01:06:14,957 --> 01:06:16,856
that you're shy, and...

1367
01:06:16,892 --> 01:06:19,860
I know that you've been hurt, so...

1368
01:06:19,895 --> 01:06:23,057
I'm gonna make this really easy on you.

1369
01:06:24,165 --> 01:06:26,462
If you come upstairs...

1370
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:27,865
you're gonna get laid.

1371
01:06:27,902 --> 01:06:29,801
Wow.

1372
01:06:30,972 --> 01:06:35,635
Nobody's ever said that to me before. Um...

1373
01:06:35,676 --> 01:06:37,540
I just... I'm telling you...

1374
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:39,477
my head's kind of a mess right now.

1375
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,041
Julia's staying at Glenn's tonight, huh?

1376
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,344
Yeah.

1377
01:06:45,384 --> 01:06:47,943
Does she stay over there a lot?

1378
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:49,248
Yeah.

1379
01:06:49,288 --> 01:06:50,584
Really?

1380
01:06:54,092 --> 01:06:56,286
Oh, my God.

1381
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:57,419
What?

1382
01:06:57,462 --> 01:07:00,521
I can't believe I never noticed it before.

1383
01:07:00,564 --> 01:07:02,224
What?

1384
01:07:04,501 --> 01:07:06,434
You've got a thing for Julia.

1385
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:09,063
Oh, no, I don't. I don't. I...

1386
01:07:09,106 --> 01:07:12,302
I think she's a very nice girl, but she's marrying that jerk-off.

1387
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:16,072
Hey. I mean, you know why she's marrying him, don't you?

1388
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:21,575
The money thing?

1389
01:07:21,617 --> 01:07:24,176
Security? A nice house?

1390
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:26,448
Uh, I guess that's important to some people.

1391
01:07:26,488 --> 01:07:28,682
No, it's...

1392
01:07:28,723 --> 01:07:32,419
it's not important to some people, Robbie.

1393
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,086
It's important to all people.

1394
01:07:34,128 --> 01:07:37,995
Really? Well, then I guess I'm in big trouble.

1395
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:40,225
Hey. Morning, sunshine.

1396
01:07:43,169 --> 01:07:46,968
Oh, I have a bad headache, a really bad headache.

1397
01:07:47,007 --> 01:07:49,099
Can I cook you some breakfast?

1398
01:07:50,576 --> 01:07:52,372
# I was walkin'... #

1399
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:54,878
How was your bottle of rum last night?

1400
01:07:54,913 --> 01:07:58,109
# Just a-Iookin' for someone to meet... #

1401
01:07:58,149 --> 01:07:59,706
I didn't vomit on you, did I?

1402
01:08:01,386 --> 01:08:03,580
A little on my shoe, but...

1403
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,815
luckily, I was wearing your shoes.

1404
01:08:05,857 --> 01:08:07,380
Good.

1405
01:08:07,424 --> 01:08:09,550
# I was hopin', hopin'... #

1406
01:08:09,593 --> 01:08:12,652
So, did anything happen with Robbie last night?

1407
01:08:12,696 --> 01:08:14,356
# Wonderin' #

1408
01:08:14,398 --> 01:08:15,887
# If you'd stay for the night... #

1409
01:08:15,932 --> 01:08:16,955
A kiss.

1410
01:08:16,999 --> 01:08:18,989
# I don't wanna be Ionely... #

1411
01:08:19,035 --> 01:08:21,002
Who kissed who? Did you kiss him, or did he kiss you?

1412
01:08:21,037 --> 01:08:24,437
- I kissed him. - And then what?

1413
01:08:24,473 --> 01:08:25,939
Nothing.

1414
01:08:25,974 --> 01:08:28,567
# Do you believe in love... #

1415
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:32,705
I'll tell you, he sure doesn't think much of Glenn, though.

1416
01:08:32,747 --> 01:08:34,941
Really? What did he say?

1417
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:37,212
That Glenn's a jerk-off.

1418
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:40,981
# You're makin' me believe it, too... #

1419
01:08:41,021 --> 01:08:42,988
Why would he say that?

1420
01:08:43,023 --> 01:08:45,718
I mean, who knows? Maybe... maybe he was jealous.

1421
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:49,989
Don't worry. I mean, I told him why you were marrying him.

1422
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:52,553
Why did you tell him I was marrying him?

1423
01:08:52,598 --> 01:08:54,758
Because you love him.

1424
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,031
And, you know, because...

1425
01:08:59,071 --> 01:09:01,732
because with Glenn, you'll have security.

1426
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:04,831
But that's not why I'm marrying him.

1427
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:08,806
Then why are you?

1428
01:09:11,716 --> 01:09:14,411
# I don't wanna be Ionely, baby #

1429
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,080
# Please help me #

1430
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,450
# I wanna love you all over #

1431
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:22,957
# Do you believe in love? #

1432
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,855
# Do you believe in love... #

1433
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:27,224
Hi, Rosie. How are you?

1434
01:09:27,262 --> 01:09:28,455
Oh, fine, dear.

1435
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,964
Is Robbie here? I came by to give him something.

1436
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:34,091
Oh, no, Julia. I'm afraid he's not.

1437
01:09:34,168 --> 01:09:35,395
Yeah, but it's Thursday.

1438
01:09:35,436 --> 01:09:37,198
You guys have your singing lessons today.

1439
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:38,898
Not anymore.

1440
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,203
Now that he's gone to the city to get a real job...

1441
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:43,801
he doesn't have time to give me lessons.

1442
01:09:43,954 --> 01:09:46,285
Why do you think you'd be a good hire for this bank?

1443
01:09:46,323 --> 01:09:48,051
Well, I'm ready to work hard...

1444
01:09:48,091 --> 01:09:50,888
and when I put my mind to something, I go all the way.

1445
01:09:50,927 --> 01:09:52,359
I'll go all the way for you, sir.

1446
01:09:53,662 --> 01:09:54,958
Do you have any experience?

1447
01:09:54,997 --> 01:09:58,659
No, sir, I have no experience, but I'm a big fan of money.

1448
01:09:58,701 --> 01:10:01,760
I like it. I use it. I have a little.

1449
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:04,327
I keep it in a jar on top of my refrigerator.

1450
01:10:04,372 --> 01:10:05,929
I'd like to put more in that jar.

1451
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:07,702
That's where you come in.

1452
01:10:09,277 --> 01:10:11,107
He wants to make money.

1453
01:10:11,144 --> 01:10:14,670
You know, live in a nice house...

1454
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,615
with wide windows and lamps.

1455
01:10:17,651 --> 01:10:21,017
You can't expect him to live forever with his sister...

1456
01:10:21,053 --> 01:10:24,215
and the nipple-twisting that goes on there.

1457
01:10:24,256 --> 01:10:25,779
Well, I thank you for your time.

1458
01:10:25,825 --> 01:10:28,759
Actually, sir, I really need this job to impress a girl.

1459
01:10:28,794 --> 01:10:30,556
Will you leave now, please?

1460
01:10:30,595 --> 01:10:32,289
You don't even have to give me the job.

1461
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:34,354
If you could just give me some business cards with my name on it...

1462
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:35,626
I think that might help.

1463
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:38,260
OK, well, I'm gonna try and go look for him, OK?

1464
01:10:38,303 --> 01:10:40,361
Tell him I'll give him a raise.

1465
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:42,894
Three meatballs a lesson.

1466
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:45,304
How about this? I'll give you ten singing lessons...

1467
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:47,036
for one business card. Please.

1468
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:49,067
Thank you very much.

1469
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:04,147
# The best things in life are free #

1470
01:11:04,192 --> 01:11:06,989
# But you can give them to the birds and bees #

1471
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,996
# I want money #

1472
01:11:10,164 --> 01:11:12,688
# That's what I want #

1473
01:11:12,733 --> 01:11:15,030
Hey, Julia. What are you doing here?

1474
01:11:15,069 --> 01:11:18,037
I went by Rosie's to find you.

1475
01:11:18,071 --> 01:11:21,335
Oh? I'm not doing that anymore.

1476
01:11:21,374 --> 01:11:22,863
I know. I just thought that teaching...

1477
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:25,638
was such a big part of your life.

1478
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,272
Well, it was, but now I'm doing some stuff...

1479
01:11:28,313 --> 01:11:30,303
to better my situation.

1480
01:11:30,949 --> 01:11:32,506
That sounds kind of selfish.

1481
01:11:33,852 --> 01:11:35,284
It's not selfish.

1482
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,651
There's a lot of money out there. I'm trying to get my hands on some.

1483
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:40,384
Yeah, but you don't want to be just another yuppie idiot.

1484
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:41,721
Why? What's wrong with that?

1485
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:44,352
Don't want to live in my sister's basement anymore.

1486
01:11:44,395 --> 01:11:47,192
I want to get a big house, have some security.

1487
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:50,558
Can't do that doing favors for people all the time...

1488
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,260
getting paid in meatballs.

1489
01:11:52,302 --> 01:11:54,394
But you're above all that material bullshit.

1490
01:11:54,438 --> 01:11:57,133
I don't know. We're living in a material world...

1491
01:11:57,173 --> 01:12:00,266
and I am a material girl. Or boy.

1492
01:12:01,277 --> 01:12:02,504
No, you're not.

1493
01:12:02,545 --> 01:12:04,739
What about you? You're into material shit.

1494
01:12:06,147 --> 01:12:07,340
What do you mean?

1495
01:12:07,382 --> 01:12:09,906
What do I mean? You're marrying Glenn 'cause he's got money.

1496
01:12:18,525 --> 01:12:20,253
You asshole.

1497
01:12:32,271 --> 01:12:35,762
Oh, my God. She made me a present.

1498
01:12:35,807 --> 01:12:37,831
I am an asshole!

1499
01:12:40,378 --> 01:12:42,504
You're going to the mental institution.

1500
01:12:42,547 --> 01:12:43,774
Beat it!

1501
01:12:53,757 --> 01:12:54,780
# Go #

1502
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:00,622
# How about it? #

1503
01:13:05,067 --> 01:13:07,296
# Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack... #

1504
01:13:07,336 --> 01:13:08,768
Rudy.

1505
01:13:08,804 --> 01:13:09,827
Same?

1506
01:13:09,872 --> 01:13:12,840
Give me the same, please.

1507
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:15,364
# Like a river that don't know where it's flowin'... #

1508
01:13:15,409 --> 01:13:17,103
- What's up? - There he is.

1509
01:13:17,145 --> 01:13:18,668
- You all right? - Mm-hmm.

1510
01:13:18,713 --> 01:13:22,648
You know something? You were right. You've always been right.

1511
01:13:22,682 --> 01:13:25,081
What have I been so right about?

1512
01:13:25,118 --> 01:13:28,951
Women. You just have fun with them.

1513
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:31,354
You get emotionally involved, and they end up, they...

1514
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,651
What do they do to you?

1515
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,620
They rip your heart out of your ass.

1516
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,289
That's right.

1517
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:41,958
Did, uh, something happen with Julia?

1518
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,162
I went on that double date, right?

1519
01:13:45,203 --> 01:13:47,500
And the moron she's gonna marry...

1520
01:13:47,539 --> 01:13:50,336
actually tells me he cheats on her.

1521
01:13:50,374 --> 01:13:52,432
But can I tell her?

1522
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:54,966
No. I mean, who am I to break up her marriage?

1523
01:13:55,012 --> 01:13:57,809
You need a prostitute.

1524
01:14:02,752 --> 01:14:05,049
Anyways...

1525
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:06,348
I'm confused.

1526
01:14:06,389 --> 01:14:08,549
Well, because you like her.

1527
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:13,792
I think I'm in love with her.

1528
01:14:15,764 --> 01:14:18,493
But I gotta get that out of my head, you know?

1529
01:14:21,735 --> 01:14:24,225
From now on, I'm just... I'm gonna be like you, man.

1530
01:14:24,271 --> 01:14:26,465
I'm just gonna be with a different chick every night...

1531
01:14:26,507 --> 01:14:28,167
and then I'll send them packin'.

1532
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:30,835
Sounds like you got it all figured out.

1533
01:14:30,877 --> 01:14:34,676
I mean, I'm gonna have to give them cab money to go home...

1534
01:14:34,714 --> 01:14:37,739
because I'll feel bad if I don't, but after that, it's bye-bye, birdie.

1535
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:39,511
Bye-bye.

1536
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:42,018
That's it, man, starting right now.

1537
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:44,112
Me and you are gonna be free and happy...

1538
01:14:44,156 --> 01:14:45,520
the rest of our lives.

1539
01:14:45,557 --> 01:14:48,753
# Love my way #

1540
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:50,692
# It's a new road #

1541
01:14:50,728 --> 01:14:53,719
I'm not happy. I'm miserable.

1542
01:14:53,764 --> 01:14:55,560
Wha-What?

1543
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,898
See, I grew up idolizing guys...

1544
01:14:58,935 --> 01:15:01,266
like Fonzie and Vinnie Barbarino...

1545
01:15:01,304 --> 01:15:02,770
'cause they got a lot of chicks.

1546
01:15:02,806 --> 01:15:05,774
You know what happened to Fonzie and Vinnie Barbarino?

1547
01:15:05,809 --> 01:15:09,335
Yeah. I read that Fonzie wants to be a director...

1548
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:12,676
and Barbarino, I think, the mechanical bull movie.

1549
01:15:12,715 --> 01:15:14,181
I didn't see it yet.

1550
01:15:14,216 --> 01:15:17,446
Their shows got canceled...

1551
01:15:17,485 --> 01:15:20,282
'cause no one wants to see a fifty-year-old guy...

1552
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:21,719
hitting on chicks.

1553
01:15:23,191 --> 01:15:24,521
Then, what are you saying?

1554
01:15:24,559 --> 01:15:27,322
What I'm saying is, all I really want...

1555
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:29,760
is someone to hold me...

1556
01:15:29,796 --> 01:15:34,425
and tell me that everything is gonna be all right.

1557
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:38,732
Everything is gonna be all right.

1558
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:41,796
# I fall low... #

1559
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:44,536
If you found someone you can love...

1560
01:15:44,576 --> 01:15:46,736
you can't let her get away.

1561
01:15:46,778 --> 01:15:48,540
# Love my way... #

1562
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:51,810
You're right, man. Thank you, Sammy.

1563
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,714
Don't tell anyone what I said.

1564
01:15:57,421 --> 01:15:59,388
- Mom. - Uh-huh?

1565
01:15:59,423 --> 01:16:02,186
Do you really like Glenn?

1566
01:16:02,226 --> 01:16:05,626
Oh, sure, honey. What's not to like?

1567
01:16:05,662 --> 01:16:07,629
He's rich, he's charming, he's handsome...

1568
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:11,030
and now he's really got it all 'cause he's got you.

1569
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,561
Honey, what's the matter?

1570
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,633
I don't know if I'm in love with him anymore.

1571
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:22,973
Why?

1572
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:24,943
What happened?

1573
01:16:28,616 --> 01:16:31,982
I just don't know if he's the right guy for me.

1574
01:16:33,787 --> 01:16:36,016
And I've been spending a lot of time...

1575
01:16:36,056 --> 01:16:39,183
with this other man, Robbie Hart.

1576
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:42,523
Ha. The wedding singer?

1577
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:45,461
You're thinking of leaving Glenn for the wedding singer?

1578
01:16:46,865 --> 01:16:49,025
I don't know what I'm thinking.

1579
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:50,329
I'm confused.

1580
01:16:50,369 --> 01:16:52,734
Oh, I know, sweetie.

1581
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:55,260
You've got what is known as the jitters...

1582
01:16:55,306 --> 01:16:57,170
cold feet. Everybody has 'em.

1583
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:59,437
I had 'em.

1584
01:16:59,477 --> 01:17:01,273
Course, I should have run screaming down the street...

1585
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,538
instead of marrying your father...

1586
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:05,547
but Glenn, he's different. He's a keeper.

1587
01:17:07,684 --> 01:17:10,914
You're gonna marry Glenn on Sunday.

1588
01:17:10,953 --> 01:17:12,317
You're gonna love him...

1589
01:17:12,355 --> 01:17:14,322
and everything's gonna be wonderful.

1590
01:17:18,027 --> 01:17:20,426
Where's your veil? Oh, it's downstairs.

1591
01:17:20,462 --> 01:17:21,792
I'll go get it.

1592
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,919
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1593
01:17:50,956 --> 01:17:52,684
I'm Mrs. Glenn Gulia.

1594
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,385
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

1595
01:17:57,429 --> 01:17:59,794
I'm Julia Gulia.

1596
01:18:01,365 --> 01:18:03,924
Julia Gulia.

1597
01:18:03,968 --> 01:18:05,992
Right when I wake up in the morning...

1598
01:18:06,037 --> 01:18:08,231
you're the first person that pops in my head...

1599
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:11,068
and I keep thinking about you over and over.

1600
01:18:11,107 --> 01:18:12,801
It's nice to meet you.

1601
01:18:12,842 --> 01:18:15,309
I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia.

1602
01:18:24,019 --> 01:18:25,508
Hi.

1603
01:18:25,554 --> 01:18:28,078
I'm pleased to meet you.

1604
01:18:28,122 --> 01:18:29,850
I'm Mrs. Robbie Hart.

1605
01:18:31,325 --> 01:18:34,122
Robbie and I are so pleased you could come to our wedding.

1606
01:18:57,248 --> 01:18:58,976
# Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki, shut up #

1607
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:00,813
# Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki #

1608
01:19:00,852 --> 01:19:03,149
# Three words to the whack, step yourself back #

1609
01:19:03,188 --> 01:19:05,121
# You're gettin' down and then you're givin' no slack #

1610
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,247
# Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs #

1611
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,315
# You're throwin' down with the radical sacks #

1612
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:11,622
Yeah. Word.

1613
01:19:11,662 --> 01:19:13,185
Pretty good, eh?

1614
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:14,958
# You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down #

1615
01:19:14,997 --> 01:19:16,122
What happened?

1616
01:19:16,165 --> 01:19:18,496
She just looked way too happy.

1617
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:19,966
I couldn't do it.

1618
01:19:20,002 --> 01:19:22,902
I'm sorry, man.

1619
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:25,634
Hey, Rudy. Get Robbie a double.

1620
01:19:25,674 --> 01:19:28,141
Actually, Rudy, don't even worry about it.

1621
01:19:28,176 --> 01:19:29,472
I brought my own.

1622
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:31,603
You can't drink that in here, Robbie.

1623
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:35,479
All right. I'll finish up in the alley.

1624
01:19:35,516 --> 01:19:36,914
Are you guys coming?

1625
01:19:46,326 --> 01:19:49,351
Hey. It's the wedding singer.

1626
01:19:49,395 --> 01:19:50,725
Hey, Glenn. What's up?

1627
01:19:50,763 --> 01:19:54,391
Hey, Robbie, I heard you couldn't close the deal with Holly.

1628
01:19:54,433 --> 01:19:56,332
Yeah. What's the matter with that? You're not...

1629
01:19:56,368 --> 01:19:57,959
You like women, right?

1630
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:00,200
Not as much as you do, I guess.

1631
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,036
Listen, we're gonna have a little pre-bachelor party party.

1632
01:20:03,074 --> 01:20:05,303
You want to come in and have a beer?

1633
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:06,468
You're ridiculous, man.

1634
01:20:07,979 --> 01:20:10,913
Stop all this cheating shit, moron.

1635
01:20:10,948 --> 01:20:12,005
She's a good girl.

1636
01:20:12,048 --> 01:20:13,639
Hey, asswipe...

1637
01:20:15,318 --> 01:20:16,978
don't go snitchin' to Julia about this.

1638
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,510
I know you got some little crush on her...

1639
01:20:19,556 --> 01:20:21,750
but you gotta face the facts.

1640
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,757
She'd rather go to bed with a real man...

1641
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:25,452
not some poor singing orphan.

1642
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,796
All right, shithead.

1643
01:20:29,832 --> 01:20:32,561
I haven't been in a fight since I was in the fifth grade...

1644
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,931
but I beat the shit out of that kid...

1645
01:20:34,969 --> 01:20:36,697
so now I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.

1646
01:20:38,339 --> 01:20:40,397
OK, what are you doing, man?

1647
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,430
I'm sorry.

1648
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:44,568
I used to be much stronger.

1649
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:47,206
You're dead, buddy.

1650
01:20:47,247 --> 01:20:50,340
Yeah! Yeah!

1651
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,680
Hey.

1652
01:20:52,718 --> 01:20:54,150
Why don't you write a song about this?

1653
01:20:54,187 --> 01:20:55,676
You can call it, uh...

1654
01:20:55,721 --> 01:20:58,382
I Got Punched in the Nose...

1655
01:20:58,424 --> 01:21:00,891
For Stickin' my Face in Other People's Business.

1656
01:21:06,364 --> 01:21:07,295
Way to go.

1657
01:21:07,332 --> 01:21:09,959
Sounds like a country song.

1658
01:21:19,278 --> 01:21:20,608
Hi, Robbie.

1659
01:21:25,151 --> 01:21:27,948
Kiss my grits.

1660
01:21:29,554 --> 01:21:32,113
# I am the son #

1661
01:21:32,157 --> 01:21:34,090
# And the heir... #

1662
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:36,024
I can see that you're drunk...

1663
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:38,858
and that's OK.

1664
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:41,022
I'm still gonna tell you this.

1665
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:43,589
I really miss you, and I want to come back.

1666
01:21:45,269 --> 01:21:47,361
I don't wanna be alone anymore.

1667
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,336
No.

1668
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:51,635
You're not alone anymore.

1669
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:53,470
Linda's back.

1670
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:39,678
Can I help you?

1671
01:22:42,186 --> 01:22:44,380
Is Robbie here?

1672
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:48,213
I'm afraid he's, uh, indisposed.

1673
01:22:52,062 --> 01:22:53,153
Shower.

1674
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,190
You must be Linda.

1675
01:22:59,235 --> 01:23:01,293
Yeah, that's me...

1676
01:23:01,337 --> 01:23:02,701
Robbie's fiance.

1677
01:23:02,738 --> 01:23:04,705
Who are you?

1678
01:23:04,739 --> 01:23:06,000
I'm Julia Sullivan.

1679
01:23:07,676 --> 01:23:10,371
Would you tell him that I came by to see him?

1680
01:23:10,412 --> 01:23:12,743
Oh, yeah, surely will, Jennifer.

1681
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,178
It's Julia.

1682
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:34,358
Wake up, sleepy head.

1683
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:37,265
This is the first day of our new life together.

1684
01:23:39,705 --> 01:23:40,762
# Wake me up #

1685
01:23:40,806 --> 01:23:42,830
# Before you go-go #

1686
01:23:42,873 --> 01:23:46,808
# Don't leave me hanging on like a solo #

1687
01:23:52,282 --> 01:23:55,148
- Linda? - Hi.

1688
01:23:58,154 --> 01:23:59,381
What are you doing here?

1689
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:04,920
Well, you passed out, so I took care of you.

1690
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,427
What? Why'd you take care of me?

1691
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:12,223
I told you last night, Robbie, I realized I was wrong...

1692
01:24:12,266 --> 01:24:14,631
and I want to take care of you for good.

1693
01:24:14,669 --> 01:24:17,159
I can learn to deal with the fact that you're just a wedding singer...

1694
01:24:17,205 --> 01:24:18,933
and not a rock star. I could even learn to deal...

1695
01:24:18,973 --> 01:24:20,769
You can learn to deal with that?

1696
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:23,775
I don't want you to learn to deal with that.

1697
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:25,936
That's not how it works.

1698
01:24:25,979 --> 01:24:27,002
Jeez!

1699
01:24:27,047 --> 01:24:30,015
Well, Robbie...

1700
01:24:30,049 --> 01:24:32,608
maybe we should talk about this when you're feeling better.

1701
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:36,814
Hey, psycho, I'm not gonna feel better about this.

1702
01:24:36,856 --> 01:24:38,618
It's over.

1703
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:41,021
Now please get out of my Van Halen T-shirt...

1704
01:24:41,059 --> 01:24:43,322
before you jinx the band and they break up.

1705
01:24:46,197 --> 01:24:47,993
Oh, OK.

1706
01:24:48,031 --> 01:24:50,328
So you're still pissed about that wedding thing.

1707
01:25:01,677 --> 01:25:03,473
Glenn.

1708
01:25:03,513 --> 01:25:05,173
Glenn, good morning.

1709
01:25:05,214 --> 01:25:07,010
Hi. Good morning.

1710
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:09,481
Good morning. Hello.

1711
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:11,644
Hey, baby.

1712
01:25:11,686 --> 01:25:13,710
You gonna make breakfast in bed?

1713
01:25:13,755 --> 01:25:15,415
Um, no.

1714
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:18,254
Actually, I've been doing some thinking, and...

1715
01:25:19,727 --> 01:25:21,853
I don't need a big wedding...

1716
01:25:21,896 --> 01:25:24,125
and I think that I've been really selfish...

1717
01:25:24,165 --> 01:25:27,656
in making you do something that you don't even want to do.

1718
01:25:30,103 --> 01:25:31,660
You wanna go to Vegas?

1719
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,836
Yeah.

1720
01:25:34,874 --> 01:25:37,740
Well, all right. Let's go.

1721
01:25:37,776 --> 01:25:39,675
Heh heh heh.

1722
01:25:39,845 --> 01:25:43,371
# There were bells #

1723
01:25:43,415 --> 01:25:46,440
# On a hill #

1724
01:25:46,484 --> 01:25:52,183
# But I never heard them ringing #

1725
01:25:52,223 --> 01:25:56,682
# No, I never heard them at all #

1726
01:25:56,726 --> 01:26:02,220
# 'Til there was you #

1727
01:26:02,265 --> 01:26:03,697
Aww.

1728
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:08,499
# And there was music #

1729
01:26:08,537 --> 01:26:13,667
# And there were wonderful roses #

1730
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:16,574
# They tell me #

1731
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:18,601
# In sweet #

1732
01:26:18,646 --> 01:26:22,240
# Fragrant meadows #

1733
01:26:22,283 --> 01:26:29,211
# Of dawn and dew #

1734
01:26:29,256 --> 01:26:31,883
# There was love #

1735
01:26:31,925 --> 01:26:32,948
# All around... #

1736
01:26:32,992 --> 01:26:36,825
Flight number 1156 is now ready for boarding.

1737
01:26:36,863 --> 01:26:38,386
We'd like to ask those passengers...

1738
01:26:38,431 --> 01:26:41,365
traveling with small children...

1739
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:46,462
# No, I never heard it at all #

1740
01:26:46,505 --> 01:26:48,529
# 'Til there was #

1741
01:26:48,573 --> 01:26:53,339
# You #

1742
01:26:53,377 --> 01:26:55,241
I just always envisioned the right one...

1743
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:57,508
being someone I could grow old with.

1744
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:06,747
I know. I'll go get the car.

1745
01:27:08,191 --> 01:27:10,715
Rosie, congratulations.

1746
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,090
I gotta go take care of something, OK?

1747
01:27:12,127 --> 01:27:14,788
I know you do. Go get her.

1748
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:15,887
All right. All right.

1749
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:18,398
- Robbie, I need to talk to you. - I can't talk right now.

1750
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:19,831
Are you back with Linda?

1751
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:21,630
No. Why? Who said that?

1752
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:23,966
Julia. She went to your house...

1753
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,029
to tell you she was falling for you...

1754
01:27:26,073 --> 01:27:28,131
and Linda answered the door in her underwear.

1755
01:27:28,175 --> 01:27:29,573
She was so upset...

1756
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,440
she and Glenn just jumped a plane to Vegas.

1757
01:27:31,478 --> 01:27:33,604
What do you mean? They're getting married tomorrow.

1758
01:27:33,647 --> 01:27:35,944
Well, apparently, that wasn't soon enough.

1759
01:27:38,118 --> 01:27:39,243
# I said, hip, hop #

1760
01:27:39,286 --> 01:27:40,775
# A-hippie to the hippie to the hip, hip, hop #

1761
01:27:40,819 --> 01:27:43,514
# You don't stop rockin' to the bang, bang boogie #

1762
01:27:43,556 --> 01:27:44,783
# Say, up comes the boogie #

1763
01:27:44,823 --> 01:27:46,255
# To the rhythm of the boogie that beats #

1764
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:48,316
We're now ready for our general boarding.

1765
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,054
That's it, sweetie. Ready to go?

1766
01:27:50,094 --> 01:27:51,151
Yeah.

1767
01:27:52,163 --> 01:27:55,757
This is a great idea. I'm glad you came around.

1768
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,289
You want to do some gambling and have some fun right away...

1769
01:27:57,335 --> 01:27:58,528
or you just want to get married?

1770
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:00,434
I just want to get married.

1771
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:02,334
You're never going to find her.

1772
01:28:02,372 --> 01:28:04,566
There's got to be a million wedding chapels in Vegas.

1773
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,472
- Does anybody have a pen? - What for?

1774
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:08,306
I got a good idea for a song.

1775
01:28:08,344 --> 01:28:10,436
- Here. - Thank you.

1776
01:28:15,851 --> 01:28:17,078
Thank you.

1777
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:18,142
Hey, I'm sorry.

1778
01:28:18,186 --> 01:28:19,880
Can I help you?

1779
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:21,820
Yeah. I need a ticket for Las Vegas, please.

1780
01:28:23,792 --> 01:28:25,088
We only have one seat left...

1781
01:28:25,126 --> 01:28:26,854
and it's in our first-class section.

1782
01:28:26,895 --> 01:28:28,361
The next flight leaves in the morning.

1783
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:31,993
Can I borrow your credit card?

1784
01:28:32,032 --> 01:28:33,862
You're going to pay me back, right?

1785
01:28:33,901 --> 01:28:35,925
No, but if you don't give it to me...

1786
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:39,632
I'm going to tell everybody what you said at the bar.

1787
01:28:39,672 --> 01:28:40,831
Thanks.

1788
01:28:40,873 --> 01:28:43,033
Hey, that was really nice of you.

1789
01:28:43,076 --> 01:28:44,235
Thanks.

1790
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:46,244
Hey, do you like Flock of Seagulls?

1791
01:28:46,278 --> 01:28:48,541
I can see you do.

1792
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:50,046
- Wish me luck. - Go get her!

1793
01:29:00,024 --> 01:29:03,083
Hey, Glenn, do you mind if we switched seats...

1794
01:29:03,127 --> 01:29:04,491
and I sat in the window seat?

1795
01:29:05,528 --> 01:29:08,087
Mmm. I hate the aisle seat.

1796
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:10,860
Every time that drink cart comes by, it bangs me in the elbows.

1797
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:14,858
Your arms are smaller than mine, Jules.

1798
01:29:14,903 --> 01:29:19,066
I know. I just never saw the bright lights of Vegas before.

1799
01:29:20,876 --> 01:29:22,365
Tell you what.

1800
01:29:22,411 --> 01:29:25,004
How about I let you lean over me when we fly over the strip?

1801
01:29:25,046 --> 01:29:26,637
OK?

1802
01:29:33,554 --> 01:29:35,077
Thank you.

1803
01:29:36,323 --> 01:29:38,654
Hot towel?

1804
01:29:38,692 --> 01:29:39,851
Hot towel?

1805
01:29:39,893 --> 01:29:41,757
Thanks.

1806
01:29:49,168 --> 01:29:51,362
Ah.

1807
01:29:51,404 --> 01:29:52,734
Oh, my.

1808
01:29:52,772 --> 01:29:54,261
I'm sorry.

1809
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,466
I've never been on first class before.

1810
01:29:57,509 --> 01:29:59,874
My name is Joyce. Just buzz if you need anything.

1811
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:01,343
Thank you.

1812
01:30:01,379 --> 01:30:02,868
Here.

1813
01:30:02,913 --> 01:30:03,936
Thank you.

1814
01:30:07,017 --> 01:30:08,813
Sir?

1815
01:30:08,852 --> 01:30:10,250
Is that Billy Idol?

1816
01:30:12,022 --> 01:30:14,319
- I believe it is. - Oh, my God.

1817
01:30:14,357 --> 01:30:16,984
Would you like some champagne or some orange juice?

1818
01:30:17,026 --> 01:30:20,119
- How much is it? - It's free.

1819
01:30:20,163 --> 01:30:24,064
It's what? Holy shit, this is incredible.

1820
01:30:24,099 --> 01:30:26,862
Actually, I shouldn't drink. I fell in love with this girl...

1821
01:30:26,902 --> 01:30:28,562
and she's going to marry an idiot...

1822
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:30,627
so I'm on my way to Vegas to stop them.

1823
01:30:30,672 --> 01:30:34,107
That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

1824
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:35,505
Where are they getting married?

1825
01:30:35,543 --> 01:30:36,975
That's the problem... I don't know where...

1826
01:30:37,011 --> 01:30:38,341
but I'm going to run around and find them, you know?

1827
01:30:38,379 --> 01:30:39,845
I got to do what I got to do.

1828
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:50,486
Oh.

1829
01:30:50,522 --> 01:30:53,922
Next time they come by, grab me a Heineken, will you?

1830
01:31:00,364 --> 01:31:02,160
She comes over to tell me how she feels...

1831
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,190
and Linda answers the door...

1832
01:31:04,235 --> 01:31:06,702
wearing nothing but my Van Halen T-shirt.

1833
01:31:06,738 --> 01:31:08,329
No way.

1834
01:31:08,372 --> 01:31:09,736
I don't know what to do.

1835
01:31:09,773 --> 01:31:12,138
She's getting married, and he's going to ruin her life.

1836
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,438
Ah, Glenn doesn't deserve her.

1837
01:31:14,478 --> 01:31:16,536
All he cares about are possessions...

1838
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:20,481
fancy cars, CD players.

1839
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:23,040
Even women are possessions to him.

1840
01:31:23,085 --> 01:31:24,346
See? Billy Idol gets it.

1841
01:31:24,386 --> 01:31:26,148
I don't know why she doesn't get it.

1842
01:31:26,188 --> 01:31:27,449
Oh, I hope you find her.

1843
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,150
You guys will not believe this.

1844
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:31,248
Some creep in coach who thinks he's Don Johnson...

1845
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:34,021
just asked me to be part of the mile-high club.

1846
01:31:34,062 --> 01:31:37,656
He said I was grade-A, top-choice meat.

1847
01:31:43,737 --> 01:31:46,330
- Is he right in here? - Yeah.

1848
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:48,873
What's the mile-high club?

1849
01:31:59,117 --> 01:32:01,482
Oh, my God. The mile-high guy is Glenn.

1850
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,215
- They're on this plane. - No way!

1851
01:32:04,256 --> 01:32:05,313
You guys got to help me.

1852
01:32:05,357 --> 01:32:07,051
Right!

1853
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:08,682
Yeah!

1854
01:32:10,261 --> 01:32:12,353
Good afternoon, everyone.

1855
01:32:12,396 --> 01:32:14,363
We're flying at 26,000 feet...

1856
01:32:14,398 --> 01:32:16,160
moving up to 30,000 feet...

1857
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:19,531
and we got clear skies all the way to Las Vegas.

1858
01:32:19,569 --> 01:32:22,731
And right now, we're bringing you some in-flight entertainment.

1859
01:32:22,772 --> 01:32:24,739
One of our first-class passengers...

1860
01:32:24,774 --> 01:32:26,206
would like to sing you a song...

1861
01:32:26,241 --> 01:32:28,208
inspired by one of our coach passengers.

1862
01:32:28,243 --> 01:32:31,268
And since we let our first-class passengers...

1863
01:32:31,313 --> 01:32:33,610
do pretty much whatever they want...

1864
01:32:33,649 --> 01:32:34,876
here he is.

1865
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:40,517
# I wanna make you smile #

1866
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,954
# Whenever you're sad #

1867
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,217
# Carry you around #

1868
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:46,817
# When your arthritis is bad #

1869
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:49,555
# Oh, all I wanna do #

1870
01:32:49,596 --> 01:32:52,291
# Is grow old with you #

1871
01:32:55,267 --> 01:32:57,359
# I'll get you medicine #

1872
01:32:57,403 --> 01:33:00,929
# When your tummy aches #

1873
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:02,564
# Build you a fire #

1874
01:33:02,608 --> 01:33:04,632
# If the furnace breaks #

1875
01:33:04,676 --> 01:33:08,304
# Oh, it could be so nice #

1876
01:33:08,346 --> 01:33:10,939
# Growin' old with you #

1877
01:33:13,951 --> 01:33:16,043
# I'll miss you #

1878
01:33:16,086 --> 01:33:18,315
# Kiss you #

1879
01:33:18,355 --> 01:33:20,049
# Give you my coat #

1880
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:22,614
# When you are cold #

1881
01:33:22,659 --> 01:33:24,592
# Need you #

1882
01:33:24,627 --> 01:33:26,924
# Feed you #

1883
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:28,589
# Even let you hold #

1884
01:33:28,631 --> 01:33:30,621
# The remote control #

1885
01:33:34,469 --> 01:33:37,062
What the hell's that fruit doing here?

1886
01:33:41,509 --> 01:33:43,305
Get out... get out of the way!

1887
01:33:43,344 --> 01:33:45,277
Excuse me, sir. I have to serve the beverages.

1888
01:33:48,682 --> 01:33:49,705
Oh!

1889
01:33:52,652 --> 01:33:54,915
How you doing, sir? Chicken or fish?

1890
01:33:54,954 --> 01:33:56,853
You better get out of my way, Billy, or you're going to get hurt.

1891
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:58,049
Oh, yeah?

1892
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:01,617
Don't you talk to Billy Idol that way.

1893
01:34:03,128 --> 01:34:04,594
Uhh!

1894
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:06,597
# So let me clear the dishes #

1895
01:34:06,632 --> 01:34:09,759
# In our kitchen sink #

1896
01:34:09,801 --> 01:34:10,926
# Put you to bed #

1897
01:34:10,968 --> 01:34:13,128
# When you've had too much to drink #

1898
01:34:13,170 --> 01:34:14,500
# Oh #

1899
01:34:15,606 --> 01:34:18,130
# I could be the man #

1900
01:34:18,175 --> 01:34:22,270
# Who grows old with you #

1901
01:34:22,312 --> 01:34:24,905
# I wanna grow old #

1902
01:34:24,948 --> 01:34:27,211
# With you #

1903
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:38,752
That was the most beautiful song.

1904
01:34:38,794 --> 01:34:40,488
I got a confession to make.

1905
01:34:40,528 --> 01:34:43,325
That song was about you.

1906
01:34:43,364 --> 01:34:44,830
Good.

1907
01:34:44,866 --> 01:34:47,163
I'm in love with you.

1908
01:34:48,669 --> 01:34:51,398
I am so in love with you.

1909
01:34:51,438 --> 01:34:53,405
Aww.

1910
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,168
Hey, Robbie, that wasn't a bad song.

1911
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:57,675
You know, I'm going to tell those record company guys about you.

1912
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:59,974
You mind if I give her a kiss first?

1913
01:35:00,012 --> 01:35:02,036
Oh, yeah. Do what you got to do.

1914
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:10,981
# Ah ha ha ha #

1915
01:35:11,022 --> 01:35:12,579
# Ha #

1916
01:35:18,062 --> 01:35:20,757
# Ah ha ha ha #

1917
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:21,991
# Ha #

1918
01:35:22,032 --> 01:35:24,727
# I know this #

1919
01:35:24,768 --> 01:35:27,861
# Much is true #

1920
01:35:27,904 --> 01:35:30,167
# Ah ha ha ha #

1921
01:35:30,206 --> 01:35:31,695
# Ha ha #

1922
01:35:31,741 --> 01:35:34,470
# I know this #

1923
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:38,104
# Much is true #

1924
01:35:38,146 --> 01:35:39,169
# Ah ha ha ha #

1925
01:35:39,214 --> 01:35:41,010
# I know, I know, I know #

1926
01:35:41,049 --> 01:35:43,539
# This much is true #

1927
01:35:43,585 --> 01:35:45,848
# Oh, yes, I do #

1928
01:35:45,887 --> 01:35:49,822
# Robbie and Julia #

1929
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:51,221
# Ha ha #

1930
01:35:54,198 --> 01:35:57,291
# I heard you on my wireless back in '52 #

1931
01:35:57,333 --> 01:36:00,665
# Lying awake, intent at tuning in on you #

1932
01:36:00,703 --> 01:36:04,001
# If I was young, it didn't stop you comin' through #

1933
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,700
# Oh-a oh #

1934
01:36:07,542 --> 01:36:10,942
# They took the credit for your second symphony #

1935
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:14,311
# Rewritten by machine, our new technology #

1936
01:36:14,349 --> 01:36:17,613
# And now I understand the supernova scene #

1937
01:36:17,652 --> 01:36:19,482
# Oh-a oh #

1938
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,952
# I met your children #

1939
01:36:20,988 --> 01:36:22,887
# Oh-a oh #

1940
01:36:22,923 --> 01:36:24,389
# What did you tell them? #

1941
01:36:24,424 --> 01:36:27,915
# Video killed the radio star #

1942
01:36:27,961 --> 01:36:31,293
# Video killed the radio star #

1943
01:36:31,331 --> 01:36:34,561
# In my mind and in my car #

1944
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:38,399
# We can't rewind, we've gone too far #

1945
01:36:38,437 --> 01:36:40,768
# Oh oh oh oh oh #

1946
01:36:41,807 --> 01:36:44,172
# Oh oh oh oh oh #

1947
01:36:45,443 --> 01:36:48,775
# And now we meet in an abandoned studio #

1948
01:36:48,813 --> 01:36:52,179
# You hear the playback, and it seems so long ago #

1949
01:36:52,216 --> 01:36:55,412
