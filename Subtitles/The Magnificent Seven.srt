00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,846
Go on!

3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,040
Seem a little lonely. Need some company?

4
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,520
Make some time for you, little missy.

5
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,001
- Yeah!
- Come on, move! Get out of the way!

6
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,724
- Hurry.
- Quickly.

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,441
Hurry.

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,520
- Move it!
- Come on, come on!

9
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,080
- Get out of the way, now!
- Come on.

10
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,566
Fire in the hole!

11
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,201
Another wagon coming from town!

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,364
That's Mr. Bogue's gold!

13
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,482
Move. Get out of the way!

14
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,720
Out of the road!

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
This gold's heavy.

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,880
- Must be a lot in there.
- You folks stay back!

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,720
Stay away from the gold!

18
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
- Get right inside. You, get up there!
- Get going!

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,325
There's more gold in the wagon.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,128
Hurry up. Get the rest of those cases.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Ain't right how these men are being treated.

22
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,410
They fought in the war.

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,364
Line your asses up and get paid.

24
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,482
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go! Move!

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,440
- All right, boys, line up.
- Move. Come on!

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,363
Get that wagon back to the mine.

27
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,331
Let's move! Move!

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
What about our water?

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,762
Bogue's gonna come back,
and he's gonna try and take this land.

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
- What about our families?
- What about Bogue?

31
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,644
Hey, calm down! Calm down!

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
Our crops are dying!

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
He's telling us that the water's poison?

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,080
- It's a lie!
- It is a lie.

35
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,481
Otherwise, why does he have Blackstones
keeping us away from it?

36
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,080
- He's just a man, Turner.
- He's a man with an army, Phillips!

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,004
- He's a man with a claim to mine a mountain.
- He's trying to run us out of town.

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
And his miners are camping
on the edge of our town!

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,325
A man seizing our land.

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,640
A man with dozens of hired guns
on his payroll.

41
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
We know that, Turner.

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,201
- Who's gonna stand up to a man like that?
- We will.

43
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,526
- But how? With what?
- We're just farmers.

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,846
To Bogue?

45
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,962
- There are laws on our side.
- Bogue is the law, Matthew.

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,480
Bought and paid for.

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
- Even got our sheriff on his payroll!
- And his deputies.

48
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,160
- And that's why I say we fight.
- I say we fight. Yeah.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,810
I ain't fighting,
and I ain't leaving neither.

50
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,684
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- God will provide.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,768
That is right, Brother Phillip.
The Lord surely will provide.

52
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,280
Now, now. Bogue is a businessman.

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000
If you just reason with him,
he'll give you a fair share.

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,280
- Yeah. Right. Sure he will.
- Fair share, Gavin?

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,010
You're the only one making money here!

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,482
No, you and your whores.

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,726
Now, Ben, that ain't fair.

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,365
You know that.
You were there the other night.

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,885
You know that's a lie now, Gavin!

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,321
- Please, brothers and sisters...
- You know that's a lie.

61
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,090
- Please, brothers and sisters.
- Reason?

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Ask the Dennehys how far reasoning got them.

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
He burned all the Dennehys' crops!

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
- Our farms are rotting.
- That's right.

65
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
It's only a matter of time
before he drives all of us out of here.

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,888
For the sake of our children,

67
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,800
I believe it's time we leave Rose Creek.

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,086
- To where?
- And where are we gonna go?

69
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,280
- I know you're scared.
- I've given everything I have.

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,200
We all are, but we came far to get here.

71
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,800
Suffered losses too painful to bear
to make this our home.

72
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,160
- Praise God.
- Amen.

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,241
We did it.

74
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,041
All of us.

75
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,760
Together.

76
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,086
This valley is ours.

77
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,770
- I agree with Matthew.
- I'm with Matthew.

78
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,291
This is the Lord's house.
It's no place for guns.

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,289
There are women and children.

80
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,526
Mr. Bogue.

81
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,922
This is what you love, what you'd die for.

82
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,045
And what your children

83
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,330
and your children's children
will work on, suffer for,

84
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,522
be consumed by.

85
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,009
Look at me, boy. Come on up here.

86
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,722
Come on, boy. Come on!

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,489
It's okay, son.

88
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,409
Now, I come here for gold.

89
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,640
Gold.

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,886
This country has long equated democracy
with capitalism,

91
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,563
capitalism with God.

92
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,280
So you're standing
not only in the way of progress and capital.

93
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,362
You're standing in the way of God!

94
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,166
- And for what?
- No, preacher.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,081
You want to help me out?

96
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,330
Let's find out.

97
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,249
Put your hand in there for me.

98
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,087
Go on.

99
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,281
Go on.

100
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,480
Land.

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,200
This is no longer land.

102
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
The moment I put a pin in the map,

103
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,200
the day I descended
into this godforsaken valley

104
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,680
and cast my gaze upon it,

105
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,889
it ceased to be land and became...

106
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,406
That's it. Pull your hand out.

107
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,925
Dust.

108
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,960
Go on, sit back down.

109
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,244
This is your God?

110
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,246
$20 for each parcel of dust,
that is my offer.

111
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
- My land is worth three times that!
- You can't do that.

112
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,128
We have to think of our families.

113
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,287
This valley's worth more than that.

114
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,890
- You're stealing our land!
- And our livelihood.

115
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,810
It won't sweeten.

116
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,244
It'll only sour.

117
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,845
- They're coming in!
- Everybody on out!

118
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,200
Get out of here! Go on!

119
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,169
What are you doing? This is God's house.

120
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,760
Both of you! Stay here!

121
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,760
You're not going anywhere. Stay here!

122
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,569
No, no, no!

123
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,489
- No, please, no!
- Get down.

124
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,403
Somebody help her. Come on. Come on.

125
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,090
- Get out!
- It's the Lord's house!

126
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,289
- Move!
- Get the hell out of here!

127
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,604
No! Don't!

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,486
Please!

129
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,206
Do not turn your back on the Lord.

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,761
Please stop.

131
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,486
- Please, stop it!
- Leave him alone!

132
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,647
Stay down, preacher!

133
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,040
- I'll return to Rose Creek in three weeks.
- Stop moving.

134
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,200
Those of you who accept my offer,

135
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,851
whose signed deeds are on my desk
when I return...

136
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,849
- Matthew!
- ...shall get their $20.

137
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Get off him!

138
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,804
Those of you who do not,

139
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,282
may your good Lord help you.

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,600
I'll help you. I'm sorry. Let me help you.

141
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,170
The Lord's watching.

142
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,121
What kind of man are you?

143
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,129
What'd these people ever do to you?

144
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,564
For what, Bogue?

145
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,526
For land?

146
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
For land?

147
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,527
No!

148
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,841
Matthew!

149
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,247
Isabel, no!

150
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,610
Son of a bitch.

151
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,800
- No, Caleb!
- Oh, my God.

152
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,848
Down, down! Stay down.

153
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,770
No, no.

154
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,721
No!

155
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,803
Leave the bodies where they lay

156
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,320
and let 'em look at 'em a few days.

157
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,280
No!

158
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,283
- My God.
- No!

159
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,125
No! No!

160
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,200
Caleb.

161
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,200
Please, God, don't take him.

162
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,040
Come on, Leni. We have to
get the baby away from the church.

163
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,724
- It's on fire. Come on, come on, come on.
- No, no.

164
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,281
Come on, come with us. Come on, Leni.

165
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,289
This is the Lord's house.

166
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,560
- Come on, there's a fire!
- Something's on fire!

167
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,520
- Let's put it out, men. We can't leave this!
- Shit, it's on fire!

168
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,040
It'll be burned to the ground
if we don't hurry!

169
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
- Stay back!
- Wait, wait, wait.

170
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,000
- Stay back.
- Stay back, men!

171
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,320
Come on, we're just trying to help.

172
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,926
You don't get paid to help. Move!

173
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,445
- I can't.
- I'm fine.

174
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,562
Come on. Come on. Come with us.

175
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,842
Damn wheel's busted. I can't fix it!

176
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,246
Got a long ride ahead of us.

177
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,361
Well, lookee there.

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,809
You know where you are, cowboy?

179
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,409
Get right here. Get right here.

180
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Yeah, I'm hoping to change my luck.

181
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,081
- These cards are shit.
- Deal.

182
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,610
Now, let's try to keep civil
this round, okay?

183
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,210
I'm looking at you, Lucas.

184
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,045
Just play the damn game, Faraday.

185
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,440
What the hell is he doing here?

186
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,926
Shot of busthead.

187
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,849
Sorry, don't carry that kind, cowboy.

188
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,041
Well, in that case, I'll have a double.

189
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,971
- What's that for?
- Information.

190
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,283
Looking for a man. Big fella.

191
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,646
'Bout your size.

192
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,160
What's his name?

193
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,323
Name his mama gave him was Daniel Harrison,

194
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,046
but sometimes
he goes by the name of Powder Dan.

195
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,880
Killed a tenant farmer
and his son in cold blood.

196
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,400
Stole the man's plow horse.

197
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,087
Man's wife tried to intervene.
Took advantage, then killed her, too.

198
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,530
- Ain't heard of him.
- Well, like I said, he use different names.

199
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,440
Had a bullet scar on his left shoulder.

200
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,960
Right there.

201
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,440
Now, Powder Dan ran with an outlaw,
name of July Bully.

202
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,806
May he rest in peace.

203
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,960
- He's dead?
- Yes, sir.

204
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,041
How'd he die?

205
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,286
I whispered in his ear.

206
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,966
Yeah, what's that?

207
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,807
Come here.

208
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,563
Bring them in

209
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,971
Bring them in

210
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,486
From the fields of sin

211
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,525
Bring them in

212
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,521
He shot my damn foot!

213
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,201
Come on, hey. Settle down, mister. Come on.

214
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Come on, easy.

215
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,720
I got a family, mister.

216
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,643
They're better off without you.

217
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,163
Somebody fetch the sheriff.

218
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,520
- Get the sheriff!
- Get the sheriff.

219
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,204
- Get the sheriff!
- Get the sheriff!

220
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm gonna kill you, Faraday.

221
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,241
You son of a bitch. Deal with you later.

222
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,689
- Well, I know it.
- Go on out.

223
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,761
Come on, come on.

224
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,124
Dan, you dead?

225
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,884
Pity. I had just ordered a drink from him.

226
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,482
Money for blood's a peculiar business.

227
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,484
He started shooting everyone in cold blood!

228
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,600
- And he's still in there, yeah.
- That son of a bitch!

229
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,880
- There he is!
- There he is!

230
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,240
- That's him!
- That's him!

231
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,840
- Sheriff! Sheriff!
- He shot him in cold blood!

232
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,480
My name is Sam Chisolm.

233
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,720
I'm a duly sworn warrant officer
of the circuit court in Wichita, Kansas.

234
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm also a licensed peace officer

235
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,286
in the Indian Territories, Arkansas,
Nebraska, and seven other states.

236
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,200
Now, this man is wanted on charges
in Nebraska,

237
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,884
expedited by federal writ,

238
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,762
under Common State Law Enforcement Act.

239
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,760
Yes, sir.

240
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
Wire Judge Talbot in Wichita for the reward.

241
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,800
Half the money goes to the man's widow.

242
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,480
And you can hold my part for me
till I get back.

243
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,561
Where you headed?

244
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,329
Off into the mountains, hunting a vaquero.

245
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,844
No, Miss Emma. I'll do it.

246
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,890
- Excuse me. Are you a bounty hunter, sir?
- No, sir.

247
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,640
Yeah, that's Powder Dan.
Get him on outta here.

248
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,920
I have need of a man
with your qualifications.

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,280
You can't afford me.

250
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,204
Well, can you at least describe the rates
or offer up the particulars?

251
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,440
Rose Creek.
It's only four days' ride from here.

252
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,640
A rich man has overtaken the town.
He's killed half a dozen men.

253
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,680
He's got the sheriff on his payroll
and Blackstone agents in his employ.

254
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,411
Well, you don't need a bounty hunter,
you need an army.

255
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,329
And we intend to hire one, sir.

256
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,247
Guess you weren't expecting
to see me again, were ya?

257
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,280
Wild Bill? Is that you? You look like shit.

258
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,089
Ain't no Wild Bill.

259
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,085
They call me

260
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,570
the Two Gun Kid.

261
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,880
Keep your hands away
from your weapons, Faraday.

262
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,566
- Hands up. Hands up.
- Hands away from the...

263
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,285
Get his guns, Dicky.

264
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,210
Don't try nothing.

265
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,771
A pretty one.

266
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,680
What's that, a Peacemaker?

267
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,330
Now turn around.

268
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,245
I'm not for sale.

269
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,488
Mister. Mister!

270
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,044
You intend to make me chase?

271
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,280
I have a proposition.

272
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,125
- And I'm wary of propositions, miss.
- Missus.

273
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,240
I'm not sure if my friend
filled you in on the details.

274
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,401
Enough of 'em.

275
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,887
Then why won't you at least listen?

276
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,120
We're simple farmers.

277
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,640
Decent, hard-working people
being driven from our homes.

278
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,609
Men slaughtered in cold blood.

279
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,200
Women and children
without food or essentials.

280
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,126
All because some man named Bogue
wants to mine our valley and take it from us.

281
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,441
Bartholomew Bogue?

282
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,601
You know of him?

283
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,245
Heard the name.

284
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,969
What's this?

285
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,010
Everything we have.

286
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,644
That's what it's worth to us.

287
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,527
Been offered a lot for my work
but never everything.

288
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,202
That man murdered my husband.

289
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,881
Killed him dead in the middle of the street.

290
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,526
So you seek revenge.

291
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,367
I seek righteousness, as should we all.

292
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,723
But I'll take revenge.

293
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,320
The Two Gun Kid.

294
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,040
That's my name now.

295
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,360
'Cause you got two guns?

296
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,400
- Maybe not.
- Told you it was a stupid name.

297
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,280
Dicky, shut your goddamn mouth.

298
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,771
Faraday, walk!

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,207
Just mad 'cause Mama gave him the name Earl.

300
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,840
What do you want to do with him?

301
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,366
How 'bout we take him over
into that mine there?

302
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,600
This is as good a place as any.

303
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,761
Into the mine, Faraday.

304
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,200
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

305
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,770
If you're gonna rob me, rob me.

306
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,723
But I will not go in that mine.

307
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,885
There's rats in there.

308
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,806
Virginia City? Three days past?

309
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,640
Best you remember who'd you cheat
out of $50 in a card game!

310
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,167
I assure you I did not have to cheat
to beat the likes of you two.

311
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Easy.

312
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,731
Gentlemen, allow me a moment
to show you something quite miraculous.

313
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,320
You just show us our money, Faraday!

314
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,560
Fifty-two cards.

315
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,120
- Pick a card.
- We ain't playing no game.

316
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,800
You've got the drop on me.
You'll get a hoot outta this.

317
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,560
Come on, Earl, just pick one real quick.

318
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,529
You know how I like magic.

319
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,646
- All right, keep the gun on him.
- Got it trained right on him.

320
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,411
No tricks now.

321
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,960
Don't let me see it.

322
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,611
Show your associate.
Commit the card to memory.

323
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,121
When you're ready,
put the card back in the deck.

324
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,371
Don't try nothing.

325
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,640
Keep your gun on me. That's very good, Earl.

326
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,840
Now, there's no way
I can know what your card is

327
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,251
because I didn't see it.

328
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,042
- Yet...
- Come on. Let's go!

329
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,767
With a shuffle and a cut, miraculously,

330
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
your card.

331
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,560
That ain't his card.
Man, you ain't no magic man.

332
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
That's not it? Hold on.

333
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,525
Quit playing around
before I blow your goddamn head off.

334
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,127
Remember the plan, Earl. I get to kill him.

335
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,250
You didn't let me finish.

336
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,685
Your card was the king of hearts, right?

337
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,360
Is this your card?

338
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
Now, you see? That was worth it, wasn't it?

339
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
- That was kind of good.
- Pretty good.

340
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,881
That was...

341
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,963
No, you just killed my brother.

342
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,040
- Should I kill you?
- No. Please.

343
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,361
Would you like to see another magic trick?

344
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,040
No.

345
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,121
Yeah.

346
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,720
It's called The Incredible...

347
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,165
No.

348
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,650
Disappearing...

349
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,207
Ear.

350
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,325
My ear!

351
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,089
We are never gonna cross paths again.

352
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,921
Please don't kill me.

353
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,170
Keep your money, please.

354
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,246
I didn't want to kill him.

355
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,929
He shouldn't have touched my guns.

356
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
The only way in is the valley floor,

357
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,440
and the main road in and out is to the west.

358
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,931
Where's the mine?

359
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,640
Here.

360
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,800
- And where's Bogue?
- Sacramento.

361
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,723
Back in less than three weeks.

362
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,240
And how many men you say
you got left in town?

363
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,481
Forty, maybe.

364
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,646
Farmers. Not fighters.

365
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,800
You understand what it means
when you start something like this?

366
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,247
We did not start this, Mr. Chisolm.

367
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,445
What are you waiting on?
Just get him under control.

368
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,520
Spend all night at the saloon, and then
you can't even control a silly horse.

369
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
Come on, lad, get in there!

370
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,320
Silly horse? That's a stallion.

371
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,320
His name's Jack, and he's killed men before,
so he oughta be careful.

372
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,641
- Easy, easy, easy!
- I require my horse back.

373
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,241
That horse.

374
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,560
Two days past.

375
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,000
Your horse against my Irish whiskey.

376
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,160
Behind the saloon rolling dice.

377
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,370
That, sir, is a lie. A complete, absolute...

378
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
Good Lord.

379
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,360
- Easy.
- I thought that was a dream.

380
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,761
I thought you were a leprechaun.
That was real?

381
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,440
I was mistaken.
I would like to buy my horse back.

382
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,285
Though I am light of funds at the moment.

383
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,726
So...

384
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,520
Seems we have ourselves a Mexican standoff,

385
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,080
only between an Irishman and a Baptist,
and I'm not sure how that ends.

386
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,481
With you walking away

387
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,611
without your horse.

388
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,200
Now, why'd you have to go
and touch your gun for?

389
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,680
We were in the middle
of a gentlemen's negotiation.

390
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,886
Come on!

391
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,446
How much for his horse?

392
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,360
$25 for the horse.

393
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,240
Seven and two bits for the saddle.

394
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,209
Our paths cross again.

395
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,400
To what do I owe the pleasure?

396
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,760
Come on.

397
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,002
Took a job. Looking for some men to join me.

398
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,241
Is there money in it?

399
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,601
And who's she?

400
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,281
Joan of Arc.

401
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,605
My name's Emma Cullen.

402
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,400
And this is my associate, Teddy Q.

403
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,562
Well, I do have an affinity for shiny things.

404
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,168
- Is it difficult?
- Impossible.

405
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,960
- How many you got so far?
- Two.

406
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,407
- What, them?
- You and me.

407
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,163
Sending a woman to gather guns
is not very chivalrous.

408
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,324
I volunteered.

409
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,769
Insisted, actually.

410
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,248
Lot of fire in that one.

411
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,845
Begs the question.

412
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,568
Whose execution do we seek?

413
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,124
Bartholomew Bogue.

414
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,440
Bart Bogue? The robber baron?

415
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,840
Means there's gold in the equation,

416
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,880
but gold don't do you much good
when you're buried with it.

417
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
You want out, feel free to leave.

418
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,881
Just leave my horse.

419
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,080
'Cause I paid for it.

420
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,246
Just speaking out loud.

421
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,040
Twenty miles east of here.
Volcano Springs. Supply station.

422
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,200
You look for a Cajun, name of Robicheaux.

423
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
- Goodnight Robicheaux?
- That's right.

424
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
The Angel of Death.

425
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,600
Meet me outside of Junction City
in three days.

426
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,887
Yeah, I ain't there,
then it means I'm dead and you can...

427
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,527
You can keep my horse.

428
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,930
You're with me. Come on, let's go. Come on.

429
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,366
Three days.

430
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,244
The gun. The gun!

431
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,204
Give it to him.

432
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,210
He was already dead,
if that's what you're wondering.

433
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,160
- You been sleeping in here?
- He doesn't snore much.

434
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,520
- You Vasquez?
- What's this to you?

435
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,602
Here. I'm gonna tear up a warrant.

436
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,440
I just want to make sure
I'm talking to the right man.

437
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,124
No.

438
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
Poor likeness.

439
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,560
You a bounty hunter?

440
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,290
Duly sworn warrant officer.

441
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,600
Where is your gun?

442
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,682
Man carries a gun, he tends to use it.

443
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,320
Dead ranger by your hand. $500 reward.

444
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,680
Maybe he had it coming.

445
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,960
Doesn't matter to me either way.

446
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,647
- Why? You intend to get that reward?
- That depends.

447
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,609
Got a business proposition for you.

448
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,006
Well, does this business involve her?

449
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,726
Yes, it does.

450
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,606
Get me out of here! Let me out of here!

451
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,121
You wipe that smile off your face.

452
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,242
Laugh now. Get it outta your system.

453
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,520
After our business is concluded, what then?

454
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,520
There'll still be a lot of men
after your hide.

455
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,443
- And that should give me comfort?
- Should.

456
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,610
I won't be one of 'em.

457
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,125
You're loco, my friend.

458
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,290
Let me tell you the game.

459
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,206
- Go on, now!
- Fastest gun wins.

460
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
Winner take all.

461
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,121
Hope you've all put your bets down.

462
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,006
Arcade.

463
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,290
Billy Rocks.

464
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,364
On my gun.

465
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,400
Yeah, how about that, boys?

466
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,084
- That's good.
- That was pretty good, huh?

467
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
- Billy wins.
- What?

468
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,568
Are you blind? Come on, Eddy.

469
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
- You're a liar!
- Come on, Arcade.

470
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,968
- Hey, come on, we all saw me win, now.
- Yeah!

471
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,160
- Double down!
- We all want some more!

472
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,366
Why don't we do it for real?

473
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,440
- Come on, Arcade, back off.
- No, no, double down.

474
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,240
Come on, you scum-sucking runt of a man.

475
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,440
I want no part of this.

476
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,808
- Double or nothing!
- It's your funeral, Arcade.

477
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,884
Double or nothing.

478
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,566
He called it.

479
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,571
All right.

480
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
He's lost his mind.

481
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,650
- He ain't got a chance.
- It ain't right.

482
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,081
Billy?

483
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,161
On my gun.

484
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,960
- Never seen anything like this.
- What the hell was that?

485
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,840
- Come on, now.
- I think he killed him.

486
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,285
- He killed him, right?
- What the hell?

487
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,361
Damn!

488
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Damn it, Arcade.

489
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,920
- Man, he got it.
- What was that?

490
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,083
- Damn!
- See? I told you. I told you!

491
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,880
I ain't in the habit of paying off cheaters.

492
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,610
I'll be keeping my money.

493
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,451
Easy, Goodnight. He's drunk.

494
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,690
He don't mean it.

495
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,960
Mr. Robicheaux,
if I'd known it was you, that was your man,

496
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,963
I never would've made
such a disrespectful comment.

497
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,564
It's all right, son. You just pay me double.

498
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,131
Yes, sir.

499
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,482
- Damn fool.
- Goodnight Robicheaux?

500
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,969
Sam Chisolm sent us.

501
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,520
- All right, get him outta here.
- That's gotta be real rough.

502
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,443
I said, what do you think I'm paying for?

503
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,880
"Duly sworn warrant officer

504
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,486
"from Wichita, Kansas,
and seven other states."

505
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,200
- Do we have the same man?
- Yeah, believe we do.

506
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,408
Should we talk somewhere more private?

507
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,602
Nah, I like it right here.
Billy, you like it here?

508
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,521
Yeah.

509
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,600
- How'd y'all meet?
- How did we meet, Billy?

510
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,082
I was serving a warrant on him
for the Northern Pacific Railroad.

511
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,328
Warrant for what?
Killing a man with a hairpin?

512
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,448
Now, now, you're gonna have to pay for that.

513
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,006
That is funny.

514
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,840
Here's what it is.

515
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,720
I found Billy
down in an old redneck saloon in Texas,

516
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
and all these good ol' boys,

517
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,486
they didn't want to serve
Billy's kind, all right?

518
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,080
So this petite son of a bitch
took on the whole room bare-knuckled.

519
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,200
I watched in awe, and I said to myself,

520
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,205
"Goodnight, this is not a man to arrest,
this is a man to befriend."

521
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,326
- You make your living off of his alley fights?
- Equal shares.

522
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,840
Between fights, Goody helps me
navigate the white man's prejudices.

523
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,164
I keep him employed,
and he keeps me on the level.

524
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,849
Well, Mr. Chisolm told us to come fetch you,

525
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,080
but he didn't say anything
about your friend over there.

526
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,242
Wherever I go, Billy goes.

527
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,047
Yes, sir.

528
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,401
We understand each other.

529
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,640
Well, day-and-a-half ride to Junction City.
We got two days.

530
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,484
Let's do a half day of drinking.

531
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,769
I like you.

532
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,571
- Sam Chisolm!
- Goodnight Robicheaux.

533
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,527
Sight to see, even with a storm on our backs.

534
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,080
Yeah. Rain ain't nothing but wet.

535
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,760
Well, what we lose in the fire
we will find in the ashes.

536
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,001
That's right.

537
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,001
Yeah.

538
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,368
This is Billy Rocks. He's with me.

539
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,681
Sam, that's Billy.

540
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,411
He come with Goodnight.

541
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,086
I don't know about this one.

542
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,161
Who's this?

543
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,644
We work for her.

544
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,207
Well, enchanté, mon cher.

545
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,240
- Emma Cullen.
- Your hands are cold, Emma.

546
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,685
Are you nervous?

547
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,960
Don't be.

548
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,280
Goodnight's my name.

549
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,125
That Billy is pretty nifty
with them pigstickers.

550
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,409
Good, we got a Mexican.

551
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,965
What a merry band we are.

552
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,200
Me a gray, Chisolm a blue,

553
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,521
Billy, a mysterious man of the Orient,

554
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,160
a drunk Irishman,

555
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,160
a Texican,

556
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,527
a female and her gentleman caller.

557
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,966
This is not going to end well.

558
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,569
I'm Mexican, cabrón.

559
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
No such thing as a "Texican."

560
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,242
Try telling that to my granddaddy.

561
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
He died at the Alamo.

562
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,160
New Orleans Greys, long barracks, bayonets.

563
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,400
Blood. Teeth.

564
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,324
Mauled by a horde of teeming brown devils.

565
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,680
My grandfather was one of those devils,
you know.

566
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,364
Toluca Battalion.

567
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,568
Hey. Maybe my grandfather
killed your grandfather, huh?

568
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,451
What a charming thought.

569
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,970
I sense we are bonding.

570
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,920
So we're talking about the same Jack Horne.

571
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,200
The Jack Horne. The legend Jack Horne.

572
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,360
Legend? Legend, my ass.

573
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,320
Yeah, he might've killed 300 Crow,

574
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,402
but he ain't never met
the Pigeon brothers before.

575
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,568
And you saying that's Jack Horne's rifle?

576
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,202
It was Jack Horne's rifle.

577
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,964
And there's an Army fort
want to pay $1,000 for proof of death.

578
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,281
Rifle'll do.

579
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
You have no body?

580
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,366
Well, you see, Len here
smashed a boulder over his head.

581
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,201
Fell off a cliff.

582
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,200
Snuck up on him, huh?

583
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,647
Just what the hell are you trying to imply?

584
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,127
Oh, my Lord.

585
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,561
The Pigeon brothers weren't famous very long.

586
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,247
These two ungodly creatures

587
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,284
broke a rock on my head.

588
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,600
Robbed me of my possessions.

589
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,440
I trailed 'em for two days.

590
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,887
Guess they got what they deserved, Mr. Horne.

591
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,000
My name is Sam Chisolm.

592
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,289
We met about six years ago up in Cheyenne.

593
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,250
Now, I got a right,

594
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,008
by the Lord and by the law,
to take back what belongs to me.

595
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,250
Are we in agreement?

596
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,201
Yeah.

597
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,201
Yes, sir.

598
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,800
You still collecting scalps?

599
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,120
The government don't pay
a bounty on redskins anymore.

600
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,565
You must be out of work.

601
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,730
Now, that's part of another story, ain't it?

602
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,730
Yes, it is.

603
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,240
We... We're looking for some men, Mr. Horne,
some good men like yourself, to do a job.

604
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,000
Going after a fella,
name of Bartholomew Bogue and his men.

605
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,607
Just... Well, just thought
you'd be interested.

606
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,923
I believe that bear
was wearing people's clothes.

607
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,321
Never trust a people
who bury their dead above the ground.

608
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,444
Don't call the alligator "big mouth"
till you cross the river.

609
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,680
- Are you in the army?
- No, sir.

610
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,800
I figured 'cause you carry this
army-issue Open Top .45 Long Colt.

611
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,530
Took you for a soldier.

612
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,440
You know how to shoot that thing?

613
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,081
- If I had to, I reckon.
- If you had to?

614
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,125
Tell you what, for a sip of your whiskey,
I'll teach you a few lessons.

615
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,007
Lesson one.

616
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,006
This

617
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,565
means don't shoot.

618
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,320
You got it?

619
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,004
Now watch this one.

620
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,051
Now, lesson two.

621
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,360
Take this card out of my hand.

622
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,720
You take the card, you live.

623
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,404
You don't, you die.

624
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,603
Come on, Teddy.

625
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,005
Focus.

626
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,129
You got to be quick.

627
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,688
You just lost your first gunfight.

628
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,890
Try it again.

629
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,611
Lesson two. It was never about the cards.

630
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,320
Now, I'll give you a third lesson.

631
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,801
Think you need that more than I do.

632
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,680
Why don't you just take the rest,
Mr. Faraday?

633
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,091
Well, I think I will.

634
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,168
The fire still burns.

635
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,520
We have heard the chimes at midnight.
Have we not?

636
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,841
So what's the play here, Sam?

637
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,487
What's the payout?

638
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,880
Little gold?

639
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,325
Cash money?

640
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,961
Diamonds?

641
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,601
You ain't changed.

642
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,364
Everything that...

643
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,040
Everything they have,
that's what they offered.

644
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,849
Everything? Yes?

645
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,720
She's about the same age
your sister'd be by now.

646
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,165
Yeah, she is.

647
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,526
Just making sure we're fighting
the battle in front of us, not behind.

648
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,051
Smell that?

649
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,804
What smell?

650
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,611
- The smoke?
- It's blood.

651
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,731
- He's been tracking us.
- I'll be damned.

652
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,251
Please tell me I'm hallucinating.

653
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,480
You are hallucinating.

654
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,050
So am I.

655
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,360
Where there's one, there's more.

656
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,805
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

657
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,928
Comanche?

658
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,081
We come in peace.

659
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,201
Vasquez.

660
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,364
You speak Comanche?

661
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,010
Some.

662
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,525
You speak...

663
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,086
...white man's English?

664
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,841
Some.

665
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,130
Where's your tribe?

666
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,330
The elders told me my path is different.

667
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,920
My path is different, too.
My path... Our path.

668
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,163
We go to fight wicked men.

669
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,411
Probably, we all die.

670
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,689
I'm called Red Harvest.

671
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,608
- What'd he say?
- Said he's with us.

672
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,208
Gonna fix him some breakfast. I had mine.

673
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,325
Let's get this fire started.

674
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,160
- Mr. Paley, come on in.
- All right, sweetheart.

675
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,969
Buy me a drink, sugar.

676
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,162
- Better get her all nailed down.
- I keep telling him. He just don't listen.

677
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,490
Kristen.

678
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,525
That man's trouble.

679
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,000
Afternoon, gentlemen.

680
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,321
Town's got a ban on firearms.

681
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,800
Check 'em in. Get 'em back on your way out.

682
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,043
You don't mind me asking,
but how is it all of you go so well-heeled?

683
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,564
These men are deputies.

684
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,767
Awful lot of deputies
for such a small place, ain't it?

685
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,241
What's his story?

686
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,891
My manservant. He's harmless.

687
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,128
Saved his life in Shanghai,

688
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,490
debt of honor and the like.

689
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,760
Now, you don't mind
giving up those guns, do you?

690
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,320
Absolutely. Law and order, I say.

691
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,921
Sheriff?

692
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,840
Now, I must tell you that
I'm more than happy to cooperate.

693
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,685
I can't say the same thing
for my compadres behind you.

694
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,368
Quite a batch of strays.

695
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,964
I'll say a prayer for you.
You know, a little prayer.

696
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,568
Yeah, you'll make a hell of a rug.

697
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,331
And you'll be murdered

698
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,005
by the world's greatest lover.

699
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,690
All right.

700
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,844
All right.

701
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,810
What's your aim here, mister?

702
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,485
Well...

703
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,920
I hear that there are some cowards
running security here,

704
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
so I figured we'd come down here
and look after all this gold.

705
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,286
Cowards?

706
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,324
Blackstone detective agents. Cowards.

707
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,169
Now, Blackstones are good, union busting,

708
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,960
back-shooting homesteaders and women, but

709
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,520
you put 'em up against some real men,
men that know what they're doing...

710
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,204
You sure you don't want my gun?

711
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,120
Now, you do know who we work for, right?

712
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,205
The force he can bring to bear?

713
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,885
You tell Bogue

714
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,884
if he wants his town,

715
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,525
come see me.

716
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,566
I don't believe he heard you.

717
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,120
Go on, horse.

718
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,960
No!

719
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,880
Devil, don't shoot. I'm the proprietor.

720
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,200
No!

721
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,807
Lord, give me clear vision!

722
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,326
Clear sight!

723
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,805
Go on, shoot him.

724
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,805
Take the shot.

725
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,365
Take that shot.

726
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,804
Take the damn shot!

727
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,245
Give me that.

728
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,727
It's jammed.

729
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,091
How'd we do?

730
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,771
I got five.

731
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,644
- I got six.
- Hey.

732
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,202
- What'd you get?
- Six.

733
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,284
I got seven.

734
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,640
You wanna try and tie it up?

735
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,324
Huh, chingado?

736
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,729
Say when, güero.

737
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,401
Hey.

738
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,241
Come on out of there.

739
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,563
Come on. Come on!

740
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,805
Take off that gun belt.

741
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,200
You all right?

742
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,964
Nice and easy.

743
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,850
Take off that badge, too.

744
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,240
I'm still sheriff. Duly elected.

745
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,243
Consider this a recall.

746
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,960
Now, you're gonna deliver
a message to your boss.

747
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,720
Mister, you already sent him a message,

748
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,325
only you're not gonna like his answer.

749
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,840
Tell him we have his town,
we have his whole valley.

750
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,360
He want it back,
he's gonna have to make a deal with us.

751
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,250
He don't make deals.
You can ask anybody here.

752
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,520
He's just gonna send as many men as it takes
to squash you flat.

753
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,682
We'll be waiting.
In the meantime, you tell him this.

754
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,680
Lincoln. Like the president. Say it.

755
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,440
Lincoln, like the president.

756
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,560
That's right. Lincoln, Kansas.

757
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,360
And you tell him if he don't show up himself,

758
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,330
he ain't nothing
but a yellow-bellied sapsucking coward.

759
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,601
Go on, git.

760
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,040
Git.

761
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,326
Hey.

762
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,040
Sam Chisolm. Say it.

763
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,122
Sam Chisolm.

764
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,724
Yes, sir.

765
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,800
Well, this is quite the welcome party.

766
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,770
- Where is everybody?
- I think we killed 'em all.

767
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,320
No, they're here.

768
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,166
They just want to make sure their candle
is lit before they blow out the match.

769
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,927
Everyone! Come on! Come out!

770
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,083
- Come out!
- Come on out, everybody!

771
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,560
What's the matter with y'all?

772
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,324
Don't you see what they just did?

773
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,648
Come on! Come out!

774
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,928
These men are here to help us!

775
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,164
- Come on!
- Well, look at that.

776
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,649
- Come on!
- Nothing to be scared of! Let's go!

777
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,200
- Come on!
- Is he dead?

778
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,964
Come on. Get away.

779
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,247
It's okay.

780
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,167
Come on, don't be afraid.

781
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,370
I have assembled these men
and offered fair pay.

782
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,080
Who picked you to deal on our behalf?

783
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,289
Seems I was the only one
with balls enough to do so.

784
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,766
So I did.

785
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,011
As I said, these men are here to help us.

786
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,761
Mr. Chisolm?

787
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,680
My name is Sam Chisolm,

788
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,890
and I'm a duly sworn warrant officer
in Wichita, Kansas.

789
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,000
Also, a licensed peace officer

790
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,840
in the Indian Territories, Arkansas
and seven other states.

791
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,571
Now, what happened here was

792
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,760
just an opening skirmish.

793
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,440
The real battle is yet to come.

794
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,040
The idea is that when it comes,
it'll be on our terms.

795
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,960
- On our terms?
- Yeah, there's no way in hell.

796
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,720
Son of a bitch'll come back with 200 men
and slaughter us all.

797
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,804
If you want to leave, leave.

798
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,447
Just don't take anything
you didn't bring with you.

799
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,406
You want to keep your town,
you're gonna have to fight for it.

800
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,280
Now, we're here to help you,
but you got to help us.

801
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,240
We're gonna need every somebody out here
to help us fight.

802
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,760
Good Lord! Are you suggesting we wait here
to face retaliation?

803
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,960
- Hell, yeah, he is.
- What?

804
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,240
- Let 'em come. We'll be ready for 'em.
- I beg pardon, sir.

805
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,080
The spirit here is willing,

806
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,200
- but we are not killers.
- That's right.

807
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,602
Most aren't, till they're looking
down the barrel of a gun.

808
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,163
Now, I never shot anything
that could shoot back at me.

809
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,886
But this is our home.

810
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,200
- Damned if I won't defend it.
- That's right.

811
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,200
And now let me tell you,
these men that are coming here,

812
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,640
they're gonna underestimate you.

813
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,920
That'll be their first mistake.

814
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,607
That's all well and good,
but we don't have enough time.

815
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,760
Bogue said he'd be back in three weeks,
that was eight days ago.

816
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,200
- One week.
- That only leaves us... No, one week?

817
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,964
- One week?
- One week.

818
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,160
Three days' ride to Sacramento
with the bad news,

819
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,480
one day for Bogue to plan, three days back.

820
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,050
Seven days, that's all you got.

821
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,844
For goodness' sake.

822
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,724
We'll get started in the morning.
Get a good night's rest.

823
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,043
May be your last for a while.

824
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,404
I'll have some more beans.

825
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,602
Like being in one of them damn zoos.

826
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,729
Fame is a sarcophagus.

827
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,640
You read those in a book,
or you just make 'em up as you go?

828
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,361
I'll try to use
one-syllable words from now on.

829
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,642
What... What's a syllable?

830
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,200
White people's food...

831
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,725
...is for dogs.

832
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,961
What'd he say?

833
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,569
He asked that you kindly stop
staring at his hairline.

834
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,880
I will.

835
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,531
As long as he stops
licking his lips over mine.

836
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,880
These bodies don't get buried
in the church graveyard.

837
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,480
You take 'em to Boot Hill.

838
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,120
I expect we'll make ten miles by sundown.

839
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,600
I suppose that undertaker's
gonna get some business out of this deal.

840
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,240
I guarantee you, there ain't no reason
to be running off scared.

841
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,926
Hate to see y'all go like this, now.

842
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,167
Now, now, won't you reconsider?

843
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,800
Who'd have thought
we'd travel this many miles

844
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,761
just to have the good people of Rose Creek
turn tail and leave us to die?

845
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,687
Well, some people have died for much less.

846
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,051
Behold.

847
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,205
Our army approaches.

848
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,882
Good, they brought their pitchforks.
We may stand a chance after all.

849
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,888
Lord, keep me from judgment.

850
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,886
Gun on your shoulder. Right shoulder.

851
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,086
Knives. There's nothing to it.

852
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,689
Oh, boy.

853
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,245
Who here fought
in the War of Northern Aggression?

854
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,960
Not me.

855
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,480
What is this? Come on.

856
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,000
Throw.

857
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,605
Slash.

858
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,129
Stab. That's it.

859
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,720
That simple.

860
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,640
- Like hell.
- Hey.

861
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,560
- How the hell we gonna learn to do that?
- Get back here!

862
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,840
Get back!

863
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,365
Fire!

864
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,762
Jesus wept!

865
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,000
Reload!

866
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,280
Statistically speaking,
they should've hit something.

867
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,120
Y'all starting to piss me off.

868
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,400
How many times I got to tell you
to keep your foot up underneath you?

869
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,290
Come on, now.
Schoolteacher, take your hat off your head.

870
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,481
Jesus!

871
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,967
Teddy...

872
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,960
Expect more from you, son.

873
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,200
The recoil is not to be shunned,
it's to be absorbed.

874
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,521
I ain't shunning a damn thing, sir.

875
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,880
You trying to make me angry?
Is that what it is?

876
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,405
Do you...

877
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,920
That's the second time for you.

878
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,720
- Go make me some eggs.
- The damn hammer...

879
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,240
No, I don't wanna hear it!
Have a nice afternoon.

880
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,960
You gonna point...
You gonna point that rifle at me?

881
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,166
No, sir.

882
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,720
You cut the ears off a mule,
don't make him a horse.

883
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,480
- Leave your weapon.
- I'm trying to help you. You understand?

884
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,080
Keep the target soft, pull the trigger slow.

885
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,120
- So slow. You can't pull it slow enough.
- Like that?

886
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,168
Let the shot surprise you.

887
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,125
All right, now.

888
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,690
Fire when ready.

889
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,040
Fire!

890
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,369
Think I pinched my finger.

891
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,160
Bless their hearts.

892
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,560
That's hard to do.

893
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,520
This many men and miss that many targets?

894
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,601
Twice?

895
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,891
I'm looking at a line of dead men.

896
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,320
You gotta hate what you're firing at!

897
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,000
Hate it! Come on!

898
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,760
Get some gravel in your craw!

899
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,640
Goddamn sons of bitches!

900
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,767
All right.

901
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,369
These men need inspiration.

902
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,120
- Inspire them.
- Yeah.

903
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,204
You are Goodnight Robicheaux, after all.

904
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,690
Aint'cha?

905
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,683
I can hit sand, but we need the lead.

906
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,330
Twenty-three confirmed kills at Antietam.

907
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,840
This is one of Connolly's
Confederate sharpshooters.

908
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,764
Dubbed "the Angel of Death."

909
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,400
Do what he does.

910
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,570
He's a legend.

911
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,844
Or is that all you are?

912
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,440
- That's some fancy shooting there.
- He did it. He did it.

913
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,800
- That's why they call him Goodnight.
- You're telling me.

914
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,609
- Can you believe that?
- That's fantastic.

915
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,567
Told you.

916
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,329
Y'all go home, polish your rifles,
maybe the glint'll scare 'em off.

917
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,324
We ain't gonna shoot no more?

918
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,764
So this is our trap.

919
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,320
It might work. Pin 'em in there.

920
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,404
Well, it might, if we can teach
more than half of these townsfolk

921
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,240
to hit the broad side of a barn at ten paces.

922
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,160
Come up with a few surprises.

923
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,040
We'll need more than a few.

924
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,920
It's a box of death.

925
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,800
So melt the elements, with fervent heat.

926
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,882
Like Sodom and Gomorrah.

927
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,245
What do you think?

928
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,040
Reminds me of this fella I used to know.

929
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,009
Fell off a five-story building.

930
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,480
Passed each floor on the way down.

931
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,689
People inside heard him say,
"So far, so good!"

932
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,201
- He's dead now.
- Yeah.

933
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,842
I make good on my horse yet, Sam?

934
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,683
So far, so good. Let's go get some ammo.

935
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,801
Come on.

936
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,963
Mr. Bogue wants this mine stripped
before he gets back.

937
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,091
Move it, you lazy dogs!

938
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,040
Move that gold out!

939
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,889
Fire in the hole!

940
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,490
That sounded like a gunshot!

941
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,410
It's coming from the cliff.

942
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,920
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

943
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,162
- Keep the powder down.
- Look-it, right there.

944
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,280
These ain't Bogue's guys.

945
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,569
Yup. They done killed them all.

946
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,686
This mine is now closed.

947
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,164
You men are free to go.

948
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,930
Or you can stay and fight.

949
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,528
- This will help.
- Yeah.

950
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,603
I've always wanted to blow something up.

951
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,251
Go back inside.

952
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,369
Mr. Chisolm, what's this?

953
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,080
Reinforcements.

954
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,200
- What's that on the wagon?
- Dynamite.

955
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,840
Dynamite? Where you gonna put that stuff?

956
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,280
- Your place.
- My place? Why my place?

957
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,204
Oh, Lord. Please be careful with it.

958
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,240
My town. My gold. How?

959
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,324
It was happening so fast, Mr. Bogue,
I couldn't...

960
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,888
There just wasn't enough.

961
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,765
And that I'd be a coward?

962
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,360
If you didn't come to Rose Creek. Yes, sir.

963
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,680
- He said his name was Chisolm?
- Sam Chisolm.

964
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,000
- From Lincoln?
- Like the president.

965
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,520
He name his price?

966
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,682
He didn't have one. Just terms.

967
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,050
All men have a price.
Isn't that right, Mr. Harp?

968
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,526
Not this man.

969
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,369
How many men you say?

970
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,248
- Seven.
- Seven? Seven?

971
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,720
Seven men ride into my town, dispatch
with 22 of the best guns money can buy?

972
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,840
Is that what you're telling me?

973
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,720
They fought like three times that, Mr. Bogue.

974
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,600
Bullshit.
It was nothing but the element of surprise.

975
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,051
Hey.

976
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,491
Surprise.

977
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,440
You think Rockefeller
had to do things himself?

978
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,560
Vanderbilt?

979
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,200
Everything I have, I worked for it.

980
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:47,040
Not like them, with their fancy friends
and their pocketed politicians.

981
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,487
I want land, you know what I do.

982
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,681
I take it.

983
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,602
You know what history will say
about Rose Creek?

984
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,200
Nothing.

985
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,680
It won't have existed for long enough.

986
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,649
But history will remember me,

987
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,681
and what I built.

988
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,448
Mr. Denali, recruit an army
to go back with us.

989
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,321
Pretty.

990
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,286
I mean good.

991
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,520
Your shooting is good. Do it again.

992
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,843
Sight the lowest part of the V,
cheek resting against the...

993
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,404
I had a father, thank you.

994
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,561
I didn't.

995
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,370
God dang it, I'm good.

996
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,845
Why are you doing this, Mr. Faraday?

997
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,087
I mean, why are you here

998
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,002
fighting someone else's fight?

999
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,211
I needed my horse back,
and this was the price.

1000
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,684
Six pounds of pressure.
That's all that's required to kill a man.

1001
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,808
And they say the nightmares never go away.

1002
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,047
Those nightmares,
they keep you up often, Mr. Faraday?

1003
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,525
You might want to wear some pants
if you're fixing to fight.

1004
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,120
Bogue will come from the south.

1005
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,362
Now, he'll prefer high ground,

1006
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,806
but we'll try to lure him into town,
turn it into a shooting gallery.

1007
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,080
Now, if we can create enough confusion,
maybe we can get them to break ranks.

1008
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,760
That's a lotta open space here, Sam.

1009
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,411
I don't really see a way to keep 'em out.

1010
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,807
We're not. We're gonna let 'em in.

1011
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,040
Yes, yes, we force 'em down through here,
leave this open here,

1012
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,122
make this into a graveyard.

1013
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,320
Goodnight, you're our best shot with a rifle.

1014
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,720
You find high ground
that gives you a clear line of sight,

1015
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,520
you keep Bogue in your sights
once the chaos starts.

1016
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,965
Now, we have some shotguns.

1017
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,640
We can get the men who can't shoot,
place 'em in front of each door.

1018
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,440
It's hard to miss a doorway.

1019
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,480
We could dig trenches.
Shoot all the way out that way.

1020
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,769
Trouble with taking one of these positions,
you can't ever get down.

1021
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,810
Now, whatever happens, Bogue can't leave.

1022
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,844
How do we even know Bogue's gonna show?

1023
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,880
- He'll show.
- And if he just shoots you in the head?

1024
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,089
Then just shoot him in the head.
Hell, I don't know, avenge me.

1025
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,000
If we can lure him into the bottleneck,
close the door behind him,

1026
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,321
each group fire and advance,
we stand a chance.

1027
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,851
Worst-case scenario,
all is lost and we blow the mine.

1028
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,090
This right here is the best spot.

1029
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,640
Can we take position up there? Is it safe?

1030
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,324
Anything left up there to stand on?

1031
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,084
Won't have to go too far
to pray for forgiveness.

1032
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,325
There you go.

1033
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,248
But there is no forgiveness
for men like you, güero.

1034
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,000
Don't call me güero.

1035
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,640
What's güero mean, anyway?

1036
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,327
- Handsome? Debonair?
- Yeah, something like that.

1037
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,000
No, this is our stronghold.

1038
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,840
You funnel them all towards the church.

1039
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,040
Where am I?

1040
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,400
You keep the women and children
safe and out of harm...

1041
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,766
I aim to fight.

1042
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,886
Well, if it comes to that,
then we're all dead, ain't we?

1043
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,689
Let's hope if we die, we've confessed.

1044
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,367
Goody.

1045
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,201
You all right?

1046
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,646
What do you say, Sam,
about 50 or 75 yards out?

1047
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,567
That's our trench.

1048
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,440
Ditches on each side!
The rest of y'all stand to the side!

1049
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,842
We're gonna need another ditch by the livery.
See that?

1050
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,640
Good, and heave!

1051
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,246
- All right, tie it up, now.
- Put your weapon...

1052
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,049
Make sure you paint the whole thing.

1053
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,123
Very smart, smoking, huh?

1054
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,607
- Three minutes.
- That's too much land to cover.

1055
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,125
Where did them eggs come from?

1056
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,802
A chicken's ass, you dummy.

1057
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,483
Did I introduce you to my wife?

1058
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,360
Her name is Ethel, and I love her.

1059
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,681
Hello, Ethel. Charmed.

1060
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,169
And I consider her to be the love of my life.

1061
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,920
And she is a no-bullshitter,

1062
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,923
- she's a straight shooter.
- All right, calm down, now.

1063
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,000
Put the gun away, son.

1064
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,320
- Her name is Ethel.
- Put it away.

1065
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,360
And you'll show her some goddamn respect.

1066
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,771
Yeah.

1067
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,124
It's Maria you can disrespect.

1068
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,728
Don't tell Ethel about Maria.

1069
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,243
Wait, wait, wait. My Maria, cabrón?

1070
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,160
You have a Maria?

1071
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,168
I have three Marias!

1072
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,520
That's not right.

1073
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,728
The owl followed me here.

1074
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,960
- Nothing's following you.
- I heard the voice.

1075
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,160
- Goody...
- I heard the voice.

1076
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,880
- Goody.
- Billy, I heard it.

1077
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,240
I pull that trigger in violence again,
I'm gonna die a ghastly death, Billy.

1078
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,890
I heard it.

1079
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,840
- Same thing, it's not the same thing.
- Yeah, it is.

1080
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,360
No, a woman's a woman,
a gun's a gun, in the Lord's eye.

1081
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,120
They're just dreams, Goody.

1082
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,040
You talk about guns, you talk about women,

1083
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,920
you talk about 'em separately.
It ain't right.

1084
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,446
Sure it is. Sure it is, my friend.

1085
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,484
I had a wife once.

1086
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,000
Had a family. Had some children, too.

1087
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,889
One time.

1088
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,360
Now the stitching'll outlast you, I imagine.

1089
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,720
That's... That's very nice of you.

1090
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,802
I didn't ask you to do that.

1091
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,687
I didn't ask you to ask.

1092
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,920
You quit staring.

1093
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,360
I didn't ask her to do that.

1094
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,523
Well, the lady just did some poking
and sticking for you.

1095
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,166
Maybe you should consider
returning the favor, you know?

1096
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,530
Okay, all right.

1097
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,049
- Evening, Mr. Chisolm.
- Preacher.

1098
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,243
- What a beautiful night it is.
- Yes, it is.

1099
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,365
I just wanted to take a moment
to come up here

1100
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,080
and to thank you
for everything that you've done for us.

1101
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,722
It's been a long while since we've been able
to enjoy an evening quite like tonight.

1102
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,760
Before you and your men arrived,

1103
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,606
all of our everyday pleasures
had been taken from us.

1104
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,443
To have those back,
even if only for a moment,

1105
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,004
well, it might not mean that much to you,

1106
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,090
but, by God,
we are all eternally grateful to you.

1107
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,169
More than you know, preacher.

1108
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,920
Last thing I wanna be doing is playing cards.

1109
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,640
- All night.
- All night.

1110
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,768
You know, some of these folks
ain't gonna make it.

1111
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,806
Yeah.

1112
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,600
- Here we go. Easy. Easy.
- Steady.

1113
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,967
- Throw me the other end!
- Here you go.

1114
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,840
Okay, pues.

1115
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,968
- That far enough?
- That'll do!

1116
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,807
All right, two or three more of those,
then we're good.

1117
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,766
That's it, right there.

1118
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,402
Look. Look. Look.

1119
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,689
Watch your head now, Teddy.

1120
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,320
Now you can pray for us, Father.

1121
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:27,000
My brother, I will pray for you
until I forget how to pray.

1122
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,684
Water, Mr. Chisolm?

1123
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,611
This is a grand day
in the history books of Rose Creek!

1124
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,120
God bless you, Mr. Chisolm, sir.

1125
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,120
Vindication, brothers and sisters!

1126
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,727
- Water, Mr. Horne?
- Thank you, miss.

1127
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,804
For God's glory!

1128
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,527
Bogue comes with his men.

1129
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,801
When?

1130
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,644
Dawn.

1131
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,520
The Lord said, "Where there are two or three
gathered in My name,

1132
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,886
"I will be there."

1133
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,691
You just gonna run off
before you get your cut of the gold?

1134
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,089
Well, y'all gonna be dead
this time tomorrow, Sam.

1135
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,728
I believe every man's got the right
to choose where he dies, if he can.

1136
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,480
Well, that kind of talk
may work with these other sons of bitches,

1137
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,210
but I know why you're here.

1138
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,120
And it's not for the benefit of mankind.

1139
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,280
You run out on these people, Goody,

1140
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,126
and you gonna be disappointing
more than just them or me.

1141
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,720
Remember what you said to me
when them Billy Yanks

1142
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,760
were kicking my sorry ass six ways to Sunday?

1143
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,320
- I remember.
- Yeah?

1144
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,440
You asked me why I wanted to save
a piece of rebel trash like you,

1145
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,806
and I told you the war was over.

1146
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,046
- But it ain't over, Sam.
- Yes, it is.

1147
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,520
No, it isn't. No, the killing's not over.

1148
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,080
It keeps going on and on and on.

1149
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,440
- I seen so much death.
- The war is over

1150
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,329
for both of us.

1151
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,441
What we lost in the fire,

1152
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,044
we'll find in the ashes.

1153
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,126
I need you.

1154
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,770
I've become everything I despise. I...

1155
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,084
I'm faint-hearted and I'm a coward.

1156
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,400
Bye.

1157
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,689
You remember me as I was.

1158
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,721
Come on.

1159
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,920
...hallowed be Thy name.

1160
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,490
Thy kingdom come,

1161
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,840
Thy will be done,

1162
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,240
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1163
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,800
Give us this day our daily bread

1164
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,962
and forgive us our trespasses...

1165
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,405
You all right?

1166
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,486
Well...

1167
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,081
Where's Billy?

1168
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,244
It looks like he's started to drink.

1169
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,202
All right. Well...

1170
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,241
Anybody else want to leave, now's the time.

1171
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,448
No one'll hold no ill will towards you.

1172
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,960
What about you?

1173
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,640
I...

1174
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,240
I believe I'm gonna see this through.

1175
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,209
These people deserve their lives back.

1176
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,520
I have nowhere else to go, so I'm in.

1177
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,480
You know, I knew that tomorrow
was gonna be a dark day.

1178
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,007
And now that there's one less of us,
gonna be darker.

1179
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,326
But to be in the service of others

1180
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,527
with men that I respect,

1181
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,125
like you all...

1182
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,767
Well, I shouldn't have
to ask for more than that.

1183
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,283
- I'll see you in the morning.
- All right.

1184
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,120
I'm hungry.

1185
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,128
Wait. Hell, you speak English?

1186
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,281
So?

1187
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,808
You little shit. We got a lot to talk about.

1188
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,049
Don't walk away from me!

1189
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,964
I'll take his place.

1190
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,128
- Who?
- Goodnight.

1191
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,129
Just saw him ride out.

1192
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:31,641
Thank you for the strength
that you have given me.

1193
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,200
It's time.

1194
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,640
Come on, children!

1195
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,040
- Come on.
- Children, quickly, please, go on.

1196
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,487
- Let's go.
- Come on, hurry!

1197
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,440
Hurry, children!

1198
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,851
Come on, come on.

1199
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,320
Now get on down in there. Come on.

1200
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,925
Watch your step.

1201
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,728
Easy, easy.

1202
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,881
Steady.

1203
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,250
Easy now, easy.

1204
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,851
Chisolm?

1205
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,046
It's him, all right.

1206
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,526
It's only minutes.

1207
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,568
We're safe. Nothing to fear.

1208
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:05,681
Yeah.

1209
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,090
Mr. Denali.

1210
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,200
Keep it clear!

1211
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:44,286
- Come on!
- Steady!

1212
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,851
That's it, straight on!

1213
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,846
- Mask up.
- All together. Come on.

1214
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,961
Bring 'em up!

1215
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,801
Steady on, boys! Steady on!

1216
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,171
Mind your sister.

1217
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,240
Come on, line up, boys. Steady on, steady on!

1218
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,440
Shoot whoever you see!
Don't spare a soul, do you hear me?

1219
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,960
Go around! Go around!

1220
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,485
Go through the miners' camp!

1221
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,880
Just stay with me, boys!

1222
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,569
Drain all the blood from their bodies,
you hear me?

1223
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,720
I'm counting.

1224
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,847
Five.

1225
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,681
Four.

1226
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,401
Three.

1227
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,206
Two.

1228
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,324
Let's go, come on!

1229
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,607
One!

1230
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:25,927
One!

1231
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,526
Hold! Hold!

1232
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:41,960
Keep your line!

1233
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,087
Head to the left!

1234
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:48,921
Pull!

1235
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,080
Watch your back coming in!

1236
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:52,161
Get him!

1237
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,684
I can't see 'em from here!

1238
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,169
Hey! Easy, easy, easy!

1239
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,961
Let's do it!

1240
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:15,120
- Now!
- Come on!

1241
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,123
- Let's go!
- Shoot, shoot!

1242
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,647
Dig in! Keep shooting!

1243
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,881
I got him!

1244
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:32,767
Here they come! Stand your ground!

1245
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:40,086
- Through here, go!
- Cut him off round that bend!

1246
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,641
Get him! Go!

1247
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,647
Watch your right!

1248
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:09,240
- Shoot! Go around, fire!
- Head him off, over there!

1249
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,841
There's another one up top!

1250
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:20,927
Over there!

1251
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,760
"Although I walk through the valley

1252
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,127
"of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil

1253
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,089
"for Thou art with me."

1254
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,205
That's it! Unload on him!

1255
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,007
I got him!

1256
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,281
- Here!
- There!

1257
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,960
Go 'round, go 'round!

1258
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,565
- Ain't no way through!
- Come on!

1259
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,281
Push the wagon!

1260
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,726
Get to the church!

1261
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,805
Let's go, come on!

1262
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,610
Now! Now!

1263
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,360
There's too many of 'em.
They're gonna kill all of us!

1264
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,930
No! No! Stay down!

1265
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,921
Keep shooting!

1266
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,200
What are you doing there?

1267
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,725
Get back to the livery stable!

1268
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,486
Just keep moving!

1269
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,571
They're gonna kill us all!

1270
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:37,805
We're outnumbered!

1271
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:38,960
Go around the barn!

1272
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,644
We're clear, we're clear!

1273
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,527
Keep shooting!

1274
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,006
Light up that wagon!

1275
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,682
- They're on that roof!
- Push them wagons!

1276
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,086
Block 'em in!

1277
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,567
They got us trapped!

1278
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,166
Ain't no way out!

1279
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,641
Go, go, go!

1280
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,801
Open 'em up!

1281
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,331
Go get the wagon.

1282
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,041
Head to the church!

1283
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,086
Into the church!

1284
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,240
Bring the fight to these cowards!

1285
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,890
Yeah, let's kill these bastards!

1286
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,440
- Wagons! Wagons! Let's go.
- Hurry, güero!

1287
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,284
Light 'em up and lock
these sons of bitches in here!

1288
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,200
Lock 'em up! Let's...

1289
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,327
Güero, man!

1290
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,080
- Light it up!
- Yeah.

1291
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,491
That's far enough. Leave it, let's go!

1292
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,925
Are you okay, güero?

1293
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,484
So far, so good.

1294
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,769
Can't get out! It's a dead end!

1295
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,648
- We're trapped!
- Go the other way!

1296
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,969
We still have men there, sir.

1297
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:46,687
I'm going!

1298
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,040
- Go.
- Keep shooting!

1299
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,201
They're trapped!

1300
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,451
Keep shooting!

1301
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,890
Keep shooting, güerito!

1302
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:21,162
Go 'round! It's blocked!

1303
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,721
Now!

1304
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,607
Come on!

1305
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,965
They got the devil's breath!

1306
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,048
They got a goddamn Gatling gun!

1307
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,806
Let 'em have it.

1308
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,726
Let's run!

1309
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,081
Get the fuck...

1310
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,806
Gavin, damn it!

1311
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,720
Take cover!

1312
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,848
- Go on, Miss Emma.
- Get down!

1313
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,960
They have a Gatling gun! A Gatling gun!

1314
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,407
Get inside! Inside, inside!

1315
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,601
- Billy!
- Hey, Goody!

1316
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:03,040
- Go! Gun!
- Gatling gun!

1317
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,770
Move, get out of the way, go on!

1318
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,891
Get down, get down!

1319
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,201
Go on, Miss Emma, go!

1320
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,400
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

1321
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,680
They're reloading! Stay down! Stay down!

1322
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:53,886
Get down!

1323
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,560
The children.

1324
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,766
- Get down.
- Get down!

1325
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,126
- Get down against the wall, come on!
- Hey, Goody!

1326
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,647
- Yeah, I see 'em, I see 'em.
- Let's go, Billy!

1327
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,360
We gotta get these kids outta here.

1328
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,160
All right, everybody, come on.

1329
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,520
- Everyone, up the stairs.
- Quick, quick.

1330
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,840
- Quick, quick, quick.
- Be careful.

1331
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:22,931
Can't walk. They got my leg, sir.

1332
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,280
Schoolteacher, what are you doing up here?

1333
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,640
I want to stay.

1334
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,080
Come on, now, get outta here!

1335
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,400
Wrap that leg! Stop the bleeding.

1336
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,680
Find some ammo. You did good...

1337
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,921
Shit!

1338
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:56,560
We are giants put on this earth

1339
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:00,087
to rid it of evil
and to keep all that is good!

1340
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:07,280
- Straight to the field. Come on.
- Quickly. Quickly!

1341
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,680
- Go on, children, hurry.
- Come on.

1342
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:09,841
- Quickly.
- To the field.

1343
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,320
- Keep going, keep going!
- Anthony!

1344
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,640
- Quickly now.
- Anthony!

1345
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,280
- Pa! Quickly!
- Go, go, go.

1346
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:54,720
- You can't...
- Go, go, go!

1347
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,720
- Come on. Stay together.
- Let's go! Go, go, go.

1348
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,564
Keep going! To the ridge line!

1349
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,171
Come on. Just keep going.

1350
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,884
Get down. Get down!

1351
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,365
Come on. Come on.

1352
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,161
Get down!

1353
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,840
They're coming!

1354
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,922
We're running outta ammo, boys!

1355
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,369
- Shit, Billy.
- I knew you'd come back.

1356
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:30,930
You did, did you? How'd you know that?

1357
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:34,241
You forgot this.

1358
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,360
- All right. Let's do it.
- Yeah!

1359
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,009
You're a disgrace.

1360
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:13,491
Over there! Over there!

1361
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,601
Ammo, ammo!

1362
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,005
This is all we've got.

1363
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:22,291
This reminds me of what my daddy used to say.

1364
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,687
What's that, Goody?

1365
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,520
What?

1366
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,365
Well, my daddy used to say
a lot of things, you know.

1367
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:40,200
- You all right?
- Hell yeah.

1368
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,000
So far, so good.

1369
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,730
I might need a new vest.

1370
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,728
Damn, we gotta do something about that gun.

1371
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,447
Hey.

1372
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:03,921
You know what?

1373
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,160
We're even.

1374
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,004
For the horse. You don't owe me anything.

1375
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,366
Well, you owe me.

1376
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,761
What's that?

1377
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,561
Cover.

1378
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,130
Come on! Come on!

1379
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,201
Over here!

1380
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,926
This side, Goody.

1381
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,082
Ride, Faraday, ride!

1382
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:47,881
What do we have here?

1383
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:05,011
Get the two in the back.

1384
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:08,961
Hit the steeple.

1385
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:19,327
I got him!

1386
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:37,007
Goody.

1387
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,161
Come on, boy!

1388
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:02,446
Why don't you stay down, boy?

1389
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,765
Let's go, boys.

1390
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,486
Yeah. Yeah.

1391
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:59,121
Dynamite.

1392
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,368
I've always been lucky with one-eyed jacks.

1393
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,881
Dynamite!

1394
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:57,521
Bring them

1395
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:02,162
Bring them in

1396
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,166
Chisolm?

1397
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,645
Should I know that name?

1398
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,642
You should know it from your obituary.

1399
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:22,240
We connected, somehow?

1400
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,448
14th of October, 1867.

1401
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:31,409
Did you hire renegade Greys to pillage
and steal land in Kansas?

1402
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,250
Homesteaders.

1403
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,726
Good people trying to make a life
for themselves, like these people here.

1404
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:46,600
If God didn't want 'em sheared,

1405
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,762
he wouldn't have made 'em sheep.

1406
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,040
No.

1407
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,121
Pick it up.

1408
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:23,400
Go on, pick it up. Pick it up.

1409
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:24,606
Pick it up!

1410
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:56,649
You a God-fearing man?

1411
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,766
Yeah.

1412
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:27,050
Please, just leave.

1413
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:33,883
Please leave me be! Please!

1414
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,200
Please.

1415
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,204
I... I beg your pardon.

1416
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,560
I've done you wrong.

1417
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,971
God.

1418
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,890
I want you to pray with me.

1419
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:56,966
All right?

1420
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:00,127
Come on.

1421
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:05,121
All right?

1422
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:07,563
- Ask for forgiveness.
- Wait.

1423
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,640
- Yeah, you can.
- I...

1424
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:12,769
You close your eyes, and you pray.

1425
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,680
Pray for my mother

1426
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,171
that your men raped.

1427
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,808
Go on, pray. You pray.

1428
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:28,444
Pray for my two sisters

1429
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:31,490
that your men murdered.

1430
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,011
That they strung up.

1431
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:37,680
Did they pray when they put
the rope around my neck?

1432
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:39,125
Did they pray then?

1433
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,130
Pray, pray.

1434
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,285
I remember. Chisolm...

1435
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1436
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:49,885
- I remember.
- You remember?

1437
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,246
I said pray.

1438
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,245
No.

1439
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:58,890
Hallelujah.

1440
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:04,242
Killing me won't give you
the satisfaction you want!

1441
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:08,200
"Our Father..."

1442
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,281
Say it.

1443
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,969
"Who art in heaven.

1444
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,405
"Hallowed be Thy name." Say it.

1445
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,407
"Thy kingdom come..." Go on.

1446
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:23,246
Come on.

1447
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:25,126
Say it.

1448
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:49,891
Amen.

1449
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:09,286
Faraday?

1450
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:45,090
Thank you, Father.

1451
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:52,441
Preacher.

1452
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:57,203
I'm gonna take good care
of your men, Mr. Chisolm.

1453
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:58,560
Proper.

1454
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:03,371
You made it? You made it through!

1455
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:16,486
Let's go.

1456
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:18,840
God bless you, Mr. Chisolm.

1457
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:19,921
Take care of Jack, Teddy.

1458
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,561
- Miss Emma.
- Thank you.

1459
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:44,480
- Thank you so much, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Chisolm.

1460
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:46,640
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Mr. Chisolm.

1461
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:48,484
Godspeed, men.

1462
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:54,531
Mom, is it over?

1463
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:57,361
Mommy?

1464
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:00,091
- Mom!
- Sweetheart!

1465
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:10,045
That's all right.
As long as I can walk, I'll be fine.

1466
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,482
Whatever they were in life,

1467
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,648
here, at the end,

1468
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:58,927
each man stood with courage and honor.

1469
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:04,161
They fought for the ones
who couldn't fight for themselves,

1470
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:06,282
and they died for them, too.

1471
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:10,403
All to win something
that didn't belong to them.

1472
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:13,571
It was...

1473
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:16,283
magnificent.

1473
02:08:17,305 --> 02:09:17,571
