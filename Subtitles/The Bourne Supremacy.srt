2
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:48,775
This is not a drill, soldier.

3
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:52,683
We clear on that?

4
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:55,920
This is a live project.
You're a go.

5
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,956
You're a go.

6
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:02,326
Training is over.
Training is over.

7
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:07,027
Training is over.
Training is over.

8
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:54,045
I'm okay. It's fine.

9
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:58,746
Just a headache.

10
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:06,587
You're burning up.

11
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:22,540
It's okay.

12
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:27,241
Just a headache.

13
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:48,532
Anything new?  No.

14
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:53,233
It's just bits and pieces.

15
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:57,374
I can hear Conklin's voice,

16
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:02,075
and there's that photograph, but ...

17
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,616
I just can't stay with it.

18
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:07,952
But you're sure it's not
just a bad dream? It happened.

19
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:12,456
It was a mission.

20
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,525
And I was there.

21
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:19,226
You should write it down.

22
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:23,200
Two years we're scribbling in that notebook ?
It hasn't been two years.

23
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,537
It's always bad, and now it's just
the same thing over and over again.

24
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:31,976
But that's why we write it down. Because
sooner or later, you remember something good.

25
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:37,348
I do remember something good.

26
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:42,049
All the time.

27
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:43,247
- I want one final go around.
- All teams listen up.

28
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:47,151
- We are standing by for final green.
- Survey Two, I need to know when you've got eyes.

29
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:51,622
- This is Survey Two. I have eyes.
- Copy that.

30
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:56,323
Survey One, this is Hub.
Do you have visual contact?

31
00:04:56,962 --> 00:05:01,662
Hub, this is Survey One.
Mobile One is in motion.

32
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,369
Survey Three, that is good.

33
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:13,310
- Hub.
- Director Marshall from Langley.

34
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:16,780
- Langley.
- Stand by, please.

35
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:21,252
- Martin?
- I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller.

36
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:24,922
We understand you're using
the full allocation for this buy.

37
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,157
It's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.

38
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:32,960
For a thief, a mole. If it does nothing more
than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at 10 times the price.

39
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:36,400
Hub, this is Survey Two.
Escort is breaking off ...

40
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,136
Mobile One is entering the building.

41
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:43,837
Gentlemen, I have the seller on-site and in play.
Quite frankly, there's nothing much more to discuss.

42
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,683
- All right, Pam. Your call.
- Go.

43
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,752
- We're on.
- Audio contact only.

44
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:57,821
Switching to channel one now.

45
00:05:57,822 --> 00:06:02,522
Copy that. It's affirmative.

46
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,785
Hub, Mobile One and seller
have entered the office.

47
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:06,486
Copy that.

48
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:21,668
This is everything?

49
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:59,639
Those were shots.

50
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,783
Survey One, come in. Survey One, I need to know
what happened. What do you see?

51
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:07,885
- Do you see any shadows? I see nothing.
- What is your visual?

52
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:12,586
- Get some men in there. Get some men in there right now.
- Pull it up, Kurt.

53
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,260
Eye contact. I don't care if it's visual ?
Mobile One, can you copy, please?

54
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:19,263
- Are you there, Mobile One?
- I'm sorry.

55
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:23,964
What do you see?

56
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,986
... Petroleum Association's annual
conference here in Berlin ...

57
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:46,056
is Pekos Oil chief executive officer
Yuri Gretkov.

58
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:50,757
In just six years, Gretkov has turned
Pekos into an oil empire, which in turn ?

59
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,202
He's become one of
the wealthiest men in Russia ...

60
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:02,903
after consolidating drilling rights
in the Caspian Sea and gaining control of one of the wo ?

61
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:59,593
How much?

62
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:34,451
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

63
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:37,454
He is my friend.
There's been a death in the family.

64
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:42,155
I wonder if you've seen him.

65
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,069
- Hey.
- Get in.

66
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,138
- What's wrong?
- We're blown.

67
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,839
How?
We pushed it. We got lazy.

68
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:48,558
Idiot!

69
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,461
All right. That's twice now
I've seen the same guy.

70
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,530
I saw him in town.
He was at the telegraph office.

71
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,932
Are you sure?
How-How can you be sure? It's just wrong.

72
00:13:55,933 --> 00:14:00,633
The guy, the car he's driving,
what he's wearing ? it's just wrong.

73
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,609
Look, Jason, let's stay calm.
It could be anybody. This is real.

74
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,312
This is real. That's him.
That's him right there.

75
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:14,013
Get your head down.
Silver Hyundai. Get your head down.

76
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:36,339
How far is he?

77
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,743
How far?

78
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:44,444
A hundred meters.

79
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,732
Here, take the wheel.
You're gonna drive.

80
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:06,770
Switch.

81
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:11,471
Just head to the bridge.

82
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:33,493
- Turn here. Cut through the field.
- Hang on.

83
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,280
All right, you keep going to the shack.
I'll meet you there in one hour.

84
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:26,683
I'm gonna bail out on the other side of this
bridge. It's the only way he can follow us.

85
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:29,085
What if it's not who you think it is?
It's them. It's Treadstone.

86
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:31,655
Jason, don't do it.
Look, Marie, I warned 'em.

87
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:34,024
I don't want you to do it.
I told them what would happen if they didn't leave us alone.

88
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:37,761
- It's never gonna be over like this.
I don't want ?  We don't have a choice.

89
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:42,462
Yes, you do.

90
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:00,437
Thank you.

91
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:04,441
Two of these explosive charges
placed on the power lines, and one of them failed.

92
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,576
The fingerprints from the one
that didn't go off.

93
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,778
- And the Germans can't match it?
- No. Nobody's got it.

94
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,249
We checked out every database
we could access. But we're hooked into Langley now.

95
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,950
Run it.
Okay.

96
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:28,932
What the hell's Treadstone?

97
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:33,633
All right. Get me a flight.
We're going to Langley.

98
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:09,949
Two men dead, three million in cash gone,
no Neski files,

99
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,995
and all very public.

100
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:15,198
This is still a clandestine agency, no?

101
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,233
I don't view this event
as a failure.

102
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:20,003
You call it a success?
We have a lead.

103
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:24,704
A fingerprint left by the assassin.
He's one of us.

104
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,512
- Who is it?
- What can you tell me about Treadstone?

105
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:33,549
Treadstone?
It's where the trail dead-ends.

106
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,552
If you want an answer,
you're going to have to give me ...

107
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:41,253
a level-five S.C.I. access.

108
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:47,030
We have a lead, Marty.

109
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:50,600
All right.
You've got your clearance.

110
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:54,304
But you're on
a very short leash.

111
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:58,408
And you'll give a full report
to the group. I wanna know where you're going with this.

112
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:03,109
Sir.

113
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:19,922
Ward?

114
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:21,657
Yes?
Pamela Landy.

115
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:24,127
Hey, Pam.
What can I do for you?

116
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:26,696
I was hoping you had some time for me.
Time for what?

117
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:31,999
- I'm free right now, actually.
- That sounds ominous. Let me check my schedule.

118
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:39,142
Excuse me. I need to, uh ?
Excuse me. Can I help you?

119
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:41,477
Yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Abbott.
Twenty minutes?

120
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:46,178
See ya.

121
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:54,557
Operation Treadstone.
Never heard of it.

122
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,325
That's not gonna fly. With all due respect, Pam,
I think you might've wandered past your pay grade.

123
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:04,096
That's a warrant from Director Marshall
granting me unrestricted access to ...

124
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:08,801
all personnel and materials
associated with Treadstone.

125
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:13,643
So, what are we looking at?
I wanna know about it.

126
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:16,712
Know about it?
It was a kill squad. Black-on-black.

127
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:21,284
We closed it down two years ago.
Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.

128
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:25,021
So I think you better take this
back to Marty and let him know exactly what you're doing.

129
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:29,722
He does. I've been down to the archives.
I have the files, Ward.

130
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,729
- Let's talk about Conklin.
- What are you after, Pam?

131
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,400
You wanna fry me?
You want my desk. Is that it?

132
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:39,268
I wanna know what happened.
What happened?

133
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:44,229
Jason Bourne happened.
You got the files. Then let's cut the crap.

134
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:49,041
Conklin had these guys wound so tight,
they were bound to snap.

135
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:53,683
Bourne was his number-one.
The guy went for a job, screwed the op, never came back.

136
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:58,781
Conklin couldn't fix it,
couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways.

137
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:02,125
So you had Conklin killed?
I mean, if we're cutting the crap.

138
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:04,694
I've given 30 years
and two marriages to this agency.

139
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:07,663
I've shoveled shit on four continents.
I'm due to retire next year.

140
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:10,766
But if you think I'm gonna sit here
and let you dangle me with this,

141
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:15,271
you can go to hell ... and Marshall too.

142
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:18,074
It had to be done.

143
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:20,943
- And Bourne? Where is he now?
- Dead in a ditch.

144
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:23,713
- Drunk in a barn Mogadishu. Who knows?
- I think I do.

145
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:26,249
I had a deal going down
in Berlin last week.

146
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,951
During the buy, both our case officer
and the seller were killed.

147
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:33,652
They were killed by Jason Bourne.

148
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,059
They're ready for us upstairs.

149
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:22,567
Seven years ago, $20 million of C.I.A. funds disappeared
during a wire transfer through Moscow.

150
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:28,077
In the investigation that followed,
we were contacted by a Russian politician, Vladimir Neski.

151
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:32,215
Neski claimed we had a leak
and that we'd been ripped off by one of our own.

152
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:34,650
And were we?
We never found out.

153
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:37,019
We were negotiating a meet
with Mr. Neski when he was killed.

154
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,055
- By who?
- His wife.

155
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,791
The case had gone cold until a month ago
when we founda source.

156
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:45,428
Another Russian in Berlin
who claimed to have access to the Neski murder files.

157
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:50,129
We thought we had
another bite at the apple.

158
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:55,567
Turns out the assassin
was one of our own ? Jason Bourne.

159
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,408
I know Treadstone's not
a very popular subject around here,

160
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:01,978
but we found some interesting things
when we dug a little deeper.

161
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:05,414
This is Conklin's personal computer.

162
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:10,876
His Treadstone files are bloated with code keys
and case files that he neither needed nor had clearance for.

163
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:15,024
Buried in the hard drive, we found a deleted file
with an account number to a bank in Zurich.

164
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:20,759
At the time of his death, he was sitting on a
personal account in the amount of $760,000.

165
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:25,564
You know what his budget was?
We were throwing money at him and asking him to keep it dark.

166
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:28,738
- It was his own account.
He was up to something. This is supposed to be definitive?

167
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:31,707
What's definitive is that
I just lost two people in Berlin. So what's your theory?

168
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:36,345
Conklin's reaching out from the grave
to protect his good name? The man is dead.

169
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:39,682
- No one's disputing that, Ward.
- For Christ's sake, Marty, you knew Conklin.

170
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:43,719
Does this scan? I mean, at all?

171
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,721
Cut to the chase, Pam.

172
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:48,124
I think that Bourne and Conklin
were in business together,

173
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:51,360
that Bourne's still involved
and that whatever information I was trying to buy in Berlin ...

174
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:54,430
was big enough to bring Bourne
out from hiding to kill again.

175
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:57,600
How's that scan?

176
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,602
Excuse me, sir,
but you're not gonna believe this.

177
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:04,303
Jason Bourne's passport
just popped up on the grid in Naples.

178
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:09,679
Okay. Contact Naples.
They need to know who they're dealing with.

179
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,380
Find out what kind of local assets
we have in place there.

180
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:22,855
Nah, it's nothing. Some guy's name
came up on the computer.

181
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:32,231
All right.

182
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:47,783
Mr. Bourne, I'm John Nevins.
I'm with the U.S. Consulate.

183
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:52,484
I just have a few questions for you.

184
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,030
You're coming out of Tangier.
Is that correct?

185
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:13,906
What's the, uh, nature
of your visit to Naples?

186
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:38,701
Look, I don't know what you did, and
I don't know who you're working for.

187
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:40,703
But I promise you this ?

188
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:45,404
you're gonna play ball
one way or the other.

189
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:54,583
This is Nevins.

190
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:57,853
This is Tom Cronin, C.I. Operations
Officer calling from Langley, Virginia.

191
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:01,290
- Do you have a Jason Bourne in custody?
- Yes, I do.

192
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:05,991
Listen, he's an agency priority target.

193
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:10,762
Call me back
as soon as he's secure. I understand.

194
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:56,512
He's been detained.
Here's the number.

195
00:31:56,513 --> 00:32:01,213
He's being interrogated by
a field officer out of the consulate.

196
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,899
- Hello.
- This is Pamela Landy, C.I. supervisor.

197
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,568
Where do we stand?

198
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:22,438
I, uh, think he got away.

199
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,241
Damn it.

200
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:28,978
- Have you locked down the area?
- Locked it down? No. No.

201
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:32,114
This is, uh ? This is Italy.
They don't exactly lock down ?

202
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:35,618
- How long have you worked for the agency?
Me? For four years.

203
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,420
If you ever wanna make it to five, you're gonna listen to
me real close. Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous.

204
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,859
Last week in Berlin he assassinated two men ?
one a highly experienced field officer.

205
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,162
I want you to secure that area.
I want any evidence secured, and I want it done right now.

206
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:49,665
Is that clear?
Yes, sir ? ma'am.

207
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:53,135
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin
in 45 minutes, which means you're gonna call me back in 30.

208
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:57,836
And when I ask you where we stand,
I had better be impressed.

209
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,711
- Berlin?
- I already have a team in place there.

210
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:05,347
I doubt that Bourne's in Naples
ready to start a family.

211
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:08,017
- You have no idea what you're getting into.
- Do you have any idea?

212
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:11,453
From the minute he left Treadstone, he's killed and
eluded every single person that you've sent to find him.

213
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:15,024
You read a couple of files on Jason Bourne,
and that makes you an expert? This is my case, Ward.

214
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:18,761
Enough. I want you both
on that plane.

215
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:23,032
We are, all of us, going to do
what we were either too lazy or inept to do the last time around.

216
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:26,302
We're gonna find this son of a bitch
and take him down.

217
00:33:26,303 --> 00:33:29,972
I 'm not having Jason Bourne
destroy any more of this agency.

218
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:34,673
- Is that definitive enough for you?
- Yes.

219
00:33:37,314 --> 00:33:40,716
Jason Bourne is armed
and extremely dangerous.

220
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:44,520
Last week in Berlin he assassinated two men ?
one a highly experienced field officer.

221
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:46,288
I want that area ?

222
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:49,024
... he assassinated two men ?
one a highly experienced field officer.

223
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:53,725
I want that area secured.
I want any evidence secured, and I want it done right now ?

224
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:16,782
This is not a drill, soldier.

225
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:22,921
This is not a drill, soldier.
This is not a drill, soldier.

226
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:28,126
We clear on that?
We clear on that?

227
00:35:39,402 --> 00:35:42,037
You'd been working at Treadstone
for three years,

228
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:44,039
and your cover at the time was what?

229
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,809
That I was an American student in Paris.

230
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,812
And what exactly did your job
with Treadstone in Paris consist of?

231
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:53,615
I had two responsibilities.
One was to coordinate logistical operations.

232
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:55,851
The other was to monitor
the health of the agents.

233
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:58,387
Health, meaning what?
Their mental health.

234
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:01,323
- Because of what they had been through,
they were prone to a variety of problems. What kind?

235
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:05,394
Depression, anger,
compulsive behaviors.

236
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:09,398
They had physical symptoms.
Headaches, sensitivity to light.

237
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:14,099
- Amnesia?
- Before Bourne? No.

238
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:20,242
The plane's ready.
There's a car waiting for you.

239
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,311
- Good luck.
- No. You were his local contact.

240
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:27,012
You were with him the night Conklin died.
You're coming with us.

241
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:33,210
Langley pulled an image out of Naples.
It's uploading right now.

242
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:36,185
It's coming in now.

243
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:39,054
- I need clearance.
- He's not hiding, that's for sure.

244
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:41,557
- Why Naples? Why now?
- Could be random.

245
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:43,725
- Maybe he's running.
- On his own passport?

246
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:46,461
- What is he actually doing?
- He's making his first mistake.

247
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:49,431
It's not a mistake.

248
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:52,868
They don't make mistakes.
They don't do random.

249
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:55,437
There's always an objective.
Always a target.

250
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:58,006
The objective and targets
always came from us. Who's giving them to him now?

251
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:00,409
Scary version?

252
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:05,110
He is.

253
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:05,574
- I emptied it.
- It felt a little light.

254
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:10,275
Put it down.

255
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:17,576
- Front.
- Sorry. Old habits.

256
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:24,623
Use your teeth.
Ah.

257
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:36,271
Word in the ether was
you'd lost your memory.

258
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:40,972
You still should've moved.

259
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:44,179
- What do you want?
- Conklin.

260
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,181
He's dead.

261
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:50,915
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
So who's running Treadstone now?

262
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:54,656
Nobody. They shut it down.

263
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:59,357
It's over. We're the last two.

264
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:05,867
If it's over,
then why are they still after me?

265
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:08,570
- I don't know.
- Ever heard the name Pamela Landy?

266
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:11,873
- I don't know who that is.
- Pamela Landy and Berlin. What's going on in Berlin?

267
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:14,776
I don't know.

268
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:19,477
Why would I lie?

269
00:40:40,837 --> 00:40:45,537
I thought you were here to kill me.

270
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,878
What'd you do?
I'm sorry.

271
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:54,579
Did you call it in?

272
00:40:55,451 --> 00:41:00,151
Get up. Come on.

273
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,493
You have a car out front?
The keys are in my coat pocket.

274
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:06,495
But we should ?
What?

275
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:11,196
Go out the back.
I have another car.

276
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:45,503
Pamela Landy.

277
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:52,076
Nein, mein Herr.
Danke.

278
00:45:56,452 --> 00:46:00,221
Pamela Landy.

279
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:04,922
Nein.

280
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:15,303
Pamela Landy, bitte.

281
00:46:15,304 --> 00:46:20,004
Ja.

282
00:46:48,704 --> 00:46:52,107
Pamela Landy, please.
One moment, please.

283
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:55,844
Thank you.

284
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:58,913
I wanted to call a guest.
Pamela Landy.

285
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:01,850
Just one second, please.

286
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:05,954
Hello?

287
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:09,157
Hello?

288
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:13,891
I'm sorry, sir. The phone's busy right now.
Just try later. Thank you.

289
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:04,779
Okay. Let's take a look at the timeline.
What's Bourne's objective?

290
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,482
Now, I wanna break this out
in boxes.

291
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:11,486
Naples outbound. Check everything.
Flights, trains, police reports. That's box one.

292
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:16,187
- Teddy, that's yours.
- Got it.

293
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:18,993
Box number two.
Call it "prior connections. '"

294
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:23,694
I want to rerun all Bourne's
Treadstone material. Every footstep.

295
00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:27,235
Kim, box three.
I want to identify his method of travel.

296
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:29,871
Stay on the local cops.
We need a vehicle, a parking ticket, something.

297
00:48:29,872 --> 00:48:34,572
Langley's offered to upload
any satellite imaging we need, so let's find a target for them.

298
00:48:36,946 --> 00:48:41,216
Danny, box four. I need fresh eyes.
Review the buy where we lost the Neski files.

299
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:45,917
Timeline it with what we know about Bourne's movements.
Turn it upside down and see what we find.

300
00:48:48,224 --> 00:48:52,957
Come on, guys. We ran this guy's life
with total control for all those years.We should be a step ahead of him.

301
00:48:53,028 --> 00:48:57,728
You wanna go home?
Find Jason Bourne.

302
00:49:15,618 --> 00:49:20,318
- Pamela Landy.
- This is Jason Bourne.

303
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,125
- Bourne? It's Bourne. We need 90 seconds
to triangulate his position.

304
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:28,696
What do you want?

305
00:49:28,697 --> 00:49:33,397
Are you running Treadstone?

306
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,772
Treadstone was closed down
two years ago. You know that.

307
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:40,441
Then who's planning
the missions now?

308
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:45,142
There are no missions. It's over.

309
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:50,147
- Then what do you want with me?
- Berlin.

310
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:55,456
Have you forgotten
what happened in Berlin?

311
00:49:55,457 --> 00:49:58,860
You killed two people, Bourne.
You killed two people, Bourne.

312
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:03,031
You killed two people, Bourne.

313
00:50:03,032 --> 00:50:07,732
Neski ? Vladimir Neski ?
Vladimir Neski ?

314
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:21,082
Bourne?

315
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:24,586
I wanna come in.

316
00:50:24,587 --> 00:50:29,090
- Okay. How do you wanna do it?
- We need 35 seconds.

317
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:33,824
- I need someone I know to bring me in.
- Who?

318
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:37,765
There was a girl in Paris.
She was part of the program.

319
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:42,403
She used to handle logistics.
Alexander Strasse, 30 minutes, under the World Clock.

320
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:45,640
Send her alone.
Give her your phone.

321
00:50:45,641 --> 00:50:48,276
What if I can't find her?

322
00:50:48,277 --> 00:50:52,977
It's easy.
She's standing right next to you.

323
00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:08,997
- There's just so many areas ?
- It's a very simple layout.

324
00:51:08,998 --> 00:51:10,932
Get the second quadrant.
Pull it out.

325
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:14,469
Where is it? Get the second quadrant, please.
Pull it all the way up.

326
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,305
Clock is right here ? Shit, he's
put her in the middle of everything.

327
00:51:17,306 --> 00:51:20,308
This is a security nightmare.
There is no way we are going to get her covered ?

328
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:24,245
Call a Mayday into Berlin station.
We need snipers, D.O.D., whatever they've got.

329
00:51:24,246 --> 00:51:28,449
No snipers. You put snipers
on the roof and it'll scare him off, and I need answers.

330
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:32,720
- You can't really believe he wants to come in.
- He knows something about the Neski case.

331
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:36,591
- I'm not gonna pass up this chance to find out what it is.
- Don't be a fool. Not when we're this close.

332
00:51:36,592 --> 00:51:38,826
Are we talking about protecting Nicky
or killing Bourne?

333
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:43,821
- We're talking about killing Bourne.
- We're talking about the next dead body. It might be Nicky. It will be someone.

334
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:48,599
You're not hearing me.
Bourne dead gives me nothing.

335
00:51:49,638 --> 00:51:54,338
Can I talk to you privately?

336
00:51:57,746 --> 00:52:00,481
- What?
- I know how you're feeling.

337
00:52:00,482 --> 00:52:03,151
You lost two men in Berlin
and you want it to mean something.

338
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:05,186
But nothing Bourne gives you
will bring your men back.

339
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:09,657
Nothing in those files
makes their sacrifice worthwhile. You have to let go.

340
00:52:09,658 --> 00:52:13,327
We're professionals.
When an operation goes bad, we tie it off.

341
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:18,028
If there's something you're not telling me, I want it now before I send
that girl out there. Do you understand?

342
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:25,569
You talk about this stuff
like you read it in a book.

343
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,289
What do you want to do?

344
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,025
Put the snipers in place.

345
00:52:44,026 --> 00:52:47,261
If things go bad, we take him out.

346
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:51,962
You got it.

347
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:31,906
Hub, this is Survey One.
We have a crowd moving in.

348
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:36,210
- It's some sort of protest march.
- I'm sorry. This is as close as I can get.

349
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:40,214
- Survey Two, can you get in any closer?
- Kurt, make sure the south end is covered.

350
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:44,915
Roger. Affirmative. Copy that.

351
00:53:57,332 --> 00:54:01,936
Hello. There's a tram coming
towards you. Get on it.

352
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:04,872
- She's moving to the tram.
- Where's it going?

353
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:09,573
The tram is going
to Alexanderplatz Station.

354
00:54:12,948 --> 00:54:17,648
Survey Five, I can't see him.
I don't see him.

355
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:23,090
Hub, this is Survey Two,
she's getting on a tram.

356
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:25,226
- She's getting on the tram.
- Zoom in on the tram.

357
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,962
- Bourne's on the tram.
- I don't think he's on the tram.

358
00:54:27,963 --> 00:54:32,266
He's on the tram.

359
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:35,736
Send them in to follow.
Tell them to keep their distance.

360
00:54:35,737 --> 00:54:37,772
Okay, Delta, let's go.
Get on it.

361
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:41,142
Come on. Let's go.

362
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:45,843
- Tell her to hurry.
- There's nothing on the south side.

363
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:04,528
Alexanderplatz Station,
25 seconds.

364
00:55:17,612 --> 00:55:22,312
This is Survey Three. There's a lot of protesters here.
There's no way we can cover out there.

365
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:28,452
- Get her out of there.
- Go! Delta, move! Now!

366
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:48,342
- She's not here. She's gone.
- Goddamn it!

367
00:55:48,343 --> 00:55:50,644
- They are not on the tram.
- He's one guy!

368
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:54,015
- Jason, please don't hurt me.
- What were my words?

369
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:56,650
I said leave me alone,
leave me out of it.

370
00:55:56,651 --> 00:56:00,221
I did. I swear.
Jason, I told them that I believed you.

371
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:02,623
I'm gonna ask you
some simple questions.

372
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:06,460
You're gonna answer me honestly,
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you.

373
00:56:06,461 --> 00:56:09,196
- Delta, give me something.
- They're on it! They're on it!

374
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:11,499
Who's Pamela Landy?

375
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,069
- She's a task force chief.
- Is she running Treadstone?

376
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,905
No, she's the deputy director.
Why is she trying to kill me?

377
00:56:17,906 --> 00:56:21,976
Last week an agency field officer tried
to make a buy off of one other ops.

378
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:25,713
He was trying to sell out
a mole or something and you got to him before we did.

379
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:27,915
- I killed him?
- You left a print.

380
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:30,985
There were partial prints that trace back to Treadstone.
They know it was you.

381
00:56:30,986 --> 00:56:34,755
- That is insane.
- Why are you doing this? Why come back now?

382
00:56:34,756 --> 00:56:37,358
Landy will find ?
Stop. Stop.

383
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:41,662
Last week I was 4,000 miles away
in India, watching Marie die.

384
00:56:41,663 --> 00:56:44,665
They came for me,
and they killed her instead.

385
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:49,366
This ends now.

386
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,875
Find her.

387
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:58,913
What do you people want with me?
Why are you trying to frame me?

388
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:02,716
- Please! I'm only here because of Paris. Abbott dragged us ?
- Abbott? Who's Abbott?

389
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:04,718
Conklin's boss.
He-He shut down Treadstone.

390
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,587
Is he here in Berlin?
Yes.

391
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:08,589
Did he run Treadstone?

392
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,725
Did he run Treadstone?
Yes. Conklin reported to him.

393
00:57:11,726 --> 00:57:13,727
Please. Please, I swear ?

394
00:57:13,728 --> 00:57:17,898
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?
Conklin ? Stuff on Conklin.

395
00:57:17,899 --> 00:57:22,599
It was something to do
with a Russian politician.

396
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:32,075
Neski. Wh-What?
What are you talking about?

397
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:35,216
Training is over ? Training is over ?
Training is over ?

398
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:37,818
When ? When was I here in Berlin?

399
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:40,788
What are you talking about?
For Treadstone. I did a job here.

400
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:43,757
When? No, you never worked
in Berlin before.

401
00:57:43,758 --> 00:57:46,160
My first job. In Berlin.
You know my file.

402
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:49,096
- You've never worked Berlin before.
- My first job!

403
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:51,866
No, your first assignment was Geneva.
You fucking people!

404
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:55,102
I swear! I swear!
I know I was here, Nicky!

405
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:58,272
- It's not in your file!
- I know I was here!

406
00:57:58,273 --> 00:58:02,973
No, I swear ? Oh, please!

407
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:22,463
Pam, I want to show you something.
It's Alexanderplatz.

408
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:26,433
We got three levels, we got 15 tunnels.
They're all converging in a five-block radius.

409
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:28,502
Over here, Luftschulzbunker.
That was an old war shelter.

410
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:31,972
How many men are out there? Two coming down the back stairs.
The rest, they're fanned out for a search.

411
00:58:31,973 --> 00:58:34,808
- What's our security situation here?
- Where, "here"? The ground?

412
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:38,879
Here, here, in the building. Check
everything, and recheck all the stairwells, hallways, everything.

413
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,348
It's done.

414
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:45,853
Okay, let's go public.
Release his photo to the Berlin police.

415
00:58:45,854 --> 00:58:49,290
- And check out his story about the girlfriend in India too.
- I'm on it.

416
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:53,991
You're in a big puddle of shit, Pamela,
and you don't have the shoes for it.

417
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:57,198
- He said he didn't know anything about Berlin.
- He knew that Nicky was wearing a wire.

418
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,135
- Don't you think that was for our benefit?
- He didn't sound like a man in control to me.

419
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:03,470
We know he was in Berlin.

420
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:05,839
His mind is broken.
We broke it. And now ?

421
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,943
What now? Terminate him?
You've been pushing that agenda ever since we got here.

422
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:12,546
- He also said you were running Treadstone. Should we believe that too?
- I'm convinced Bourne knows something.

423
00:59:12,547 --> 00:59:14,615
He knows that you're after him,

424
00:59:14,616 --> 00:59:18,953
and in the interest of self-preservation
you might start with that.

425
00:59:18,954 --> 00:59:23,654
Check on those photos.
Have they gone out?

426
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:39,569
I need to show you something.

427
01:01:23,044 --> 01:01:27,081
All right, I finished my box work, but I
wanted to show you before I showed Landy.

428
01:01:27,082 --> 01:01:29,083
Came down here last night ...

429
01:01:29,084 --> 01:01:31,085
because none of this
is making any sense.

430
01:01:31,086 --> 01:01:33,587
I'm with you ? Conklin was a nut.
But a traitor?

431
01:01:33,588 --> 01:01:37,424
I just can't get there.
What do you have, Danny?

432
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:40,894
All right, you put a four-gam Kel on here,
it's gonna take out power to the building.

433
01:01:40,895 --> 01:01:43,163
You know that.

434
01:01:43,164 --> 01:01:48,192
There were two charges that were supposed to go off simultaneously.
The second one, over here, didn't go off.

435
01:01:48,303 --> 01:01:52,306
Now, first of all, this is nothing.
It's a sub-line for the breaker above.

436
01:01:52,307 --> 01:01:54,808
And second, why put the charge
all the way down here?

437
01:01:54,809 --> 01:01:59,509
If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear,
you're good enough to know you don't need this.

438
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:01,548
Bourne would know.

439
01:02:01,549 --> 01:02:04,118
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No.

440
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:08,088
But what if somebody were trying to cover their tracks
by blaming Conklin and Bourne?

441
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:12,789
What if Bourne didn't have
anything to do with this?

442
01:02:14,095 --> 01:02:16,397
- Show me again.
- All right.

443
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:21,098
Well, you put ?

444
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:47,691
Pull over. He's getting out.

445
01:02:48,696 --> 01:02:53,133
This is not a drill, soldier.
We clear on that?

446
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:57,834
This is a live project,
and you're a go.

447
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:04,174
I'll see you on the other side.

448
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:24,064
- Good evening, sir. How can I help you?
- I want to get a room for the night.

449
01:03:24,065 --> 01:03:28,765
Do you have a reservation?
No.

450
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:36,907
Actually, is room 645 available?
I've stayed there before.

451
01:03:40,882 --> 01:03:44,451
I'm sorry, sir. That room is occupied.
How about room 644?

452
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:47,054
It's right across the hall.

453
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:49,056
Sir?

454
01:03:49,057 --> 01:03:53,360
644?
That's fine. Thank you.

455
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:58,061
I just need your passport
and signature right here, please.

456
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:03,633
Have a nice night.

457
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:38,201
Ja.

458
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:06,529
Berlin Polizei.

459
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:22,883
Where?
Brecker Hotel.

460
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:24,851
Okay, we're there.
Take the van!

461
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:29,552
- Brecker? How far?
- About five or six minutes.

462
01:06:04,392 --> 01:06:07,527
Hi!

463
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:12,228
Hey!

464
01:06:46,801 --> 01:06:49,736
Congratulations, soldier.

465
01:06:49,737 --> 01:06:54,437
Training is over.

466
01:07:33,548 --> 01:07:38,248
Polizei! Polizei!

467
01:07:51,532 --> 01:07:56,232
Go!

468
01:08:19,227 --> 01:08:24,096
Black coat, possibly leather,
dark T-shirt, dark pants.

469
01:08:24,165 --> 01:08:28,502
The cops out there wanna corral all the guests together
and check 'em out one by one.

470
01:08:28,503 --> 01:08:30,771
That will really work.

471
01:08:30,772 --> 01:08:35,472
What the hell's he doing here?
Maybe he just wanted to stay the night.

472
01:09:09,477 --> 01:09:14,177
Polizei!

473
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:27,790
Polizei! Polizei!

474
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:35,431
Polizei! Polizei!

475
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:18,575
Polizei! Polizei!

476
01:12:13,461 --> 01:12:15,462
They missed him?
Yeah, so far.

477
01:12:15,463 --> 01:12:18,465
But they found Nicky.
She's back at the Westin. Bourne let her go.

478
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:21,768
He let her go?
Yeah.

479
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:25,739
Where's Danny Zorn? He ought to
head over there and debrief her.

480
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,741
Why did Bourne come here?

481
01:12:27,742 --> 01:12:31,044
We don't know yet.
Landy's upstairs in one of the rooms.

482
01:12:31,045 --> 01:12:35,745
She said she'd call you
when she's done.

483
01:12:36,183 --> 01:12:39,586
Okay.

484
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:44,287
I think I'll, uh ... take a cab
back to the hotel.

485
01:12:49,397 --> 01:12:52,065
So, the room he checked into
was across the hall.

486
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:54,100
Mmm.

487
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:58,801
Why would he come in here?

488
01:13:04,578 --> 01:13:09,278
What are you thinking?
I recognize this room from a photo.

489
01:13:09,517 --> 01:13:14,087
There was a chalk outline right here
around the body of Vladimir Neski.

490
01:13:14,088 --> 01:13:17,257
This is where
his wife killed him?

491
01:13:17,258 --> 01:13:21,958
Do you still think
his wife killed him?

492
01:13:28,536 --> 01:13:32,238
Guess he got out
through this window.

493
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:35,241
We just got word
from the Berlin police.

494
01:13:35,242 --> 01:13:39,942
They found Danny Zorn's body.

495
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:46,219
I want you two to stay on Bourne.
Check everything that's out there.

496
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,788
Call Abbott.
Tell him to wait for me in his hotel.

497
01:13:48,789 --> 01:13:53,489
I'm coming to see him.

498
01:14:19,453 --> 01:14:22,155
- Da.
- It's me.

499
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:25,458
They're onto Neski.

500
01:14:25,459 --> 01:14:28,461
This is not a clean phone.
They can't prove anything without Bourne.

501
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:31,431
Kill Bourne,
and you kill this investigation.

502
01:14:31,432 --> 01:14:35,969
I'm afraid, Ward, the time has come for us
to part company.

503
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:40,640
Listen, Yuri, you bought those oil leases
with 20 million in stolen C.I.A. seed money.

504
01:14:40,641 --> 01:14:43,109
You owe me.
I gave you your cut.

505
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,345
We both got rich.

506
01:14:45,346 --> 01:14:47,514
I don't owe you anything.

507
01:14:47,515 --> 01:14:51,151
The plan can still be salvaged.
Just get Bourne. You hear me?

508
01:14:51,152 --> 01:14:53,153
He's still out there.
Now get him.

509
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:57,854
Get Jason ?

510
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:19,609
I don't suppose it would do me
much good to cry for help, huh?

511
01:15:19,914 --> 01:15:23,149
Not much.

512
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:25,818
You killed her.

513
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:27,820
It was a mistake.

514
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:30,690
It was supposed to be you.

515
01:15:30,691 --> 01:15:34,694
There were files linking me
to the Neski murder.

516
01:15:34,695 --> 01:15:38,731
If the files disappeared
and they suspected you,

517
01:15:38,732 --> 01:15:40,900
they'd be chasing a ghost
for 10 years.

518
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:42,902
So we got in the way.

519
01:15:42,903 --> 01:15:46,339
Is that why Neski died?
Is that why you killed Marie?

520
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:48,341
You killed Marie ...

521
01:15:48,342 --> 01:15:50,343
the minute
you climbed into her car.

522
01:15:50,344 --> 01:15:53,346
The minute you entered her life,
she was dead.

523
01:15:53,347 --> 01:15:56,349
I told you people
to leave us alone.

524
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:58,851
I fell off the grid.
I was halfway around the world.

525
01:15:58,852 --> 01:16:01,754
There's no place
it won't catch up to you.

526
01:16:01,755 --> 01:16:04,224
It's how every story ends.

527
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:07,493
It's what you are, Jason ?
a killer.

528
01:16:07,494 --> 01:16:12,031
You always will be.

529
01:16:12,032 --> 01:16:16,732
Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!

530
01:16:17,304 --> 01:16:19,839
She wouldn't want me to.

531
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,540
That's the only reason
you're alive.

532
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:41,187
I'm a patriot.
I serve my country.

533
01:17:41,188 --> 01:17:45,888
And Danny Zorn?
What was he? Unlucky.

534
01:17:46,293 --> 01:17:50,993
Collateral damage.

535
01:17:51,098 --> 01:17:54,467
So, what do we do now?

536
01:17:54,468 --> 01:17:59,168
I'm not sorry.

537
01:18:55,863 --> 01:18:58,531
No, no, no, forget it.
Call me as soon as he's here.

538
01:18:58,532 --> 01:19:00,566
No, that's nothing.

539
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:03,002
- Good synch-up.
- Who's this guy?

540
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:05,238
Platform "B".

541
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:08,408
Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!

542
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:11,010
She wouldn't want me to.

543
01:19:11,011 --> 01:19:15,711
That's the only reason
you're alive.

544
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:26,993
Got a call from Langley.

545
01:19:26,994 --> 01:19:29,996
They're, uh, going through
Abbott's records,

546
01:19:29,997 --> 01:19:34,697
and Marshall wants to know
what's going on with Bourne.

547
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:38,604
Wait, Teddy. Teddy, who's this?
Look at this guy.

548
01:19:38,605 --> 01:19:40,773
He 's about to enter ?
Right there! There!

549
01:19:40,774 --> 01:19:43,109
Right through there.
That's Bourne.

550
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:46,279
- Get down here! We got something!
- We got a sighting! Check it out!

551
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,282
There. I got it on the big monitor.
Hold on.

552
01:19:49,283 --> 01:19:51,951
Here it comes again.

553
01:19:51,952 --> 01:19:54,754
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on. He's just entered frame.
- It's the coat. That's him!

554
01:19:54,755 --> 01:19:57,423
What train is that?

555
01:19:57,424 --> 01:20:02,124
- That's the train to Moscow.
- Why the hell would he go to Moscow?

556
01:20:03,063 --> 01:20:07,763
Get me
the Russian interior ministry.

557
01:23:33,073 --> 01:23:37,773
Da.

558
01:24:35,235 --> 01:24:39,935
Da.

559
01:36:31,317 --> 01:36:34,119
I speak English.

560
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:37,856
I'm not gonna hurt you.

561
01:36:37,857 --> 01:36:42,557
I won't hurt you.

562
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,300
You're older.

563
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:58,339
Older than I thought you'd be.

564
01:36:59,745 --> 01:37:04,316
That picture.

565
01:37:04,317 --> 01:37:08,987
Does that mean a lot to you?

566
01:37:08,988 --> 01:37:12,090
It's nothing.
It's just a picture.

567
01:37:12,091 --> 01:37:15,327
No.

568
01:37:15,328 --> 01:37:18,330
It's 'cause you don't know
how they died.

569
01:37:18,331 --> 01:37:21,600
I do.

570
01:37:21,601 --> 01:37:26,301
No, you don't.

571
01:37:29,108 --> 01:37:33,808
I would want to know.

572
01:37:35,781 --> 01:37:40,616
I would want to know that my ?
that my mother didn't kill my father,

573
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,889
that she didn't kill herself.

574
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:48,226
What?

575
01:37:48,227 --> 01:37:52,927
It's not what happened
to your parents.

576
01:37:58,571 --> 01:38:03,271
I killed them.

577
01:38:03,876 --> 01:38:08,046
I killed them.

578
01:38:08,047 --> 01:38:12,617
It was my job.

579
01:38:12,618 --> 01:38:17,318
It was my first time.

580
01:38:19,392 --> 01:38:24,092
Your father
was supposed to be alone.

581
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:31,603
But then your mother ...

582
01:38:31,604 --> 01:38:36,304
came out of nowhere,

583
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:42,310
and I had to change my plan.

584
01:38:45,885 --> 01:38:48,553
It changes things,

585
01:38:48,554 --> 01:38:50,555
that knowledge.

586
01:38:50,556 --> 01:38:55,256
Doesn't it?

587
01:38:57,897 --> 01:39:02,597
When what you love
gets taken from you,

588
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:09,771
you wanna know the truth.

589
01:39:26,559 --> 01:39:31,259
I'm sorry.

590
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:31,419
- Pamela Landy.
- I hear you're still looking for me.

591
01:40:34,627 --> 01:40:39,327
Bourne?
What do you want?

592
01:40:40,366 --> 01:40:43,401
I wanted to thank you ...

593
01:40:43,402 --> 01:40:45,603
for the tape.

594
01:40:45,604 --> 01:40:50,304
We got what we needed.
It's all tied off ... It's over.

595
01:40:51,377 --> 01:40:54,579
I guess I owe you an apology.

596
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:56,848
Is that official?

597
01:40:56,849 --> 01:41:00,552
No. Off the record.
You know how it is.

598
01:41:00,553 --> 01:41:02,454
Goodbye.

599
01:41:02,455 --> 01:41:07,155
Wait. Wait.

600
01:41:09,228 --> 01:41:11,229
David Webb.

601
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:13,231
That's your real name.

602
01:41:13,232 --> 01:41:17,932
You were born 4-15-71
in Nixa, Missouri.

603
01:41:19,138 --> 01:41:23,838
Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it.

604
01:41:25,678 --> 01:41:30,378
Bourne?

605
01:41:30,916 --> 01:41:35,616
Get some rest, Pam.
You look tired.
