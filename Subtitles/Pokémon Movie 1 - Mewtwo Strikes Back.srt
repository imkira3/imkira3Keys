1
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:32,652
August 6th.

2
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,165
Today my colleagues will reach the site
where ancient civilization may have
created a shrine to Mew,

3
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:44,260
the most powerful Poaémon to have
ever existed now believed to be extinct.

4
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,039
Giovanni's financing the expedition,

5
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:51,968
when he learned that my work's in the field
of cloning he agreed to fund my research...

6
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,314
but only if I would try to create for him
an enhanced living replica of Mew.

7
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:04,852
I had to agree. All he wants is
to control the most powerful Pokémon
the world's ever known.

8
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,119
I of course want something more, much more.

9
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:29,181
Mew.

10
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:39,818
Our team is bringing back
what we believe to be a Mew fossil.

11
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:42,062
I pray it's authentic.

12
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:45,559
If so I may finally have the DNA I need...

13
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,796
to create the Pokémon powerful enough
to survive the cloning process.

14
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:54,701
Perhaps then I can unloca the secret
to restoring life itself.

15
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:40,045
Where am l?.

16
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:42,679
Who am l?.

17
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,347
What am l?.

18
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:48,825
It's just like all the other clones, Doctor...
it doesn't gain consciousness.

19
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:52,865
I just don't understand it.
Its other vital signs are strong.

20
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,627
When measuring brain activity...

21
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:57,101
I sense others near me.

22
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,196
What are those strange sounds they make?.

23
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:02,798
Those are words. They're talking.

24
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,272
What're you?.

25
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,976
What'd you mean?. I'm a girl, a person.

26
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,848
A person?. Am I a person?.

27
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:17,754
Well you looa like a Pokémon
but you talk.

28
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,689
I didn't know a Pokémon could talk
like a person.

29
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:24,787
Pokémon?. Person?. What're those?.

30
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:26,763
Which one am l?.

31
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:31,764
Maybe it maaes a difference to you if you're
a Pokémon or a person but not to me.

32
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,436
If you're in this place I guess
you must be the same as all of us are.

33
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,546
What's that?.

34
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:49,213
I'm not sure but Mewtwo and Ambertwo
seem to be communicating with
the other clones.

35
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:49,948
But how?.

36
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:52,321
They could be using telepathy.

37
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,002
Soon.

38
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:20,043
Everybody here's a copy that's why
there's a two after all of our names.

39
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:21,779
I don't understand.

40
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:25,881
They call me Ambertwo
but I'm still really Amber.

41
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:42,566
Please, please let my theories be true.

42
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:46,305
I must see my little girl's smile again.

43
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:53,977
Dear.

44
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:58,484
I've reawakened her consciousness
here in this chamber.

45
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:02,253
I just need to keep it viable long
enough to complete the process.

46
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:05,832
Why are you doing this?.
You can't bring Amber back.

47
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:11,495
You're wrong. Look! She lives
within this light. Her energy's undeniable.

48
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:17,136
If my cloning theories are correct,
we'll have Amber back with us one day soon.

49
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:23,205
I loved our daughter as much as you did
but she's gone, no one can bring her back,

50
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:28,778
and I can't go on watching you try.
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

51
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:39,527
I will do anything to see you again.

52
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:44,226
So how are they doing today?.

53
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:45,963
You should be very pleased, Doctor.

54
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:50,169
The Pokémon clones are in stable condition
and Mewtwo is getting stronger everyday.

55
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:55,112
One of them is bound to survive. It looas like
all our hard work is finally paying off.

56
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:58,407
Yes, Giovanni will be very happy lim sure.

57
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:02,352
He may soon have
the most powerful Poaémon in the world.

58
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,549
But I'll get something much more precious,

59
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:09,590
knowledge of how to recreate life...

60
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:15,123
then I'll use it to bring her back.

61
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:30,315
I call this my Remember Place.
This is where I used to live.

62
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:35,080
What is that?.

63
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,485
That's the sun.

64
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,023
What is it for?.

65
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,856
It makes the whole world bright
and it keeps us warm all day.

66
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:47,063
That's called wind.

67
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,225
Wind?.

68
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:56,675
The wind helps us along. Sometimes
it's soft and sometimes it's very strong.

69
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,712
And that's the sunset.

70
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:05,250
That's when the sun says good night,
see you tomorrow.

71
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:07,083
Is that a sun?.

72
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:09,712
No, thatis the moon...

73
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,693
and the stars are the little lights
that twinkle all night just so
we won't feel alone in the dark.

74
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:25,534
We're losing all readings
from Charmandertwo.

75
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:27,764
No, not again!

76
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:39,143
Bulbasaurtwo and Squirtletwo are fading
the same way!.

77
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:41,413
It looks like another failure.

78
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,089
Where did they go?.

79
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:09,604
Doctor, we're losing her too.

80
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,252
Amber.

81
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:23,262
What's wrong, Amber?. What's happening?.

82
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:26,763
It feels like itis time to say goodbye.

83
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,261
Goodbye?.

84
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:38,311
I feel something...

85
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,713
what're these?.

86
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:45,512
They're tears, you're crying.

87
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:47,111
Crying?.

88
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,518
My Daddy used to tell me a bedtime story...

89
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:54,788
that when Pokémon are sad and they cry,
their tears are filled with light.

90
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:58,690
I'm so sad.

91
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:00,791
I have to go.

92
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,299
Why?.

93
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:05,470
I don't anow but it's alright.

94
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,835
Thank you for caring about me...

95
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:09,532
and don't cry Mewtwo.

96
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:14,943
You should be happy you're alive
and life is wonderful...

97
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:28,854
These tears what good are they?.

98
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:32,158
Please Amber come back!

99
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,460
Don't go please...

100
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:36,768
Amber!.

101
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:40,337
Doctor, Mewtwo's brain waves
are out of control.

102
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:42,964
It's getting too upset.
It mustn't remember this.

103
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:45,806
Administer the serum...do it immediately!

104
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:47,777
I'll try a hundred units.

105
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:56,917
1 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1 00

106
00:09:57,057 --> 00:09:59,355
What's happening?. Is it working?.

107
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:04,628
Its brain waves are going back to normal.
Everything seems okay, Doctor.

108
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:09,326
Nothing is okay. My Amber is gone forever...

109
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,662
only Mewtwo survives.

110
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,277
I have slept for so long.
It seems like forever.

111
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:27,986
But I remember something, someone.

112
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:32,452
Life is wonderful.

113
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,859
But why?.

114
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:03,281
Life:. the great miracle...
and the great mystery.

115
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:16,327
Since the beginning, humans and Pokémon
alike have searched for its meaning.

116
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:25,610
Many strange and wondrous legends evolved
from the pursuit of life's mysteries.

117
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:35,515
But none is stranger than this tale...

118
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:38,591
of the most powerful Poaémon of all!

119
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,383
Where am l?.

120
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:11,155
This...this is not the same!

121
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:15,386
Was everything before...just a dream?.

122
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,658
Why...?.!.

123
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,570
Doctor! Look at this!

124
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:26,604
What?.

125
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:29,174
Its brain waves...they're surging!

126
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,300
Let me see!. She's right.

127
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:32,776
Let's run another scan.

128
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,813
Its mind is racing!

129
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:36,914
Those voices...

130
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:38,841
I hope we don't lose this one.

131
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:40,146
They're outside...

132
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:41,311
We can't lose this one!

133
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:43,586
Where I must be...!

134
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,161
Radio Giovanni's helicopter.
Tell him what's happened.

135
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:57,236
Quiet!

136
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:00,371
Let us hear it's psychic powers!

137
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,271
Psychic...powers?.

138
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:08,513
For years we struggled to successfully
clone a Poaémon to prove our theories...

139
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:10,810
but you're the first specimen to survive!

140
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:17,412
That is Mew, the rarest of all Pokémon.
From its DNA we created you, Mewtwo!

141
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:19,253
Mewtwo!

142
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:23,890
That I am only a copy...
nothing but Mew's shadow?.

143
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:28,229
You are greater than Mew, improved
through the power of human ingenuity!

144
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:33,405
We used the most advanced techniques
to develop your awesome psychic powers!

145
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:37,904
So I am simply the end result
of your experiment.

146
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,643
What becomes of me
now that your experiment is over?.

147
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:44,006
Oh, our experiment isn't over yet.
It's just beginning!

148
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:45,982
Now the serious testing begins!

149
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:49,384
These humans, they care nothing for me.

150
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:51,251
Congratulations!

151
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:54,019
We've done it. Excellent job!

152
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:57,994
Is the new tank ready?.

153
00:13:58,097 --> 00:13:59,564
No...we'll have to come up with
a cage for it.

154
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,224
Congratulations...

155
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,697
Science...

156
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,736
Excellent!
We'll start our testing right away.

157
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,707
Is that my purpose?.

158
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:16,238
Am I just an experiment...
a laboratory specimen?!.

159
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:19,648
This cannot be...my destiny!

160
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:58,819
We dreamed of creating
the world's strongest Pokémon.

161
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:03,285
And we succeeded!

162
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:37,522
Behold my powers!
I am the strongest Pokémon in the world.

163
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:40,126
Stronger even...than Mew!

164
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:53,444
Those fools thought
you were a science experiment.

165
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,138
But l...I see you as a valuable partner.

166
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,350
Partner?!.

167
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:07,086
With your psychic powers and my resources,
together we can control the world!

168
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:10,390
I do not need your help for that, human!

169
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:13,397
A wildfire destroys everything in its path.

170
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:16,900
It will be the same with your powers...
unless you learn to control them.

171
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:18,197
I can help you do that.

172
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:19,737
How?.

173
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:25,000
Trust me and I'll show you a way to focus
your powers that will make you invincible.

174
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,276
Show me.

175
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:56,239
You say this armor protects my body...
yet it suppresses my powers.

176
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:59,778
Your powers are not being suppressed,
they are being focused.

177
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,212
Learn to use them
to accomplish your purpose.

178
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,316
What is that?.

179
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:09,047
Patience my friend...
your purpose will become clear.

180
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,739
So this is my power.

181
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:51,459
I am in control now.

182
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:21,391
But why am I here?.

183
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:44,181
Now I fully perceive my power!
But...what is my purpose?.

184
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:51,679
To serve your master. You were created
to fight for me! That is your purpose!.

185
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:58,429
That cannot be! You said we were partners!.
We stood as equals!

186
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:03,996
You were created by humans to obey humans.
You could never be our equal.

187
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:09,040
Humans may have created me...
but they will never enslave me!.

188
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:11,966
This cannot be...my destiny!

189
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:14,406
Stop this now!.

190
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:18,414
I was not born a Pokémon.
I was created.

191
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:24,514
And my creators have used and betrayed me.
So...I stand alone!

192
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:02,388
Who am l?.

193
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:07,261
What is my true reason for being?.

194
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:11,469
I will find my own purpose...

195
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:18,268
and purge this planet of all who oppose me
...human and Pokémon alike!

196
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,537
The world will heed my warning:

197
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:26,908
The reign of Mewtwo...

198
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:29,418
will soon begin.

199
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:57,910
Mewtwo Striaes Back

200
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:06,817
Today Ash, Brock and Misty are taking
a short break from their Pokémon adventures.

201
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:12,090
As always, Ash is determined to become
a Pokémon Master, and as always,

202
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:15,497
he's ready to endure any hardship,
bear any burden,

203
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:19,935
with strength,
stamina and a will of steel!

204
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:22,131
Hungry...need food.

205
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:25,335
No, Ash! You haven't done a thing all day!.

206
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:29,914
I'm too weak to work Misty...
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

207
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:31,040
No!

208
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,017
This lunch is gonna be just perfect
for you Ash...

209
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,788
it's my lazy boy i'no-chew" stew.

210
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:48,031
Hey...you there!

211
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:51,797
I'm looking for a Pokémon trainer named Ash
from Pallet Town!

212
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:53,030
Do you know him?.

213
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:54,333
Yeah he's me.

214
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:58,700
Let's have a match...
unless you're afraid to lose!

215
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:02,045
I'm afraid you're gonna lose this one!

216
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,776
Ash! You just said
you were too weak to work!

217
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:08,342
That's right. I am too weak to work
but a Pokémon battle isn't work!

218
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:11,681
That's progress...
at least his mouth is working.

219
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:30,124
Nice job, Bulbasaur!
You did it!

220
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:44,398
Oh...Oh, no!!!

221
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,438
We did it!!!

222
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:49,676
Well that sure was a shocking ending.

223
00:24:49,782 --> 00:24:52,410
Shocking that Ash moved so fast!

224
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,291
There's another credit
on Pikachu's i'charge account."

225
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:03,020
We've got to grab it!

226
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:05,892
I know we gotta grab some rare Pokémon
for the Boss,

227
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:10,162
but it wouldn't be such a bad idea if we
grabbed a little bite to eat, would it?.

228
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,703
We didn't come here to steal a meal!

229
00:25:13,005 --> 00:25:15,735
I'd settle for a taste of that Pika-chow!

230
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,808
I'm starvin'.

231
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:23,609
I can cook something!

232
00:25:23,716 --> 00:25:28,050
Thanks but the last time you cooked
you wiped out eight of my nine lives.

233
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,514
Master, shall I extend an invitation
to these trainers as well?.

234
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,654
As you wish.

235
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,549
Hey, watch where you're flying.

236
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,059
Something is for me?.

237
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:53,200
Greetings Pokémon trainers!
I bear an invitation.

238
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:55,773
She's really small but really pretty!

239
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:59,241
You have been chosen to join
a select group of Pokémon trainers...

240
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:00,369
at a special gathering.

241
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:04,381
It will be hosted by my master,
the world's greatest Pokémon trainer,

242
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:06,678
at his palace on New lsland.

243
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:09,481
A chartered ferry will leave
from Old Shore Wharf...

244
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,613
to take you to the island
this afternoon.

245
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,725
Only trainers who present this invitation
will be admitted.

246
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:18,393
If you decide to attend
you must reply at once.

247
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:20,460
My Master awaits you.

248
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,904
Ah...is there a rewind button?.

249
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:27,931
Should we go?.

250
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,565
Of course we should!!
I've gotta meet her!!

251
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,540
I guess the world's number one trainer
wants to challenge me to a match!

252
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,776
Well...we gotta let them know right away.

253
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:39,373
I'm saying yes!

254
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:53,388
We wanna know what's so special
about the twerp trio's special delivery!

255
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:58,163
Hey, look!

256
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,170
"Yes"?. To what?.

257
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:48,946
Chill out, Raticate!

258
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:51,845
Kingler, save your energy will ya.

259
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:53,985
This is gonna be so cool!

260
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,418
Officer Jenny, please report
to the ferry entrance.

261
00:29:56,522 --> 00:29:58,990
Officer Jenny,
to the ferry entrance, please.

262
00:30:02,728 --> 00:30:04,923
Togepi's totally soaked!

263
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:08,233
I can't believe
how fast the storm came up.

264
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:15,365
What?!. The ferry is cancelled?.!

265
00:30:15,474 --> 00:30:17,169
But I've gotta get to New lsland!

266
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:18,208
Yeah, so do l!

267
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:20,402
What's the big deal?!.
It's only a little rain!

268
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:21,911
It's more than just rain!

269
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:24,744
The Harbor Manager thinks
this could be the worst storm ever!

270
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,549
Listen to me!

271
00:30:26,718 --> 00:30:30,085
The prophets have predicted
the return of the Winds of Water.

272
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:31,888
For years I have prayed...

273
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,359
...that mankind would never witness...
...that deadly storm ever again.

274
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:38,491
Isn't that just a legend?.

275
00:30:38,597 --> 00:30:42,966
The ancient writings tell of the storm
wiping out all but a few Pokémon.

276
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:45,093
In their sorrow
the water of their tears...

277
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:48,696
somehow restored the lives
lost in the storm.

278
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:51,034
But there are no Pokémon tears today.

279
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,309
Just waters which no one can survive.

280
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:57,211
And that's why your ferry to New lsland
has been cancelled.

281
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:02,145
Well I'm going to New lsland anyway!
All my Pokémon are water type!

282
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,518
We'll just swim over to that palace!

283
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:08,285
I warn you, the waves will be savage,
you will never make it!

284
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,825
And besides...if you tried that stunt
and your Pokémon got hurt...

285
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,058
you'd be out of luck because we had to
close down the Poaémon Center!

286
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,833
Uhh, how come?!.

287
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:20,468
Because the nurse in charge of
the center disappeared last month!

288
00:31:20,572 --> 00:31:23,735
And if any of you see her
please contact me at once!

289
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,436
That's a picture of her over there
on the wall!

290
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,741
She's cute!

291
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:33,343
She sure looks familiar.

292
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:54,297
Come back here!
Or I'll place you under arrest!!

293
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:58,576
Come back...

294
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:01,441
Some trainers have no fear.

295
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:07,146
To them this is just one more challenge.
They follow their hearts.

296
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:11,552
That is what sets them apart...
and will make them Pokémon masters.

297
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,328
Good luck to all of you.

298
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:28,200
The world's greatest Pokémon Master
is waiting for me!

299
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,170
Let's use our Pokémon
to get to that island!

300
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:36,142
Ash, our Pokémon aren't strong enough
they can't handle giant waves liae this!

301
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:37,947
Guess you're right.

302
00:32:43,522 --> 00:32:46,650
You vant to cross maybe?.
Ve take you ya!

303
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,988
Ve Vikings are used to big vave.

304
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:52,757
Ve get you to New lsland faster dan
you can say farvhegnugen!

305
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:56,090
Stroke, stroke.

306
00:32:57,636 --> 00:33:01,629
Stroke, stroke, stroke.

307
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,105
I think I'm gonna have one.

308
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:05,472
I didn't know Vikings still existed.

309
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:07,770
They mostly live in Minnesota.

310
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:11,007
Something is not right.
Are you sure this boat's safe?.

311
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:15,514
Don't vorry, dis ship won't let you down!

312
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,885
Ve always sail in da rough veather!
Don't get upset!

313
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:20,822
Tell my stomach.

314
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:24,888
Heave! Ho! Heave!
Ho! Heave! Ho!...

315
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:28,722
It's all right, Togepi. We're gonna be OK.

316
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,633
Heave! Ho! Heave!...

317
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:49,412
Those aren't Vikings!

318
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:50,715
It's Team Rocket!

319
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:54,724
I should've known there was something fishy
about them besides the way they smell!

320
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,059
Prepare for trouble!

321
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,754
Make it double!

322
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:02,159
Forget the motto! We're gonna
have to "wave" g'b-y-y-y-e!

323
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:15,912
Ash! Misty!

324
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:22,049
Have you seen Ash and Piaachu?.

325
00:34:22,154 --> 00:34:23,143
Not yet!

326
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,961
Stay together! It's our only hope!

327
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:51,568
Hey, look!

328
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:35,915
My Master bids you welcome to New lsland.
Will you kindly present your invitation?.

329
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,316
Here it is Miss!.

330
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:44,895
The bearers of this invitation
may be admitted to New lsland.

331
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:48,295
I knew I recognized that face!

332
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:49,722
What?.

333
00:36:51,536 --> 00:36:54,562
Aren't you the nurse who's missing
from the treatment center?!.

334
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:56,639
You do look just like her!

335
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:58,265
I fear you are mistaken.

336
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:02,676
I have always dwelt on this island
...and have always been
in the service of my Master.

337
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:05,442
Please...come this way.

338
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:08,583
My Master awaits your arrival.

339
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:36,365
Now that you are here,

340
00:38:36,474 --> 00:38:40,171
all trainers worthy of an audience
with my Master are present.

341
00:38:46,851 --> 00:38:48,318
There's only three of them!

342
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,650
Aren't we gonna wait for the others?.

343
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:52,984
Only the trainers capable of
braving the storm...

344
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:56,288
have proven themselves worthy
in my Master's eyes.

345
00:38:56,394 --> 00:38:59,227
Do you mean that storm was
some kinda test?!.

346
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:03,260
Please release your Pokémon
from their Pokéballs and join the others.

347
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:07,335
It will not be long before
my Master's intentions are clear.

348
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:20,148
Locked out...now we'll never anow
what kind of party we're missing!

349
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:22,344
Then we'll just have to
crash that party!

350
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:24,183
You know another way in?.

351
00:39:24,356 --> 00:39:25,687
Look over there!

352
00:39:30,895 --> 00:39:33,989
But Jessy! How are we gonna
swim up that thing?.

353
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:36,124
Pretend you're a catfish!

354
00:39:42,073 --> 00:39:43,836
Something wrong, Jessy?.

355
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:46,407
No. Come on, letis get going!

356
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,138
I think this plan's all wet!

357
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,989
What took you guys so long?.

358
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:02,584
How'd you get here?.

359
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,685
I decided to fly over.

360
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:08,630
It was easy...hurricane winds are
a breeze for Pidgeotto here.

361
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:10,491
Hey, guys, say hello!

362
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:18,300
A Gyarados!

363
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,105
Those're my Pokémon!

364
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:23,137
There was no problem
getting through that storm!

365
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:25,273
I rode over on Gyarados' back!

366
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:28,811
Wow, I heard it takes a lotta skill
to train Gyarados!

367
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,084
Yeah! But once you train it,
it's the most dependable Pokémon there is!

368
00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:38,587
You haven't met my Pokémon
...over there!

369
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:03,585
You are about to meet my Master.

370
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:07,618
The time has come for your encounter
with the greatest Pokémon Master on earth.

371
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:21,302
What's that?.

372
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:14,822
Yes! The world's greatest Pokémon Master
is also the most powerful Pokémon on earth!

373
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:19,260
This is the ruler of New lsland,
and soon, the whole world...

374
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:20,661
Mewtwo...

375
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:22,790
Mew...two!?.

376
00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:27,128
A Pokemon can't be a Pokémon master!
No way!!.

377
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,129
Quiet human!

378
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,765
From now on I am the one
who makes the rules.

379
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,341
How's it talking?.!

380
00:42:33,444 --> 00:42:34,138
It's psychic!

381
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:01,562
We'll show you!
Let's go, Gyarados!!

382
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:07,636
Gyarados Hyper Beam Attack!

383
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,761
Gyarados!

384
00:43:27,465 --> 00:43:29,296
Childis play.

385
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:31,358
Your usefulness has ended.

386
00:43:41,946 --> 00:43:43,106
Nurse Joy!

387
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:47,312
Where am l?.
And how in the world did I get here?.

388
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:49,386
You have been under my control.

389
00:43:49,954 --> 00:43:53,253
I transported you here
from the Pokémon Center.

390
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:58,062
Your knowledge of Pokémon physiology
proved useful for my plan.

391
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:02,926
And now I have cleansed your tiny human
brain of memories from the past few weeks.

392
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:04,126
Who are you!

393
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:09,306
I am the new ruler of this world,
the Master of humans and Pokémon alike.

394
00:44:09,574 --> 00:44:11,064
You're just a bully!

395
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:41,765
Look at these.

396
00:44:51,616 --> 00:44:53,208
They're Pokémon!

397
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:55,385
Are they real?.

398
00:45:00,425 --> 00:45:02,256
I was hoping there would be a party.

399
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:15,529
This is the Pokémon replication system...
system activated...

400
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:18,535
Pokémon based on genetic analysis...

401
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,678
Pokémon DNA sampling sequence
now in progress.

402
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:26,076
Hey! Put me down!
What are you...Iet go!

403
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:29,683
Help!!!.

404
00:45:29,787 --> 00:45:31,118
Meowth! Grab him!

405
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:32,946
Help me!!!.

406
00:45:39,797 --> 00:45:42,561
I made it...but just by a hair!.

407
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,526
Look! There's your hair!

408
00:45:45,636 --> 00:45:50,938
Analyzing Pokémon bio-material sample...
analysis complete...

409
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:54,135
Pokémon identified:
begin replication sequence.

410
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:55,371
Who's that Pokémon?.

411
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,504
It's Meowth!

412
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,223
Meowth!!!

413
00:46:07,925 --> 00:46:09,586
But I'm Meowth!

414
00:46:09,694 --> 00:46:11,184
So's the one in the tank!

415
00:46:11,295 --> 00:46:12,592
That's your clone!.

416
00:46:12,697 --> 00:46:13,425
Huh?!.!

417
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:19,469
! haven't got much time.! pray
this record of our experiment survives.

418
00:46:19,737 --> 00:46:22,331
A year ago we discovered a fossil
that proved to be the remains...

419
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,670
of the ancient Pokémon...Mew!.

420
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:29,012
There was sufficient genetic material
to replicate Mew,

421
00:46:29,113 --> 00:46:30,876
but Giovanni, who funded our project,

422
00:46:30,982 --> 00:46:35,316
insisted we try to design super-clones,
more powerful than any living Pokémon.

423
00:46:35,486 --> 00:46:38,944
Many attempts failed. But finally,
our experiments proved successful.

424
00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:42,890
We produced a living Pokémon.
We called it "Mewtwo. "

425
00:46:44,195 --> 00:46:47,392
But for some reason
the creature 's anger is out of control.

426
00:46:47,498 --> 00:46:50,990
With its psychic powers
it is destroying our laboratory.

427
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:56,339
We dreamed of creating the world's
sotrongest Pokémon. And we succeeded!

428
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,635
Sounds like a real Pokénstein!

429
00:47:01,746 --> 00:47:02,974
Sure does.

430
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,207
One b-a-a-d cat!

431
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:07,914
So this must be the lab.

432
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,884
But if Mewtwo destroyed it...

433
00:47:09,987 --> 00:47:11,716
...somebody rebuilt it!

434
00:47:11,823 --> 00:47:13,916
Yes, but who?.

435
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:20,024
You humans are a dangerous species.

436
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:24,894
You brought me into your world
with no purpose but to be your slave.

437
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:28,132
But now I have my own purpose:.

438
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:34,370
My storm will create my own world...
by destroying yours!

439
00:47:34,812 --> 00:47:39,215
So you hate all humans...and you're gonna
destroy us to save Pokémon!?.!

440
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:44,087
No. Your Pokémon will not be spared!

441
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:47,587
They have disgraced themselves
by serving humans.

442
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:50,190
Those Pokémon are nothing but slaves!

443
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:55,994
So you say I am wrong...

444
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:59,500
that you are not this human's servant,
you are his friend?!.

445
00:48:00,538 --> 00:48:02,836
You're as pathetic as the rest.

446
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:12,240
Pikachu!

447
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,410
Humans and Pokémon can never be friends!

448
00:48:16,254 --> 00:48:18,415
Ash! Are you okay?!.

449
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:20,721
Don't pick on Pikachu!

450
00:48:21,492 --> 00:48:26,862
If you are a Pokémon, there's no reason
I can't capture you. Go, Rhyhorn!

451
00:48:48,085 --> 00:48:49,575
No!! Rhyhorn!!

452
00:48:49,687 --> 00:48:50,745
Fools!

453
00:48:50,855 --> 00:48:53,255
Your Pokémon attacas cannot weaken me!

454
00:48:53,357 --> 00:48:56,793
My powers are too great!
No trainer can conquer me!

455
00:48:56,894 --> 00:48:59,260
Then you won't mind proving it
in a real match!

456
00:48:59,363 --> 00:49:01,024
Is that a challenge?.

457
00:49:01,132 --> 00:49:02,463
You bet it is!!

458
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:21,975
They're awake!

459
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:10,798
I'm scared!

460
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:11,595
Me too!

461
00:50:11,702 --> 00:50:12,930
Me-owth!

462
00:50:15,272 --> 00:50:17,331
Liae most Pokémon trainers,

463
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:21,070
I too began with Charmander,
Squirtle and Bulbasaur.

464
00:50:21,545 --> 00:50:24,036
But for their evolved forms,

465
00:50:24,148 --> 00:50:28,380
I used their genetic material to clone
even more powerful copies.

466
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:29,508
Copies!?.

467
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,144
They're clones!.

468
00:50:57,882 --> 00:51:01,477
A stadium! Mewtwo planned
this all along!

469
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:05,578
Your fake Venusaur can't beat
my real one. Right Bruteroot?!.

470
00:51:06,791 --> 00:51:09,954
We'll blow away that Blastoise,
won't we, Shellshocker!

471
00:51:11,462 --> 00:51:15,228
It may not have a nickname
but I do have...a Charizard!

472
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:16,299
I choose you!

473
00:51:28,512 --> 00:51:31,310
Charizard...I didn't say start?.!

474
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,924
Your Charizard is poorly trained.

475
00:51:59,443 --> 00:52:02,071
Which of you will oppose me first?.

476
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:11,046
I underestimated you last time,
but that won't happen again!

477
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:30,065
Go. Bruteroot! Razor Leaf!

478
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:32,474
Vine Whip!

479
00:52:47,858 --> 00:52:49,052
Bruteroot!

480
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,093
It looks like I'm up! Go, Shellshocker!

481
00:52:58,202 --> 00:53:00,329
Shellshocker, Hydro Pump!

482
00:53:07,545 --> 00:53:09,103
Shellshocker!

483
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:13,139
You better forfeit Ash!
Those clones are too powerful!

484
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,274
I'm not giving up!

485
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,786
Charizard! Use your speed,
not power, and you'll win!

486
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:26,261
All right! Go!

487
00:53:40,644 --> 00:53:42,441
Can't Charizard move any quicker!?.

488
00:53:42,546 --> 00:53:44,343
The clone is too fast!

489
00:54:04,268 --> 00:54:05,735
Charizard's in trouble!

490
00:54:05,836 --> 00:54:06,734
Finish it!

491
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,578
No! Charizard...no...are you okay?.

492
00:54:23,387 --> 00:54:29,223
As the victor, I now claim my prize...
your Pokémon!

493
00:54:32,263 --> 00:54:33,423
Hey, wait!!

494
00:54:38,202 --> 00:54:39,931
What are you gonna do
with those Pokémon!?.

495
00:54:40,404 --> 00:54:43,965
I will extract their DNA
to make clones for myself.

496
00:54:44,108 --> 00:54:46,542
They will remain safe
on this island with me,

497
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:48,737
while my storm destroys the planet.

498
00:54:48,846 --> 00:54:50,040
You can't do this!

499
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:52,481
Yeah, Mewtwo! We won't let you!

500
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,718
Do not attempt to defy me!!!

501
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,115
This is my world now!

502
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:05,057
Uh, oh!!

503
00:55:05,162 --> 00:55:06,652
Let's go!!

504
00:55:13,637 --> 00:55:14,968
Gyarados!

505
00:55:20,177 --> 00:55:21,303
Get away!

506
00:55:53,077 --> 00:55:54,772
Hey! I know!

507
00:55:54,878 --> 00:55:58,473
Mewtwo can't capture them
if they're already inside their Pokéballs!

508
00:55:58,582 --> 00:56:00,516
Bulbasaur! Squirtle! Return!

509
00:56:02,786 --> 00:56:03,684
It is no use!

510
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:12,453
This futile to try and escape my power.

511
00:56:12,763 --> 00:56:15,857
Never mind the Pokéballs!
Carry them away!

512
00:56:18,268 --> 00:56:19,462
Give back my Psyduck!

513
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:21,895
Vulpix!

514
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,611
Run, Pikachu!

515
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:47,658
Pikachu!!

516
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:01,541
Keep running Pikachu!!!

517
00:57:43,687 --> 00:57:45,086
Pikachu!

518
00:58:03,841 --> 00:58:06,401
You're not gonna get Pikachu!

519
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:14,506
There goes...

520
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:21,782
...Alakazam?. Dewgong?. Vileplume!

521
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,430
Sandshrew! Nidoqueen! Vaporeon!

522
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:34,361
But me...I got a special place
in my tail for this one!

523
00:58:41,678 --> 00:58:42,667
Look there!

524
00:58:45,716 --> 00:58:47,775
I don't have time
for your dumb motto today!

525
00:58:52,823 --> 00:58:54,688
Who's that Pokémon?.

526
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,122
It's Pikachuuuu!!!

527
00:58:56,627 --> 00:59:00,085
Let go!! Stupid machine!!

528
00:59:00,197 --> 00:59:04,031
Give me back my Pikachu!!! Aaaah!!

529
00:59:08,872 --> 00:59:09,896
What's happenin'?!.

530
00:59:28,592 --> 00:59:30,025
Pikachuuuu!!

531
00:59:34,631 --> 00:59:36,428
I'm so glad you're okay.

532
00:59:42,606 --> 00:59:44,506
The copies are hatching!

533
00:59:52,783 --> 00:59:54,910
They're fabulous fakes!

534
00:59:55,018 --> 00:59:56,781
Send in the clones!

535
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:59,048
But where are the real ones?.

536
01:00:03,894 --> 01:00:05,486
I wonder if they feel...

537
01:00:05,596 --> 01:00:06,927
...clonesome.

538
01:00:19,343 --> 01:00:20,867
The Poké-originals!

539
01:00:28,118 --> 01:00:29,551
Squirtleis back!!

540
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:40,159
You're all OK!

541
01:01:09,493 --> 01:01:12,053
Humans...you have served my purpose.

542
01:01:12,162 --> 01:01:15,563
I am sparing your lives...
for the moment..

543
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:26,632
But you cannot escape your fate.

544
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:30,179
The hour of my vengeance draws near...

545
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:40,722
Behold.

546
01:01:42,926 --> 01:01:45,656
With Pokémon and humans eliminated...

547
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:48,026
the clones shall inherit the world!

548
01:01:48,131 --> 01:01:51,760
You can't do this. I won't let you!

549
01:01:58,241 --> 01:01:59,173
It's Ash!

550
01:01:59,276 --> 01:01:59,970
All right!

551
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,384
Psyduck!

552
01:02:11,521 --> 01:02:12,681
Vulpix!

553
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,655
It is useless to challenge me!

554
01:02:18,762 --> 01:02:22,789
It's not gonna end like this, Mewtwo...
We wonit let it!

555
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,962
You're mine.

556
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:37,843
Ash! No!

557
01:02:37,948 --> 01:02:39,074
Look out!

558
01:02:46,022 --> 01:02:47,148
What?!.!

559
01:02:54,731 --> 01:02:56,323
Can it be!?.

560
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:20,454
What is that?.

561
01:03:20,557 --> 01:03:21,854
I don't anow.

562
01:03:23,093 --> 01:03:26,790
Mew! So finally we meet.

563
01:03:27,697 --> 01:03:28,459
Mew!

564
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:33,334
I may have been cloned from your DNA,

565
01:03:33,436 --> 01:03:38,931
but now I will prove that Mewtwo is better
than the original, superior to Mew!

566
01:03:41,044 --> 01:03:42,739
Mew and Mewtwo?!.

567
01:03:42,846 --> 01:03:45,178
So Mewtwo was cloned from Mew?.

568
01:03:47,784 --> 01:03:51,049
This world is too small
for two of us!!!

569
01:04:02,632 --> 01:04:04,532
Why do you flee from me?!.

570
01:04:04,835 --> 01:04:08,202
Are you afraid to find out
which of us is greater?!!.

571
01:04:32,395 --> 01:04:33,327
Hah!!!

572
01:04:42,572 --> 01:04:45,598
So you do have some fight in you.

573
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:48,944
But I have no time for games.

574
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:50,671
Destiny is at hand.

575
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:54,544
Who will rule?. My super Pokémon...

576
01:04:54,718 --> 01:04:59,178
or your pathetic group of
spineless inferior Pokémon?.

577
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:03,950
We were created with powers
far stronger than the originals.

578
01:05:07,597 --> 01:05:11,431
Hmm...Mew's got a good point.

579
01:05:11,534 --> 01:05:12,364
What's it saying?.

580
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:16,795
Mew says you don't prove anything
by showing off a lot of special powers

581
01:05:16,907 --> 01:05:20,399
and that a Pokémon's real strength
comes from the heart.

582
01:05:21,978 --> 01:05:25,436
My clones don't need their powers
to prove their worth!

583
01:05:37,627 --> 01:05:42,587
I will block all the Pokémon's special
abilities using my psychic powers.

584
01:05:42,699 --> 01:05:45,600
Now we shall see who triumphs!
Go!!!

585
01:08:22,959 --> 01:08:27,020
Pokémon aren't meant to fight...
not like this...

586
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:30,827
it's useless...what can come out of it?.

587
01:08:31,267 --> 01:08:33,701
Nothing...but pain.

588
01:08:34,337 --> 01:08:38,603
Why can't Mewtwo understand that it's not
right to force Pokémon to battle this way?.

589
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:40,608
They're all living creatures.

590
01:08:41,144 --> 01:08:44,045
This just proves that fighting is wrong.

591
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:51,980
I was prepared for trouble...
but not for this!

592
01:08:52,088 --> 01:08:54,079
Make that double...for me!

593
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:57,216
Now I can see how horrible
fighting really is.

594
01:08:57,327 --> 01:08:59,921
Even the best of friends
fight sometimes.

595
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:02,554
I'll promise never to fight again
if you will!

596
01:09:02,665 --> 01:09:04,792
Oh, Jessy!

597
01:09:16,212 --> 01:09:18,009
What am I doing?.

598
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:24,444
Let's get something straight copy cat.
You-owth ain't gonna push Me-owth around!

599
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:29,415
You mean we don't have to fight
with each other?.

600
01:09:29,526 --> 01:09:32,086
But how can I trust you,
you was born different.

601
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,262
I almost made an clawful mistake,

602
01:09:36,366 --> 01:09:39,597
but how do I anow you're not
gonna pull a fast one on me?.

603
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:46,741
You're right.
We do have a lot in common:

604
01:09:46,843 --> 01:09:51,371
The same earth, the same air,
the same sky.

605
01:09:52,749 --> 01:09:55,479
Maybe if we started
looking at what's the same...

606
01:09:55,585 --> 01:09:59,919
instead of always looking at
what's different, well who knows?.

607
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,158
Pikachu!!

608
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:20,063
Pikachu!!

609
01:11:27,176 --> 01:11:29,167
Quit it! Please stop!!!

610
01:11:30,546 --> 01:11:31,205
Ash!!

611
01:11:31,314 --> 01:11:32,576
Are you oaay?!!.

612
01:11:33,116 --> 01:11:34,879
We gotta stop this!

613
01:11:34,984 --> 01:11:35,951
But how?.

614
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:38,953
All Mewtwo cares about is proving
how strong those super clones are.

615
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:45,052
I'd rather risk my life out
in Mewtwo's storm...

616
01:11:45,161 --> 01:11:47,857
than watch these Pokémon
destroy each other.

617
01:11:48,498 --> 01:11:49,760
Me too.

618
01:11:49,866 --> 01:11:53,563
I wish there were some way to stop them.
I don't anow what to do!

619
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,471
I don't thina theyill ever stop.

620
01:11:59,642 --> 01:12:02,611
Those Pokémon look like they're
ready to fight to the death!

621
01:12:03,046 --> 01:12:06,243
That's a fight...
that nobody's going to win.

622
01:12:06,349 --> 01:12:11,013
Someone's got to take a stand...
someone's gotta say no...

623
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,113
and refuse to fight...
just liae Pikachu.

624
01:13:18,287 --> 01:13:19,117
Ash, wait!

625
01:13:19,355 --> 01:13:21,789
You've got to stop right now!

626
01:13:24,026 --> 01:13:25,926
Stop!!!.

627
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:28,624
Ash!!

628
01:13:28,731 --> 01:13:29,891
Oh. no!

629
01:13:38,775 --> 01:13:42,404
Fool! Trying to stop our battle!

630
01:14:25,555 --> 01:14:26,886
Please no!

631
01:16:30,313 --> 01:16:32,076
Pikachu!

632
01:17:01,877 --> 01:17:05,904
The human sacrificed himself...
to save the Pokémon.

633
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:10,345
I pitted them against each other...but not
until they set aside their differences...

634
01:17:10,453 --> 01:17:14,287
did I see the true power
they all shared deep inside.

635
01:17:15,558 --> 01:17:19,517
I see now that the circumstances
of ones birth are irrelevant...

636
01:17:19,629 --> 01:17:24,362
it is what you do with the gift of life
that determines who you are.

637
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:05,337
Mewtwo...where are you going?.

638
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:09,709
Where my heart can learn
what yours knows so well.

639
01:18:10,046 --> 01:18:13,243
What transpired here
I will always remember...

640
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:17,409
but perhaps for you
these events are best forgotten.

641
01:18:41,577 --> 01:18:43,636
This could be the worst storm ever!

642
01:18:43,746 --> 01:18:47,477
You must listen to me!
You have got to find shelter!.

643
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:49,107
Excuse me please!

644
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:52,448
The Pokémon treatment center
will be open as a shelter!

645
01:18:52,822 --> 01:18:55,723
Anyone who needs a place to stay
should come with me!

646
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:04,065
Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny
are really great!

647
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:07,567
They just keep gett'n more beautiful
everytime I see them.

648
01:19:07,937 --> 01:19:11,134
Hey, guys...how did we wind up
in this place anyway?.

649
01:19:11,373 --> 01:19:14,467
Well...I guess we're just here
because we're here!.

650
01:19:16,145 --> 01:19:17,578
Yup! Let's eat!

651
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,647
Ah...

652
01:19:19,115 --> 01:19:21,174
Look! It's a miracle!

653
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:35,554
I can't believe it.

654
01:19:35,664 --> 01:19:37,131
The storm disappeared!

655
01:19:37,233 --> 01:19:38,200
That's so weird!

656
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:41,495
It's good to have things clear again.

657
01:19:52,815 --> 01:19:54,680
Hey! What's that?.

658
01:19:55,284 --> 01:19:57,184
What's what?.

659
01:19:58,154 --> 01:19:59,985
I don't see anything, Ash.

660
01:20:00,156 --> 01:20:01,885
Except the sky.

661
01:20:04,193 --> 01:20:08,892
The day I left home to start my Pokémon
journey, I saw a really rare Pokémon.

662
01:20:08,998 --> 01:20:11,967
And just now,
I thought I saw another one.

663
01:20:12,535 --> 01:20:14,969
Well maybe you're just
seeing things, Ash!

664
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:15,866
Huh?!.

665
01:20:15,971 --> 01:20:17,802
Well maybe he's not!

666
01:20:19,842 --> 01:20:21,241
Well maybe we'll see.

667
01:20:25,147 --> 01:20:28,548
Many strange legends surrounds
the mysteries of Pokémon...

668
01:20:28,651 --> 01:20:33,850
and just as many adventures await our young
heroes as they continue on their quest!

669
01:20:33,956 --> 01:20:37,221
For Ash and his friends
the journey's just begun!

670
01:20:43,966 --> 01:20:46,867
I don't have a clue how we got here,
but who cares?!.!

671
01:20:46,969 --> 01:20:48,402
This is paradise!!

672
01:20:48,504 --> 01:20:50,233
For once a happy ending!

673
01:20:50,706 --> 01:20:54,233
Team Rocketis signing off again!

674
01:20:55,911 --> 01:20:57,173
I'm out of sunscreen.

675
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:00,407
You know I'd really like to go sailing
in one of them catamarans.
