Dammit!

15
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,680
I can't hold him for much longer!

16
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,150
You wanna know what the problem is?
The problem is it ain't starting.

17
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,250
Yeah, because of something you just did!

18
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,790
I just been sitting in it!

19
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,920
Your butt made it not start. Thanks!

20
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,360
See if the radio works.

21
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,730
I'm not listening to Egypt's Only Country.
Are you nuts?

22
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,430
I listen to The Sand,
Cairo's home for classic rock!

23
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,460
Will you guys get out of here?
I can't hold him for much...

24
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,970
Let's let a real man handle this!

25
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,380
- This thing ain't got no engine.
- Hello?

26
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,250
You need to check the air-tires?

27
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,690
That's where the power is generated!

28
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,410
And that was the problem, wasn't it?

29
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,010
No. While you was fighting
that thing-dog, I...

30
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,280
I called a tow truck.

31
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,180
None of that shit ever happened
and you know it!

32
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,490
- Frylock! You're alive!
- Not quite.

33
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,920
Allow me to explain.

34
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,260
With Frylock in my arms,
I stumbled upon a witch doctor.

35
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,030
Yo, what up, G?

36
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,870
Who was able to provide us
with food, shelter...

37
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,100
and some kick-ass video games.

38
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,640
Yeah, you get pumping.
That's how you pump!

39
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,610
Come on, come on!

40
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
Get there!

41
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,180
Come on!

42
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,750
- Yes!
- Glory! Glory!

43
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,180
- That's how you do it!
- The plantation is safe!

44
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,820
Beatdown city, man!

45
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,820
- The slaves are yours!
- The South rises again!

46
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,550
You gotta watch out
for my musket skills, baby!

47
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,330
You are great at that game.
Your friend is terrible, though.

48
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,660
Yeah, he sucks.

49
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,770
He's dead!

50
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,970
You know, I don't advertise this
but I can bring him back to life.

51
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,810
- It's something I do, but it's up to you.
- I'll bet you can't.

52
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,110
Yeah? How much you wanna bet, bro?

53
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,450
And so a bet was made.
And you know I totally would've won...

54
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,220
had the friggin CIA not busted in.

55
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,660
We know you're in there Lincoln!
We've got the place surrounded!

56
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,350
To the new Beetle convertible!

57
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,670
Alright, everybody freeze!

58
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,970
Don't move!

59
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,330
We know you're invisible.

60
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,580
- Crank up some jams!
- I do the radio.

61
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,850
I need me some Sand! K-Sand!

62
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,050
Yeah!

63
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,750
Take a break! Biggie time.

64
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,760
Just because we fought
one invisible criminal...

65
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,830
doesn't mean everybody's invisible.

66
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,370
I understand that, but it does mean
that some of them could be invisible...

67
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,700
and I think
they're all invisible in this room.

68
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,710
I don't know
where you get your ideas, T.J.

69
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,590
Hurry!
This rocket should take you as far as...

70
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,020
Come on!

71
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,120
I was saying, this rocket
should take you as far as Pluto.

72
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,360
- What about Frylock?
- He should wake up at any moment.

73
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,930
But I must warn you...

74
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,160
from now on
he will be extraordinarily dumb.

75
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,470
- Be gone ye!
- OK, but first let's all get picture together.

76
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,010
- Lincoln, you the tallest...
- Everybody freeze.

77
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,670
Go, God damn it! Go!

78
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,840
We know you're invisible, so don't move!

79
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,420
- No one will catch Time Lincoln!
- Shoot before he transports!

80
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,150
No one, ever!

81
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,560
Oh, great.
You just had to shoot, didn't you?

82
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,360
- Way to change the future.
- What do you mean?

83
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,730
Pull, whitey, pull!

84
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,940
And so Frylock is with us,
in a manner of speaking...

85
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,270
but he would never recover his smartness.

86
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,140
And that's why
I have to cut up his food for him.

87
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,080
Frylock, is all this true?
Is that where we come from?

88
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,380
He doesn't understand your talking.
You must draw him pictures.

89
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,220
But you should use bright colors.
That's the only way you can catch his eyes.

90
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,390
The truth is, Meatwad,
I don't know where we came from.

91
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,080
But I do know how we're gonna die.

My father built this castle.

117
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,030
He said that Weirds would live here
for a thousand years...

118
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,540
and now it's being turned
into fucking lofts!

119
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,770
Well, you could still stay here.
I mean, you could buy a unit...

120
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,070
- These look pretty cool.
- Look at this unit!

121
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,920
Can you...help him move out?

122
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,280
Inside out?

123
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,620
You know what?

124
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,030
I'm just gonna let you have this one.
You can have it.

125
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,690
- For free.
- But we wanna pay!

126
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,800
Check one, two. Check.

127
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,270
Check, check, check.
One, two, buckle my shoe.

128
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,440
Three-four, shut the door, check, check.

129
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,640
- Checking the mic.
- It's checked.

130
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,770
Checkin' the mic, check.
Checkin' the mic, check.

131
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,990
Check, check, check, checking the mic.

132
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,490
Mic check, checking the mic, mic check.

133
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,220
- It's checked!
- Check.

134
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,390
- Sibilance. Sibilance. Sibilance.
- It's checked already! It's checked!!

135
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:52,130
It is? OK, good.
And we got all these in tune, right?

136
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,040
- Tell me these are in tune.
- Yeah.

137
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,240
- They're dolls.
- Shoot.

138
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,640
Are they in tune?

139
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,980
- What's all this to do?
- This is Meatwad's concert tour.

140
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,950
- Girl Quest 2005.
- Read the t-shirt, fool.

141
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,650
{\an5\pos(424,43)}- There's gonna be girls here?

142
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,650
{\an5\pos(424,76)}- Yep. I advertised.

143
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,420
What the fuck?!

144
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,160
See, women love kitty cats.

145
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,500
That's why we gonna fire 'em out
of these high-powered plasma cannons.

146
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,900
Meatwad, you need to go on.

147
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,000
The sooner you go on,
the sooner everyone can go home.

148
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,340
Good evening, New Jersey!

149
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,740
How's the air conditioning out there?

150
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,770
Well, let's see
if we can turn the heat up!

151
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,050
What the...?
Who's throwing potatoes up here?!

152
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,450
I'll shut this show down!

153
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,780
- Alright Meatwad, we are done!
- Wait, hang on, we're gonna do this.

154
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,760
Fire!

155
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,560
Dang it.

156
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,600
- I guess I didn't pack 'em right.
- Fools!

157
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Like being at the Vietnamese Butcher!

158
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,690
Neil?

159
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,690
Neil?

160
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,050
- Cut it out, Neil!
- Sorry, Walter.

161
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,750
It's Mr. Melon to you! You...

162
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,650
- ...fool!
- Fuck it!

163
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,590
I can't work under these conditions!

164
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,060
I want a diet water and
I want my mommy right now!

165
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,320
Meatwad, women don't need to be wooed...

166
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,830
with an electric guitar by a meatball.

167
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,660
What women want are these.

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Pythons.
Check it out.

169
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,970
Go ahead, touch it. Quick.

170
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,440
- Who farted?
- Shake.

171
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,470
Not all women are into muscles.

172
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,380
Well, the beautiful ones are.
The ones in Miami.

173
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,580
Come on.
All women are beautiful, on the inside.

174
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,210
I know that, yeah,
I've been inside of them.

175
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,380
Their homes.
That's where I go when they leave for work.

176
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,320
I get to know 'em before I meet 'em...

177
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,920
and then I wait for them outside,
behind a bush.

178
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
- That what gets me off.
- Gets you off what?

179
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,460
The...the chain.
Off the chain.

180
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,070
Follow me and learn!
Sex ed has begun.

181
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,730
Now this square is the...

182
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,240
- ..man.
- OK.

183
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,880
- This circle here, that's the uterus.
- That's what it looks like?

184
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,280
Up close, yes.
This is lifelike drawing of the uterus.

185
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,880
See the guy takes the car after his job...

186
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,820
to pick up the uterus at her house.

187
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,220
Because she doesn't work
unless she's sweeping up something.

188
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,890
And where do they go?

189
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,630
All the way...to a hotel...

190
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,600
which definitely has cable.

191
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,170
And that's where
this trapezoid becomes...

192
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,610
shall we say...entangled,

193
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,240
with the exposed
and aerated crotches.

194
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,450
And that there
is the exposed crotches?

195
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,750
I told you
that's the chair and the spatula.

196
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,240
- I knew it.
- Congratulate yourself, my friend.

197
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,990
You have just been laid.

198
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,090
- That feels good.
- Yeah, I never tire of it.

199
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,550
You think that women are attracted to me?

200
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,870
Well, I think they pity you.
Because you're overweight.

201
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,870
I mean, a lot of it has to do
with having a good body.

202
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,600
Well, you ain't got no good body!

203
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,770
I have a great body,
and I get it by doing reps.

204
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,710
No way. You got a machine?!

205
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,850
I don't have a machine.

206
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,320
I have <i>the</i> machine!

207
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,240
Behold.
The machine!

208
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,590
The Insanoflex!

209
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,630
Behold, my Elvis costume!
I ain't seen that since Halloween.

210
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,500
Let me tell you about the system.

211
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,070
Rumor has it...

212
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,800
it was brought back
from a more advanced time...

213
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,640
the time, of course, of <i>Timecop...</i>

214
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,980
to train my buns!

215
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,350
Show me how to get some pythons
like Chief Wahoo McDaniel.

216
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,980
No no, you can't just hop into this,
you'll hurt yourself.

217
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,060
Start stretching out by helping me drag it
in front of the TV, OK? Let's go.

218
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,490
And, one!

219
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,600
Push, keep pushing!

220
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,060
Keep pushing!

221
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,830
Ain't that the reason
you exercise in the first place?

222
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,370
- So you could move something like this?
- No!

223
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,200
- That is not the reason.
- Alright. What's the reason?

224
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,040
Poontang.
Poontang is the grubby little middleman...

225
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,080
you must go through
to get the girls.

226
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,610
It's not even assembled right.
Look at this.

227
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,080
That's...that's... Yeah...

228
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,620
so you can do it on a plane,
business trips.

229
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,950
Look at this. One, two...

230
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,960
- OK, and where are the directions?
- I know, I don't know!

231
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,390
You know, the internet
is a popular source of information.

232
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,400
And the internet is also a popular way...

233
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,230
to play some of my favorite games, like...

234
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,900
Crystal Meth, Nightmare Killing Spree...

235
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,970
and Clamdigger - Head To Head.

236
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,210
- Here I go.
- Don't you touch my computer!

237
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,240
Oh my God.

238
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,340
There must be fifty bras on this page!

239
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,310
- I gotta get on that!
- No! No, no, no!

240
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,350
Somebody's been bra-shopping in here!

241
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,250
- Let me see! Come on!
- Do you mind?

242
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,220
- Damn!
- You will bookmark that.

243
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,790
- You've never seen a bra before?
- Not with the boob meat inside of it!

244
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:20,090
OK. Search for Insanoflex.

245
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
Oh my God! Again.

246
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,810
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

247
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,250
These directions are written
in some sort of rare, robot dialect.

248
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,120
- Oh my God.
- Please, translate.

249
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,220
- Well, I speak robot.
- This is odd.

250
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,090
- It's almost as if...
- I speak robot.

251
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,860
I heard you.
I'm sorry, continue with your translation.

252
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,300
It's as if someone
didn't want us to put this together.

253
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,670
- And yet they sold it to us.
- I speak robotanese.

254
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,670
Danger.
Deadly death danger.

255
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,040
Beware.
You must never, ever, ever, ever...

256
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,120
ever, ever, ever...

257
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,380
ever, ever, ever,
ever assemble the Insanoflex!

258
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,830
Need help assembling?
Because we said not to?

259
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,000
So is there a number you can translate?
Can you at least do that?

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
Yeah, there is.

261
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,330
2937584923

262
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,240
04747483

263
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,270
7438445...

264
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,410
Don't do it. Enjoy.

265
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,910
Man, the phone's ringing.

266
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,520
Yes, I can see that,
these work, you know!

267
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,320
Do not touch the phone!

268
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
- What the...
- Intruder!

269
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,420
I am the Cybernetic Ghost
of Christmas Past.

270
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,590
Do you have a...a quick second?

271
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,830
- Sure.
- Thousands of years ago into the future...

272
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,970
your race will develop
the ultimate exercise machine...

273
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,040
that has irresistible force
and immovable object...

274
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,940
with over 90 exercises
and an infinite amount of weight...

275
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,350
and plus it has a rowing machine
for cardiovascular workout...

276
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,080
and a clicker that allows you
to keep track of your reps.

277
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,590
Every time you do a rep it clicks "One".

278
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,520
The button is big and red...

279
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,260
a color which no longer exists in your time.

280
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,960
Cool dude!
How do I order?

281
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,470
You fool! Don't you understand?
You built it!

282
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,540
If this machine falls into the wrong abs...

283
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,610
the world as you know it will become
a world as you've never imagined it...

284
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,440
starring Chow Yun-Fat.

285
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,580
What are you saying?

286
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,610
Because I don't even know
what you're talking about anymore.

287
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,920
Are you saying
that someone could become so buff...

288
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,490
that he could score like,
all the world's ass...

289
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,130
and thus creating
massive global inbreeding...

290
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,030
ultimately bring population
growth to a standstill?

291
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,660
No!

292
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,670
Well I wasn't thinking that,
but that could happen.

293
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,530
Dude, I totally want one!

294
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,870
Sorry.

295
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,710
- I still want one.
- Oh, sure.

296
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,250
you'll set it up,
but it will take you over a week...

297
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,650
and you'll keep telling yourself
"I should hop on that and use it"...

298
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,820
because these slacks no longer fit right.

299
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,060
You have got to answer
that fucking phone.

300
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,790
- It's driving me nuts!
- Let the machine get it.

301
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,260
- Hello?
- Hello?

302
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,060
Hey man, how's it going?

303
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,960
- Pretty good.
- I pull your leg out!

304
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,870
Oh, dammit!

305
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,970
We need a new machine.

306
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,580
So, how do you even know all this?

307
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,950
Fortunately for humanity,
I traveled forward into the Bahamas...

308
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,350
but also back in time, to steal this!

309
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,860
- That's a screw.
- No.

310
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,960
It is part XJ32...

311
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,800
which is to fasten the
Pectomizer to the Ab-Eraser...

312
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,700
to the thing!

313
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,970
Without this one piece, the Insanoflex...

314
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,370
would fall apart.

315
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,310
Watch this.

316
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,540
She loves it.

317
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,520
So, that thing is basically a screw.

318
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,350
Yes, it screws into things.

319
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,280
So can't they just go
buy a screw or something?

320
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,600
Shit.

321
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,660
I mean, I'd probably
just shove a pencil in the screw hole.

322
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,500
I just shoved a pencil in the screw hole.

323
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,270
It better not be mine.
My algebra homework is due tomorrow.

324
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,200
Gonna work out on this thing or not?

325
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,570
I'll work out on your face.

326
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,850
Bring me the vegetable oil.
I think I'm gonna pose right here.

327
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,180
Show you boys how it's done!

328
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,150
Women drop to their knees
when they see the shape of my fingers.

329
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,150
They're like beautiful
little muscular hot dogs.

330
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,090
Look at these guns!

331
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,630
I just pooped a little bit.

332
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,650
- Meatwad, hit the switch.
- OK.

333
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,640
- Is it on?
- Hit it again.

334
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,300
Can't get good help these days.

335
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,570
- Jiggle it.
- Do exactly what he told you!

336
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,580
It's just one switch! I'm doing it.

337
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,780
Well that's it. You see this M?

338
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,180
It probably stands for motherboard,
and evidently we're missing it.

339
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,290
It stands for Meatwad.
And that's me, y'all.

340
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,380
It stands for mar...

341
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,360
for mar...morphin...

342
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,800
I will come up with something.
And it will sting like the bee!

343
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,970
Wait a minute.
Is that the box it came in?

344
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,040
No. What am I, on trial here?

345
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,170
- Where did you get this?
- I got it from a dear friend...

346
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,310
who knows <i>my</i> needs.

347
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:45,080
And he also happens
to wear bitchin' ass pants!

348
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,050
You see, they're made
of a fiber optic technology...

349
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,450
that hug the flesh on my unique shape.

350
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,790
They circulate air
around my genitals...

351
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,690
and they wick the sweat
off my balls.

352
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,320
You wanna know more about my pants,
I got some literature here...

353
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,160
That's alright. I just need to know
where you got that Insanoflex?

354
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,690
Some garage sale. Back when I,
you know, gave a crap about my body.

355
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,600
Then of course some
jack off friggin' ripped it off.

356
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,370
Will you speed it up?
What is the hold-up back there?

357
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, Shake says
you gave it to him for Christmas.

358
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,300
Is that where it is?

359
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,710
Yeah, I thought Santa Claus came in here,
and busted out my window.

360
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,040
Look, I know it's yours...

361
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,440
but we're missing a key part
that makes it work.

362
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,320
Well, boo hoo, for you.
So go cry in the street off my property.

363
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,150
Well, what we were thinking
is that if we could just...

364
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,920
- ...go inside your house and look around.
- See, I'd love to do that, but no.

365
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,260
You're not coming in here.

366
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,230
Can you tell me who you bought it from,
and I can go ask that guy if he still has it?

367
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,230
- Here's the address. Right here on the box.
- What the he--?

368
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,070
Why are we stopping
when my foot is clearly still on the gas?

369
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,940
South Jersey Shore.
I know where that is.

370
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,930
Alright, hop in. Warp speed. Go!

371
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,010
We overshot that.

372
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,980
We went all around the earth
and back to where we started.

373
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,040
It's pretty amazing isn't it?

374
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,220
- OK, impulse power!
- Let's take the cart.

375
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,390
- Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop!
- What? What is it?

376
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,890
Must've just been the wind.

377
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,920
There it is. In all its beauty.

378
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,980
Oh man. The door's locked.

379
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,270
Hand me a credit card.

380
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,970
Dude, you can't pick the lock,
man, I know you.

381
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,170
I know, I want to order some DVDs online.

382
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,510
This has been a complete
intelligence failure of massive proportions!

383
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,650
Will you see if they have
<i>Deathdream</i> by Bob Clark?

384
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,150
- Did he not do <i>Porky's</i>?
- He did do <i>Porky's.</i>

385
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,820
He also did <i>A Christmas Story,</i>
which makes me laugh and laugh.

386
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,660
Dude, they got a key.

387
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,590
It's right there under the...

388
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,330
Well, it's hanging
on that nail by the door.

389
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,060
- We were never here.
- You never saw us.

390
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,710
I told you dude, we needed the Machine!

391
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,610
- How many times did I say that?
- Zero. You said it none times.

392
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,060
- What?
- Hey, sweaty man.

393
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,900
- Could you help us lift something?
- No, I don't think so.

394
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,030
- Damn it!
- Rude!

395
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,900
What difference does it make?
The friggin thing don't work!

396
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,070
- They're missing a piece.
- Where is it?

397
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,410
That's right, fat man.
I will totally ruin your bushes.

398
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,610
Please don't do that.
It's about to bloom!

399
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,880
I've been urinating it twice a day!

400
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,480
I forgot it did this.

401
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,730
Now tell me fat man, and make it quick...

402
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,420
what was I going to ask you?

403
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,670
Check it out. I mean, here's the box for it.

404
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,830
And here's the address.

405
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,900
Come on, let's go!
Everybody inside the race car!

406
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,670
Wait for me!

407
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,940
- Thrusters on!
- Go!

408
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,480
- Is your seat belt properly fastened?
- Yeah.

409
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Dude, why don't we just take our ship?
It's probably faster.

410
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,010
Yes, to the ship!
It was my idea.

411
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,060
Goodbye fat man.

412
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,720
You can suck it!

413
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,610
- Steve, heat the oil!
- OK.

414
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,450
And now...

415
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,420
shoestring the giant potato!

416
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,470
The oil is ready!

417
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,470
Lower the box!

418
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,950
No!

419
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,390
- No!
- I know!

420
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,720
He's been trying to kill us
for the last three miles.

421
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,560
Listen up, there is
no right on red in this State!

422
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,800
It's left, goddamn you!

423
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,060
Do you even know the difference?

424
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,970
Here we are.

425
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,980
Obviously this is the kitchen.

426
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,110
All modern appliances, brushed metal.
All brand new.

427
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,580
What's this do?
Hey, what's that do?

428
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,150
Don't you ever touch people's stuff!
What kind of manners do you have?

429
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,850
You know I touch the stuff first.

430
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,690
And if you look over here...

431
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,090
- What is this, a creature in here?
- Yes, that.

432
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,530
That's a creaturezoid!
There are only two in the known universe!

433
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,700
Taunt it and it will eat your skin!

434
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,000
This is my...wife.

435
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,240
OK, well, I guess we're gonna go on
and get on out your hair, here.

436
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,280
Out of curiosity, you don't happen to have
a missing piece to an exercise machine...

437
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,810
Nope! Can't help you there. Sorry.

438
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,920
Come on and get me. What's the matter?

439
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,780
Too faggoty to come and get me?

440
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,350
Come on, Shake!

441
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,250
- I'm so sick of pussies.
- Drag me out of here, come on!

442
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,700
- I am a master of disguise!
- Yeah.

443
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,740
Well, they were here, looking for the part.

444
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,900
No one must ever
put together the Insanoflex!

445
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,410
- Well, he doesn't have it.
- We'll just wait...

446
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,800
Thousands of years ago
I told you he didn't have it.

447
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,160
Why are we beating
our brains out about this?

448
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,570
I mean, come on, dudes!

449
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,440
We'll just wait until we create it,
and then like, we'll have it!

450
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,030
Well, alright.

451
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,040
Man, nobody's gonna take
these voice oscillators back.

452
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,410
- Well, I will try anyway.
- I think I even swallowed the tag.

453
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,870
- Do you have the receipt?
- I prefer to keep mine in my butt.

454
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,420
Oh no! Someone's coming!
Put on your costumes.

455
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,320
Oh, <i>sheisse</i>!

456
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,450
Everybody, make out and kiss hard!
Like you mean it!

457
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,130
Get a room!

458
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,110
Did you hear me say, "Get a room?"
I told them to get a room.

459
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,150
They were like making out
then we walked by and I went...

460
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,190
"Get a room!"
That's pretty good, right?

461
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,450
OK, they're gone.

462
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,490
- That was very close.
- Yeah. We were.

463
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,290
Very close.

464
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,160
You know, you're a good kisser.

465
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,490
OK, they're gone, OK?

466
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,040
I'll handle this.

467
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,250
Yes, can I help you?

468
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,250
Yeah, we're here
with the Boys Club and...

469
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,190
We're here to throw down!

470
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,760
Four eyes!
I need those combinations!

471
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,400
- What are you talking about?
- You know, like missile codes right away!

472
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,470
Shake! Shake!

473
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,540
There won't be a tomorrow, Jack.
Let alone your little grandma...

474
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,540
- OK, I give! I give!
- You're going down, milkshake!

475
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,940
I give up!
I'm not even fighting you back!

476
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,440
All you had to do was ask!

477
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,410
- Missile codes? We don't need these!
- Well, I need them.

478
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,420
We are a go for operation
Banana Monkey...

479
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,090
029 Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.

480
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,320
Launch pad one, launch pad two,
launch pad three.

481
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,120
We have ignition.

482
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,120
I am just... I am smelling a missile.

483
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,300
Nah, there's no way!

484
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,930
Greetings, I'm Space...

485
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,310
Shut up, honey. It's just fire.

486
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,210
Say, you wouldn't happen to have a...

487
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,280
I already told you,
we don't have that part you're looking for!

488
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,210
What do you mean you already told us?

489
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,220
Well yeah, just a few minutes ago,
when you were here.

490
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,450
The thing for the exercise equipment,
we don't have it.

491
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,320
Sir, you must turn your key,
we are at Defcon 3.

492
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,790
Turn your key, sir.

493
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,050
Who's that?

494
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,030
- That's my wife.
- OK, look.

495
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,060
If you see anything that looks like this,
let us know.

496
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,970
- Wait a second. Can we have this?
- Meatwad, let me see that.

497
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,100
My God, this is the missing piece!

498
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,480
- Knock-knock!
- Welcome home, baby.

499
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,020
I say this to all of your things.
For this is a robbery.

500
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,690
- Nobody move!
- Yeah, we'll see you guys later.

501
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,480
Stop moving!

502
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,290
- They're gone, man.
- Yes, Err.

503
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,960
We scared them off
with our fierce ferocity.

504
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,600
Do what he says
and say what he does, and...

505
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,390
look at this!

506
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,970
- This is ours!
- That is correct.

507
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,460
What is it? No time for an answer!
Tractor beam on!

508
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,080
Observe as I steal it!

509
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,280
Do not waste your pathetic mortal energy
trying to stop us...

510
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,450
unless you want to amuse us,
which is what you're doing.

511
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,180
You can't stop us, you can't touch us!

512
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,390
We're untouchable, unstoppable,
unflappable, unmotivated....

513
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,420
What is that, Err?

514
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,290
- This is an ashtray!
- What the f--?

515
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,160
- I like to smoke.
- Tractor beam off!

516
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,030
- An ashtray? Come on, man.
- What's wrong with an ashtray?

517
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,930
Err, if you want to achieve in this life...

518
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,370
you need to set your goals higher.

519
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,440
- I'm already pretty high!
- And so am I.

520
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,840
- So grab the other end of this...
- Yes!

521
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,240
...as we commit first degree
Grand Theft Coffee Table!

522
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,440
- Tractor beam on!
- We are stealing!

523
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,850
We control your home furnishings!

524
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,250
And we will be back
when you least expect it.

525
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,280
We will!

526
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,850
For the end table,
the ottoman, and the wine rack.

527
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,890
See if we don't!

528
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,020
- But we don't have room right now.
- We are renting at the Y!

529
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,960
- What's wrong with your chicken?
- That's a gay chicken.

530
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,870
The piece is missing!

531
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,530
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes, Steve!

532
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:33,080
Randy!
Turn your fucking stereo down!

533
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,020
Did you see
that chicken guy running around?

534
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,550
- That guy was weird.
- Yeah. Really weird.

535
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,990
There was something
about that chicken.

536
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,760
Something that reminded me
of another weird person I used to know.

537
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,230
Yeah, it was many years ago.

538
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,060
We were colleagues once,
we were very close.

539
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,170
I was just starting in my scientific career
and he was already...

540
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,600
OK, all right, you went to camp,
you made out with a girl, Vietnam, what?

541
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,910
What?! I've got stories too,
I've been places, I have friends.

542
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,610
But right now I need to get physical.
And listening ain't doing it for me.

543
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,480
All right, give me the damn piece.
Let's see if it fits.

544
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,990
It looks like they have the piece.

545
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,590
Then they must have the piece.

546
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,530
- That's what I just said.
- Shush, Emory! The robot is right.

547
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,730
Someone must distract them,
while I go in there and beat it out of them!

548
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,540
- Now who's had that fantasy?
- I got an idea.

549
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,410
Why don't we just send wingnut over here
to freakin' bore them to death.

550
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,940
I have a thousand weapons
of mass distraction.

551
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,910
Which one shall you require?

552
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,410
What about the student council story?

553
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,850
- That one's a corker.
- Oh, yes.

554
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:47,250
The student council story.
That is one of my very favorites.

555
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,960
Thousands of years ago
I ran for treasurer of student council...

556
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,760
it involved a lot of hard work...

557
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,730
we decorated many cookies...

558
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,830
we spent all night
putting up cream frosting.

559
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,870
and then we drew on many posters.

560
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,570
But the principal called me
down to her office...

561
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,410
and informed me
that I had violated election rules.

562
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,550
Thousands of years ago I kicked your ass.
And I'm gonna do it again right now.

563
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,920
That's what Sister Margaret
kept telling me...

564
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,980
as I explained my political agenda
in her bathroom.

565
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,320
Where are my frickin' pants?!

566
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,230
You can't hide 'em, I see 'em!

567
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,760
I see 'em!

568
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Carl!

569
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,400
I wanna share with you...

570
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,070
by letting you jump on in here
and take the other leg.

571
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,700
- No, thank you. Save it for the tea party.
- Come on.

572
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,910
Our balls will wick together as one!

573
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,870
That's my workout machine, isn't it?

574
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,380
Yeah, we found that missing piece, Carl.

575
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,710
I don't want to tell you what to do, but...

576
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,880
you're putting it in upside down.

577
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,080
Will you back up? I know what I'm doing.

578
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,990
Well fine, do it your wrong way.

579
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,050
- All right, here we go.
- There you go.

580
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,790
- Finally!
- Excuse you?

581
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,860
Set it to maximum!
I'll have to start maxing out right here.

582
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,070
No, I bought it, I get first crack at it!

583
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,530
- I'm doing it.
- I'm the one who just put it together!

584
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,300
- I'm the muscle one!
- Shake, will you let Carl go first?

585
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,340
- I mean, he does own the damn thing!
- You're right, Frylock.

586
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,410
I will be the bigger man,
and let the baby have his way.

587
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,250
Turn it on now! Get a mirror!
Hurry! Someone spot me!

588
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,480
Get your ass out of there!

589
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,580
All right.

590
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,190
All right, put it on warm-up mode.

591
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,650
I want to work into this very slowly
before I completely dominate it, OK?

592
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,470
Look at this whole routine,
this is pretty sweet there.

593
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,670
What the hell?!

594
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,400
What's going on here?

595
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Am I exercising, or...?

596
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,010
Seriously,
what is going on behind me here?

597
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,450
Crap, crap, crap, crap!

598
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,110
What the fuck is going on
with this thing?!

599
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,520
Man! I'm glad he went first.

600
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,990
- I told you it mustn't be installed!
- No you didn't!

601
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,620
- I didn't?
- No, you didn't.

602
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,330
I meant to!

603
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,300
Make it stop, I'm already sore here!

604
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,530
- Oh, <i>sheisse</i>!
- Dude, just stay down.

605
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,340
The re--the res--the reasoning...

606
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,950
The resoning must begin at once!

607
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,180
Neil!

608
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,020
Contact the county!

609
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,580
Hang on, wait. What are we doing?

610
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,490
Do I have to explain
<i>everything</i> to you, Neil?

611
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,520
Hey, y'all!

612
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,560
They got a big ol'
floating watermelon over here!

613
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,920
Reverse thrusters!

614
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,100
Just a couple more reps man, let's go!

615
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,970
No pain, no gain! Come on!

616
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,410
I wanna see you go for it! You got it!

617
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,040
You don't wanna
look like that forever, do you?

618
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,010
- Crap! It's heading downtown.
- What, the watermelon?

619
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,080
No, not the watermelon!

620
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,520
There's only one way to stop it.

621
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,720
You must push...

622
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,850
the stop switch.

623
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,100
It doesn't have a stop switch!

624
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,100
Well...

625
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,590
I...

626
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,640
Then there's no way to stop it!

627
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,810
- What the f--? You don't know!
- Is that clock right?

628
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:03,110
- My goodness, is it that time already?
- Man, it has been a day!

629
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,380
I tell you what, I mean...

630
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,110
I been going non-stop
since like noon, or something.

631
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,580
I got to go, I got to go to bed.

632
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,420
- Shake.
- And you got school tomorrow too!

633
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,820
- No I don't.
- Yes you do, and you will now go to bed.

634
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,420
Shake, don't you get it?

635
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,190
Why don't you get this
with your lips!

636
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,890
I'm referring to my anus.

637
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,600
Carl's gonna be destroyed,
along with all the rest of downtown!

638
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,770
If we help you,
can we get the machine?

639
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,790
Or can we go to the...?

640
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,070
- Or what!?
- I don't know!

641
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,470
You don't have to yell at me like that!

642
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,810
Look.

643
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,740
We need a plan.

644
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,490
I have a plan.

645
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,460
Alright, you see
that roller coaster over there?

646
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,100
It's the Steel Python,
and in order to ride it...

647
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,430
we must each purchase tickets...

648
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,470
at $3 a pop...

649
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,640
with your money...

650
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,300
in order to ride it.

651
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,140
And that there's the plan.

652
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,910
What about the Insanoflex?

653
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,410
Insan--
No, that thing's gone, brother.

654
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,180
And pretty soon,
the world as we know it will be gone.

655
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,690
That's why you gotta you squeeze as much
out of the time you got left on this earth.

656
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,990
And squeeze it for fun.

657
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,990
He's right.

658
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,450
- Will you two cut it out?!
- Word up, bitch.

659
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,930
Eat that, motherfuckers!

660
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,730
- Now here's dessert!
- What the hell are you doing here?!

661
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,440
That sort of snippy attitude
does not require an answer.

662
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,170
He's right.
You wanna buy a coffee table, man?

663
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,040
Notice the fine lacquered oak.

664
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,740
Four legs!
Top, bottom, underneath, sides.

665
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,710
It would complement
the inside of your anus beautifully.

666
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,120
- Get it, man?
- Do you get the double <i>entendre</i>?

667
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,490
- Up your butt!
- Do you know what an anus is?

668
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,320
Up your butt! Sideways!

669
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,420
Look, we just really
want to ride this coaster, so...

670
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,260
you know, be cool and...
give us all your money.

671
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,030
Total destruction
and devastation is imminent.

672
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,770
And it takes a long time.

673
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,900
About an hour,
hour and a half from now.

674
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,870
- Or two!
- And it will suck.

675
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,100
Wait, stop moving!

676
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,080
Is it just me, man, or is that thing
coming right towards us?

677
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,550
- Yeah, look at it.
- Man, I gotta get out of here.

678
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:26,820
- Run.
- It's coming right towards us!

679
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,750
I'm sorry, this plan is moronic!

680
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,390
The Insanoflex
is ripping up my home town.

681
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,290
And you're sitting here
not even tall enough to ride!

682
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,100
Now we have to fund your operation!

683
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,100
Come on gang.
Let's all do a topless car wash!

684
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,040
I'm tall enough to ride now.

685
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,940
Meatwad!
I didn't know you could do that.

686
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,680
Ain't no one ever asked me.
You want you some office space?

687
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,210
How 'bout tech support?

688
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,480
Wait a minute, this gives me an idea!

689
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,090
Is it the same idea I had?
About riding that there roller coaster?

690
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,380
I hope so.

691
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,260
Pre--tty bad--ass!

692
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,750
I like the missiles, that works.
You need to mess up the hair more.

693
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,920
- I just combed it.
- Look more like a monster.

694
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,620
I like parting it to the side
but giving it a messy look.

695
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,030
Like he's a preppy
but he'll throw down with you.

696
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,400
Lose the shorts, though.
This ain't no Pride Parade, it's a fight.

697
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,990
Well, how about this?
See? Blue jean shorts.

698
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,900
- Cutoffs.
- OK, fine, that'll work.

699
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,470
Now Oglethorpe and Emory,
I want you two to...

700
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,170
Where'd the Plutonians go?

701
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,510
Hold your hands up this time.

702
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,010
That is a direct order
from Commander Fun.

703
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,280
Hold on, hold on!

704
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,270
Oh God!

705
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,590
Alright, Shake.
The Meat Monster is set up.

706
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:18,490
You need to lure that thing down this alley,
so Meatwad can attack him.

707
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,160
- Shake?
- I ain't doing that. No.

708
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,260
- No, no. Hell no.
- Stay right there!

709
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,570
What are you do--? You must
lure that thing into the Meat Monster!

710
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,470
Well, what the hell
do you think I'm doing here? My nails?

711
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,810
- I may?
- Fine!

712
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:35,110
- I'll get Robot Man here to do it.
- I don't want to do it.

713
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,610
My hands are tied at this point.

714
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:40,980
I kind of also got
a teeth whitening package.

715
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,250
So, you know...

716
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,520
don't stay up.

717
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,690
Meet us out there as soon as you're done.

718
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,130
- Oh, crap!
- OK, just close the door, please?

719
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,060
Alright, Carl!
Looking good!

720
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,460
What are you... Wha--

721
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,700
See you later!

722
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:04,040
What the hell are you doing?
You were supposed to attack him!

723
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,440
With your fangs! And then
blow him up with the meat missiles!

724
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,880
- I forgot.
- It's too late now.

725
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,080
I've been to the future and it's his destiny.

726
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,820
<i>- Their</i> destiny.
- Wait a second.

727
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,720
What do you mean by <i>their</i> destiny?

728
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,890
Frylock, look at this!

729
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,120
Oh, my God!

730
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,690
Do you know what this means?

731
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,730
It's just as I suspected.

732
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:30,800
I'm female.

733
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,030
- It's...it's female.
- You're what?

734
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:36,000
I mean, the Insanoflex is a female.

735
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,580
And it's pregnant.

736
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,880
Wait, go back to the other part.

737
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,850
Where you were saying
you were a woman?

738
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:48,880
He's right.

739
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,890
Thousands of years ago into the future...

740
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:55,620
descendants of the original Insanoflex
will roam the earth...

741
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,030
exercising alternating muscles
on alternating days...

742
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,960
until the human race
has cut carbohydrates...

743
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,370
out of their diet forever.

744
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,900
And everything will be crushed...

745
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,460
in the Yeast Uprising of 1987.

746
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,580
You said you're a woman!

747
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,880
- Well, I'm not. Look, Shake...
- Don't touch me.

748
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,870
Will someone just grab
the other end of that egg, please?

749
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,690
Well with my teeth the way they are...

750
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,650
I'm kind of not supposed
to chew anything for like four hours.

751
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,460
Pick this egg up now!

752
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,980
But my teeth have just been whitened!

753
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,920
These teeth here,
they make for a pretty good stool.

754
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:42,540
- You know you're sittin' on my teeth?
- I need to get eye level with the TV.

755
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,140
- I see that.
- And then I need to wear these teeth.

756
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,980
In my mouth.
When I go on dates.

757
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,040
With women of the opposite sex.

758
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,750
They're not clothes, you know.
They're part of my body!

759
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,110
Get your ass off my teeth!

760
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,550
Look at this.
This is unbelievable!

761
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,720
I know it! My tan fell off.

762
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,430
$49, straight down the crapper!

763
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,160
With this Ultra X-Ray,
I should be able to look inside...

764
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,430
Why don't you just break it open, like this.
With my Ultra Foot.

765
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,640
OK, once I get the Ultra X-Ray
completely calibrated...

766
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,130
I should be able to configure...

767
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,890
See? I get shit done.

768
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,060
- Damn, that's a good beat!
- Yeah, Meatwad, it is.

769
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:44,960
Almost too good.

770
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,100
- What is this music?
- Well, it's from my exercise video.

771
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:54,210
<i>Lose Weight! Eviscerate!</i>
<i>Volume 2 - Sea Of Blood, Island Of Death.</i>

772
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,640
I think I want to see that video.

773
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,020
You'd better run, boy!

774
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,050
Run those pounds off.

775
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:08,220
See, this is an exercise program
designed to keep you working out.

776
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,060
You know,
24 hours a day for 30 days...

777
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,130
until, you know, forever.

778
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,460
Yeah, but...

779
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,960
You're guaranteed
to lose weight that way.

780
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,570
- What the...?
- Or that way.

781
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,140
The way where he blows
your head off with a laser.

782
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,270
- Who blows your head off with a laser?!
- Him, right there.

783
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,240
That's the Insanoflex.

784
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,400
That sucker's crazy.

785
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,480
- We got one of them, don't we?
- Yeah!

786
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,590
Remember? You were supposed
to wrap yourself around him?!

787
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,920
Well I'll be.
Where has my head been?

788
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,760
Has any of these people
ever stopped the Insanoflex?

789
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,930
No. It can't be stopped,
once it gets going with that music!

790
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,170
See, that's what fuels its insane rage.

791
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,630
Maybe if we could change the music...

792
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,970
we could confuse the Insanoflex.

793
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,010
Well, I'll be.
That'd probably do it.

794
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,480

00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,140
On one condition.

817
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,770

00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,440
Man, the world has turned, man!
Look here, man.

You've got digital quality.

- Will you come on?!

863
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,150
My Frydar is picking
up slower biorhythms.

864
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,690
- You gotta do it close range, huh?
- Must be in cool-down mode.

865
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:39,860
Yeah, my Strawdar
picked that up about 20 miles back.

866
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,960
Hey, dudes!

867
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,800
Look at us up here
on the roller coaster!

868
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,430
Hey guys!
What's going on?

869
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,440
What's wrong with him?

870
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,710
- Look out down there!
- My nutrients!

871
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,970
Retrieve them at once,
they have escaped!

872
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,140
That came out of you?!

873
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,170
Alright everyone.
Here's what we're gonna do.

874
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,480
- Man! What happened?
- Dang it.

875
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,920
- Great, and now what?
- I'm gonna fly up there...

876
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,490
and blow them all up
because I am sick of this shit!

877
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,980
- No!
- Wait, Frylock!

878
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:14,060
So you're just gonna go up there
and blow up your neighbor Carl?

879
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,330
Don't you understand
how much he has to live for?

880
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,370
OK, now that you're looking at me,
I mean...

881
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:26,310
I'll come up with something here,
give me a second.

882
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,330
He's...

883
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,470
Hang on.

884
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,250
Well, he's got...

885
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:44,430
...porn!
He's got a bunch of porn.

886
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,500
Who'll take care
of his vast collection of pornography...

887
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,400
both in VHS and DVD format?

888
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,730
Who's gonna call his mom,
and pretend he ain't lookin' at porn...

889
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:56,100
while he's talking to her on the phone?

890
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,840
And who, answer me this...

891
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,210
will clean his pool
after I have peed all in it?

892
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,380
- You.
- That's my point. Go kill him.

893
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,050
- Alright, alright.
- Hell!

894
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:09,120
I wrote this next one

we learned that music is stronger.

924
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,280
No!

925
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,820
- Carl?
- Oh my God. Carl?

926
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,590
- Is he dead?
- Carl, you all right? Can you hear me?

927
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,620
Carl? Hey, Carl?

928
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,630
Carl!

929
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:05,430
You OK? There?

930
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:07,230
What happened to him?

931
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,110
Baby, you showed up! Great.

932
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:17,140
Sorry, I didn't introduce you guys,
this is my new friend.

933
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,110
- Linda.
- How y'all doin'?

934
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,280
- Hello.
- Hey, man.

935
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,840
Hi, how's it going?

936
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:28,990
Yeah, we met in line for the coaster.

937
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,790
We compared our lats and our traps and...

938
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:36,490
turns out we do a lot of the same
exercises, don't we baby?

939
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:49,240
The two of us were thinking about going
out for some vitamin supplements and...

940
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,050
inject ourselves
with some extract from a bull's semen.

941
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:54,920
That's what she likes
to do for muscle mass there.

942
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,480
- Anyone wanna come?
- No.

943
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,450
- Nah, that's cool.
- No, I can't.

944
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,890
See ya later, losers.
I'm going off to do another little workout.

945
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:05,190
At her place! Yeah!

946
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,700
The only thing
that bull semen did for me...

947
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,820
was activate my gag reflex.

948
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,800
Well Carl got himself a girlfriend.

949
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,200
I'm proud of him.
And I'm lonely. I want a girlfriend.

950
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,840
- I'm the one who wants a girlfriend!
- No, it is I who wants a girlfriend.

951
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,510
- Get this thing going again.
- I'll tell y'all what.

952
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:27,920
See all these eggs laying around here?
Why don't you just pick one out.

953
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,780
Pretty soon they're all gonna hatch
and once they do...

954
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,250
life as we know it, is over.

955
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,620
You know, you're really great
at taking a good fun situation...

956
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,590
and turn it into something crappy.

957
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,860
You know
we're about to get laid here, right?

958
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,160
- How we gonna stop all of them?
- Well, why don't you ask him?

959
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,600
Because <i>he</i> invented it.

960
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,340
I did mention that, right?
I think I mentioned that.

961
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:55,000
- So you're the one that created this thing?
- I think so. He says I did.

962
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,280
I'll probably just knock it out
this afternoon.

963
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,320
- Let's just wait around.
- He won't.

964
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,950
He has no discipline.

965
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,490
Why don't you tell a story about it
that lasts five hours?

966
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:09,690
Will you shut up?!

967
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,430
I have an idea.

968
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,590
We're gonna have to go back in time.

969
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,800
- And kill his parents.
- No!

970
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,870
Don't do that, they're in Florida!

971
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,140
No, no, Shake.
Here's what we're gonna do.

972
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,200
Come on, how often
do you see them anyway? Honestly?

973
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,770
Hey guys? Hello?

974
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:29,940
Don't walk away
or I shall help me for you!

975
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,350
Look man, I'm here for you, it's OK.
Now, what I want you to do...

976
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:35,840
is drink this.

977
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,620
Thank you Err.
What was that thick shake?

978
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,320
Well, I'll tell you what it is.
It's mayonnaise I found in the trash can.

979
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,360
And it had hair on it!
And you drank it!

980
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,390
Because I am your doctor.
Do what I say!

981
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,180
Look.

982
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:05,950
Yet again, another testament of my ability
to pound the brewskies.

983
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,050
Yeah. Those are collecting fruit flies.

984
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:12,650
They are hovering around the display.
They are in awe of my ability to drink.

985
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:15,990
Dude, you remember that exam?
That's tomorrow?

986
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,460
- 'Cause, were you gonna study for it or...?
- I sold my books.

987
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:22,960
Screw them, man!
Plus, books are for nerds.

988
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,500
Well, maybe you should save
some of that book money for laundry...

989
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,900
'cause your sheets
are getting pretty gross man.

990
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,840
What sheets?
I don't have sheets.

991
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,670
Maybe we should throw them away.

992
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:36,710
Dude, I'm so glad the computer
hooked us up as roommates.

993
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,870
We are friends forever, you and I.

994
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,080
Yep.

995
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,640
I'm pretty psyched about it.

996
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,380
<i>Sheisse</i>, the RA!

997
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,760
S'up bro?
Wanna hackey-sack?

998
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,900
Can we just kill him?

999
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,200
Yeah, do it, seriously,
'cause I get straight A's if he gets killed.

1000
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,270
Remedial Verbs.
You're studying that?

1001
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:02,170
I say speak to the hand to that class.

1002
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,910
I'm not getting up at eleven in the morning!

1003
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:08,010
To create that Insanoflex
you would've had to have...

1004
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:11,810
an advanced knowledge
of biogenetics and robot hydro-rhythms.

1005
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,850
Do you, or...?

1006
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:16,880
See, I learned
how to help Timmy find his nuts.

1007
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,410
Please let me kill him.

1008
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:28,730
Oh, no. My clothes
didn't make it through the time rift!

1009
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:30,230
I'm totally nude.

1010
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,930
Nice going.
You saved the future.

1011
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:36,000
- You told me he invented this!
- I will. I know, I do.

1012
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,140
Did you even study robotics in school?
You didn't, did you?

1013
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,280
No way!
He majored in pottery, man.

1014
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,340
Well, is there...
is there like a giant pot...

1015
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:47,540
that destroys the world
that I might have glazed?

1016
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,480
You can stare at my genitals.

1017
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,650
You totally didn't save the future!

1018
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,790
My vacation is ruined!

1019
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,050
Well then,
who did create the damn thing?!

1020
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,660
- Well, I guess I don't know.
- No you don't. You don't know shit.

1021
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,700
"Thousands of Years Ago."
You randomly string words together...

1022
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,330
that make up ridiculous stories of things
that never happened and never will!

1023
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:15,600
Really? Well then,
what do you make of this?

1024
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:23,010
"I can feel it coming in the air tonight."

1025
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:28,840
"I've been waiting
for this moment all my life."

1026
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,490
My father?

1027
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,890
Yes, no, yes.

1028
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:37,500
Your father.

1029
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,590
Oh my god!
You don't, you don't mean...

1030
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:45,370
Yes.

1031
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:47,410
- Thousands of years ago...
- No, no.

1032
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:50,540
I know who you're talking about.
Don't worry about it.

1033
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,280
- Look, a caterpillar!
- Oh, wait.

1034
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,210
- Where?
- Where's this caterpillar?

1035
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:57,580
- Just keep looking. Come on, let's go.
- Now I see it.

1036
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:00,250
Hello, little caterpillar!

1037
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,950
Destroy him!

1038
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,990
- You never told me we got us a daddy?
- You don't remember?

1039
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:11,300
- Do I remember anything?
- I got your daddy right here.

1040
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,960
He's only got one eye,
and two little uncles for ya too.

1041
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,470
It was a long time ago...

1042
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,670
Did ya hear me?

1043
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,670
I said I got your daddy right here
and I pointed at myself?

1044
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,840
I thought it was only a dream,
but it was a nightmare.

1045
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,910
It was dark, I couldn't see anything.

1046
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,820
But I do remember the painful sting
of hot oil against my skin.

1047
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,860
The hum.

1048
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:49,490
The hum of some type
of enormous mixer.

1049
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,010
And the wet slap
of steel hands on raw meat.

1050
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,410
How you doin'?

1051
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,640
The shriek of a million chickens,
screaming in agony...

1052
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,780
as they were merged into one.

1053
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:13,350
Right on, yeah!

1054
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,700
We were each given part of his brain,
and they brought us to life.

1055
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,330
But <i>he</i> was never the same.

1056
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:25,600
- There we go.
- Did I get some brain?

1057
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,810
- Sort of.
- I know I did. I can feel it.

1058
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:37,650
Well...

1059
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:41,420
- He said it would sort of compensate.
- Guys, down here.

1060
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:45,820
How did I compen...template?

1061
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:47,630
What about me?

1062
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:48,790
Fuck it!

1063
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,430
- I got head cheese?!
- All right...

1064
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:56,200
some of us got brain,
but that's not important, OK?

1065
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,100
- That was a very good story.
- Well, it's not done.

1066
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:03,270
My turn. Once upon a time,
there was a little elf...

1067
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,400
Just shut up!

1068
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:09,510
You have all been created...

1069
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:14,450
for a very ridiculous purpose.

1070
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,350
{\an5\pos(424,43)}I want you to drive this plane...

1071
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,550
{\an5\pos(424,43)}into that brick wall!

1072
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,870
Zero-one-niner,
requesting permission...

1073
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:30,200
for approach
to smash into brick wall, over.

1074
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,360
Permission granted!

1075
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,310
Right on!

1076
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:38,140
- Frylock! You?
- Change of plans, Bittle!

1077
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:49,020
- That's all you got?! Come on!
- Let go!

1078
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,860
No!

1079
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:04,600
No!
My creations!

1080
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,230
Fucking sandals!

1081
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,240
So, I diverted the plane to Africa...

1082
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,280
so we could try to stop world hunger.

1083
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,910
Running into a brick wall just seemed...

1084
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:18,850
like it would hurt. A lot.

1085
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:22,410
I mean, that's just dumb.

1086
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,530
All right, listen up. When we hit the ground,
I want everybody...

1087
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,630
to spread out
in a three meter stance...

1088
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:36,260
wait for air backup and then we're going...

1089
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,740
Chicken Bittle
did not survive the trip.

1090
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:45,070
And it didn't us long
to freak out all of Africa.

1091
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:54,220
- Hi, how ya doing?
- Hey, wait! No! We're here to help you!

1092
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:57,720
Come on, don't run!
Where you going?

1093
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,210
Our mission failed.

1094
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:06,800
So we came back to the States
and rented out this house in New Jersey.

1095
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,800
I couldn't live up to my father's
backwards, retarded expectations.

1096
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,100
I came here to follow my dream...

1097
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,610
of dancing professionally...

1098
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,840
in the nude.

1099
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,410
I mean, on Broadway.

1100
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:23,180
- I don't remember any of this.
- Me neither.

1101
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,920
You kept playing with your Gameboy.

1102
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,620
I'd say, "Shake, look up.
We're saving that."

1103
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,260
And you were all like,
"Well I'm on level three."

1104
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,260
I do remember level three.

1105
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:37,160
Well, did you ever get
to dance...professionally?

1106
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,000
That was a lifetime ago, Meatwad.
I have other responsibilities now.

1107
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,430
Yeah, dinner, right?
Where is it?

1108
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,810
- We're home.
- This ain't my house.

1109
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:51,940
Mine neither.

1110
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,340
Linda, this is some...
food that you've made.

1111
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,520
What is it?

1112
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,490
Apple cinnamon flavored
monkey gland energy shake.

1113
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:08,860
Thought I tasted a hint
of the monkey gland...

1114
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:17,400
Excuse me.

1115
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,200
Linda, I care about you.
I respect you.

1116
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,580
So where am I gonna do you?

1117
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,910
- Man, jackpot!
- Yeah.

1118
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:29,850
Lie down on it while I get nude.

1119
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,180
Yeah, I like it!

1120
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,390
Oh man, you are wild!

1121
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:40,120
- Thank you God!
- Yeah. My bedroom.

1122
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:43,790
Hey baby, your muscle's leaking...

1123
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:46,320
What's up with that?

1124
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,530
Oh no, no!

1125
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,630
Crap!

1126
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:55,310
- Shit.
- This is going to hurt!

1127
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:58,610
- A lot!
- Crap, crap, crap, crap!

1128
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:02,550
Oh, don't cry.
You've been such a good boy.

1129
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:04,480
I'm gonna let you have a lolly!

1130
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:06,870
Now lick it!

1131
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,790
- Listen. Is that Carl?
- Carl!

1132
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,820
Welcome home, boy!

1133
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,600
- You bastard!
- Not anymore, daddy!

1134
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,140
- Daddy?
- Bring it on, motherfucker!

1135
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,400
Come on, take this!

1136
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,680
Come on, I thought you'd love that!

1137
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,810
You'd like some more?

1138
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,330
That's all you got?

1139
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:57,700
God damn it!

1140
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,310
Oh, God Carl!

1141
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:03,930
Thank God. Unchain me.

1142
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,680
Where'd you get that lollipop?

1143
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,770
Bring it on! Come on! Take this!
And some of that with you!

1144
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,420
Can you hold on a sec?
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

1145
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,460
What is it, Steve?

1146
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,950
Did you need anything else
from me today?

1147
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:26,130
'Cause my wife wants me home
at six and...

1148
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,070
Go ahead and punch out.

1149
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:30,970
No, not that one.

1150
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,600
Yes.
That one.

1151
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,180
OK everybody, have a good one.

1152
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,770
God, I love that!

1153
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:13,040
So you created the Insanoflex!

1154
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,450
So you could build someone else up
and use their muscles.

1155
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,720
Yeah.

1156
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,120
Keep going.

1157
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,820
I don't know.

1158
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,380
- To fight me?
- Yes!

1159
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,710
Yes, that's exactly why!

1160
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,820
But...but why?

1161
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,320
Because I hate you, Daddy!

1162
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,290
No, don't you pull
this reverse psychology crap with me!

1163
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:01,730
- It was <i>you</i> who created <i>me</i>!
- No!

1164
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:05,090
It was <i>you</i> who created <i>me</i>!

1165
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,370
- Do you remember this?
- That's Little Death Bear.

1166
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:13,440
- How do I know that?
- But you said I couldn't have it!

1167
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,140
Because you said
I would lose a hand!

1168
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,610
Yeah, man, I mean, look at it,
it's covered with razor blades!

1169
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:22,710
- Well, now I have it.
- Can I have it?

1170
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:26,450
God, now I remember!

1171
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:30,190
- You wanted that thing for Christmas!
- Yes. And instead...

1172
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:33,320
you gave me this.
A Baby Wets All Night!

1173
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,630
And it screwed me up forever!

1174
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:41,700
- But, that's not how I remember it.
- How do you remember it, Daddy?

1175
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:45,270
- With star wipes?
- Yeah, a lot of star wipes.

1176
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:48,110
And Phil Collins
is constantly <i>In The Air Tonight.</i>

1177
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,940
<i>.. Tonight.</i>
I love that song, but why?

1178
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,110
- Behold!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1179
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:55,440
What are you doing back there?

1180
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:59,480
A VHS that you had produced!

1181
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,190
No, that's impossible!

1182
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:03,390
You've got a VCR
in the back of your head?!

1183
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:05,960
It's like David Cronenberg
all up in here.

1184
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,730
It's all coming together now,
don't you see?

1185
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:12,160
You created <i>him</i>
with a piece of <i>your</i> brain!

1186
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,200
And he was your only son.

1187
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,600
But it didn't come out right,
because you were a bad father.

1188
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,900
So you altered your memories
to take away the pain.

1189
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,540
Because you thought...
You know, Chicken Bittle?

1190
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:26,640
You remember him?
His death was your fault!

1191
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,910
So you wiped your mind clean...

1192
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:32,880
threw away your old identity,
and started a new life...

1193
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,820
in obscurity.

1194
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,620
No, that's not how it happened.

1195
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:39,260
This is a VHS, he's a VCR...

1196
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:40,620
and he lives with us.

1197
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:44,860
Daddy, you've grown
into a beautiful young woman.

1198
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,260
Yeah, thanks.
Let's keep that on the down low.

1199
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:50,500
- What did I tell you?!
- I don't believe it. Come on!

1200
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,940
Pay up! Five bucks. Come on!

1201
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:56,670
- But how did...?
- Trapped in a man's body.

1202
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:00,380
- But you was...
- I'm a lesbian.

1203
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,900
- Yeah, but still, I mean...
- On Oprah.

1204
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:08,480
- Yeah, but the...
- Plastic novelty vagina.

1205
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:15,430
- Well, that...explains a lot.
- But one question still remains.

1206
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:17,760
- We created all of <i>you</i>!
- Mutants!

1207
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,860
And the world
you pathetically pretend to live in.

1208
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,770
Now, bring us your beer!

1209
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:27,000
- Your remote needs batteries.
- The TV sucks, man.

1210
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,870
- And now it needs fixing.
- Children, please.

1211
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:32,880
Stop all this bickering!

1212
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,310
That's that watermelon
I was telling you about.

1213
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:38,550
And that was another lie.
And you're going to hell!

1214
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:42,020
Feel the sweet embrace
of Satan's hoof against your face!

1215
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,010
Shake!

1216
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,510
Meatwad?

1217
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,130
Buddy?

1218
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:51,690
Are you OK?

1219
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,200
Stand aside!

1220
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,430
- What...what happened?
- Neil!

1221
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:58,990
Play the drum solo of life!

1222
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:26,430
Yeah, yeah! Rock! Rock out!

1223
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,700
Forget it. I don't want it.

1224
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,230
Hey y'all, I live!

1225
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:05,000
- Who are you?
- I am Walter Melon.

1226
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:09,110
- This is my accomplice Neil.
- How's it going?

1227
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:11,510
- Hi.
- Hello.

1228
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:14,850
And this puddle over here
used to be Steve.

1229
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:16,250
The drum solo of life!

1230
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,970
No, no, that's OK.

1231
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,920
- What are you doin' here?
- Well, I only...

1232
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,220
created all of you!

1233
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,260
I also created the Insanoflex...

1234
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:36,100
and produced
three top-selling exercise videos.

1235
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,440
Then I lost my job.
That sucked.

1236
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,970
They said I spent too
much time editing my videos...

1237
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:43,340
and not enough time
breaking down egg crates...

1238
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,340
which is what I should be doing now
had I not been fired.

1239
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,380
You two were to destroy
each other today...

1240
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:54,890
so I would inherit your real estate
to build the ultimate franchise.

1241
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,650
The Insano-Gym!

1242
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,390
- But we rent.
- So do I.

1243
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:04,800
- Man, we live at the Y.
- Till we get some things going.

1244
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,760
- They won't let us use the pool, man.
- Yes. They won't.

1245
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,830
Are you serious?

1246
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:11,960
Yeah man!
They said we pee in the pool. 'Cause I do!

1247
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,570
- And I as well.
- Yes!

1248
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,470
Digital gold cascades
from our square bladders.

1249
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:18,580
No, about the renting.
You all rent?

1250
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:21,010
- Oh, yes.
- Yes sir. Very much so.

1251
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,650
- At the Y.
- But the Insano-Gym!

1252
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:26,350
You couldn't put a gym
in a residential neighborhood.

1253
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:28,290
It's not even zoned for commercial use.

1254
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:30,720
You'd probably have to go
through the city, or something.

1255
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:35,490
Yeah. Well. I guess this
kinda foils your stupid plan.

1256
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:40,300
- Papa?
- Well, yeah! Kinda!

1257
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,430
Damn it!
I'm telling your mother.

1258
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:44,490
- Mother?
- Neil, come on!

1259
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,100
Wait, wait!
We have a mother?

1260
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,370
Yes, Frylock, I am your mother.

1261
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,810
And I am a nine-layer bean burrito.

1262
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,350
That's neat.

1263
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:08,330

1264
