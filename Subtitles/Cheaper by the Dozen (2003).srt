This is business.

All right, focus on
your navies and your grays.

Navy is muscle,
gray is smarts.

My book's getting published.

we're gonna have it all?

All right, there's one thing.
What?

They asked me to go
to New York for a few days.

Oh.
"Oh"?

518

That was a good "oh,"

Yes, it's not
the best timing in the world.

I can handle this.

That's easy for you to say.
You're an only child.

And, sure, last time
it was just my pants.

*

1465
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:38,240
* What wishes will you make

1466
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,243
* When the season is near

1467
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:43,278
* Will your dreams
be the same *

1468
01:34:43,378 --> 01:34:45,748
* As they were last year

1469
01:34:45,781 --> 01:34:48,183
* Will you ask for a little

1470
01:34:48,283 --> 01:34:50,753
* Will you ask for a lot

1471
01:34:50,786 --> 01:34:52,921
* And when you make your list

1472
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,590
* Will there be something
you forgot *

1473
01:34:55,758 --> 01:34:58,326
* How about peace on Earth

1474
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:00,628
* It can't be bought or sold

1475
01:35:00,763 --> 01:35:03,431
* How about peace
this Christmas *

1476
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,768
* And someone's hand to hold

1477
01:35:05,868 --> 01:35:08,636
* How about love
in our hearts *

1478
01:35:08,771 --> 01:35:10,773

1482
01:35:23,852 --> 01:35:26,121
* That you've been
waiting for *

1483
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,390
* Snowfall and presents

1484
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,793
* Choirs singing at your door

1485
01:35:30,893 --> 01:35:33,428
* This season will be perfect

1486
01:35:33,528 --> 01:35:36,331
* Like those picture
postcard scenes *

1487
01:35:36,431 --> 01:35:38,801
* But is that the answer

1488
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:41,136
* Is that what Christmas
really means *

1489
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:43,806

* And that's what
Christmas should be *

1497
01:36:02,825 --> 01:36:05,660
* What would you sacrifice

1498
01:36:05,828 --> 01:36:10,198
* What would you give away

1499
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:16,404

gift of all *
