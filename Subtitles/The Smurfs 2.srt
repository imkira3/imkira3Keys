2
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,126
Time to smurf some magic.

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,569
Let's see.

4
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,250
There you are.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,163
Mimosa pollen.

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,250
Yes, tiger lily

7
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,642
to make her essence magical and blue.

8
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,321
Unless this spell be all for naught,

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,324
the final thing, one hopeful thought.

10
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,442
Once upon a time, in Smurf Village,

11
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,445
happy Smurfs
were going about their happy lives

12
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,605
completely unaware that not too far away,

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,763
the evil wizard Gargamel

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,526
was concocting a diabolical plan.

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,520
Hey-

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,965
Hey!

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,010
Smooth, you're upstaging the narrator.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,289
Yo, take it down a notch,
my blues brothers.

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,362
- All right. All right.
- Thank you. Anyway...

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,885
So Gargamel said,

21
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,647
"I am making my own irresistible creation,"

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,204
"the Smurfette, to infiltrate their village
and betray the Smurfs."

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,807
Wow.

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,325
Not a good look on her.

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,970
- She's a Frankensmurf?
- Yes.

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,248
And her naughty nature
took Smurf Village by storm.

27
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,606
She even flooded our village.

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,080
The Smurfs wanted her gone,

29
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,246
but even though she was Gargamel's
creation, Papa saw the good in her.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,531
With love, kindness, a complete makeover,
and a secret magic formula,

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,843
he turned her into a true-blue Smurf,

32
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,608
and that is how
our darling Smurfette came to be.

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,761
- Hi.
- Holy moly.

34
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,285
Hi, Smurfette.

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,609
I wish I had that hair.

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,686
- Nice dive, Smurfette.
- That was amazing.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,727
Wow. Show-off.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,887
Pretty!

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,282
- That was so purty.
- Nice tuck and roll.

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,089
- Hi!
- Like a beautiful mermaid.

41
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,925
Wait, how is her hair still dry?

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,363
Oh, no.

43
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,005
What...

44
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,123
Stupid, trusting Smurfs.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,009
You're mine now.

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,003
- It's alive!
- Smurf for the hills!

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,844
Don't kill the narrator!

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,962
The world as we know it is over!

49
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,044
She's got a Dragon Wand.

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,770
Don't hurt my cupcake!

51
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,841
Look out!

52
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,767
Yes! My beautiful creation.

53
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,128
You truly are daddy's little girl.

54
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,090
No...

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,846
Smurfette, are you okay?

56
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,205
Oh, Papa.

57
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,441
There, there. Everything's
going to be fine.

58
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,522
Having that nightmare again?

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,765
Papa, every year on my birthday,

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,844
I have these horrible dreams
about where I come from,

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,528
and it makes me wonder who I really am.

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,766
And every year, I remind you,
it doesn't matter where you came from.

63
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,684
What matters is who you choose to be.

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,524
Really?

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,166
Don't take this old Smurf's word for it.

66
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,720
Go out there and see for yourself.

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,121
This is where you belong.

68
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,806
<i>You belong to Gargamel.</i>

69
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,406
<i>You belong to Gargamel.</i>

70
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,089
"You belong to Gargamel." Say it.

71
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,764
"You belong to Gargamel."

72
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,241
“I, I.”

73
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,324
You know what? Never mind, sir.
You're a dim-witted toad.

74
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,251
"You're a dim-witted toad, sir?"

75
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,402
No, actually, you are!

76
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,885
There.

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,206
<i>Yet another groundbreaking feat of illusion</i>

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,205
<i>from the most innovative conjurer
the world has ever seen.</i>

79
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,727
Gargamania,

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,169
the magical sensation that has captivated
the nation from New York to Las Vegas,

81
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,244
is now taking on the City of Light,
Paris, France.

82
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,161
This master mysterio
has gone from unknown to unstoppable

83
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,601
after a surprise discovery in New York.

84
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,362
Yo, get out of the road, freak!

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,967
How dare you? How dare you call me "Yo"?

86
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,123
Hey, no, put my car down.

87
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,965
Yo, how do you like it up there?

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,406
Moron.

89
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,241
<i>From New York street performer
to the new toast of Europe,</i>

90
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,120
<i>the only magician ever to play
the famed Paris Opera House.</i>

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,406
<i>Stay tuned.</i>

92
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,562
Oh, dear gods, can we please
just have one quiet carriage ride

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,644
without you tormenting me about
using up all the Smurf essence?

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,089
I extracted all I could from Papa Smurf
in the kingdom of New York.

95
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,889
How much essence did you extract?

96
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,481
I'm squandering it?

97
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,641
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,167
I had to turn that man into a giant toad.
It's a magic show, isn't it?

99
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,608
Because without Smurf essence, I can't...

100
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,490
Why am I even discussing this with you?
You don't have any magic!

101
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,847
Stick that on your
Facebook page and lick it.

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,490
Like it. Like it. Whatever.

103
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,966
Besides,

104
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,489
I still have plenty enough essence left to
carry out my delightfully diabolical plan.

105
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,730
Now, my adoring public desires me.

106
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,650
Hello!

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,929
Hello, my lowly little bootlicks.

108
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,211
Yes, you must all worship me.

109
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,281
Yes.

110
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,364
Even you, my flea-bitten little fur bag.

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,089
All hail the great and powerful...

112
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,130
Azrael... Azrael... Stop it.

113
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,210
Open it! Open it!

114
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,761
Come, Azrael. Hurry up.

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,729
Hello, handsome.

116
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,565
Look, a present.

117
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,961
No doubt from a worshipping admirer.

118
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,161
It's for you.

119
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,811
You are not more popular than I am.

120
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,325
A little green dot?

121
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,689
Why do you get all the little green dots?

122
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,530
Get it, get it.

123
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,006
Father's going to love this.

124
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,081
- Hackus want to play.
- Hey!

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,400
Let Hackus play with the kitty.

126
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,760
Cover me.

127
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,881
I'm going in.

128
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,401
Hello, kitty.

129
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,765
Vexy!

130
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,604
All right, my little Naughties.

131
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,041
Yeah!

132
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,084
Hackus to the rescue!

133
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,526
Booyah!

134
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,648
Good save, Hackus.

135
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,841
Pull, pull!

136
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,764
Hackus cat-fishing. Caught a big one.

137
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,923
And round 12 goes to the Naughties.

138
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,083
Well said, my dim brother.

139
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,447
Apparently, it wasn't a gift, Azrael.

140
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,965
It was a trap.

141
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,646
- Very amusing, my little Naughties.
- Hey!

142
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,926
Did we please you, Father?

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,003
No, no, you didn't.

144
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,887
You know what would please me, Vexy,
if you were blue like real Smurfs,

145
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,362
then your essence would endow me with real
magic like that of a true-blue Smurf.

146
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,370
That would excite me.

147
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,245
Instead, you're both just
deeply disappointing experiments.

148
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,566
Experiment?

149
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,644
Like my traitorous Smurfette.

150
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,845
The banner goes over there, please.
Thank you, and I love the piñata.

151
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,241
- How's that, Gutsy?
- A little lower, Grouchy.

152
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,971
I want to be able to
whack him right in the smurf berries.

153
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,003
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

154
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,243
What a cake!
Smurfette's gonna love this party!

155
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,971
Hey, who smurfed a bite
out of Smurfette's birthday cake?

156
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,041
- Not me.
- I don't know.

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,168
- Greedy?
- What? Why you all looking at me?

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,403
Hey, Brainy, here's my present
for Smurfette's surprise party.

159
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,041
Come on, Jokey, do you really think that I,
the smartest Smurf in the village,

160
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,009
- would fall for your sophomoric gag?
- Yep.

161
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,844
Just give me the card.

162
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,088
Out-smurfed by a simpleton.

163
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,164
- She's coming. Smurfette's coming.
- Oh, no! The surprise will be ruined.

164
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,290
Code blue! Code blue!
Repeat, this is not a drill. Code blue.

165
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,441
Undo it, unglue it!

166
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,851
We gotta get her out of here!

167
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,048
Here she is! Act natural!

168
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,526
Hey, guys.

169
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,207
Anyone want to do anything fun
on this special day?

170
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,209
Hey, Vanity.

171
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,601
Want to sit by the fountain
and look at your reflection?

172
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,650
Kind of tired of looking
at myself, Smurfette.

173
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,960
As if.

174
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,963
Nope, not building anything for anybody.

175
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,041
- Hey, Party Planner.
- Hey.

176
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,963
- Hey, Social Smurf.
- Yes, darling?

177
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,123
Anything fun coming up
that I should know about?

178
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,441
No, nothing till Smurfapalooza.

179
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,881
It's going to be wild, right, Social Smurf?

180
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,648
Yeah. I've got it all over the Smurf Web.
It's got 101 likes on Smurf book.

181
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,085
I will put you on the guest list.

182
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,323
So, no one remembered my birthday?

183
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,408
The surprise is gonna be ruined!

184
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,449
Hush up! Hush up!

185
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,326
You know, Smurfette, occasionally,
it's good to have a little alone time.

186
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,802
- Yeah, so take a hike.
- Yeah, we don't need you here, we're good.

187
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,927
- Bye.
- There you go.

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,490
See you.

189
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,450
We fooled her pretty good,
don't you think, Clueless Smurf?

190
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,162
Yeah!
She's got no idea about the surprise party!

191
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,567
Dude.

192
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,766
Maybe I really don't belong here.

193
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,129
Okay, blow out the candles, Blue.

194
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,762
Nice.

195
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,331
Okay, I think
I've got everyone's issues covered here.

196
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,122
This is an organic, gluten-free,
antioxidant-rich acai berry cake

197
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,049
made locally by a cruelty-free baker
who swears he's never even seen a peanut.

198
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,770
Everybody good? Right?

199
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,650
- Are these plates PCB-free?
- No.

200
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,044
- Actually, we're good.
- Actually, we're good. PCB and BPA-free.

201
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,326
Daddy, can we cut the cake?

202
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,521
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do that.

203
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,761
Cut it.

204
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,047
Boy, who thought parenting
could be so complicated?

205
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,406
- Yummy.
- Seriously, guys?

206
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,561
You guys make it look easy.

207
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,563
Yeah, you must have had a great role model.

208
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,687
No, not really.

209
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,566
- My dad took off when I was five, so...
- Am I late?

210
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,641
Did I miss all the presents?

211
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,565
Hey!

212
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,361
- Grandpa Vicster!
- Hey!

213
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,447
Happy birthday, Blue.

214
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,807
Now it's a party. Hello.

215
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,291
I'm Victor, Patrick's dad.

216
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,882
And you must all be his friends,
which makes you my friends.

217
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,961
So let's go.

218
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,760
Arms in the air, you're all getting hugs.

219
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,927
Hey, okay.

220
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,526
I thought you said your father left you.

221
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,808
He did. This is my stepfather.

222
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,484
You'll want him to leave. Just wait.

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,523
Hello. Where's my Gracie?

224
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,523
- Hey.
- Victor.

225
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,045
How are you?

226
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,281
You know, ever since Blue was born,

227
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,921
I kind of miss you being as big as a house
with more of you to hug.

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,047
Yep.

229
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,686
And now, I've saved the
biggest hug for last.

230
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,002
- Boundaries, please. Boundaries.
- Let's show them how it's done.

231
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,605
Unhand me.

232
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,280
I don't like this at all.

233
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,006
Thank you.

234
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,847
There's nothing like
the embrace of two proud Doyle men.

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,206
I am not a Doyle man.

236
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,361
Little Paddy Doyle.

237
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,841
- Winslow.
- Okay, compromise. Winslow.

238
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,729
Hyphen-Doyle.

239
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,571
Hey, isn't he the guy
from the Korndog commercials on TV?

240
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,722
- Hey, you're right.
- Well, you got me.

241
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,120
- Korndog King.
- No, no, no.

242
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,167
- One moment.
- Please not this.

243
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,720
Now, in honour of Blue's birthday,

244
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,641
I'm going to present each and every
one of you with a free Korndog...

245
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,200
- Thank you.
- ...on the house.

246
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,049
Teriaki dog.

247
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,526
That's for you.

248
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,364
Do these have any peanuts?

249
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,046
I would never put peanuts in a Korndog.

250
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,201
Great.

251
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,691
Go ahead, big guy, it's okay.

252
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,684
For the simple reason, you see,
we deep-fry them in peanut oil.

253
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,801
Peanut oil?

254
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,605
- What?
- Johnny, spit it... Spit it out right away!

255
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,245
Okay, I got the phone, okay.

256
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,768
Spit it out, Johnny! Spit it out right away!
Into Mama's hands.

257
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,961
Deep breath for the EpiPen.

258
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,242
- It's okay.
- What's happening to that kid's lips?

259
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,046
- Azrael, bring me my plan.
- Father?

260
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,168
It's in the bathroom.
Check my side of the sink.

261
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,241
Father?

262
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,965
It's feeding time.

263
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,849
Hackus dizzy.

264
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,002
Yes, I almost forgot.

265
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,447
Apparently, I have to keep you alive.

266
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,844
I hope you both appreciate
what a tremendous burden this is upon me.

267
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,160
All right, mind your manners.

268
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,560
Thank you.

269
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,884
If you were real Smurfs,
I'd be taking essence from you.

270
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,531
I didn't hear a "thank you."

271
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,330
Close enough. Come, come.

272
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,644
We must review my plan
before tonight's raid on Smurf Village.

273
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,769
This is not my writing parchment.
Where is my plan?

274
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,761
"Gone digital"?

275
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,968
I don't understand what that means.

276
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,487
Yes, phase one, "Create Naughties." Yes.

277
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,642
Check. Where is phase two?

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,968
I am enamoured of that swiping motion.

279
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,731
Yes, get away, get away,
get away, get away.

280
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,770
Phase three... Swipe.

281
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,729
I capture my ungrateful daughter

282
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,044
and force her to tell me the secret formula
that Papa used to turn her blue.

283
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,201
Swipe.

284
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,408
I turn you and hundreds
other like you blue.

285
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,484
Hackus blue!

286
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,401
I place you into a terrifying machine
and extract your essence.

287
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,567
- What?
- And then,

288
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,651
the entire world shall bow before me!

289
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,646
Will that extracting thing hurt?

290
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,326
It's excruciatingly painless.

291
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,528
You'll see, it'll be fun, for me.

292
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,640
Anyway, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

293
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,130
Back to phase two, the very reason
we came to this cheese-infested metropolis.

294
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,602
The great iron spire.

295
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,284
The only possible way

296
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,888
to harness enough energy to create a portal
right into the heart of Smurf Village.

297
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,611
How I love portal creation.

298
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,809
Come, come, let us away! To the iron spire!

299
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,962
It worked!

300
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,606
Yes! Just enough essence!

301
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,687
And now I will go down in history!

302
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,650
Nothing can stop me now!

303
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,442
My Gargaberries!

304
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,801
Oh, no!

305
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,170
Now I shall prove my genius!

306
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,247
Head spin!

307
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,291
It appears I lack sufficient essence
to create a human-size portal.

308
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,603
Father, I can fit through there.
Let me get Smurfette.

309
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,727
Hackus go! Hackus go!

310
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,211
- Hey!
- Hackus go!

311
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,284
Yes, yes. Well, let's see here.

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,049
- Eeny, meeny, miny...
- Pick me! Pick me!

313
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,207
Moron.

314
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,247
Yes!

315
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,369
- Hey, Hackus, listen to this.
- What?

316
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,646
I win.

317
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,410
Nicely played, Vexy.

318
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,084
Now, I must warn you.

319
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,731
Your destination is a true horror.

320
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,328
A realm filled with
the relentless crushing quiet of peace,

321
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,609
punctuated by
the wretched cacophony of joyousness.

322
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,449
- It's horrible.
- What a nightmare.

323
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,921
Yes, yes, it completely ruined your sister.

324
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,287
It's such a shame when
a bad girl turns good.

325
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,361
So true.

326
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,007
But she does know the secret formula,

327
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,369
so go get Smurfette!

328
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,082
I just don't get it.

329
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,329
They know how tough my birthday can be,

330
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,284
and they didn't even remember.

331
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,206
Maybe Papa was wrong.

332
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,204
Guess I'll never really be one of them.

333
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,728
- Oh, no!
- Help.

334
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,451
Please, wait.

335
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,051
I escaped.

336
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,366
Escaped?

337
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,930
From the evil wizard who made me.

338
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,124
Do you mean Gargamel?

339
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,806
Is Gargamel your father?

340
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,370
Yes.

341
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,046
But he's...

342
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,930
That means you're just like me.

343
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,202
- Gotcha!
- What are you doing?

344
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,248
Father's going to be very happy.

345
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,005
Smurfette's in trouble!

346
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,206
- Crikey!
- Oh, no!

347
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,328
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Smurfette!

348
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,004
No!

349
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,844
- Oh, no, you don't.
- No!

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,411
- Let go!
- Now get in there!

351
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,050
Oh, no!

352
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,249
- She's being smurf napped.
- Unhand her!

353
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,051
So long, Smurfs.

354
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,164
- Smurfette!
- Smurfette!

355
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,366
What are we gonna do now?

356
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,287
My powers of deduction lead me to believe
that this is the work of Gargamel.

357
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,441
Oh, no, oh, no!

358
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,087
- Yes!
- Pretty blue.

359
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,525
Gargamel.

360
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,729
Smurfette. Welcome home.

361
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,527
You're wasting your time, Gargamel.

362
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,329
Papa and the others are gonna come for me.

363
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,244
I don't think so.

364
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,890
They came for Clumsy.

365
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,649
Yes, but you see, Clumsy was a real Smurf.

366
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,930
Whereas I was the one who created you.

367
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,562
You do remember that, don't you, dear?

368
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,490
You're not my father. Just let me go home.

369
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,891
Of course.

370
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,291
Anything you say,

371
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,402
but first, I will need one itsy-bitsy,
teeny-tiny little thing first.

372
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,528
- Teeny-tiny.
- What?

373
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,564
Just the secret formula that Papa
used to turn you into a real Smurf.

374
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,405
Hackus real Smurf. Hackus blue!

375
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,720
Like you, blondie.

376
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,247
It would benefit us both,
don't you see, my dear?

377
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,529
You give me the formula,
I turn my little Naughties blue.

378
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,410
- Blue.
- I use their essence

379
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,643
to continue with
my wonderful magic show here.

380
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,248
That way I never have to bother you
or Smurf Village again.

381
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,370
I don't trust you,
and I'm not telling you anything.

382
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,003
Well,
perhaps you need a little persuasion, eh?

383
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,366
Naughties, attack!

384
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,409
With pleasure.

385
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,527
Attack!

386
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,569
- No, no, no, not each other.
- Not me!

387
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,609
I got you...

388
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,960
Hackus!

389
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,645
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

390
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,761
Not the cat, not the...

391
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,764
Deeply, deeply disappointing experiments.

392
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,490
We've got to rescue Smurfette.

393
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,085
What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?

394
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,650
All right, Smurfs, listen up.

395
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,487
I saved enough grotto water from the last
blue moon for just such an occasion.

396
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,882
I was able to
smurf it into smurfportation crystals.

397
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,049
So you don't need a portal.
Very clever, Papa.

398
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,440
Smurf-xactly.

399
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,524
These will take us directly to
Master Winslow's mushroom.

400
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,849
Yeah, Patrick and Grace helped us
last time we smurfed through the portal.

401
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,809
Precisely! They'll know what to do!

402
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,960
- Sign me up!
- Sign me up.

403
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,962
- At your service, Papa.
- Pick me!

404
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,650
- Did someone say, "Baker should go"?
- I would rather not.

405
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,721
Me, me, pick me, Papa!

406
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,202
Now, now, Smurfs.
I only had water enough for nine crystals.

407
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,569
That's me and three others round trip,
plus Smurfette on the way home.

408
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,728
Assuming you can find her, which you won't.

409
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,407
That's not a very smurfy attitude, Grouchy.

410
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,608
Actually, for me, that was pretty good.

411
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,764
I'll need courage,
intelligence and strength.

412
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,126
- So Gutsy.
- Aye.

413
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,326
- Brainy.
- Of course.

414
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,566
- Hefty.
- You got it.

415
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,524
- You'll smurf with me.
- Yeah, can I...

416
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,841
Yes, Passive-Aggressive Smurf?

417
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,766
I think Brainy is a
really excellent choice.

418
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,841
Good luck with that.

419
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,240
You see what he does?

420
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,209
- That's not a compliment.
- Go figure.

421
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,601
- Okay, Hefty, take one.
- Let's do this.

422
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,768
- Go her, guys!
- Oops!

423
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,841
Clumsy.

424
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,200
Somebody do something!

425
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,522
Stand back! I know the Smurflich manoeuvre.

426
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,881
He doesn't look good.

427
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,883
Oh, dear, he's turning blue-er.

428
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,961
Not good.

429
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,923
Somebody get my hammer!

430
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,889
Nice going, Clumsy.

431
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,247
I got it!

432
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,890
Cheerio!

433
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,202
This was supposed to be Hefty!

434
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,725
Sorry! My bad!

435
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,326
I get so puffy when I travel.

436
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,441
Bye.

437
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,286
Well, sometimes,
you got to smurf with the changes.

438
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,441
Travel safe, Papa.

439
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,245
<i>And so Papa and his B team...</i>

440
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,765
I'll be in charge while you're gone!

441
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,081
<i>- And</i> so Papa...
- Go get Smurfette back!

442
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,891
- Come on!
- And bring her home!

443
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,006
I'm glad his throat opened up
and his lips are back to normal.

444
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,844
Again, we're so sorry.

445
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,002
If... Hello?

446
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,883
Johnny can breathe again, which makes two of
us since both of his parents are lawyers.

447
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,850
Well, that's why they overreacted.

448
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,126
They didn't overreact.

449
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,964
He's dying.

450
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,123
I think it's time for this.

451
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,443
You didn't bring the crown.
Don't put the crown on him.

452
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,010
Come on, you used to love this crown.

453
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,491
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

454
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,244
- You wore it everywhere.
- I did not.

455
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,407
Never did. Never once.

456
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,604
This is the way you do it... Look.

457
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,962
Do you see what is going on out there?

458
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,803
Yeah, they're bonding.

459
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,124
- Technically, they're spitting.
- Come on.

460
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,601
Blue needs to know that
family's not just you and me,

461
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,603
and it's really good for him
to play with his grandfather.

462
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,205
Good job!

463
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,011
- Oh, yeah. He's a terrific role model.
- Come on, Patrick.

464
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,525
Grace, he ruins everything.

465
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,281
He shows up, and he ruins things.
That's what he does.

466
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,645
Just like when he first
moved into my house.

467
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,927
He sent my parrot away.

468
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,001
Your parrot?

469
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,162
My father's parrot.

470
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,928
When my dad took off, he left Zeus,
and I loved that bird.

471
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,848
I was a kid, and Zeus
was the only part of my dad I had left.

472
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,091
There you go.

473
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,487
What?

474
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,124
Get Blue. Blue?

475
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,810
Blue?

476
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,251
Blue! Victor!

477
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,361
- Stay there.
- Victor, do you have Blue?

478
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,561
Victor! We can't get the door open!

479
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,046
Victor!

480
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,601
- Victor, open the door!
- Victor, we can't open the door!

481
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,602
I can't see! I can't see!

482
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,486
I'm on a dark, lifeless planet
that smells like corn dogs!

483
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,531
Oh, the smurfanity.

484
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,281
Sorry, mister. Your face got in the way.

485
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,964
- Is that Clumsy? Smurfs?
- Clumsy?

486
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,724
- Help!
- Look out, Grouchy!

487
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,450
- Clumsy, is that you?
- This way!

488
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,961
- I'm blind!
- No, you're in a corn dog.

489
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,320
I knew it would end this way!

490
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,606
Where am I?

491
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,644
This place is strange and terrifying

492
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,167
and so handsome.

493
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,009
Hello, you.

494
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,161
No! '

495
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,483
We're lost in the dark,
and it smells like corn dogs!

496
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,681
Watch out!

497
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,444
Master Winslow's gotten old.

498
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,250
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Blue?

499
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,448
Stop, stop, stop. They're friends.

500
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,641
- Friends?
- Yeah.

501
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,800
They're little blue aliens
trying to steal our faces.

502
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,490
No, no, they're called Smurfs.

503
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,803
And they are the sweetest little things
you ever did see.

504
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,881
Not me.

505
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,008
No, not you, Grouchy.

506
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,241
Papa, Clumsy.

507
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,811
- Patrick!
- Master Winslow.

508
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,360
- Hi, Grace.
- Smurf, Smurf, Smurf!

509
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,126
- Is that Blue?
- He's huge.

510
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,687
I wouldn't want to be
the stork that brought that guy.

511
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,520
Well, if Blue likes the Smurfs,
then Vicster likes the Smurfs.

512
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,650
What a thrill this must be for all of you.

513
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,489
No pictures, please.

514
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,561
That's Vanity.

515
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,171
Narcissist.

516
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,321
What are you guys doing here?

517
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,851
Smurfette's been taken.

518
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,240
- Wait, what?
- Taken? What do you mean "taken"?

519
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,727
Smurf napped by that ghastly Gargamel.

520
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,610
She was off alone
because she thought we forgot her birthday.

521
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,121
There was a misunderstanding.

522
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,851
But if we can find him, we'll find her.

523
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,888
Well, that shouldn't be hard.
He's a big star now.

524
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,883
- He's in Paris.
- I'll call the dog sitter.

525
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,246
You get Blue's passport.

526
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,483
Yes, a rescue mission. I'll come, too.

527
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,727
You need all the help you can get.

528
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,604
Wait a minute, Blue's passport?

529
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,450
We can't just up and go to Paris.

530
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,967
At least, not all of us.

531
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,603
Okay, so that's one vote no. Who votes yes?

532
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,886
- Me.
- Of course.

533
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,322
Daddy always loses.

534
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,404
Look, this is my Smurfette
we're talking about. We have to go.

535
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,680
If we're going to be travelling,
let's make sure we do this properly.

536
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,965
Okay, here we are. Victor,
can you get Blue?

537
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,285
- All right. We're all clear on the plan, right?
- Yeah.

538
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,441
We'll head over to Gargamel's show

539
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,124
- and see if Smurfette's there.
- Yes.

540
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,124
And I'll go to Gargamel's hotel and see
if I can find out what room he's in.

541
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,680
And, Victor, you and Blue
can just check into the room here.

542
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,082
- Well, actually, I was thinking...
- No. "Actually, I" nothing.

543
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,281
You and Blue, upstairs.

544
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,680
That's the deal. End of story.

545
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,010
<i>L'Opera House, s'il vous plaft.</i>

546
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,690
My French is <i>trés</i> sexy, non?

547
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,730
- Oui, maybe I'll get you a beret.
- You cannot handle me in a beret.

548
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,724
- Is that what you think? I can't...
- Hey!

549
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,040
Get a shroom.

550
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,611
- Good luck.
- You, too.

551
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,966
Okay.

552
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Give him the formula.

553
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,451
You want to give it to him.

554
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,602
You'll feel better about yourself

555
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,327
if you stop being such an annoying
little brat and give him the formula.

556
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,729
Make her stop. It burns.

557
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,044
Hackus tell you everything I know.

558
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,840
Hackus doesn't know anything.

559
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,842
What? What?

560
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,729
"Buffering"? What the...

561
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,486
My public awaits.

562
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,645
Once again I must go astound
and confound the merry imbeciles.

563
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,649
What do you mean, I'm out of essence?

564
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,047
We can still do the show, all right.

565
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,482
Because we got all the essence we need
right here now, don't we?

566
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,044
I'm going to need a little snip.

567
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,850
Oh, no!

568
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,850
Just going to take a little
off around the ears.

569
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,921
There.

570
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,247
When my Papa gets here,
you're gonna be sorry.

571
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,525
Your Papa is not coming
because your real Papa is already here.

572
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,965
- Yeah!
- Now,

573
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,527
you can either be a good little girl
and give me the formula,

574
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,002
or you can spend the rest
of your miserable little existence

575
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,324
being harvested
inside my new superpowered Smurfalator!

576
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,323
Your call entirely. Really.

577
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,851
UP to you.

578
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,843
Father! Father!

579
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,966
Yes!

580
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,360
Nice work, my dear.

581
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,330
And as for you, nice try.

582
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,401
Yes, Azrael.

583
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,682
You can press the button
on the Smurfalator.

584
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,841
Come, come, come!

585
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,441
We'll brew this hair into Smurf essence!

586
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,969
Papa, please hurry.

587
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,929
I'm so scared.

588
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,368
Poor baby's gonna cry.

589
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,930
Hello, pretty lady.

590
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,321
Hackus pretty, too.

591
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,000
- Hi.
- Hello.

592
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,447
I was just wondering if you could be
so kind as to tell me what room...

593
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,369
What room Monsieur Gargamel is in?

594
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,648
No. Hotel policy.

595
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,281
Just right over there. Thanks.

596
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,000
Here we are, guys, the Paris Opera House.

597
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,807
- Not too shabby.
- Gargamel's really come up in the world.

598
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,481
I hope Smurfette's here.

599
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,684
I do love a good musical. Guilty!

600
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,126
- What did he just say?
- I have no idea.

601
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,842
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

602
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,447
I asked for a shroud of mystery.
This is a wisp!

603
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,686
Alakazatmosphere!

604
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,165
Holy smurf!

605
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,927
- Where did that come from?
- He's never had this much power before.

606
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,010
Well, I am outraged!

607
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,406
Positively outraged.

608
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,409
I'm sorry, who are you?

609
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,128
I am Monsieur Gargamel's manager,
Madame Doolittle.

610
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,123
What is this outhouse you call a room?

611
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,362
- The Napoleon Suite?
- Napoleon Suite? Yes.

612
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,130
But, Madame,
this is the finest room in all the hotel.

613
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,884
What could possibly...

614
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,123
Well, for starters, darling,
it's on the wrong floor.

615
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,168
No one wants to be on the...

616
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,961
- The fifth floor.
- Yes. Yes, that's much too low.

617
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,490
Oh, boy.

618
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,361
Good evening! Good evening!

619
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,765
Okay, guys, we're going in.

620
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,960
No, no, no.

621
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,167
Great.

622
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,163
Okay, Papa,
sneak out the back of my sweater

623
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,521
while I talk to this man
who has no idea what I'm saying

624
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,891
and go find that dressing room.

625
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,165
This is a great vacation, guys.
I can feel the stress melting right off me.

626
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,323
- Don't spiral, Grouchy.
- Yeah. We got this.

627
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,086
- Gentlemen, we have a cat problem.
- Get down, get down.

628
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,923
There! No, no, don't be alarmed.

629
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,162
This is how I treat all the critics.

630
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,125
Hurry, up those ropes.

631
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,004
Is Smurfette really worth all this?

632
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,445
- I'm just saying.
- Let's go.

633
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,086
- Not permis. Not permis.
- What? This is outrageous.

634
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,163
Your families will all pay dearly.

635
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,846
As a result, some of you may die.

636
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,251
No, I'm sorry, you will need your key card.

637
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,091
Yes, of course, darling, my key card!

638
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,202
Oh, dear, I've left it.

639
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,208
Oui, I was having breakfast at Tiffany's.

640
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,490
I'll just go back and get it.

641
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,322
I bet my glutes look great
climbing up this rope.

642
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,925
Grouchy, take a look.

643
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,047
I hate my life.

644
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,286
- Clumsy!
- Move it.

645
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,440
Interrupt my sorcery,
at least I should be amused.

646
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,089
Now, you will all kindly hail to the great
and exceedingly powerful Gargamel...

647
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,527
What are you doing out here? How dare you?

648
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,491
You smell something suspicious?
Well, of course you do!

649
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,051
I've seen where you put your nose.

650
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,690
Now, get out of here.

651
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,841
Hi, Daddy.

652
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,327
- Blue?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, just listen...

653
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,480
Blue and I decided
we can't let you run solo on this.

654
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,561
We can do this together.

655
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,291
Three generations of proud Doyle men
standing shoulder to shoulder.

656
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,560
Even though we're all
different heights and whatnot.

657
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,762
We are not Doyle men.

658
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,160
Winslow-hyphen-Doyle.

659
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,244
You have a bee in your bonnet
about the whole name thing.

660
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,401
Why do you chortle?

661
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,529
Usually, in magic, the cats are big, no?

662
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,808
Like tiger or like lions, you know?

663
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,408
Silence, knave! And allow me to oblige you.

664
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,482
Alakazanimal!

665
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,209
Try not to smell delicious!

666
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,800
So far, this is the worst trip of my life!

667
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,371
And I've only taken two!

668
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,171
- Look! There's Gargamel's dressing room.
- Good eye, Vanity.

669
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,242
Please! He's got a star on his door.

670
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,367
Let's go.

671
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,727
Remind me to put a star
on my mushroom when we get home.

672
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,722
- If we ever want to be blue...
- Blue.

673
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,689
We've got to come up with
some way to get her talking.

674
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,569
- Yeah.
- Got any ideas?

675
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,047
I got it! Say "please."

676
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,885
Never mind. I forgot you were you.

677
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,728
- All right, here's my plan.
- Okay.

678
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,804
We trick her into
acting like us, being naughty.

679
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,927
Naughty, naughty!

680
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,287
We use all her goodness against her.

681
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,126
Once that happens,
she'll feel like she's part of our family!

682
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,408
Family! I like family!

683
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,931
I love this plan!

684
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,161
- Oh, no!
- Broken family!

685
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,645
- Get her!
- Catch her! Catch Smurfette!

686
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,609
See you later, Smurfigators!

687
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,445
Father's gonna kill us! Go faster!

688
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,208
- Au revoir, trolls!
- Get her!

689
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,247
- Hello?
- Smurfette?

690
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,560
- Where are you?
- Quick question.

691
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,723
How is it we can't reach a doorknob,
but we can get up here?

692
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,046
No, Clumsy, don't! No, no!

693
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,004
You just lost a fight to an empty room.

694
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,083
Nobody wants to come up here

695
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,323
and play with the larger kitty
that they so annoyingly asked for!

696
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,481
You have to go! Now!

697
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,608
- Yeah, soon as we get the Smurfette.
- Yeah!

698
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,804
- He coughs up everything he eats.
- You!

699
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,125
Magic man, hand over the Smurfette.

700
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,801
What did you just say?

701
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,570
You heard me.

702
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,927
Give me the Smurfette! Now!

703
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,646
How dare you? Alaka...

704
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,921
- Duck!
- ...duck!

705
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,566
Duck?

706
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,606
That was... up.

707
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,250
No!

708
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,321
You.

709
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,729
By great Merlin's beard, I remember you!

710
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,685
We meet again, eh?

711
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,162
Daddy's flying! Daddy's flying!

712
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,848
Well, well, well,
it appears we have a volunteer after all!

713
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,050
Enough fooling around, yes?
Open wide, Azrael.

714
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,004
Put him down, Gargafella!

715
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,890
Leave my son alone!

716
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,287
I'll teach you to mess with us Doyle ducks!

717
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,641
You again!

718
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,882
What are you doing? Put me down!

719
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,041
Come on, Blue.

720
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,601
Put me down! I could have taken him!
I had him!

721
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,802
I'm afraid that's all the show
we have time for.

722
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,490
Good bye.

723
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,927
Go on, get out, get out, get out.

724
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,202
Smurfette's hair. She's been here.

725
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,203
Look! I found something.

726
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,851
A portrait of perfection.

727
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,641
Imagine how good you'd look
if you were actually helping.

728
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,643
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

729
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,007
- Smurfette?
- Smurfette?

730
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,286
Hey, is that coffee?

731
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,482
Anyone else want a cup o' joe?

732
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,641
Hey, what's that?

733
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,569
It's a mirror, you barbarian.

734
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,444
Snap out of it, Vanity, and push!

735
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,165
Rage before beauty.

736
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,766
Whatever this is,
it's making my butt scrunch.

737
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,204
That's a little scary. I mean...

738
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,488
Gargamel!

739
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,729
Clumsy! Are you trying to get us smurfed?

740
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,201
It's some sort of magic window.

741
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,044
Maybe it'll show us where Smurfette is.

742
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,121
Naughties?

743
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,329
- Gargamel!
- Quickly, pick it up.

744
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,882
Quickly, to me, to me!

745
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,367
Smurfette? Hello?

746
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,483
Where did you go? Hello?

747
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,324
- Move, Smurfs.
- Here he comes. Hurry.

748
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,164
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Where are you? Are you here?

749
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,841
- Children? Smurfette?
- Back up, back up.

750
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,606
Close the door! Close the door!

751
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,245
Your papa is back.

752
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,206
Her papa?

753
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,931
If this is a joke,
I assure you I don't find it funny.

754
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,643
- Hello?
- Hold it!

755
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,561
- Are you down there, you little delinquents?
- Keep still.

756
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,642
They must have retreated back to the hotel.

757
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,044
Of course we're running out of time.

758
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,926
If that Patrick person is here,
then Papa cannot be far behind.

759
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,049
Quickly, to the hotel!
We must get to her before he does.

760
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,970
My face! My face!

761
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,407
- What?
- It's gorgeous.

762
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,970
We fell, and it wasn't even my fault!

763
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,164
Anyone? Anyone?

764
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,086
Oh, my Smurf.

765
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,962
I'm scrunching again.

766
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,361
Papa, what does this
have to do with Smurfette?

767
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,920
Everything, I'm afraid.

768
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,129
Why would he build such a hideous device?

769
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,766
Is that a giant Smurfalator?

770
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,683
To extract our essence.

771
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,563
What are all those containers for?

772
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,008
Ninety-nine bottles of Smurf on the wall.

773
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,924
So if Smurfette gives him the formula...

774
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,291
He can turn as many Naughties into Smurfs
as his greedy heart desires.

775
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,044
Guys?

776
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,561
Oh, dear.

777
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,410
Need a catch, please.

778
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,401
This place really needs to recycle.

779
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,962
Think, Smurfette, think. Oh, no!

780
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,247
- Where's Smurfette? Where's Smurfette?
- There she is!

781
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,641
She's fast! I love this game!

782
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,327
Wait! Let's let her run for a bit.
She's got nowhere to go.

783
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,448
- This is perfect for my plan!
- Yeah, yeah.

784
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,246
What are you so cross about? I'm the duck!

785
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,483
You always barge in and ruin everything!
You're like a walking disaster!

786
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,244
Hey, look me in the eyes and say that.

787
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,762
- I can't.
- That's right, because it's not true.

788
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,600
No, I can't because your eyes
are on the sides of your head!

789
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,364
All the better for me
to see your disrespect!

790
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,329
- What are you looking at?
- Hurry up.

791
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,329
It's global warming. Buy a Prius.

792
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,681
Okay. Did I lose them?

793
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,806
Good dog.

794
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,285
No, no... Sorry. Excuse me.

795
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,684
Okay, I got this.

796
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,682
Papa, where are you?

797
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,121
Why am I not surprised the way out of
Gargamel's lair is through a sewer?

798
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,804
- Master Winslow.
- Papa!

799
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,644
- Patrick, look.
- What happened?

800
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,963
Gargamel is hatching a
terrible, terrible plan.

801
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,605
What's with the duck?

802
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,848
That's Victor.
Gargamel turned him into a duck.

803
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,084
- Now Gargamel knows we're onto him.
- I was only trying to help!

804
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,163
Victor, you look fowl.

805
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,081
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

806
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,563
Focus, everyone.
We've got to find Smurfette quickly.

807
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,403
- There she is! Got her!
- Chase over?

808
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,726
Hey, Hackus. See that candy store?

809
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,081
- Candy? Candy!
- I've got an idea.

810
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,767
Go get yourself in trouble. Be naughty!
I'll take care of the rest.

811
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,844
I love to make trouble!
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

812
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,041
Hey, blondie. Where you going?

813
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,605
Leave me alone.

814
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,160
You mean like your so-called Papa has?

815
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,205
No, he hasn't!

816
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,164
He will come for me.

817
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,046
He won't, because he knows
you're where you really belong.

818
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,410
I didn't kidnap you, Smurfette.

819
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,644
I brought you home.

820
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,321
I'm gonna make big trouble.

821
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,448
Yummy candy!

822
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,607
Here comes trouble!

823
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,285
Hello!

824
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,520
Oh, my gosh!
He's gonna be killed! We have to help!

825
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,644
I thought you were supposed to be good.

826
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,171
But...

827
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,011
Help!

828
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,531
Oh, smurf.

829
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,090
Okay, come on!

830
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,483
Oh, no. I'm really in trouble now.

831
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,967
- Vexy!
- Oh, no! Hackus!

832
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,206
Help!

833
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,765
Help Hackus.

834
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,562
Smurfette, what are we gonna do?

835
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,082
Vexy, give me a lift! Come on, jump!

836
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,242
- Bull's-eye!
- Holy smurf!

837
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,523
- Good one, Smurfette!
- Blend that, candy man!

838
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,807
Come on, Hackus!

839
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,722
Vexy, let's go!

840
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,761
Hold on!

841
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,565
Look out!

842
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,649
Nice move, stealing a cart.

843
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,008
I didn't exactly steal it.

844
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,603
- Sorry!
- Well, it's not yours, is it?

845
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,966
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

846
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,122
See? You're just like us.

847
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,884
How am I going to get Smurfette
to give me that formula, Azrael?

848
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,122
This whole thing just makes me want to...

849
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,161
Cry? No. Flush her down the toilet bowl.

850
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,844
There must be something we can do.

851
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,641
I know you only have a tiny little
pea-sized brain in there, but think!

852
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,201
Is it her birthday? Really? Who cares?

853
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,287
A present? A cake?

854
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,407
Be nice to her?

855
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,322
Bribery and flattery
to soften her stony little heart, eh?

856
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,449
That's counterintuitive,
but that just might work.

857
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,208
I'm so glad I thought of this!

858
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,605
Let's see...

859
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,361
All right, all right.

860
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,085
What kind of gift should I get her?

861
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,322
- Kitty, kitty, kitty!
- Hey, fish breath!

862
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,568
Not now, Azrael, I'm trying to think of

863
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,928
a genuine and heartfelt gift
that I can deceive that Smurfette with!

864
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,365
I said not now!

865
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,047
Not now! Not now! Not now!
Not now! Not now! Not now!

866
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,850
You are walking home.

867
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,361
Cats.

868
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,521
Faster! Faster!

869
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,607
Excuse us! Sorry!

870
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,205
How are we gonna stop this thing?

871
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,688
I don't think that's gonna be a problem!

872
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,682
And she sticks the landing!

873
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,323
- Yummy pudding!
- Hackus, it's mud.

874
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,050
Yummy mud!

875
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,243
Take your best shot, cat!

876
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,047
Watch out!

877
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,441
Yes!

878
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,568
- Nice shot! Let's go!
- Nice shot! Let's go!

879
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,969
- Come on!
- Move it or lose it, Hackus!

880
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,249
Oh, no! Angry kitty! Angry kitty! Run!

881
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,569
Okay, ladies, act pregnant.

882
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,841
- This way, guys!
- Faster!

883
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,729
- It's time to get your wings!
- Faster!

884
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,086
Quick, get on the storks!

885
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,366
Let's go!

886
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,441
Wait, where's Hackus?

887
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,965
Fly. Big stork, fly!

888
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,841
Here comes kitty! Look out!

889
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,408
Come on, Hackus! Let's go!

890
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,211
Yeah!

891
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,047
Hey, look, it's a catfish!

892
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,282
Bye, kitty!

893
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,527
This is amazing!

894
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,163
Stork going backwards!
Stork going backwards!

895
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,930
This is so beautiful!

896
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,363
I'm falling! I'm falling!

897
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,048
Smurfette's my hero!

898
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,600
- How did it go?
- Couldn't have gone better.

899
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,291
Except that everything
was a complete smurftastrophe.

900
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,485
It's Smurfy's Law.

901
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,847
Well, I have some good news.

902
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,404
I borrowed a waiter's outfit for you, complete
with a security card for the elevator.

903
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,641
How did you manage that?

904
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,089
Let's just say that the Plaza Athénée
laundry room was paid a little visit

905
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,211
by international apparel
inspector Mademoiselle Doolittle.

906
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,169
I was like Meryl smurfin' Streep.

907
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,770
Good job, Grace!

908
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,360
Does everyone get a new outfit,
or just Patrick?

909
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,084
- Bloody window.
- What was that?

910
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,247
That's Victor.

911
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,722
They wouldn't let him through the lobby,
so he flew up.

912
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,809
No depth perception.

913
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,809
Grandpa Vicster is a duck!

914
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,321
Gargamel zapped him.

915
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,000
You can change him back, right?

916
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,522
No, but it's a transformation spell.

917
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,165
It'll wear off eventually.

918
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,561
Everybody relax. It's not a problem.

919
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,166
But if you see me lay an egg,
it's just between us.

920
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,849
You don't seem too upset about this.

921
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,207
It's not in a duck's nature to get upset.

922
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,886
We like to let things roll off our backs.

923
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,247
Seriously? You seriously just said that?

924
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,171
- I like that. That's very smurfy of you.
- Very smurfy.

925
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,571
Why, thank you. See?

926
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,762
The little Santa Claus
Smurf appreciates me.

927
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,731
Maybe someday, Patrick, you'll learn to
appreciate my smurf y qualities, too!

928
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,928
Okay. I've... There's... You know...

929
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,961
I'm not having this
conversation with a duck.

930
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,444
Now I'm catching a cold.

931
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,760
I wish I had a cold.

932
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,128
I've had Hefty's crystal
shoved down my throat,

933
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,044
got attacked as a corn dog,
fell down a sewer,

934
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,527
and if that wasn't smelly enough,

935
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,730
had to travel by armpit just to find
out we're all gonna be extinct!

936
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,411
- Holy smurf, I'm a downer.
- You most certainly are.

937
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,686
Grouchy, the only way we'll be extinct is if
Smurfette gives Gargamel the secret formula.

938
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,002
- But Smurfette would never tell.
- Of course not.

939
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,320
- Never.
- Absolutely not.

940
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,290
Smurfette could never be
tricked into being one of them.

941
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,526
Hey, Smurfette.

942
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,046
Did you do this
with your sisters back in Smurf Village?

943
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,642
Lots of flying, but I never had a sister.

944
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,404
Well, you do now.

945
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,086
- Want to race?
- You want to race me?

946
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,729
You're in trouble now!

947
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,602
- I'm gonna lose you, Smurfette.
- Not a chance.

948
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,169
Watch out!

949
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,844
Hold on tight, Hackus.

950
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,808
- Not that tight, Hackus.
- Sorry.

951
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,849
Stork fight!

952
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,205
Coming through!

953
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,764
This is insane!

954
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,442
Smurf, smurf, and away.

955
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,446
Hackus, king of world!

956
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,529
You're playing dirty now!

957
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,404
I'm just getting started.

958
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,005
GO, go:

959
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,088
I call that a Crepe Smurfette.

960
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,848
Snails to go?

961
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,008
- Batter up!
- Come on!

962
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,202
Hit me with your best shot.

963
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,841
Snailed her!

964
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,048
- You are naughty, Smurfette.
- Yeah.

965
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,642
Hey! I've seen that lady before.

966
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,370
She's beautiful.

967
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,489
They've got one of these everywhere.

968
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,571
I'm gonna strangle that duck.

969
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,688
Vic's like a black cloud
that follows me around.

970
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,161
Okay, look, I get it.

971
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,163
But you know what, he's here, isn't he?

972
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,560
He shows up.

973
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,529
Yeah, whether you want him to or not.

974
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,160
Okay, I always heard that
showing up was 90% of the job.

975
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,404
A lot of fathers don't even do that.

976
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,324
He's not my father.

977
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,403
Well, that's too bad.

978
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,847
'Cause that pretty much
leaves you without one.

979
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,844
- Patrick.
- All right, guys.

980
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,570
- Game on.
- Let's do this!

981
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,768
- I'm gonna stay with Blue.
- And Vic.

982
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,366
Okay, Smurfs, off to Gargamel's hotel.

983
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,965
Patrick,
there's actually something I'd like to...

984
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,161
No "actuallys."

985
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,441
You're staying here.

986
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,000
That's not what I was even going...

987
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,650
Victor, don't make me pluck you.

988
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,165
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

989
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,120
We're gonna get Smurfette this time,
100% guaranteed.

990
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,890
What did you just say, Grouchy?

991
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,041
You heard it. I'm tired of being Grouchy.
I am changing my tune to a happy one.

992
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,089
From now on, lam...

993
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,680
Ready? Positive Smurf.

994
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,922
I sprained my face.

995
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,487
You'll get used to it. Let's go, Smurfs.

996
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,803
- Come on. Come on.
- A paper bag. First-class.

997
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,769
- Hurry...
- Clumsy!

998
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,244
Good luck, Daddy!

999
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,210
Le chat VIP.

1000
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,851
Please, I will take you to your room.

1001
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,810
<i>- Front</i> desk.
<i>- Listen well, you slack-jawed knave.</i>

1002
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,001
Monsieur Gargamel.

1003
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,848
I want ale, curds and blistered meats
sent into my room in 10 minutes,

1004
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,242
or I will turn you into
a legless tree sloth.

1005
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,050
How was that, Smurfs?

1006
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,961
That's not funny, man.

1007
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,731
Duck, duck, duck.

1008
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,731
Goose!

1009
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,123
The security card for the elevator.
Patrick needs my help.

1010
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,527
When I show up with this, he'll see
this black cloud has got a silver...

1011
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,564
A silver lining!

1012
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,609
Oh, my...

1013
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,125
Master Winslow, please.

1014
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,801
- You can't get a reservation...
- Focus.

1015
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,490
That smells delish!

1016
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,685
Le bingo.

1017
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,570
Okay, guys, listen, when you get to
the room, if there's any problems...

1018
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,326
- Snot on a half shell. Delicacy.
- Sorry, Mr. Fish!

1019
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,491
You look fried.

1020
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,200
Like I said, if there are any problems...

1021
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,283
My friend,
there are no such thing as problems.

1022
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,010
Only smurfitunities.

1023
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,481
- You're freaking me out, Grouchy.
- Positive!

1024
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,210
Of...

1025
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,403
Okay, guys, we're in.

1026
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,482
Patrick Winslow-Doyle.

1027
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,121
Patrick.

1028
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,690
- What are you doing here?
- Saving your tail feather. Now come here.

1029
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,370
I've got something
you need for your mission.

1030
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,920
Hurry up. There's no time to argue.

1031
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,887
- What?
- It's the security card for the elevator.

1032
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,242
I have the security card.

1033
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,684
What is this? This is our room key.

1034
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,166
Well, now when you come back,
you'll be able to get in.

1035
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,566
- No problem.
- I can't...

1036
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,001
No, no, no, no, no.

1037
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,281
You're welcome.

1038
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,442
You can thank me later.

1039
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,045
How did you get out?

1040
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,440
Now, you just put me back down.

1041
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,760
Patrick, help!

1042
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,611
- We need you for our duck é I'orange.
- You want a piece of me?

1043
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,842
No, no, no, no! That's not what I meant.

1044
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,208
Yeah, it starts with the ducks,
and soon, no one's safe!

1045
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,682
- Unbelievable.
- Patrick!

1046
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,521
Master Winslow?

1047
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,443
- Patrick!
- Where'd he go?

1048
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,325
- He disappeared.
- Now we're on our own.

1049
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,811
- Well...
- Hide!

1050
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,171
Monsieur Gargamel.

1051
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,446
We're smurf ed. Plan B, anybody?

1052
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,682
I'm struggling to remain positive here.

1053
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,163
Monsieur Gargamel?

1054
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,121
Room service.

1055
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,410
Hello, kitty.

1056
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,081
Here is your room service.

1057
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,040
- What do we do?
- Smurf him with the element of surprise.

1058
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,650
Oh, Clumsy!

1059
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,760
- Oh, dear.
- Now what do we do?

1060
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,091
Just act scary.

1061
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,566
What?

1062
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,126
I'm a scary ghost!

1063
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,447
Nice.

1064
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,645
Why do so many bad things
happen to little blue people?

1065
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,643
Positive, positive.

1066
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,327
Window! Window! Window!

1067
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,044
Oh, no!

1068
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,211
Are you smurfing kidding me?
You nearly killed...

1069
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,287
I mean, look at this view.

1070
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:29,682
If it looks like a duck, quacks like a
duck, and smells like a corn dog...

1071
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,882
All right, which one of you is Vic?

1072
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,803
What, you don't recognise your own father?

1073
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,886
- Let's go.
- What about my brothers?

1074
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,803
We can't just leave them here to be eaten.

1075
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,240
You just met them.

1076
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,324
This is my flock.
I can't just leave them behind.

1077
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,201
Come on, if you're game, so am I.

1078
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,567
I am covered in filth.

1079
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,087
I look like something the cat dragged in!

1080
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,922
Come on, it's not that bad.

1081
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,288
Although, if I don't... The cat!

1082
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,683
- Not the face. Not the face!
- Close the lid!

1083
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,407
- That was awesome!
- Thank you!

1084
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,002
Hackus lives!

1085
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,366
Vexy, come and help me close the door.

1086
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,090
- Thank you, bird.
- Bye.

1087
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,929
That was crazy.

1088
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,924
Bye-bye, birds. I had fun.

1089
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,361
Yeah.

1090
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,562
- High fours!
- High fours!

1091
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,120
Hackus, Hackus, Hackus.

1092
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,362
It's so nice having another girl around.

1093
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,961
What are you doing?

1094
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,046
I’m just hugging you.

1095
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,927
Haven't you ever been hugged?

1096
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,130
Vexy...

1097
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,884
- Hackus hug. Hackus hug.
- Hackus.

1098
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,803
Hackus squeeze!

1099
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,245
Hackus.

1100
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,971
I'm positive we should
just leave him in here.

1101
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,087
Thanks.

1102
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,291
Hurry. They're probably doing something
mean and horrible to her right now.

1103
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,762
Yeah, Smurfette needs us.
She's probably scared and...

1104
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,362
- I love family!
- What...

1105
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,251
What is she doing?

1106
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,322
I think they're hugging.

1107
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,561
Papa?

1108
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,325
Hackus love to hug.

1109
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,811
Hackus.

1110
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,406
Smurfette, come on,
I got to show you something.

1111
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,161
Look at us. Come on, tell
me we're not family.

1112
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,961
Smurfette!

1113
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,166
Over here!

1114
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,321
Smurfette!

1115
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,449
I'm sorry Papa Smurf didn't come for you.

1116
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:41,003
But maybe your place is here with us.

1117
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,965
Yeah.

1118
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,606
Maybe it is.

1119
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,282
Why is she being nice to them?

1120
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,121
She's just identifying with her captors.
It's classic Smurf-holm syndrome.

1121
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,410
No, she thinks we don't care anymore,
and they do.

1122
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,811
She's confused.

1123
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,169
Clumsy, Grouchy, get up there,
and help me get this door open.

1124
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,321
- That's my daughter in there!
- Okay, Papa.

1125
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,563
- I'll get on top.
- Okay, Grouchy, you jump, I'll pull.

1126
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,086
- Come on, we can do this.
- Children.

1127
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,289
- Gargamel!
- Clumsy, don't let go...

1128
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,211
Daddy's home.

1129
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:18,281
And consistent with his kind nature,
he brought you a present.

1130
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,606
Grouchy, get down. He'll see you.

1131
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,967
- How are we gonna rescue her now?
- Quiet.

1132
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,766
I do believe
we got off on the wrong foot earlier.

1133
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,887
What's happening?

1134
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,726
Would you allow me to wish you
a very, very happy birthday?

1135
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,290
It seems like only yesterday

1136
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,604
you were just my little glob of clay
and other putrid ingredients.

1137
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,401
You remembered my birthday?

1138
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,926
Of course I did. We're family.

1139
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,491
- What?
- But we're her family.

1140
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,365
- Families don't forget things like that.
- Does she think we abandoned her?

1141
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,087
Speaking of which, your little blue
step-papa never did arrive, now did he?

1142
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,525
Step-papa?

1143
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,002
Why, I am truly sorry, my dear.
That must really sting.

1144
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,644
I remember when my father
threw me down the well for the first time.

1145
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:07,964
The disappointed look on his face
when I finally managed to claw my way out.

1146
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,165
Anyway, happy birthday, my dear.

1147
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,924
- Happy birthday, Smurfette!
- Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1148
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,486
- I want to open! Let me open!
- No, no, no.

1149
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,886
Ugly.

1150
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,522
"Bow. Kneel. Worship me."

1151
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,569
Yes, delightful rendition, really.

1152
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,921
Keep it up, no-neck,
I'll turn you into a cross-eyed newt.

1153
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,964
Yes, yes, my dear.

1154
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,565
Go ahead, take it.

1155
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,884
It's a tiny little magical wand
of your very own.

1156
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,884
Go ahead. It's your birthday present.

1157
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,885
No.

1158
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,530
Don't do it.

1159
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,608
Do you like it?

1160
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,288
Silly me. I've forgotten to turn it on.

1161
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,129
Here we are.

1162
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,048
Yes, there we go.

1163
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,770
Yes, go ahead, try it out. Don't be afraid.

1164
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,968
- A Dragon Wand.
- Oh, dear.

1165
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,090
After all, it is your birthright.

1166
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,403
How do you know I won't use it on you?

1167
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,606
Well...

1168
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,129
Because, Smurfette, I am your father.

1169
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,329
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1170
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,051
- She's gonna zap him.
- Get him, Smurfette.

1171
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,526
Smurfette...

1172
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,523
<i>Sing The La La Song.</i>

1173
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,801
Sing it!

1174
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,250
This is good, right, Papa?

1175
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,846
No! She's becoming one of them!

1176
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,611
I have always wanted to do this!

1177
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,365
We're losing her.

1178
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,848
- Yes! Good one, Smurfette.
- Your first cat zap.

1179
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,526
Look at you. Look at you.

1180
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:14,330
You truly are daddy's little girl.

1181
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,768
- Smurfette!
- No, Papa! Grouchy, grab him!

1182
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,570
- No, Papa, he's gonna see you!
- Get him down!

1183
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,680
- Clumsy, help, help me get him down!
- Papa, no!

1184
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,684
Yeah!

1185
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,687
No!

1186
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,771
Take to the skies, lads.
Free at last! Free at last!

1187
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,366
- What are you, Martin Luther Wing?
- That's it.

1188
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:45,048
Joke it up, funny boy, but I am proud
as a peacock to be a freedom flighter.

1189
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,727
Oh, no.

1190
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,689
What the... is that?

1191
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,846
Hang on, Smurfs! Victor's on the way!

1192
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,889
Pop your smurf-chutes.

1193
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,240
The flying V!

1194
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,283
Gotcha.

1195
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,286
Okay, don't panic.

1196
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,362
That is a lot of white meat.

1197
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,571
Now panic!

1198
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,405
Me no likey!

1199
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,287
That was brilliant.

1200
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,883
- He's naked, right?
- Everyone okay?

1201
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,084
Help me, somebody.
Somebody please, let me out!

1202
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,601
I have seen unspeakable things down there.

1203
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,680
I have been scarred for life.

1204
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,049
Where's Smurfette?

1205
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,042
- She's...
- Where's Smurfette?

1206
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,765
We were too late.

1207
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,081
Nice going.

1208
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,804
Have fun, children.
Just remember, be kind to each other.

1209
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,087
Will you get away from me,
you bumbling moron?

1210
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,844
- Where are they?
- What?

1211
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,764
Smurfs were here? In this room?
Why didn't you say so?

1212
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,524
Right now!

1213
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,641
She must not learn of this.

1214
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,921
We must spirit her away from here
and get that formula now.

1215
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,449
Smurfette, my dear,
are you ready to go celebrate?

1216
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,204
- Yeah!
- Come on, come on. This'll be fun.

1217
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,446
We were this close to
getting Smurfette back.

1218
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,521
I know.

1219
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,410
He distracted me
at the worst possible moment, Grace.

1220
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,289
I would have been in the elevator
if it wasn't for him.

1221
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,125
Okay, okay, use your indoor voice,
and please, Patrick, just breathe.

1222
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,890
I want him gone.

1223
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,770
- He's your dad.
- No, that's one thing he is not.

1224
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,127
He's right, Grace. I'm not his father.

1225
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,687
His real father left and
started a new family.

1226
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,404
He's been chewed up about it ever since.

1227
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,163
- Excuse me?
- As well you might.

1228
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,842
But I can't take the brunt of it anymore.

1229
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,567
Hey, I never asked
for you to come barging into my life, okay?

1230
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,566
I didn't ask you to
marry my mother or take away Zeus.

1231
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,087
Zeus? The pigeon?

1232
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,290
The parrot.

1233
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,930
My parrot.

1234
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,129
Taken away because you were allergic.

1235
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,169
I was not allergic to that bird, Patrick.

1236
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,486
Yes, you were.

1237
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,527
No, I wasn't.

1238
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,647
You were.

1239
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,685
What?

1240
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,043
It got so bad, every day,
you were wheezing, coughing.

1241
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,607
Your mother and I both knew
that it would break your heart

1242
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,206
to think the bird
had to go away because of you.

1243
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,761
You already blamed yourself for your dad.

1244
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,080
So I took the heat.

1245
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,521
That's a lie. What are you...
I'm not allergic to birds.

1246
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,924
Okay, tell you what.

1247
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,521
Sniff my feathers.

1248
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,247
- I'm not going to...
- Come on, sniff them.

1249
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,041
Truth itches, doesn't it?

1250
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,002
Listen to me, Patrick.

1251
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,367
I loved your mother with all my heart.

1252
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,842
I took care of Jeannette,
and I made her happy.

1253
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,811
I also chose to love you as my own.

1254
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,370
Now, I didn't have to do that.

1255
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,765
But you were this little kid, no father, no
hope in his eyes, a big hole in his heart,

1256
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,410
so I gave you everything I could.

1257
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,923
But I'm done, you know?

1258
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,526
You don't want it, that's fine.

1259
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,002
My last word of advice to you is this...

1260
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,206
Will you grow up?

1261
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,730
Stop blaming everyone else for your pain.

1262
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,041
And whatever you do,

1263
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:29,684
don't teach that beautiful son of yours that
love is conditional, because it is not.

1264
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,403
Good bye, Grace.

1265
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,089
Bye-bye, Blue.

1266
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,368
G rand pa Vicster.

1267
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,161
Bye.

1268
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,564
Goodbye, Patrick Winslow.

1269
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,446
Look at that big wheel.

1270
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,330
Come. Come along, my dear.

1271
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,729
So this is why they call
it the City of Light.

1272
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,404
There's a lot of people.

1273
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,569
Yes, well...

1274
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,883
I prefer to call them "worshippers."

1275
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,405
"Worshippers."

1276
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,969
Alakakneel!

1277
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,130
Bow. Kneel.

1278
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,445
Hackus.

1279
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,568
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

1280
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,964
Don't worry. Everyone likes it.
He's a celebrity. Come on.

1281
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,326
Okay.

1282
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,768
Yes, hello. It's me.

1283
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,451
- These are my children.
- Hi.

1284
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,124
- Who's that?
- That's my brother.

1285
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,281
Hi. I'm Hackus.

1286
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,962
Look at that. It's a magical creature.

1287
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,810
Hi.

1288
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,211
It's my birthday.

1289
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,847
Thank you.

1290
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,127
- I have a FASTPASS.
- Yeah, FASTPASS.

1291
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,650
Monsieur Gargamel!

1292
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,521
Thank you for keeping our seats warm.
Goodbye.

1293
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,687
Bye-bye!

1294
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,849
Come along, children. Right this way.

1295
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,004
Monsieur Gargamel! Monsieur Gargamel!

1296
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,931
Let's go!

1297
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,286
- Father.
- Not now.

1298
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,771
It's feeding time soon.

1299
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,763
- Not now!
- But“.

1300
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,046
Here we are.

1301
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,761
- Our fun is just beginning, eh?
- Yeah.

1302
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,166
Alakazelevate!

1303
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,611
But isn't this lovely, my dear?

1304
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,849
And just think,

1305
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,289
with your secret formula
and my incredible magic,

1306
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,410
there's absolutely nothing
that we cannot do.

1307
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,324
Yeah.

1308
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,529
Think of all the fun we
could have, Smurfette.

1309
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,285
Okay.

1310
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:12,807
Then why are we going so slow?

1311
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,841
- Look out!
- Yeah!

1312
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,524
Isn't this fun?

1313
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,170
Decidedly not!

1314
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,281
Best ride ever! Smurfette's fun, huh?

1315
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,490
Incoming!

1316
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,291
Look out! Coming through!

1317
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,771
Sorry!

1318
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,130
I must have failed her.

1319
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,809
Sorry. I was looking for a place to think.

1320
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,566
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

1321
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,325
I was doing a little thinking myself.

1322
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,964
Master Winslow, it's hard for me,

1323
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,442
but, well, can I ask you some advice?

1324
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,483
I mean, papa to Papa-

1325
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,324
It's about Smurfette.

1326
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,844
I don't know what to do.

1327
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,128
I turned her blue.

1328
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,010
I taught her love and kindness.

1329
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,010
But the truth is, Gargamel made her.

1330
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,130
She's only a Smurf
as long as she chooses to be.

1331
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,561
But what if she doesn't?

1332
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,447
What if she chooses him?

1333
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,682
We could lose her.

1334
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,683
We may have already.

1335
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,329
I haven't done enough.

1336
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,765
Are you kidding?

1337
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,327
Gargamel just made her, but you,

1338
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,811
you made her what she is.

1339
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,770
You stepped in and loved her
as your very own.

1340
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,042
No one asked you to, you just did.

1341
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,647
Because you knew she needed that.

1342
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,848
And that's a...

1343
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,921
That's a pretty special kind of love.

1344
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,722
She's way too smart not to see that.

1345
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,970
You're right.

1346
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,725
We didn't believe in her
because she changed.

1347
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,201
She changed because we believed in her.

1348
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,650
Thank you, Master Winslow.

1349
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,088
That was exactly what I needed to hear.

1350
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,410
Me, too.

1351
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,290
Just a few more bubbles.

1352
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,925
How's that?

1353
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,243
Sweet Smurf in Heaven,
what have you eaten?

1354
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,762
It's okay.
Every time a Smurf toots, someone smiles.

1355
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,011
- Let's go, Smurfs.
- Where?

1356
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,286
We're getting Smurfette.

1357
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,204
But you saw her, Papa.

1358
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,205
She's one of them now.

1359
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,009
- A horse whisperer?
- No!

1360
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,088
- A French Socialist?
- No!

1361
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,286
A Flying Wallenda!

1362
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,169
No, she's with Gargamel. Keep up.

1363
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,044
I don't care what we saw.

1364
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,441
You never give up on family.

1365
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,443
Yeah, Papa's right.

1366
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,841
Who are you,
and what have you done with Grouchy?

1367
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,048
Hey, I'm Positive, remember?

1368
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,171
All right, Smurfs. Let's get smurfing.

1369
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,282
Master Winslow, you coming with us?

1370
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,965
Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1371
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,486
You tell me.

1372
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,046
Grouchy.

1373
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,051
- Put it away.
- Anybody else?

1374
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,762
Okay, then. Out of the tub with you.

1375
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,921
- We've got work to do.
- Hey.

1376
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,128
Let's smurf this mushroom stand.
Let's roll.

1377
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,402
Yeah, guys, let's do this.

1378
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,441
Victor? Hey.

1379
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,043
Okay, Master Winslow, we'll split up here.

1380
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,322
All right. I'll find the
electrical room and cut the power.

1381
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,521
And we'll find Smurfette.

1382
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,682
And we'll all look fabulous doing it.

1383
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,366
Oh, come on.

1384
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,408
Team building. Hello!

1385
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,040
All right, see you inside. Good luck.

1386
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,043
- Come on, guys.
- Into the belly of the beast.

1387
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,647
Why are we coming down here, Father?

1388
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,731
Well, we are celebrating
your long-lost sister's birthday.

1389
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,801
Really?

1390
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,281
Can't very well end the festivities without

1391
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,206
a cake.

1392
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,722
I made you your favourite, my dear.
Blue velvet.

1393
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,526
Cake.

1394
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,649
Go ahead. Go ahead. Make a wish, my dear.

1395
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:41,282
Anything your tiny little heart
can dream of, and it is yours.

1396
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,090
Anything?

1397
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,446
But of course.

1398
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,890
Yes, well, within reason.

1399
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,244
I'm afraid we're on a bit
of an essence budget around here lately.

1400
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,767
That's why we need the formula, you see.

1401
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,244
There she is.

1402
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,289
Is that a birthday cake?

1403
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,249
We had a birthday cake for her, too.

1404
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,841
She just never saw it.

1405
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,890
They look like a happy family.

1406
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,327
She's not going to give him the formula,
is she, Papa?

1407
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,961
If she does,
it would mean the end of all Smurf kind.

1408
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,682
Wait. Even the handsome ones?

1409
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,768
- Yeah.
- Vanity, you come with me.

1410
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,127
Clumsy and Grouchy,
go meet Master Winslow.

1411
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,209
Victor, what are you doing here?

1412
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,406
Grace called me.

1413
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,648
She said you might need a hand.

1414
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,329
No, no. Victor, wait.

1415
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,922
As usual, Grace is right.

1416
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,927
I could use some help.

1417
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,683
Well, for starters,
you might try lifting the sewer cover.

1418
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,680
Unless you're planning
on fixing the phone lines?

1419
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,968
Smurfette, the formula?

1420
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,923
Take all the time you need, my dear.

1421
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,724
As long as it's very, very soon.

1422
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,730
Then we can all be blue. Together.

1423
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,123
Hackus blue. Hackus blue.

1424
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,244
You see? They want to be blue,

1425
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,483
just like their big sister.

1426
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,685
Then we could be a real family.

1427
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,003
This is something.

1428
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:35,404
A sacred gift entrusted to me.

1429
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,850
I'm sorry.

1430
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,724
I just, I...

1431
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,526
I can't.

1432
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,966
What do you mean, you can't?

1433
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,371
I've given you everything.

1434
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,570
Kindness, presents,

1435
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,803
a cake with no poison. It's been horrible!

1436
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,565
Now, I have had just about enough of this,
young lady.

1437
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,450
You are going to give me
what I want right now!

1438
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,885
- The formula!
- No!

1439
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,961
Yes!

1440
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,371
- Father?
- What, what, what?

1441
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,331
Hackus dizzy.

1442
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,010
What's happening to them?

1443
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,446
So dizzy.

1444
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,967
Don't tell me you actually care
for these pathetic creatures.

1445
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,326
How sad for you.

1446
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,250
And how absolutely perfect for me.

1447
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,960
It looks like the power lines run this way.

1448
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,809
Let's go! Let's go!
We got to get her out of there!

1449
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,370
All right, let's do this!

1450
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,648
This way, Vanity. Through this pipe.

1451
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,008
We have to save her!
This could be my moment!

1452
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,851
I'm so sorry, my dear. I thought you knew.

1453
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,242
Without essence, they cannot live.

1454
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,811
- Father.
- No.

1455
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,121
Please.

1456
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,850
No. Vexy.

1457
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,522
So dizzy.

1458
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,321
- Hackus.
- Smurfette.

1459
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,922
Give them what you have!
Take some from me.

1460
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,041
Take some!

1461
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,161
Please!

1462
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,766
What's the point?
You won't give me the formula,

1463
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,686
so, well, I might as well just let them go.

1464
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,161
Vexy.

1465
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:18,291
You mean you'd let them die?

1466
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,289
I can always make others.

1467
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,200
Besides, I am not the one letting them die.

1468
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,726
You are.

1469
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,088
Okay. Okay.

1470
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,364
I'll give it to you. Just feed them.

1471
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,489
The formula first.

1472
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,286
Feed them. Feed them!

1473
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,925
Quickly. We have to get in there.

1474
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,128
- Dead end!
- It's locked!

1475
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,162
The formu-la-la-la-la-la-la.

1476
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,165
One hopeful thought.

1477
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,442
A dab of royal jelly.

1478
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,171
Mimosa pollen.

1479
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,287
Smurfette.

1480
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,601
- Smurfette!
- Yes, good girl.

1481
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,763
I can hear them, but I can't see them.

1482
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,968
Wait! I know.

1483
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,087
Papa, look.

1484
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,730
- And a drop of mink oil.
- I knew it.

1485
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,087
Is she giving him the formula?

1486
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,571
- Oh, no.
- Smurfette.

1487
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,687
Help me get this open.

1488
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,811
And you must say one loving truth.

1489
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,169
- Of course.
- There.

1490
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,442
That's the formula Papa used.

1491
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,170
Now, feed them! Please!

1492
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,720
First, we'll see if this works, huh?

1493
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,566
Hurry!

1494
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,767
- Come on.
- Here we are.

1495
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,205
Let's go! Let's go!

1496
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,490
Pull, Patrick. Put your back into it.

1497
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,166
- Come on!
- Hey, there's an opening down here.

1498
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,931
- Come on, Positive.
- Yeah, let's shut 'em down.

1499
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,607
One loving truth.

1500
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,364
I hope this works.

1501
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:30,526
Hackus.

1502
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,767
- Smurfette. Thank you.
- Vexy!

1503
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,083
Oh, my Smurf, it worked.

1504
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,605
- Hackus!
- Hackus blue!

1505
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,603
Hackus.

1506
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,449
Hackus is blue!

1507
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,006
We're blue! We're Smurfs!

1508
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,361
It worked. All the world is mine!

1509
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,445
- I can make my own Smurfs!
- No!

1510
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,605
We've been betrayed.

1511
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,327
Finally, finally.

1512
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,289
You're a real boy.

1513
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,441
I'm blue.

1514
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,443
Now into the machine with all of you.

1515
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,687
Father, no.

1516
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,611
- No cage for Hackus. No cage for Hackus.
- All right, all right.

1517
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,129
- In you go.
- No cage for Hackus!

1518
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,282
- Everybody gets their own room.
- Please!

1519
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:18,769
- I failed her, Vanity.
- Papa, wait.

1520
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,329
I think I can reach that pin.

1521
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,925
Good idea, Vanity.

1522
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,411
Come on, come on.

1523
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,691
Father, please.

1524
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,250
Now, don't go anywhere.

1525
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,809
You face leaking.

1526
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,322
Hackus leaking.

1527
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,251
Hackus leaking.

1528
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:46,121
You sacrificed everything just to save us.

1529
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,170
I had to.

1530
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,926
I care about you.

1531
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,525
We're family.

1532
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,927
No like leaking.

1533
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,764
Hackus like blue.

1534
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,082
What a sickening scene.

1535
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,845
I'd be completely nauseated if this weren't

1536
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,930
the happiest moment of my life!

1537
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,120
- Try the lever, the big one.
- Get on my shoulders.

1538
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,845
Hurry, lads.

1539
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,967
Which way do I go?

1540
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,963
Try negative. That might shut it off.

1541
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,884
Negative? Nah. I'm all about positive.

1542
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,247
There.

1543
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:25,291
One small step for a wizard,

1544
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,364
one giant leap for... What?

1545
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,681
Positive!

1546
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,328
Too much smurf berry cobbler.

1547
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,601
Grouchy!

1548
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,804
Yes, I said you could press the button,
didn't I?

1549
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,129
Grouchy!

1550
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,362
I lied. One giant leap for me!

1551
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,770
Just got fried.

1552
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,207
Hard to put a positive spin on that.

1553
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,561
Son of a Smurf!

1554
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,721
Hurry, Vanity.

1555
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,088
Narcissism is about to save the day.

1556
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,686
- Got it!
- Smurftastic work.

1557
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,040
- I knew it.
- Now go.

1558
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,565
- What?
- Go!

1559
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,960
Come, Azrael!

1560
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:14,329
Apparently, we must harness
the power of the skies one final time.

1561
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,845
<i>Why does this have</i> to <i>be so Les Misérables?</i>

1562
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,446
- Let's go.
- Look at me, all rough-and-tumble.

1563
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,488
I'm like Commando Smurf.

1564
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,800
Hooah!

1565
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,366
You are right.
Commandos are quiet and stealthy.

1566
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,965
Hooah!

1567
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,530
- There she is!
- Smurfette.

1568
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,840
Santa!

1569
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,329
Papa? You... You came for me.

1570
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,723
Well, of course we came for you.
You're my daughter.

1571
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,609
Was there ever a question?

1572
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,404
- No, it's locked.
- Go on through.

1573
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,681
- We'll find another way.
- Okay.

1574
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,240
We'll see you in there, Master Winslow.
Hurry!

1575
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,926
Here.

1576
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,891
Hold this!

1577
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,886
Papa.

1578
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,122
Oh, my dear.

1579
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,486
Papa, I gave Gargamel the formula.

1580
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,250
But she saved our lives.

1581
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,846
Hackus live! Hackus live!

1582
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,810
Papa, I let you down.

1583
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,086
I betrayed the Smurfs.

1584
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,650
I'm so sorry.

1585
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,721
Smurfette, life is the most precious thing
to protect.

1586
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,928
I'm very proud of you.

1587
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,968
You... You are?

1588
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:41,050
Seriously? No spanking?
No smack to the knuckles?

1589
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,168
You forgive her, just like that?

1590
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,768
Of course.
We rise to the amount of love we're shown,

1591
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,128
and we sink only when that love stops.

1592
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,886
Hackus leaking again. Leaking again!

1593
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,691
Hey, you found Smurfette!

1594
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,566
Hello.

1595
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,647
Hi.

1596
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,840
Oh, no, we don't have much time.

1597
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,248
Let's just get the formula back
and get out of here. Hooah!

1598
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,930
Wait! What about them?

1599
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,088
What about them? They kidnapped you.

1600
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,446
Yeah, they're Gargamel's.

1601
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,082
So was I, but Papa never gave up on me.

1602
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,527
So I'm not about to give up on them.

1603
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,481
And you thought you weren't a real Smurf.

1604
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,370
- Get them out, quickly.
- Right, Papa.

1605
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,044
Free Hackus!

1606
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,646
And then there were seven, eh?

1607
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,171
Hello, kitty.

1608
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,886
Welcome to the party, Papa!

1609
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,846
Look at all this essence.

1610
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,649
I love your work. Really, all of you.

1611
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,564
In particular, your Blue Period.

1612
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,084
My whole body is scrunching!

1613
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,487
That's enough, Gargamel.

1614
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,005
You have enough.

1615
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,847
Yes, yes, but you see, Papa,
I want more than enough!

1616
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,087
After all, I have to be able to power this!

1617
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,163
I call her La Wanda.

1618
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,564
You get it? Because it's a wand.

1619
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,449
So I called it La... It's very funny.

1620
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,366
If you weren't in excruciating pain,
you'd be laughing hysterically, believe me.

1621
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,486
Whatever will I do with all of this power?

1622
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,601
That's right.

1623
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:34,048
I'm going to rule the entire world!

1624
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,611
No.

1625
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,526
And, Papa,

1626
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,490
I want you to know
that as my first official act,

1627
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:47,330
I'm going to create a portal all the way from
Smurf Village right here to my Smurfalator,

1628
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:51,769
so you get to be
with all of your little smurf y friends.

1629
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,364
Forever!

1630
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,606
I don't think so, Gargamel.

1631
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,841
Hit it again.

1632
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,121
- Give it to me.
- Hurry.

1633
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,243
Hurry, he's going for his wand.

1634
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,930
- Just break it already!
- I'm too beautiful to die!

1635
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,844
For the love of Smurf, use the pointy end!

1636
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,127
Don't just stand there yelling at me!
Attack!

1637
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,367
Yes!

1638
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,086
Oh, no.

1639
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,326
Alaka...

1640
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,804
Hackus real boy.

1641
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,362
Thrown to the curb again.

1642
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,209
Careful, Clumsy!

1643
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,009
- Every time!
- Sorry.

1644
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,207
Really?

1645
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,486
High fours!

1646
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,526
Is everyone all right?

1647
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,768
All smurf y and accounted for.

1648
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,122
- Patrick!
- Daddy!

1649
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,770
- Hey.
- Hey, Grace!

1650
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,251
Hey-

1651
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,481
We did it!

1652
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,130
Grace!

1653
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,281
Smurfette.

1654
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,566
I've missed you.

1655
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,084
I was so worried about you.

1656
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,323
Grace, this is Vexy, my other sister.

1657
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,801
Well, I guess that makes
you my sister, too.

1658
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,085
Are you okay?

1659
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,881
Is this what happy feels like?

1660
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,001
Hello, pretty lady! I'm pretty, too!

1661
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,651
And this is Hackus, my brother.

1662
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:14,767
Hackus!

1663
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,769
Hackus, this is Grace and Patrick.

1664
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,481
- Hello!
- And... Your baby?

1665
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,926
This is Blue.

1666
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,010
You did good, Grace.

1667
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,889
He's blue-tiful.

1668
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,010
Who this? Who this?

1669
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,570
That's Victor.

1670
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:29,801
He's...

1671
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,921
He's my dad.

1672
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,760
And Blue's pretty fantastic grandpa.

1673
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,284
Daddy and Vicster!

1674
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,521
Okay. I got it.

1675
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,400
I'm really proud of you, Patrick Winslow.

1676
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,721
Hyphen-Doyle.

1677
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,891
Hyphen-Smurf.

1678
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,160
Yeah, guys! Smurf pound.

1679
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,766
- Vanity?
- Great job! Great job!

1680
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,600
- Positive?
- Hey, get that thing out of here!

1681
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,926
I'm not pounding anything!

1682
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,362
I'm Grouchy,
and I got a lot of pent-up anger to vent!

1683
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,609
Wow, that feels good.

1684
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,886
I'm back!

1685
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,964
And so am I!

1686
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,561
Perfect.

1687
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,364
I think most of you know La Wanda...

1688
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,762
- Unfortunately.
- ...which is a hilarious play on words.

1689
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:22,606
- Smurfette.
- Say hello to my enormous friend!

1690
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,281
I don't think so, Gargamel!

1691
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,846
Yeah!

1692
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,646
Wanda! No, La Wanda, no!

1693
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,530
Where is the "off" button on this thing?

1694
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,841
No, no, no, no.

1695
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,726
No...

1696
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,168
No, La Wanda! No means no!

1697
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,520
This is really, really gonna hurt.

1698
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,811
- Bravo, Smurfette! Bravo!
- Good job, Smurfette!

1699
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,325
That was amazing!

1700
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,243
Well, that takes care of Gargamel.

1701
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,165
Let's go home, everybody!

1702
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:31,366
- Yeah!
- Home!

1703
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,011
We still have one small problem.

1704
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,844
I've only got five crystals.

1705
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,561
Well, I say no Smurf left behind.

1706
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,721
<i>Wow, Smuriette.</i>

1707
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,246
You are pretty good with that wand.

1708
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,684
It's kind of in my blood.

1709
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,762
Which used to concern me.

1710
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,761
But as someone wonderful once told me,

1711
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,161
it doesn't matter where you came from.

1712
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,080
What matters is who you choose to be.

1713
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,202
That's my girl.

1714
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,442
And you're our papa.

1715
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,523
Thanks for giving us a new home.

1716
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,967
And a new family.

1717
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,565
You're a good Smurf, Papa.

1718
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,961
You'll be a good one, too.

1719
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,611
I'm gonna miss you, Smurfs.

1720
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,320
Maybe you can name a corn dog after them.

1721
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,006
Now you're talking. We could use blue corn.

1722
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,690
Smurf dogs, yum!

1723
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,441
Yes!

1724
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,885
Well, safe travels, guys.

1725
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,362
And smurf back soon.

1726
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,522
Thank you once again, Master Winslow.

1727
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,726
Miss Doolittle.

1728
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,200
Little Blue.

1729
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,971
Papa Vicster.

1730
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,443
- Goodbye, Winslow family.
- Goodbye, Papa.

1731
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,204
- Bye-bye!
- Toodles!

1732
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,090
- Well, let's go, Smurfs.
- Bye-bye, Winslows.

1733
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,687
I can't wait to see the rest of my family.

1734
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,642
Bye, Smurfs!

1735
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,970
- Hey, personal space.
- Sorry.

1736
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,411
Papa, you got Smurfette!

1737
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,040
Welcome home, Smurfette!

1738
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,680
- Well, looky here!
- Yeah, we're back!

1739
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,603
- Hi, guys!
- This is good.

1740
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,842
And some new Smurfs for our family.

1741
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,888
Everyone, this is Vexy.

1742
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,725
- Great goobaloo!
- She's a sassy lassie.

1743
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:21,847
Hi.

1744
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,604
- Hi...
- Hi, I'm Greedy.

1745
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,763
Hi, I'm Greedy. You want
to share a cupcake?

1746
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,610
- Crikey!
- What the hey?

1747
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,886
I nearly smurfed myself.

1748
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,361
Hackus.

1749
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,522
Hackus, these are your new brothers.

1750
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,690
I have new brothers!

1751
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,565
Squeeze!

1752
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:41,971
Hold on a minute.

1753
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,280
Technically speaking,

1754
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,125
according to section six of the
Smurf Code of Genealogical Legitimacy...

1755
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,770
Hey. Just give him a punt.

1756
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,729
- This creature cannot...
- Hackus punt!

1757
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,924
- Yeah!
- That kid's got style.

1758
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,047
He's one of us.

1759
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,046
And so, after waiting patiently
to be relevant again,

1760
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,409
our heroic Narrator
steps back into his leading role

1761
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,284
to point out that when last we met,

1762
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,409
the entire village was busying itself
with preparations for...

1763
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,323
Hey, what's with all the decorations?

1764
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,847
Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1765
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,924
Do you mind? I'm trying to bookend this.

1766
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,162
- And so...
- Yo, let's kick it.

1767
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:22,848
As the music unceremoniously
drowns out the narration...

1768
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,964
This is for my new family.

1769
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,647
Yeah!

1770
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,682
Hey, Hackus, I got you a present.

1771
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,125
Yummy!

1772
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,090
Yeah!

1773
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,406
Hooah!

1774
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,165
Have a nice trip!

1775
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,849
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Stop, stop!

1776
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,410
Help me, Wanda! Help, help me, Wanda!

1777
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,891
And where do you think you're going?
You are coming with me!

1778
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:23,209
How dare you call me that?
I have bungled nothing!

1779
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,728
Well, Paris is over, my friend.

1780
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,326
We're back here in the Dark Ages.
I suggest you get used to it.

1781
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:34,370
You want room service?
Why don't you yell out the window?

1782
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:40,444
Don't you show your claws to me unless you
are prepared to use them, Mr. Pussy Foot!

1783
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:43,888
Pussy foot! Pussy foot! Pussy foot!

1784
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,367
Stop it! Not the face! Not the face!

1784
01:44:47,305 --> 01:45:47,377
