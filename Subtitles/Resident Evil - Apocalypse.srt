<i>My name is Alice</i>

3
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,551
<i>I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation...</i>

4
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:54,972
<i>...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.</i>

5
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,474
<i>I was head of security...</i>

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,270
<i>...at a secret high-tech facility
called The Hive...</i>

7
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:05,691
<i>...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...</i>

8
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>viral weaponry</i>

9
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,195
<i>But there was an incident.</i>

10
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,157
<i>The virus escaped
and everybody died.</i>

11
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,160
<i>Trouble was. ..</i>

12
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,454
<i>...They didn't stay dead.</i>

13
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,916
<i>The T-virus reanimated their bodies.</i>

14
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>But I survived.
Myself and one other...</i>

15
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,341
<i>...an environmentalist named Matt.</i>

16
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:34,178
<i>When we emerged, we were
seized by Umbrella scientists.</i>

17
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,721
<i>Matt and I were separated.</i>

18
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,516
<i>He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.</i>

19
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:39,934
<i>Matt!</i>

20
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,523
<i>Take her to the
Raccoon City facility...</i>

21
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>...and assemble the team.</i>

22
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,193
<i>We're reopening The Hive.</i>

23
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,779
<i>I want to know
what went on down there.</i>

24
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,698
<i>We thought we'd
survived the horror.</i>

25
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,830
But we were wrong.

26
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,843
<i>You're watching Raccoon 7.
Now the weather, with Terri Morales.</i>

27
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,388
It's 6:10 in the a.m. and already
the temperature has reached...

28
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:21,058
...a massive 92 degrees as this
unprecedented heat wave continues.

29
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:25,855
<i>Clear skies in Raccoon City and a
light breeze coming in from the west</i>

30
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:31,318
<i>And as a special bonus just for you,
we have a pollen count of 0.7.</i>

31
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,654
That's a record low
for this time of year.

32
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,657
Good news for all you hay fever
and asthma sufferers.

33
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,661
<i>All in all, it looks like it's gonna be
another beautiful day.</i>

34
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,538
<i>Stay with us. After the break...</i>

35
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,666
<i>...we're gonna look at your favorite
holiday hot spots.</i>

36
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,112
Advance team, proceed.

37
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,916
Sir.

38
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,630
Holy shit.

39
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,174
Excuse us, ma'am.
There's been an incident.

40
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,947
Excuse us, sir.
There's been an incident.

41
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,116
How bad is it?

42
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,785
- You must come with us.
- I must get my daughter.

43
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,079
- It's taken care of.
- What are you doing?

44
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,707
You don't understand.
She's left for school.

45
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,044
<i>This is U-Gamma 7,
evacuation complete...</i>

46
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,422
<i>...but we just lost contact
with Gamma 12.</i>

47
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,249
<i>Unit 12 calling for immediate backup
at city hall.</i>

48
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,795
<i>Still no explanation for this wave
of unexplained killings...</i>

49
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,214
<i>...that is sweeping across the city.</i>

50
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,887
<i>A deadly crime spree with no end.</i>

51
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,597
<i>Backup, we need backup now!</i>

52
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,892
<i>Just like Valentine told us...</i>

53
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,729
<i>Off-duty law enforcement personnel,
report for duty immediately.</i>

54
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,614
Give us a hand over here,
this guy's insane!

55
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,583
- It's Valentine.
- Hold your fire.

56
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,335
- Valentine!
- They're infected.

57
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,838
Somebody get this ugly bitch
off of me!

58
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,298
I told you. Shoot for the head.

59
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,676
Please, somebody get her.

60
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,638
No! Don't shoot! Don't--

61
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,016
I'm leaving town.
I suggest you do the same.

62
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,685
<i>Everyone's leaving the city.</i>

63
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,438
<i>We've received reports
of Umbrella Corporation...</i>

64
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,023
<i>...dispatching armed guards
and troop carriers.</i>

65
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,618
<i>Move in an orderly fashion
to security checkpoints.</i>

66
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,123
The city is completely contained.
Troops have sealed all exits.

67
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,959
The only way out is this bridge.

68
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,128
<i>All citizens must pass through
medical scanning.</i>

69
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,131
Sir! You better take a look at this.

70
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,718
<i>Family members must pass through
security checkpoints together.</i>

71
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:18,308
<i>Please proceed in an orderly fashion.
Do not run.</i>

72
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,481
- He's clean. Let him pass
- Next!

73
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,984
No pushing, please. Keep in line.

74
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,612
Can we get some
reinforcements down here?

75
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,115
<i>Chopper Delta, new orders</i>

76
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,325
<i>Proceed directly to
Ravens Gate Bridge.</i>

77
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,160
<i>Reinforcements urgently needed.</i>

78
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,413
<i>Copy that, base. On our way.</i>

79
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,314
Get it.

80
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,899
No! Get off!

81
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,820
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!

82
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,674
No! Get back!

83
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,553
Civilian in trouble. Three o'clock.
Go down.

84
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,305
I can't. We have our orders.

85
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,724
No! Get back! No!

86
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,060
They're gonna kill her!
Take us down now!

87
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,020
She's a civilian. We have orders.

88
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,859
Fuck orders!

89
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,695
Nicholai, tie me off.

90
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,365
Get back! No!

91
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,909
Wait!

92
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,257
Now!

93
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,807
Take us down! Down, now!

94
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,066
Hey - Hey, you okay?

95
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,779
Step away from the edge.
Come over to me.

96
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,782
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.

97
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,453
I've seen what happens to you
once you've been bitten.

98
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,374
- We can help you.
- There's no going back.

99
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,959
No!

100
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,185
Move! Peyton!

101
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,314
- Peyton!
- Valentine. Hey, Valentine.

102
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,650
- Move! Police! Move!
- Let her through.

103
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,697
Glad you're here.
We could use the help.

104
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,995
- He has a weak heart.
- Get away from him!

105
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,788
Everybody, stand back!

106
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,750
- Daddy!
- Get away from him!

107
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,793
- Get her away from him!
- It's okay.

108
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,045
- Get her away!
- It's okay. Come on.

109
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,632
- Daddy!
- It's okay, I got you.

110
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,055
- Get him off! Get him off me!
- Move aside!

111
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,307
Get back!

112
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,690
It's here. It's reached the gate.

113
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:00,155
Why are you here? You should've
got out while you had the chance.

114
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,365
These are our people, Jill.

115
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,828
- Close them.
- Sir?

116
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,371
Seal the gates.

117
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,791
- Our men are still out there--
- Just do it.

118
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,504
Oh, my God, they're closing
the gates!

119
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,903
This is a biohazard quarantine area.

120
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,157
Due to risk of infection, you cannot
be allowed to leave the city.

121
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,201
What the fuck is going on here?

122
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,120
All appropriate measures
are being taken.

123
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,581
The situation is under control.

124
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,750
Please return to your homes.

125
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,710
You won't get away with this!

126
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,092
Let us out!

127
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,391
You have five seconds
to turn around...

128
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,268
...and return to the city.

129
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,106
Do it.

130
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:20,944
Use of live ammunition
has been authorized.

131
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,737
Five.

132
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,032
- They can't shoot people!
- They won't fire.

133
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,951
Three.

134
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,327
- Get them back!
- Two.

135
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,746
- Move!
- One.

136
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,462
Everybody, clear out!

137
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,160
<i>Kilo and Romeo squads,
rendezvous at sector 01...</i>

138
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,995
<i>...and secure against enemy.</i>

139
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,603
- Grenade!
- Grenade!

140
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,820
Squads three to seven
are on full retreat.

141
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,408
No, sir. Suppression measures
have failed. We can't contain it.

142
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,870
The infection is spreading faster
than anyone anticipated.

143
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,705
Dr. Ashford.

144
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,126
- Shouldn't you be on the chopper?
- I'm not going.

145
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:04,130
I was instructed to get you and
the other scientists out of the hot zone.

146
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,716
You're too important to Umbrella
to be at risk.

147
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,220
I'm not leaving without my daughter.

148
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,890
I'm sorry, truly.
But the city is sealed.

149
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,560
She may have survived the crash,
but we couldn't find her anywhere.

150
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,814
Even if she were still alive,
I couldn't let her out.

151
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,567
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.

152
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,154
You do what you have to do.

153
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,656
I'm staying.

154
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,782
There has to be someone left alive.

155
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,658
Come on.

156
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,886
<i>- Matt!
- Take her to the Raccoon City facility.</i>

157
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,056
<i>I want her quarantined.
Close observation.</i>

158
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,230
<i>Prepare her for exposure.</i>

159
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,737
<i>Up the dosage.</i>

160
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,074
<i>Just do it.</i>

161
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,888
Inside.

162
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,473
Let's get under cover.

163
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,128
You have to get out.

164
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,589
This is my place. I'm hiding here.

165
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,467
- It's big enough for all of us.
- Don't tell me--

166
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:21,554
Okay, just cool it. Put the gun down.

167
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,352
Put the gun down.

168
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,980
And, you, take it easy.

169
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,443
So does the Raccoon City
Police Department...

170
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,155
...have any comment
on what those things are?

171
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,408
What's that you got there?

172
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,619
My Emmy-

173
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,746
That's if any of us make it out.

174
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,888
Are you all right?

175
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,734
What are you doing?

176
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,862
What's wrong?

177
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,489
It's my sister. She's not well.

178
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,907
- Maybe I can help.
- No.

179
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,118
Out of my way.

180
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,954
Just get out.

181
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,880
You're feeding her? You're sick.

182
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,759
Just leave us alone.

183
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,220
No!

184
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,770
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey.

185
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,105
Hey! Hey, no!

186
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,193
Oh, my God!

187
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,657
Hey, help us! Come on!

188
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,870
Get it in there!

189
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,342
What the hell was that?

190
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,145
There!

191
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,485
Jesus.

192
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:25,363
- What the fuck is that thing?
- What are you doing?

193
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,323
Get back here.

194
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,161
Peyton.

195
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,247
Terri.

196
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,673
Peyton.

197
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,095
I know.

198
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,556
I count three of them.

199
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,475
They got us boxed in.

200
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,352
What are we gonna do?

201
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,729
Let's go.

202
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,418
Jesus.

203
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:29,171
We're gonna need
more ammo. I'm out.

204
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,686
Shit. I'm out.

205
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,333
Move.

206
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,526
Who the fuck are you?

207
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,617
GTA, motherfucker!

208
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,704
Oh, yeah!

209
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,872
Ten points!

210
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,207
Yuri. You okay?

211
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,295
Bite this.

212
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,979
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,667
Pull back!

214
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,056
This way.

215
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:14,063
This is Olivera. We've been overrun.
Request immediate chopper evac.

216
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,930
We need to find somewhere
to stop for a moment.

217
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,807
I don't think that's a good idea.

218
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,642
There might be more of those...

219
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:52,810
...things.

220
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,437
If there were more,
we'd have seen them by now.

221
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,107
- You know what they are?
- They're bio-weapons...

222
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,276
...from Umbrella labs
beneath the city.

223
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,112
How come you know so much
about Umbrella?

224
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,947
I used to work for them.

225
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,283
Damn it.

226
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,118
Hold it.

227
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:11,871
What do you think you're doing?

228
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,456
He's wounded.
The infection's spreading.

229
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,875
I'm fine.

230
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,878
You should take care of him now.

231
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,338
It'll be more difficult later.

232
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,050
You know that.

233
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,760
No.

234
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,637
If it comes to that...

235
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,390
...I'll take care of it myself.

236
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,813
As you wish.

237
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,234
It's nothing personal.
But in an hour, maybe two...

238
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,986
...you'll be dead.

239
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,780
And moments later,
you'll become one of them.

240
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,992
You'll endanger your friends,
try to kill them...

241
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,494
...probably succeed.

242
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,833
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

243
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,552
Help me!

244
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,396
There's too many of them.

245
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,231
Let's get out of here.
This way!

246
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:20,541
Sir, T-virus infection
has reached critical levels.

247
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,004
This is a perfect opportunity.

248
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,590
Ensure all data streams
are recorded.

249
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,593
Activate Nemesis Program now.

250
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,591
- Hey!
- Here! We're down here!

251
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:12,801
- Hey!
- Come! We're here!

252
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,098
- Where are they going?
- They're landing there. Let's get Yuri!

253
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:22,728
- Come on, Yuri. We're getting out.
- We'll get you fixed up. Come.

254
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,331
Hold on, Yuri. We're almost there.

255
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,835
No. No! Don't leave!

256
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,464
- Down here! We're coming!
- They dropped something.

257
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,341
Maybe a radio. One that works.

258
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,301
Take Yuri.

259
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,313
Hold on, Yuri.

260
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,770
Nicholai, put me down.

261
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,398
Okay, rest here.

262
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,529
What is this?

263
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,159
Looks like weapon cases.

264
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:04,037
We don't need weapons.
We need evacuation!

265
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,832
These weren't meant for us.

266
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,295
Yuri!

267
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,064
Plenty to go around.

268
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,753
Don't shoot!

269
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,883
I got the power.

270
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,345
Thank you! Owe you one, man.

271
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,683
Shit!

272
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,810
Maybe I was safer outside.

273
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,605
Get them guns out of my damn face.

274
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,901
Motherfucker, please. Look...

275
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,654
...my shit is custom.

276
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,917
What the fuck is that?

277
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,681
Shit!

278
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,984
You're going down,
you son of a bitch!

279
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,863
Fuck.

280
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:13,667
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.

281
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,299
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy,
got a rocket launcher.

282
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,387
- What do we have?
- A dozen armed men. Well organized.

283
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:36,273
- I'm surprised there's anyone left.
- They're S.T.A.R.S.

284
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,402
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
They're the best.

285
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,738
Fire!

286
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,836
Back! Fall back!

287
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:03,008
- Let's see how good they really are.
- Altering protocols.

288
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,445
S.T.A.R.S.

289
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,621
Oh, shit.

290
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,546
Respect.

291
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,778
Those were some pretty slick moves
back there.

292
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,321
I'm good...

293
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,490
...but I'm not that good.

294
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:11,827
- You should be thankful for that.
- What do you mean?

295
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,289
They did something to me.

296
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,251
I barely feel human any more.

297
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,674
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.

298
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,686
Keep moving.

299
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:53,285
<i>- Hello?
- God, I thought you'd never answer.</i>

300
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:57,038
- Who is this?
- I can get you out of the city.

301
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:58,707
All four of you.

302
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,335
<i>But first we have
to come to an arrangement.</i>

303
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,504
<i>Are you ready to make a deal?</i>

304
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,884
<i>- Do we have a choice?
- Not if you want to live past tonight, no.</i>

305
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,262
His name is Dr. Ashford and he--

306
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:16,516
Runs the genetics and viral research
division of Umbrella Corporation.

307
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:17,976
What's he want with us?

308
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,562
His daughter, Angela,
is trapped in the city.

309
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,565
Umbrella was to evac her,
but she didn't make it.

310
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,442
She's hiding out in her school.

311
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:28,487
We find her, he'll help us escape
the perimeter.

312
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,905
No fucking deal.

313
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,033
We find the building with
the thickest walls and doors...

314
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,495
...and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight, wait for help.

315
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,747
There won't be any help.

316
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,666
Umbrella knows
they can't contain the infection.

317
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:46,087
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon
City will be completely sanitized.

318
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,425
What do you mean by "sanitized"?

319
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,094
A precision tactical nuclear device.

320
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,223
- What yield?
- Five kilotons.

321
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,475
- Fuck me.
- Stupid.

322
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:03,480
- What does that mean?
- It means it'll destroy the infection...

323
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,316
...and all evidence of it.

324
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,111
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!

325
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,614
No fucking way would they
get away with that!

326
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,450
- It would be all over the fucking news!
- Cover-up.

327
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,285
Cover-up's already prepared.

328
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,288
A meltdown
at the nuclear power plant.

329
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:24,125
- A tragic accident.
- Not even Umbrella is capable of this.

330
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,877
Not capable?

331
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,421
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.

332
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:32,509
You know exactly how far
Umbrella will go.

333
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,306
So, what do we do now, huh?

334
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:42,602
I think we should be out of here
by sunrise.

335
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,987
What if there is no way out and he's
watching us on these cameras...

336
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,322
...like this is some kind
of sick game?

337
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,326
- What is it?
- What's going on?

338
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,996
- Wait.
- Sunrise ain't gonna wait.

339
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,664
No.

340
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,376
- There's something down there.
- Where?

341
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,379
There.

342
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,797
I don't see anything.

343
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:14,593
That doesn't alter the fact that
there is something down there.

344
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,345
I'm getting sick of this bullshit!

345
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:18,930
Peyton!

346
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,103
No!

347
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,858
He's located another two
S.T.A.R.S. members.

348
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,529
Nemesis.

349
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,907
Run. Just go!

350
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,627
Primary target is identified.

351
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,880
Gentlemen, this is what
we've been waiting for.

352
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,384
<i>Confirm at 2:18 and 27 seconds.</i>

353
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,013
The Nemesis Program is now
fully activated.

354
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,801
Look, I'm--
I'm sorry about your friend.

355
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,182
Let's just get to the school
and find this kid.

356
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,469
This bite...

357
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,346
...it won't stop bleeding.

358
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,183
- Why didn't they see us?
- What?

359
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:36,437
The chopper. We were right there
in the street in front of the hospital.

360
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,274
- How could they not see us?
- They saw us.

361
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,860
What do you mean?

362
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:45,280
We're assets, Nicholai.

363
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,282
Expendable assets.

364
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,119
And we've just been expended.

365
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,051
Stop!

366
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,429
I'm not one of those things.

367
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:13,892
Hey, remember me? Look, I haven't
been bitten or anything. Look.

368
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,604
Climb aboard.

369
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,608
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.

370
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,986
You can call me L.J. on account
of the informal situation.

371
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,202
We're gonna have to split up
to search this place.

372
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:18,456
Forget it. Forget it! I'm not going
out there by myself.

373
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,541
I can go with you.

374
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,669
You, take the first floor.

375
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,213
You, take the second.

376
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,215
I'll take the basement.

377
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:30,551
- I've never shot a gun before.
- There's nothing to it.

378
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,387
Try to hit them in the head.

379
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,073
I see you, mother--

380
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,451
Oh, shit!

381
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,707
So did you get the call as well?

382
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,460
- What?
- You're here for the girl?

383
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,712
Oh, yeah, yeah. The girl.

384
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:51,215
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal
with someone else.

385
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,884
I guess we're partners.

386
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:00,725
Shit.

387
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,420
Angela?

388
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,674
It's gonna be okay.

389
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,344
There's no need to be afraid.

390
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,932
We're gonna take you home.

391
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,479
Oh, my God.

392
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,277
Help me!

393
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,711
Terri?

394
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,774
You can't help her.

395
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,735
Not now.

396
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,406
I've seen what they do.

397
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:41,701
- Are you Angela?
- Yes.

398
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:44,412
We should hurry
before they come back.

399
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,082
Hold this.

400
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,339
Angela Ashford, huh?

401
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,176
That's a pretty grown-up name
for a little girl.

402
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,261
I'm not a little girl.

403
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,221
Besides...

404
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:06,100
...all my friends call me Angie.
- Angie, huh?

405
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,561
I like that.

406
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:14,692
Those things are in here.

407
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,737
It's okay, honey. They're slow.
We can run around them.

408
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,822
No.

409
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,908
Not them.

410
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,410
Them.

411
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,123
Get back.

412
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,568
<i>S'[8Y-</i>

413
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,779
Thought you might need a hand.

414
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:02,573
- You work for Umbrella?
- Used to.

415
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:09,121
Until they left us for dead in this place.
Now I consider myself freelance.

416
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:14,001
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev,
at your service.

417
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,672
- Come on!
- Wait! Angie!

418
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,132
Save the girl! I've got this bitch.

419
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:30,810
Oh, shit.

420
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,195
From now on, stay right beside me.

421
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,032
It's blocked.

422
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,077
What do we do now?

423
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,509
Wait here. Eyes:

424
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,553
Okay?

425
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,849
Thank you.

426
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,310
You two know each other?

427
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,356
She's infected.

428
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,818
She's infected on a massive level.

429
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:47,655
- How can you know that?
- Because she is too.

430
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:51,534
You're infected? When were
you gonna tell us that?

431
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,750
- Let me see.
- No.

432
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,006
You know I'm not gonna hurt you.

433
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,467
Let me see.

434
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:32,491
It's the antivirus,
the cure to the T-virus.

435
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,869
There's a cure?

436
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,537
How did you get this?

437
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:40,207
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.

438
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,711
He's sick.
And someday, I'll get sick too.

439
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,672
He just wanted to stop that.

440
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:48,549
When I was little...

441
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,634
<i>I had to walk on crutches</i>

442
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,263
<i>They said I'd never get better,
just worse.</i>

443
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:59,393
<i>He found a way
to make me stronger.</i>

444
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,479
<i>The T-virus.</i>

445
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,316
<i>Then they took the invention
away from him.</i>

446
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:07,109
Get out of my house!

447
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,577
He's not a bad man.

448
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,246
He didn't mean for any of this.

449
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,541
It's okay.

450
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:33,761
Don't shoot! He's cool.

451
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,597
He made a deal with Dr. Doom,
same as you.

452
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,769
How many of you guys are there?

453
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,687
What do you mean?

454
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,235
Nicholai.

455
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,282
When were you bitten?

456
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,117
- Three hours ago.
- What the--?

457
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,207
It's your lucky day.

458
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:10,422
Should have told me you got bit.
I'm hanging with you and shit.

459
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:17,972
<i>- Let me speak to my daughter.
- First, you tell us how we're getting out.</i>

460
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:21,684
There's a helicopter
already being prepped.

461
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,645
It takes off in 47 minutes.

462
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:28,983
<i>It'll be the last transport to leave
Raccoon City before they detonate.</i>

463
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,944
I take it this helicopter isn't
laid out just for us.

464
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:35,322
<i>No. It has another purpose,
but it'll be lightly guarded.</i>

465
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,493
- Where's the evac site?
- May I speak to my daughter now?

466
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:46,333
- Daddy?
- Hey, sweetheart.

467
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,169
<i>- Are you all right?
- When can I see you?</i>

468
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,755
Soon. These people will
bring you to see me.

469
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,632
<i>I'll see you very soon.</i>

470
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,467
<i>Put the lady back on.</i>

471
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,845
<i>Where do we have to go?</i>

472
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,180
The helicopter will be at city hall.

473
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,391
<i>I suggest you make haste.</i>

474
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,900
Computers...

475
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,320
...so unreliable.

476
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,787
Just like people.

477
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,171
You really thought I didn't know?

478
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,352
So, what are you injecting me with?

479
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,228
The antivirus.

480
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,941
The T-virus reanimates dead cells.

481
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:56,153
Basically, bringing the dead to life.

482
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,532
Or in a living human,
it can cause uncontrollable mutation.

483
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:05,162
Or it can help her walk again,
if the virus is kept in check with this.

484
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,623
- Angie's infected?
- Yes.

485
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,584
The cellular growth is enough
to regenerate her...

486
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,878
...but not enough to cause mutation.

487
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,464
And they infected you
with the T-virus as well?

488
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,758
Yeah.

489
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:20,594
But don't worry.
I'm not contagious.

490
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:24,932
Here.

491
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:29,603
Tape the story.
I'll see that it gets put to good use.

492
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,440
My name is Alice.

493
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,568
I worked for the
Umbrella Corporation...

494
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:41,573
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

495
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:47,079
I was head of security at a secret
high-tech facility called The Hive...

496
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:51,083
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

497
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,043
...viral weaponry.

498
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:23,574
Let's go.

499
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,283
You missed one.

500
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:02,691
We have to hurry.

501
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:05,903
- We're okay. We have time.
- No! We have to hurry.

502
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,325
- Holy shit! We stealing his ride!
- Take off.

503
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,579
- I said, take off!
- What's the rush?

504
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,334
We've been expecting you.

505
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:27,174
<i>- Perimeter secure.
- All sectors locked down</i>

506
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,643
- Angie!
- Daddy!

507
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,439
- I knew you wouldn't leave me.
- No. Never.

508
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,652
Discard primary weaponry.

509
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:04,378
The two of you showed such promise,
but we had to see you in action.

510
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,214
And most impressive you've been.

511
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,174
You're like brother and sister.

512
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:13,720
Heightened speed, strength,
agility, the same killer instincts.

513
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,098
Parallel strands of research.

514
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:20,394
And now...
Now we'll discover which is superior.

515
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,982
Fight him.

516
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:27,693
No.

517
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,195
Fight him, or they die.

518
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:33,907
What makes you think I care?

519
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:42,249
Daddy! Daddy, no.

520
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:44,418
No.

521
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,587
He was a valuable asset
to the corporation.

522
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,757
I don't even care
about these people.

523
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,062
Begin.

524
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:45,432
<i>He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.</i>

525
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:48,727
Matt!

526
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,400
<i>Cellular structure breaking down.</i>

527
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:58,403
<i>T-virus is manifesting itself
in a genetic mutation.</i>

528
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:05,035
<i>We're seeing similar
cellular regeneration.</i>

529
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,040
I'm sorry.

530
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:12,959
Oh, Matt. I'm so sorry.

531
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,257
Finish him.

532
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,718
I said, finish him.

533
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,471
No.

534
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:27,432
No.

535
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:32,020
Don't you understand
how important you are to me?

536
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:34,397
That creature is one thing,
but you...

537
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:38,151
...somehow you bonded
with the T-virus on a cellular level.

538
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:42,948
You adapted it, changed it.
You became magnificent.

539
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:45,492
- I became a freak.
- No.

540
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:49,412
You're not mutation.
You're evolution.

541
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:53,667
With my help, just imagine
what you can achieve.

542
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,170
What about him?

543
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:02,592
Evolution has its dead ends.

544
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:06,137
Now, finish this.
Put him out of his misery...

545
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,431
...and come with me.

546
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:12,018
No.

547
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:17,732
You're such
a disappointment to me.

548
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,484
All that strength...

549
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:22,028
...but no will to use it.

550
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,198
What a waste.

551
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,669
Prepare for takeoff.

552
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:43,008
Sanitation of Raccoon City
to commence on my mark.

553
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,019
Kill her.

554
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,236
What are you doing?

555
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,171
Get us airborne.

556
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:33,350
This is Cain. Priority overload.
Initiate launch proceedings.

557
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,187
<i>Detonation set
at T-minus 5 minutes.</i>

558
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,196
Angie, get down!

559
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,289
Why haven't we taken off?

560
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:59,292
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.

561
01:13:19,104 --> 01:13:21,314
<i>Surrender, or we open fire.</i>

562
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,762
Drop it.

563
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,187
Alice!

564
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,280
<i>Drop your weapon and surrender.</i>

565
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:50,069
Let's get this thing in the air!

566
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,076
You have to get up.

567
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,627
Matt...

568
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:10,131
Come on, we have to go.
We have to go. Come on.

569
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:15,929
Come on.

570
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,232
Get up!

571
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:31,027
If you expect me to beg, I will not.

572
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:35,448
Wait.

573
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,584
Killing me won't put things right.

574
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,545
No...

575
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,547
...but it's a start.

576
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,037
Are you going to be all right?

577
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,740
Hang on to something!

578
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,258
We're going down!

579
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:39,757
<i>U-Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.</i>

580
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,592
<i>We've located the crash site.</i>

581
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:57,316
Fetch the medical team.

582
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:00,111
What about the others?

583
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:02,780
No other bodies found, sir.

584
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:18,838
<i>We have unconfirmed reports
of disaster at Raccoon City.</i>

585
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,840
<i>These shocking images just in.</i>

586
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:24,177
<i>A mysterious plague
or viral outbreak has run rampant--</i>

587
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:27,680
<i>Implicating Umbrella Corporation
in deaths of innocent citizens.</i>

588
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:32,185
<i>This tape, work of former Raccoon 7
anchorwoman Terri Morales.</i>

589
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,812
<i>New evidence now
discredits earlier reports--</i>

590
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:38,483
<i>- Nothing more than sick joke.
- Fake videotape totally discredited.</i>

591
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:40,193
<i>Nothing more than a big hoax.</i>

592
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:42,236
<i>Playing on the very real tragedy...</i>

593
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,822
<i>...which overwhelmed
Raccoon City this week.</i>

594
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:48,159
<i>The reactor at the nuclear
power station went critical.</i>

595
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:52,914
<i>The worst atomic disaster since the
Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.</i>

596
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,501
<i>The state governor personally
thanked the Umbrella Corporation...</i>

597
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,044
<i>...for their swift action.</i>

598
01:19:58,211 --> 01:20:01,881
<i>The perpetrators of the hoax,
Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...</i>

599
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:04,967
<i>...now being sought
for questioning by the police.</i>

600
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,695
<i>Alice</i>

601
01:20:29,784 --> 01:20:32,745
<i>Alice, wake up</i>

602
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,668
Can you hear me?

603
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:43,130
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

604
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:47,134
Good.

605
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:52,431
Begin the purging process.

606
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:22,879
Her recovery's remarkable.

607
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,548
And her powers,
both physical and mental...

608
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:28,718
...are developing
at a geometric rate.

609
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:43,357
Where are you?

610
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,152
You're safe.

611
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,154
Come on.

612
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,491
That's it.

613
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:54,577
There we are.

614
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,424
Do you know what that is?

615
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:11,886
It's a pen.

616
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:13,512
You see?

617
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:16,474
You try.

618
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,478
That's it.

619
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,147
Pen.

620
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:30,571
Look at me.

621
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:35,242
Can you remember anything?

622
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:40,539
You remember your name?

623
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,334
My name?

624
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,044
My name.

625
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:52,343
I want her under
24-hour observation.

626
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:54,345
A complete set of blood work.

627
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:57,890
Chemical and electrolyte analysis
by the end of the day.

628
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:00,559
My name.

629
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:03,312
- My name.
- Sir.

630
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,481
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.

631
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:06,691
My name.

632
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:09,694
- Monitor electrical impulses--
- Sir.

633
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:13,322
Sir!

634
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:16,909
What is it?

635
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:23,165
My name...

636
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,210
...is Alice.

637
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,716
And I remember everything.

638
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:04,957
This is central.
Request immediate backup.

639
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:07,126
Maximum response.

640
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:49,293
Thank you, gentlemen.
We'll take over from here.

641
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:53,798
- On whose authority?
- Classified. Level six authorization.

642
01:24:56,175 --> 01:24:57,843
Sorry, sir.

643
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,819
Let them go.

644
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:02,616
Good to have you back.

645
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:05,828
Are you all right?

646
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:08,414
Program Alice activated.
