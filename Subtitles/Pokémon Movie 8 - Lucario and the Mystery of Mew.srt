1
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,580
Pocket Monsters.

2
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,220
Pokemon for short.

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,890
They are this world's strange,
mysterious creatures.

4
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,340
The number of species are 100,

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,570
200,

6
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,050
300...

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,720
No, possibly even more than that.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,240
Pokemon and humans put their powers
together as friends and partners.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,240
In other times, they face off
against opponents.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,390
They exist all over the world.

11
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,290
This boy is Satoshi of Masara Town.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,310
Aiming to become a Pokemon Master,
he battles and catches them.

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,720
His journey of training continues.

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,800
With as many meetings as there are Pokemon,

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,780
and with just as many partings,

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,570
many stories have been woven in this way.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,930
Yes.

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,730
It has been this way since a long,

19
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,480
long time ago.

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,950
A long time ago...
In an era before monster balls had
come into existence...

21
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,150
Aaron-sama.

22
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,410
Aaron-sama!

23
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,390
Aaron-sama!

24
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,050
I can hear you, Lucario.

25
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,470
An incredible number of troops are coming!

26
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,340
If we get caught up in them, our castle won't stand a chance!

27
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,990
At this rate...

28
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,980
The fight can't be stopped anymore.

29
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,680
I cannot leave this place.

30
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,150
As Queen, I will share the same fate as the castle.

31
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,070
Leen-sama.

32
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,290
Aaron-sama!

33
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,860
Aaron-sama.

34
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,900
Lucario.

35
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,080
Your eyes...

36
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,690
I am fine.

37
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,530
Leave this place.

38
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,400
I've abandoned the castle.

39
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,730
I can't return ever again.

40
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,030
What are you saying?

41
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,090
Please wait!

42
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,990
Aaron-sama!

43
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,350
Why?

44
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,170
The tree...

45
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,700
The Tree of World's Origin is weeping.

46
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,920
Aaron!

47
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,180
Queen Leen believed

48
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,350
that the Wave-user Aaron had used the power

49
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,200
of the Tree of World's Origin where Mew is said to live.

50
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,770
And then what?

51
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,750
The hatred and anger that shrouded the land subsided.

52
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,560
The Pokemon returned to their respective homes.

53
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,470
And so peace again returned to this land.

54
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,280
That's good!

55
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,360
And so, Aaron became known as the "Hero of the Wave."

56
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,990
Tell me the Hero of the Wave story again sometime!

57
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,470
Sure.

58
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,460
And now...

59
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:37,480
Pocket Monsters

60
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,480
Theatrical                          Edition

61
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:39,210
Mew and the Hero of the Wave

62
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:39,210
Lucario

63
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,870
Aiming to become a Pokemon Master, Satoshi and the others continues their journey,

64
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,890
and they have arrived here, at Aldoran Castle.

65
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:58,220
They are here to participate in a festival commemorating the Hero of the Wave, Aaron.

66
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,810
Whoever wins the Pokemon battle in the castle...

67
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,930
will be named the Hero of the Wave for that year.

68
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,400
When you go to an event in a castle, you have to wear old-fashioned garments!

69
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,130
I don't have any!

70
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,170
It says that they have some prepared in the castle.

71
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,010
Really?

72
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,720
I wonder if they have the hero's outfit too!

73
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,440
We should dress Pikachu up too!

74
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,070
That might be good!

75
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,950
We can pick from any of these?

76
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,360
Which one should I wear?

77
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,580
I can't decide!

78
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,930
Where's the hero's outfit?

79
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,090
I'll take... uh...

80
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,870
Ta-da!

81
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,400
How's this, Pikachu?

82
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,210
Onee-chan?

83
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,590
That is correct.

84
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,630
It suits you.

85
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,660
Doesn't it?

86
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm a hero!

87
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,100
How's this, Pikachu?

88
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,280
This might be cute!

89
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,360
It looks good on you!

90
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,070
The Pokemon Battle is starting soon.

91
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,730
All right.

92
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,060
Pikachu, let's go!

93
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
While everyone is preoccupied with that,

94
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,810
we'll take all the Pokemon in the castle!

95
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,030
We need to change clothes first.

96
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,740
What should I pick?

97
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,800
Hurry up!

98
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,030
This is so wonderful!

99
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,580
So fast!

100
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,300
The Queen of this country

101
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,620
and Lady of Aldoran Castle...

102
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,110
Eileen-sama!

103
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,620
The Queen...

104
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,500
This might be wonderful!

105
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,180
In tribute to the Hero of the Wave, Aaron, who saved the world,

106
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,830
we will now begin the Pokemon Battle!

107
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,520

108

All right! We did it!

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,800
This is the Hero's Staff, which belonged to Hero of the Wave, Aaron.

173
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,940
Only the one who wins the battle at the festival

174
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,010
and is chosen as the hero is allowed to hold this.

175
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,140
Awesome.

176
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,340
Now, please accept this, Satoshi.

177
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,960
Okay.

178
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,670
So this is the Hero of the Wave's staff...

179
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,730
Why?

180
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,250
Did you say something?

181
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,410
No.

182
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,910
In commemoration of the Hero who protected this country, Aaron,

183
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,250
let the festivities begin!

184
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,360
K... Kid-san!

185
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,410
M-M-May I have a dance with you?

186
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,410
Of course.

187
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,780
I'm honored!

188
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,080
You don't have to be so nervous.

189
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,320
I'll lead you.

190
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,250
I'm so moved!

191
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,770
Oh yeah!

192
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,570
All right.

193
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,470
Everyone, join the party!

194
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,920
Excuse me for a moment.

195
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,480
There!

196
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,000
All right! I'm going to have a feast!

197
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,470
Wait there.

198
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,060
You can't do that.

199
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,090
The Hero must not leave his seat.

200
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,570
No way...

201
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,540
Isn't this our chance to steal the Pokemon?

202
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,560
I want to dance more!

203
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,870
I've finally got a chance to wear such a nice dress!

204
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,870
Excuse me.

205
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,960
Your dancing is quite skillful.

206
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,540
N-No...

207
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,580
What a man! I could be in love!

208
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,210
Feels good!

209
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,570
Have we met somewhere before?

210
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,510
N-No, we couldn't have...

211
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,270
What a feast! This is the best!

212
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,590
Takeshi-kun, could you get me a drink?

213
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,880
Of course!

214
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,290
Just wait a moment!

215
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,630
It's morning there already, isn't it?

216
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,950
Have you finished breakfast, Banks?

217
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,190
I had a croissant and coffee.

218
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,500
You should have a salad too.

219
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,960
I think I'll have a vegetable juice.

220
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,110
Make sure you put celery in it.

221
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,500
That's a little...

222
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,030
You can't just eat things you like.

223
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,420
Sorry to trouble you.

224
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,690
Have you finished dinner, my lady?

225
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,640
It's a castle party, so I'm sure they have quite a selection.

226
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,240
I'll save it for later.

227
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,090
It can wait until I'm done with work.

228
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,230
What a pity.

229
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,840
I'm used to it.

230
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,940
Besides that, transfer a map of the castle to me.

231
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,300
Would you mind if I send it after I shower?

232
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,340
No way.

233
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,660
I'm holding off dinner for this.

234
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,260
Then please wait 30 seconds.

235
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,330
20 seconds.

236
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,520
As you wish.

237
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,770
Sorry I kept you waiting.

238
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,590
I shall transfer it now.

239
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,660
Thanks.

240
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,260
Don't push yourself.

241
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,660
Right, right. I know.

242
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,650
Chief butler, Banks-sama.

243
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,170
Those could be our rivals.

244
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,920
Where did Pikachu and the others go?

245
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,670
Gonbe?

246
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,670
Um...

247
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,840
Err...

248
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,950
Could you be...

249
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,780
Grand swing!

250
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,140
Amazing.

251
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,550
I found you.

252
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,590
Put this locator beacon on Mew, got it?

253
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,540
It's you guys!

254
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,900
It's Mew!

255
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,640
They're overdoing it.

256
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,710
They only need to put on the beacon...

257
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,380
What?

258
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,310
You sure have a lot of free time.

259
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,330
You guys have a lot of free time too.

260
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,040
Pikachu!

261
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,770
And Nyasu too!

262
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,150
Mew?

263
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,390
Instant teleportation?

264
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,020
Pikachu, you're heavier than you look...

265
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,460
You guys always get caught in the moment.

266
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,720
This is trouble.

267
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,330
So someone had this hundreds of years ago.

268
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,720
It feels so strange.

269
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,300
Why?

270
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,150
I heard it again.

271
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,840
We will now begin the evening party.

272
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,870
The Hero of the Wave will see it off.

273
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,870
Now, the Hero's pose!

274
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,310
The Hero's pose?

275
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,190
Why?

276
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,010
What's wrong?

277
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,210
There's something in this!

278
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,020
Aaron-sama!

279
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,190
Why did you abandon the castle?

280
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,450
Telepathy?

281
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,040
Why?!

282
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,260
What are you saying?

283
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,000
That's...

284
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,340
Lucario.

285
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,720
Lucario?

286
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,320
He was the Hero, Aaron's, Pokemon.

287
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,710
Yes.

288
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,930
He was in here?

289
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,290
Is this Aldoran Castle?

290
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,500
Lucario.

291
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,920
This is the castle where we'll both live starting from today.

292
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,490
The training will be tough.

293
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,020
Yes, sir.

294
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,210
I intend to teach you everything I know as a Wave-user.

295
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,590
Aaron-sama!

296
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,950
The Wave is within us.

297
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,240
Believe in your Wave.

298
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,750
Lucario.

299
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,530
Leen-sama!

300
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,240
I am not Leen.

301
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,440
Queen Leen is my ancestor.

302
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,460
My name is Eileen.

303
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,470
You have been asleep all this time.

304
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,390
I've been asleep?

305
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,350
Time has passed.

306
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,600
Impossible...

307
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,810
This room was ours just yesterday...

308
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,740
It might feel like it was yesterday to you, however...

309
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,410
For us, it happened long ago.

310
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,490
We heard that you disappeared within the battle.

311
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,080
What happened exactly?

312
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,380
Two troops closed in on us

313
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,090
and attempted to get this castle caught up in the fight.

314
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,050
I was sent out as a scout.

315
00:33:59,050 --> 00:33:59,920
But...

316
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,200
It was already too late to stop the fight.

317
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,620
The Hero Aaron stopped that, didn't he?

318
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,470
What?

319
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,750
According to the legend, Aaron saved the castle.

320
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,150
That couldn't...

321
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,360
Is that wrong?

322
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,100
Aaron-sama abandoned the castle and ran.

323
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,150
And he sealed me away...

324
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,920
This might be different from the legend.

325
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,870
What's this all about?

326
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,890
There's no way to tell the truth now.

327
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,130
What should I do?

328
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,720
Lucario.

329
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,690
You're free to stay here until you've sorted out your feelings.

330
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,300
Aldoran Castle welcomes you.

331
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,330
My Queen.

332
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,060
I'm grateful.

333
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,440
I'm Satoshi.

334
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,230
Did you mistake me for someone?

335
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,010
Aaron?

336
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,870
Oh, because of these clothes?

337
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,720
No.

338
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,260
Your Wave is the same as Aaron's.

339
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,270
We haven't seen that Pokemon before, have we?

340
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,490
They said that Pokemon's been sealed away for hundreds of years!

341
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,000
I want! I want him!

342
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,410
There's trouble!

343
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,140
Mew was...!

344
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,300
What's wrong?

345
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,480
Mew was...

346
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,840
Mew was here!

347
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,070
My!

348
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,600
So this boy saw Mew!

349
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,760
Those who see Mew are said to be granted happiness.

350
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,550
That's not it!

351
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,840
What is it?!

352
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,150
Mew disappeared with Pikachu and Nyasu!

353
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,600
Mew?

354
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,520
A Pokemon?

355
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,010
This is Lucario, a Pokemon the Hero Aaron had sealed away.

356
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,350
He just woke up.

357
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,840
No way!

358
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,650
Did you really see Mew?

359
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,080
Are you mistaking things?

360
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,450
I saw it too.

361
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,870
From a tower I was touring, I saw Mew take Pikachu and Nyasu,

362
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,640
then it transformed into Pidgeot and flew away.

363
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,290
Why did Mew do that?

364
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,250
It was probably a prank.

365
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,210
Mew occasionally appears in this castle and plays pranks.

366
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,630
He often takes toys, but he's never returned them.

367
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,490
He took Nyasu too?

368
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,930
We planned to steal Pokemon, but our own got stolen instead.

369
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,060
Well, that's not what I meant...

370
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,370
Please tell me where Mew is!

371
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,650
I'm going to find Pikachu!

372
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,780
That appears to be a large tree,

373
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,120
but it is actually an enormous, stone mountain.

374
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,080
That might be amazing.

375
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,840
We call that the Tree of World's Origin.

376
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,760
The Tree of World's Origin.

377
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,550
Mew lives there.

378
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,440
All right.

379
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,790
But Mew has the ability to transform into any Pokemon,

380
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,610
so it rarely shows its true form to anyone.

381
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,240
So how can we find it?

382
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,230
Lucario can read the Wave of all things.

383
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,160
He is said to be able to guide the Hero even in bleak darkness.

384
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,760
Lucario, you will be able to find Mew, right?

385
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,620
Yes.

386
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,830
Will you lend your power to Satoshi?

387
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,930
If the Queen wishes for it.

388
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,520
Satoshi-kun.

389
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,260
I'll lend you a hand too.

390
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,790
Kid-san!

391
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,910
You're that adventurer, Kid Summers!

392
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,270
I've been next to you all this time, but I never realized it!

393
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,360
I have failed!

394
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,430
I am deeply, deeply regretful!

395
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,990
I'm so honored to meet you!

396
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,000
She's famous?

397
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,850
Certainly!

398
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,830
According to my ranking book,

399
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,120
she's quite high up!

400
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,180
The record for the quicket trip around the world in a hot-air balloon,

401
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,660
the record for the deepest independent submarine dive,

402
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,920
the longest solo space walk, and it goes on!

403
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,530
She holds various world records.

404
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,500
She's a super woman!

405
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,120
Wow!

406
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,000
I'll feel safe with someone like you around!

407
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,490
Please!

408
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,060
I would also like you to help.

409
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,620
Actually,

410
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,550
I came here to go to the Tree of World's Origin

411
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,030
and unlock its mystery.

412
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,850
Is that so?!

413
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,010
I'd go with you even if you didn't ask.

414
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,840
Roger!

415
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,470
Then you will depart tomorrow morning.

416
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,840
Pikachu must be playing with Mew right now.

417
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,210
I hope so...

418
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,250
What are you doing?!

419
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,280
Be quiet. It's only because you were standing behind me.

420
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm counting on you tomorrow.

421
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,760
I absolutely have to find Pikachu.

422
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,530
Are you that Pikachu's master?

423
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,590
Master?

424
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,940
It's not like that.

425
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,510
Pikachu and I are friends.

426
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,930
Friends?

427
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,370
If your friend disappeared, you'd look for him too, right?

428
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,090
I'm guiding you on the Queen's orders.

429
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,960
What's with him?

430
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,550
May the Wave protect them.

431
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,810
It's as if we're in the clouds.

432
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,330
Lucario's fine in this, isn't he?

433
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,060
He's using the Wave.

434
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,400
Wave?

435
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,720
Hey, didn't Lucario say that Satoshi's Wave was the same as Aaron's?

436
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,850
That's right.

437
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,650
Just what is a Wave?

438
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,790
Everything has this thing called a Wave within them.

439
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,180
Then there's a Wave within me too!

440
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,150
People normally call them something like chi or auras, right?

441
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,270
And Lucario can see those!

442
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,760
Yes.

443
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,860
In legendary times, people who mastered the Wave were called Wave-users.

444
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,550
Aaron was one of them.

445
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,510
If this Aaron's Wave was the same as Satoshi's...

446
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,110
Maybe Satoshi can use the Wave!

447
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,180
Maybe!

448
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,960
Maybe not.

449
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,860
No good.

450
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,950
What's that...

451
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,640
He'll wake up eventually.

452
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,030
It's all done!

453
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,510
This is Satoshi's.

454
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,180
Here.

455
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,760
This is Masato's.

456
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,160
Here.

457
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,420
This is Haruka's.

458
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:43,890
Here!

459
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,210
This is Kid-sa...

460
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:45,960
Huh?

461
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,570
What Pokemon is this?

462
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,470
Hey!

463
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,080
That's Kid-san's!

464
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:57,930
You made it cry!

465
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,590
Bullying's not nice!

466
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,600
This is Usohachi!

467
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,340
It specializes in fake crying!

468
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,100
Hey!

469
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,070
Don't take other people's belongings.

470
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,130
Have this instead.

471
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,190
This feels kind of nice.

472
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,370
What was that?

473
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,000
It's huge!

474
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,560
Geysers.

475
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,770
We'll have to wait until they calm down.

476
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,130
That's...

477
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,810
A hotspring?

478
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,630
So relaxing...

479
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,920
You followed us.

480
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,120
Why don't you come in with us?

481
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,510
Usohachi!

482
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,110
Usohachi's a rock type, so it's not good with water.

483
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:01,840
No way!

484
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,260
I wish Pikachu could be with us in this hotspring too.

485
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,330
He'd definitely be happy.

486
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:12,800
Yeah.

487
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,560
Lucario.

488
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,410
Put your feet in too.

489
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:31,780
It feels nice.

490
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,820
I'll pass.

491
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,270
Don't hold back.

492
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,960
Then...

493
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,870
Right?

494
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,080
Yes.

495
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:51,910
Lucario!

496
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,570
Come in!

497
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,610
It feels great!

498
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,140
It feels great!

499
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,640
What's with him?

500
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,700
Maybe he doesn't like hotsprings?

501
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,520
Satoshi!

502
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,240
Over here!

503
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,420
What's up, Haruka?

504
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,790
Look there!

505
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,240
Is that a flower?

506
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,330
I'll take a look.

507
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,460
Satoshi's pretty flexible.

508
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,040
Like an Aipom.

509
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,870
You shouldn't pick out the flowers from the mountain.

510
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,570
Sorry.

511
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,020
Well, it couldn't be helped.

512
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,000
Let's re-plant it later.

513
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,590
Yeah.

514
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,410
This is a Time flower.

515
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,870
Time flower?

516
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:10,430
This flower shows a miracle of time for Wave-users.

517
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,390
Will this be okay?

518
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,320
Sure.

519
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,450
Haruka, give it to me.

520
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:34,730
Here.

521
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,570
What?

522
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,250
What was that?

523
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:01,300
It's a Time flower.

524
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,510
A Time flower?

525
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:08,180
According to the legends, it reveals a miracle of time for Wave-users...

526
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,440
So this is what they meant.

527
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,400
How mysterious.

528
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,480
The miracle must've happened because Satoshi and Aaron share the same Wave.

529
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,920
Pikachu and I weren't like this when we first met.

530
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,740
Is that so?

531
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,810
We didn't get along at all.

532
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,280
I got shocked by his electricity so many times.

533
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,030
How did you become friends?

534
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,160
Tell us!

535
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,170
I want to know how you and Pikachu became friends too, Satoshi!

536
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:43,300
One day on our journey, a flock of Onisuzume attacked us...

537
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,510
and we became friends thanks to overcoming that hardship together.

538
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,830
So that's what happened.

539
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:09,760
From then on, Pikachu trusted me,

540
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,750
and I trust Pikachu too.

541
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,780
You should be able to do it too.

542
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,470
I trust you, Lucario.

543
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,840
All right, that's enough!

544
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,290
What's with all this trust?!

545
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,730
People can't be trusted!

546
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,430
Wait a second!

547
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,470
Are you talking about me?

548
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:16,850
If it becomes inconvenient for you, you might abandon Pikachu.

549
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,570
I'll never abandon Pikachu!

550
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,040
How would you know?

551
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,430
Besides, someone called a legendary hero

552
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,460
couldn't possibly have abandoned his Pokemon!

553
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,330
You're just spouting nonsense!

554
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,080
What?!

555
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,130
Stop it!

556
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,200
But this guy...

557
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,170
Maybe Pikachu ran off because he was fed up with staying with a master like you.

558
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,130
What did you say?!

559
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,410
Satoshi!

560
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,640
Cut it out!

561
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,280
Stop fighting!

562
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,680
They've started fighting among themselves.

563
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,230
Who cares about that? I'm hungry.

564
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:22,970
I'll go fi...

565
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:23,550
No!

566
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,630
Don't open it...

567
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,770
Satoshi, you said too much.

568
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:33,820
But...

569
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,930
He said Pikachu ran away from me.

570
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,920
That's because you said some rude things to Lucario.

571
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,360
Yeah.

572
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,700
I bet you've never had this before.

573
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:01,630
Here.

574
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,210
It's called chocolate.

575
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:05,050
Chocolate?

576
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:10,670
They say it's good to eat sweet things when you're upset or irritated.

577
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,400
Right?

578
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:42,970
I'm at peace...

579
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,150
It's about time you got back to that brat boy and the others, isn't it?

580
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,490
He wants to play some more.

581
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,920
Wait until the morning.

582
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,150
Pikachu.

583
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,440
Lucario, what's wrong?

584
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,910
This is where I was sealed away.

585
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,020
Why?

586
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,110
Why?

587
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,590
A Time flower...

588
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,540
Aaron-sama!

589
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,400
Stop it, Lucario!

590
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,590
These aren't real!

591
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,120
That was scary.

592
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,030
This was a battlefield in the past.

593
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,060
Lucario was telling the truth.

594
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,240
Does that mean the legend was wrong?

595
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,510
But Aaron didn't seem like a bad person.

596
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:52,030
Maybe he sealed Lucario to protect him from those troops?

597
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,070
Why?

598
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:08,720
Sorry.

599
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,560
I sad all those rude things without knowing your feelings...

600
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,750
Sorry.

601
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,290
Satoshi.

602
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,580
Never abandon Pikachu.

603
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,830
I know.

604
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:37,310
Lucario!

605
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,010
Hey, what's wrong, Lucario?

606
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:55,570
Regirock!

607
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,700
What's going on?

608
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,490
Everyone, this way!

609
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:16,890
Let's go!

610
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,410
In here.

611
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:05,580
I wonder if they reached the Tree of World's Origin.

612
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,180
Why did Regirock come out and attack us?

613
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,600
It told us not to get closer.

614
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:16,870
It was a warning?

615
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:23,280
It might be protecting the Tree of World's Origin from intruders.

616
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,270
This is...

617
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,420
The lowest level of the Tree of World's Origin, isn't it?

618
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,440
Then, Pikachu is...

619
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,390
Above us.

620
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:26,950
All right. I'm coming, Pikachu!

621
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,590
Do you know where you're going?

622
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,110
Either way, we're just going up!

623
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,320
Right, Lucario?

624
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,190
For now.

625
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,060
All right!

626
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,810
Ah, Satoshi!

627
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,480
What are those?

628
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,770
Survey modules.

629
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,380
Survey modules?

630
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,460
I'm gathering more data around here.

631
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,190
Banks, time for work.

632
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,040
Wake up.

633
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,230
I've been waiting, my lady.

634
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,860
Look.

635
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,450
The Tree of World's Origin has, for thousands...

636
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:04,210
No, for tens of thousands of years, protected Pokemon here from outside interference.

637
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,210
Congratulations on the new discovery.

638
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,650
Save the celebrations for when we solve everything.

639
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:10,380
Yes, ma'am.

640
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,890
I'm counting on you to analyze the data.

641
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,190
As you wish.

642
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,650
I'm getting excited!

643
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:17,680
Me too!

644
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,570
I'm getting pretty excited too!

645
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,090
This is a treasure mountain swarming with rare Pokemon!

646
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,040
No, an underground treasure!

647
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,670
This stone mountain is alive!

648
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:31,900
It is a mineral lifeform created by nature.

649
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:38,260
The Tree of World's Origin has been living off of light energy for tens of thousands of years.

650
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:40,710
An amazing discovery!

651
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,570
Yeah.

652
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:43,450
But...

653
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,020
The mystery hasn't been solved yet.

654
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:51,920
Mew must have some connection to the Tree of World's Origin.

655
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,330
Hey!

656
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,810
Pikachu!

657
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:23,100
I'm over here!

658
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,630
What?

659
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,050
Pikachu!

660
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:39,310
If you're there, answer!

661
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,870
Pikachu!

662
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,620
Pikachu!

663
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:53,570
Pikachu!

664
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,060
I'm coming now!

665
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:11,650
Regice!

666
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,130
We're not enemies!

667
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:20,740
We're only here to look for a friend!

668
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,860
It doesn't look like someone you can convince.

669
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,580
Let's go back!

670
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,210
Lucario!

671
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,880
What's going on...

672
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:43,310
Everyone, run!

673
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,440
What's wrong?

674
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,380
It's Regice!

675
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:51,060
It's here!

676
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,170
We'll find another path!

677
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:03,740
In here!

678
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:18,880
Someone!

679
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:20,660
Save us!

680
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,600
Team Rocket?

681
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,250
I don't care if it's brat boy or whatever!

682
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,020
Do something about those guys!

683
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:41,590
Everyone, this way!

684
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:47,020
Registeel's here too!

685
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,730
That's...

686
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,870
Musashi! Kojiro!

687
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,460
Musashi, wait up!

688
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,820
Geez, you're such a slowpoke.

689
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,370
I'll leave you behind!

690
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:23,340
Behind you!

691
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,910
Now wait here.

692
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:28,060
Come on, we're not kids.

693
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,260
That won't...

694
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,300
W-What's this?!

695
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,700
Go, Sabonea!

696
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:41,180
Sabonea, Pin Missile!

697
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,080
It didn't work?

698
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:48,740
What's that?!

699
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,870
I really don't like this feeling!

700
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,080
Musashi!

701
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,520
Kojiro...

702
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,400
Chiriin!

703
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,180
Get away from here!

704
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,490
What's going on here?

705
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:26,730
They're here again!

706
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:43,480
It's coming!

707
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,210
Now, while we still have time!

708
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,130
Okay.

709
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,980
Banks, what is this?

710
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:12,020
This is likely what can be seen as the Tree of World's Origin's immune system.

711
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:15,820
It's trying to get rid of the bacteria inside it.

712
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:17,430
Bacteria?

713
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,800
You mean us?

714
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,230
No way!

715
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:23,250
That's the proof that this Tree of World's Origin is alive.

716
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,840
Banks, find an escape route for us.

717
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,760
I am.

718
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:33,920
Wait for a little longer.

719
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:38,860
Watch out!

720
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:42,850
Lucario!

721
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,570
Pokemon aren't treated as bacteria.

722
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,790
I'll hold them back.

723
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,880
Kid-san, take care of everyone.

724
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,260
I got it.

725
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,210
That way!

726
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,370
Lucario.

727
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,510
Until you meet with Pikachu...

728
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,670
I'll stay with you.

729
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,220
Thanks.

730
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:29,760
Jupitol, Bullet Seed!

731
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,170
Heigani, Bubblebeam!

732
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,070
All right.

733
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:37,850
Let's go!

734
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,550
This way, this way!

735
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:22,880
What?

736
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,600
Masato!

737
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,170
Onee-chan!

738
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,330
You guys, run!

739
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,170
Takeshi!

740
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,180
Masato!

741
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:12,000
Everyone, come out!

742
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,600
How horrible...

743
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:53,350
Pikachu's voice!

744
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:58,920
Satoshi?

745
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:18,830
Pikachu!

746
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:38,190
Pikachu!

747
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:39,420
Wait right there!

748
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,560
Pikachu!

749
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:50,730
Kid-san!

750
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:55,760
Pikachu!

751
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:57,710
Satoshi!

752
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:02,410
I met up with Pikachu.

753
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:05,350
Pikachu, this is Lucario.

754
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,560
He guided us all the way here.

755
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,030
Mew!

756
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:17,180
Mew just wanted to play!

757
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:17,980
Nyasu!

758
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:25,220
Thanks.

759
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,250
Regice.

760
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,130
We should get out of here.

761
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:35,690
Let's go!

762
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:36,260
Heigani!

763
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:36,770
Jupitol!

764
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,590
Kid-san, what about the others?

765
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,500
Everyone was sucked up by those things...

766
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,440
Musashi and Kojiro too?

767
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:57,390
Oh no!

768
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,170
This way!

769
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:16,150
My lady, the escape route is right above you!

770
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:16,790
Roger!

771
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,150
Sunlight!

772
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,130
We'll make it!

773
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,470
It's above this!

774
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:35,930
Lucario!

775
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,480
Satoshi.

776
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,950
You guys get out of here.

777
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,480
Pikachu, sorry.

778
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,250
Just when I met up with you...

779
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:05,790
This tree sees us as intruders...

780
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:13,770
Satoshi!

781
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,080
Pikachu!

782
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:17,920
Okay!

783
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:20,840
Okay, I got it!

784
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:40,420
Kid-san, just what...

785
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:45,200
Mew told the tree that you guys weren't bacteria.

786
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:45,870
Mew did?

787
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:51,510
This Tree of World's Origin and Mew share their powers

788
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,200
and live together in symbiosis.

789
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,180
Mew.

790
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,080
Thanks.

791
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:07,800
Mew!

792
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,430
He's heating up.

793
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:22,900
Just when I thought we were saved...

794
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,080
Doesn't this seem kind of bad?

795
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,600
Let's find Nyasu and get out of here!

796
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,500
OW!!

797
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,270
Kojiro?

798
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:42,490
Everyone, come back!

799
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,010
My lady.

800
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:49,850
There is an abnormality in the Tree of World's Origin's life signs.

801
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,520
It seems so.

802
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,350
There's a disturbance in its energy flow.

803
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:55,830
What do you mean?

804
01:22:55,830 --> 01:23:01,170
The sudden activity within the immune system might have caused a great deal of damage.

805
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:04,520
At this rate, if the energy flow stops,

806
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,780
the Tree of World's Origin will collapse!

807
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:36,060
My Queen, are you all right?

808
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,610
I am fine.

809
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:38,980
But...

810
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,340
I'm worried about the children.

811
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:48,000
Mew and the Tree of World's Origin are one.

812
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,060
That's why when the tree is weak,

813
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,110
Mew is also...

814
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:57,240
Is he telling us to come with him?

815
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:35,820
This is...

816
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,720
Could it be?

817
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,540
Aaron-sama!

818
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,700
This is...

819
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,700
I see!

820
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:03,150
Aaron came here by himself after sealing away Lucario.

821
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,180
This has to be the Tree of World's Origin's heart.

822
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:16,480
A Time flower.

823
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:26,410
Come out, Mew!

824
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:39,130
Mew.

825
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:42,280
I know that you and this tree are one.

826
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,910
Please, lend me your power!

827
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,950
The Wave is within me!

828
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:56,860
Take my Wave!

829
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:28,930
Aaron sacrificed his own life to stop the fight.

830
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:31,030
So this was the truth.

831
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,540
Aaron-sama.

832
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:52,050
You want me to use my power to save the tree this time?

833
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,250
All right, I'll...

834
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,530
Wait, Lucario.

835
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:03,560
If you use your Wave here, then you'll follow the same fate as Aaron did.

836
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:05,630
I know.

837
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,540
Lucario.

838
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,520
The Wave is within me!

839
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:25,300
My Wave isn't enough by itself?

840
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,380
If my Wave is the same as Aaron's, then...

841
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,140
What?

842
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:37,290
I should be able to do it too...

843
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,630
Don't, Satoshi!

844
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,480
If you do this, then you'll also...

845
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:49,540
If we don't do this now, then this tree will collapse,

846
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:51,520
and all the Pokemon below will die!

847
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:54,570
Satoshi...

848
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:56,880
I'll do whatever I can!

849
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,470
Leave the rest to me!

850
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,910
Lucario!

851
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:53,380
The Wave is within me!

852
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:28,800
Thanks, Mew.

853
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:32,450
That's good.

854
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:33,730
You're all better!

855
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,210
The tree's life signs have returned to normal.

856
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:42,840
Everything's fine now.

857
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:43,670
Yeah.

858
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:47,260
Banks, keep everything here confidential.

859
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:48,810
You won't publicize it?

860
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,540
Put it away carefully.

861
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,610
As you wish.

862
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:57,430
Lucario!

863
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,160
Satoshi...

864
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:02,860
Lucario.

865
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,410
Lucario.

866
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:30,800
I'm sorry.

867
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,120
Aaron-sama.

868
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:35,530
I didn't...

869
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:37,790
I didn't have a choice but to seal you away.

870
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:40,840
If I hadn't...

871
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,610
You would've followed me no matter what...

872
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:48,440
...and followed the same fate as me.

873
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,430
Of course!

874
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:52,970
Meaningless fights...

875
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:55,360
and throwing away lives...

876
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,730
Just myself will be enough.

877
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:05,480
But...

878
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,890
I have no regrets.

879
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:09,930
In that castle...

880
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:16,190
I was able to live such beautiful days with you and Leen-sama.

881
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,910
That's what it means to live.

882
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:27,150
I doubted you...

883
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,780
Thank you...

884
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:32,770
Lucario.

885
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:36,910
Every day I spent with you...

886
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,270
was a lot of fun...

887
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,590
Aaron-sama!

888
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:44,430
Lucario.

889
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,030
If I could, once more...

890
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,520
I'd like to see you one more time.

891
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,070
My friend...

892
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:08,310
Aaron-sama!

893
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:12,470
I was foolish.

894
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:13,650
Lucario.

895
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:14,730
That's not it!

896
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:17,530
You're a great Wave-user!

897
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:18,450
Satoshi.

898
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:22,980
Lucario!

899
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,130
Hang in there!

900
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:25,110
Don't die!

901
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:28,170
I won't be dying.

902
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:33,030
I'll be... going back to Aaron-sama's... side...

903
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,240
Hey, everyone!

904
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:13,110
Satoshi!

905
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,590
Pikachu!

906
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:15,580
Kid-san!

907
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:19,690
You made it out okay!

908
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:20,160
Yeah!

909
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:23,000
Kid-sama, I'm so glad you're safe!

910
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,750
Where's Lucario?

911
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:31,830
He...

912
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:35,720
He went back to his friend's side.

913
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:37,760
Did he...

914
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,570
It can't be...

915
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,330
The Wave is within me.

916
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,600

To the other end of that sky

936
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,510
Lucario managed to meet Aaron.
