1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,794
Stand up, asshole.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,868
I don't want any trouble.
Leave me alone.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,773
I can kick your ass while you're sitting
down or standing up. It's your call.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,110
Fuck his shit up, Raymond.
Yeah.

5
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:15,813
You might remember him as Bad Ass,

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:19,283
the bearded hero who stood up
for an elderly gentleman...

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,651
on an S.C. Transit bus...

8
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,221
and became an overnight
Internet sensation.

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:30,595
Because of his heroic efforts, Vega was made
an honorary police officer this morning.

Mmm. Mmm.

12
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,349
Oh, God, you're better than
an alarm clock, Baxter.

13
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,419
Mmm. Good boy. Good boy.

14
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,155
Good boy. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,791
Enough kisses.

16
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,493
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi!

17
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,421
Goddamn.

18
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,224
Hey, okay!

19
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,792
Cut the crap out, boy.

20
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,429
No need to get your nuts in my face.
Damn.

21
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,932
You know what?
There's a pharmacy two doors down.

22
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:24,569
They started selling hearing aids.
You oughta get yourself some.

23
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,537
Having a sale this week
on Depends.

24
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,940
Your chance to stock up
so you don't crap yourself.

25
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,710
Wow, Bernie. That's the nicest thing
you've said to me in three years.

26
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,846
Yeah. You goddamn welcome. Shit.

27
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,995
Stay in the middle.
That's it.

28
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,998
Watch it. There we go.
Right there.

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,734
Defense! Defense!
That's it. That's it.

30
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,503
Stay up there.
That's it. That's it.

31
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,573
Let's go. Let's go to the
body now. Come on.

32
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,875
Do some body work.
Do some body work.

33
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,010
Let's go! Body!

34
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,679
Body. That's it.
That's it. That's it.

35
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,413
That's it. Okay.

36
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:14,885
All right, Manny.
Two jabs and a right hand.

37
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,288
Oh! Oh, shit.

38
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,924
Damn, Manny.
You tore his head off.

39
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,395
Salts.

40
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:35,573
Jesus Christ, Frank.
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:37,975
Come on.

42
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,477
Come on, Raymond.
Hey!

43
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,513
Is he all right?
Yeah, yeah. He's okay.

44
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,749
Come on, Raymond.
You all right?

45
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,818
Come on.

46
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:51,555
I think I'm gonna stick
with Ping-Pong.

47
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,358
No, you'll be all right.

48
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,663
- Round one begins.
- Now, check this out.

49
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,998
Look. Look right there.
Look. See?

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,501
See how he favors his right?

51
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,502
He does it every time.

52
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,905
You gotta make him use his left.
That'll open him up.

53
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,274
That's what she said.

54
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:14,512
Aw, come on, Frank.
We watched this, like, 23 times.

55
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,579
I got this.

56
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,815
Alvarez doesn't have
a chance on Saturday.

57
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,619
But remember, you can...
...never be too prepared.

58
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,454
I know.

59
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:26,824
I got something for you.

60
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:31,862
Oh, Manny, you didn't
have to get me anything.

61
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,665
Just wanna say thank you
for helping me get here.

62
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,401
I never thought I'd have
a chance to turn pro.

63
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,437
Hmm. It's wrapped
and everything, huh?

64
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,106
Shut up.
Just open it.

65
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,577
Oh, man.

66
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,946
Now, what the hell
am I gonna do with this?

67
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,915
Well, I don't know.
How about everything?

68
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,351
It's time you joined
the rest of the world.

69
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,086
Hey. I'm 68 years old.

70
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,089
I've gotten along without
one of these up until now.

71
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,591
Besides, this must've
cost you a bundle.

72
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,862
How did you afford it?
Just saved up for it.

73
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,799
I gotta jump.

74
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,569
You got a date?
Something like that.

75
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,137
Um, I forgot.

76
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,972
I put something on there for you.

77
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,109
Just turn it on there
and... and tap the screen.

78
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,012
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right. Get some sleep.

79
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,154
Hey, Frank.
Pretty nice, huh?

80
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,089
Now you won't have
to freak out anymore

81
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,491
when you can't find a pay phone.

82
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,761
So I just wanted...

83
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:41,365
to say thank you
for being there for me...

84
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:46,904
and for believing in me
when nobody else would.

85
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,641
I don't know where I'd be
if it wasn't for you.

86
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,111
You've been like
a second dad to me.

87
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,416
And I love you.

88
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,686
I love you too, mi hijo.

89
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,945
Manny! Hey!

90
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,981
Adolfo. Purvis. Drake.
What's up, brothers?

91
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,951
I just got your text.
Got here as quick as I could.

92
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,052
Came from across town.

93
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:40,458
Oh. Muchas gracias.
I really appreciate that.

94
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,692
So, uh,

95
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,060
maybe you could help me out here,

96
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,830
but I'm a little confused
about something.

97
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:50,100
Um, have we not taken care of you?

98
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:53,103
Yes, of course.
Oh.

99
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:56,073
So why do you take from me?

100
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,043
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,277
Come... Please.

102
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,713
Come on.
Don't insult Adolfo.

103
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,917
Look, I'd rather you stick a
needle in my eye than insult me.

104
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:11,689
So I'm gonna give you one more
chance to answer correctly.

105
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:16,961
And you'll feel liberated, which is
a wonderful thing to feel, Manny,

106
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,129
before you die.

107
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:34,945
It's just you and me now.

108
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:45,022
Oh, goddamn it. Miro la
concha de tu hermana.

109
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,057
Seriously?

110
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,727
My bad.

111
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,862
Let's get the hell out of here.

112
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,897
Look...

113
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,900
Don't just leave him there.
Pick him up!

114
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,202
What the hell are you thinking?

115
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:19,290
Hey, Malark.
Come by for a beer?

116
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,725
Frank, I'm sorry.

117
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,594
It's Manny.

118
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:56,327
They were two peas in a pod.

119
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,195
I'm sorry?

120
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,931
Manny and his dad.

121
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,667
They were inseparable.

122
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:08,205
Once his dad passed away,

123
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,608
his world shattered.

124
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,111
And then you came along.

125
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,980
You changed his world.

126
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,715
He was a great kid.

127
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,116
Mommy.

128
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,286
Will you play Barbies with me?

129
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,954
Oh, honey.

130
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,924
Not now, okay?
Maybe later.

131
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:31,095
Hey, you know, I've played
a few Barbies in my day.

132
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,396
Can I play?

133
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,999
Okay, I'll be the purple one?
Mm-hmm.

134
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,667
Okay. Come on.

135
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,135
Is this like Mermaid Barbie?

136
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,005
Uh-huh.
You want anything?

137
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,874
One, two,

138
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,977
three, four,

139
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,246
five, six,

140
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,049
seven, eight...

141
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,385
Don't peek! Don't peek!

142
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,354
Okay.
My eyes are closed tight.

143
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,390
Nine, 10.

144
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,792
Here I come, ready or not.

145
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,162
Where's Julia?

146
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,365
Okay. Where is...
I hear something.

147
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,436
Uh-oh. I hear something.

148
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,138
Where is she?

149
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,407
Where is she?

150
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,009
Ah! There she is.
No fair.

151
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,212
I wouldn't have found you
if you had a secret door.

152
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,716
I want a secret door.
Please!

153
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,751
Well, we'll have
to talk to your mom.

154
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:28,986
Talk to your mom about what?

155
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,189
A secret door, Mommy.
It's great for hide-and-go-seek.

156
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,460
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I was the hit of the neighborhood.

157
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,796
Well, that sounds like fun.

158
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:42,266
Thank you, Mommy!

159
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:52,409
That's the first time I've seen
her smile since it happened.

160
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,145
That's a wonderful little girl.

161
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:01,452
You're gonna find the animals
who killed my baby, aren't you?

162
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,856
The police are doing everything they...
No, they're not.

163
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:10,127
Mrs. Parkes...
I know who you are, Mr. Vega.

164
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,098
What happened to you on that
bus wasn't an accident.

165
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,769
You were meant to do good in a
city that desperately needs it.

166
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:23,507
You know, I... I've got to go.
I have to... I have to go.

167
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,909
Good night, Mrs. Parkes.

168
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,340
Hey, Bernie, you all right?

169
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,544
You all right?

170
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,279
Don't you got enough
to worry about...

171
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:39,516
than to come in here
and meddle in my business, huh?

172
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,154
You know,

173
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,857
they got medication
for that problem of yours.

174
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,025
Boy, what you know
about my problem?

175
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:52,496
I know that you haven't been out of
this place since I've lived here.

176
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,933
They call that agoraphobia.

177
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,569
I know.
I... I googled it.

178
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,604
So all of a sudden you a doctor.

179
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,340
Where you study...
Tijuana Tech?

180
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:08,145
Why don't you just get yourself
out of here and don't come back.

181
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,546
Go find yourself another store.

182
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,648
Hands up!

183
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:16,286
Hey, get the hell out of my store
before I blast all of you!

184
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,888
Feisty old bastard, huh?

185
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,356
We ain't got no money.
Just get out of here.

186
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,925
We'll forget the whole thing ever happened.
Or what?

187
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,460
You're gonna run me over
with your walker?

188
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:27,130
Open the damn register, Morgan Freeman.
Screw you!

189
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,266
You wanna be a hero, too, gramps?
Oh, no.

190
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:33,971
All right, back the fuck up then.
I got you. Okay, okay. Sorry.

191
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:11,909
Bernie!
Bernie, you all right?

192
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:16,613
I didn't need your help.

193
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,316
Aw, you could've fooled me.

194
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:34,231
All good.
Thank you.

195
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,701
What is it with you
and liquor stores?

196
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,404
It's just not a good mix.

197
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:42,572
This one wasn't worth it, is it?

198
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,542
Grumpy old son of a bitch.
If you damn fools would
patrol the neighborhood...

199
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:49,513
instead of stuffin' your faces
with pastry every now and then,

200
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,148
this crap wouldn't happen!

201
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,684
You heard anything about Manny?

202
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,720
No. But we know
it was drug related.

203
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,588
No way. Not Manny.
Not drug related.

204
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,993
Frank, we found 300 Hapacol pills on
his body the night that he was killed.

205
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,763
That's five grand street value.
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,300
But it looks like
he was a major seller.

207
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,175
All right, everybody, listen up!

208
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:21,311
Hey, everybody!

209
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,479
Get in here.

210
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,183
What's up, man?
Come on. Listen up!

211
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,251
If I catch anybody here...

212
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,187
making, selling or using drugs,

213
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,291
I will personally break both your
legs and use your arms as crutches.

214
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,560
Now, do you hear me?

215
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,696
- Now, do you hear me?
- Yes!

216
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,466
Drugs are for losers.

217
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,135
Only winners come in here.

218
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,038
Don't make me say it again.

219
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,440
Tucson, come on.

220
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,752
Sit down.

221
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:07,224
All right, let's have it.
What?

222
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,725
Don't bullshit me.

223
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,227
How long was Manny dealing?

224
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,596
I swear, Coach. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

225
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:18,201
Manny would've never got involved in
any of that stuff. You know that.

226
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:22,639
You better not be lying to me.
I'm not lying.

227
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,676
Go on. Get out of here.
Yes, sir.

228
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,428
Yeah?
Ginobli.

229
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,126
Coach?

230
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:52,796
Expecting a cold?

231
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,532
Look...
Coach, I can explain, man.

232
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,469
Please don't break my legs.
Please don't break my legs.

233
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,405
How long was Manny selling?
I don't know.

234
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,307
I'm running real thin on patience.

235
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,379
How long was he selling?
Okay, okay. A few months.

236
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,348
But he was only doing it
to support his family.

237
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,917
He was gonna quit once he
turned pro this weekend.

238
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,852
Man, he didn't want you to know.

239
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,355
He knew how disappointed you'd be.

240
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,624
And what about you?

241
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:26,229
Come on.

242
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,231
Where we going?
To see your friends.

243
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,334
Wait, wait. No. No,
I can't, man. They'll kill me.

244
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,369
Uh, no, they won't.
Why not?

245
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,606
Because if you don't take me
to 'em, I will kill you first.

246
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,475
Now come on.

247
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:45,682
You sure I need
to be here for this?

248
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,551
Step back.

249
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,522
Oh, shit!

250
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:11,508
Hey, hey, we're pacifists.
And vegans.

251
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:32,596
No...

252
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,231
No, no.

253
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:51,548
All right, listen up, gentlemen.

254
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,584
Anybody in here
tries to get in touch...

255
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,852
with my friend, Mr. Tucson...

256
00:20:55,854 --> 00:21:00,557
either by phone, text,
e-mail or Instagram...

257
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,593
or any other form
of communication...

258
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:05,962
I'll kill you.

259
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,331
Now, do we understand each other?

260
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:14,704
Okay. I'll take that as a "Yes,
Mr. Vega, we understand."

261
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,508
Come on, Tucson. Let's go.
Coming.

262
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,696
Well, no.

263
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,064
Not exactly to that extent.

264
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,901
But what I can tell you is that
we are making great strides...

265
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:49,706
implementing safety and law
enforcement measures to...

266
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,940
How should I say it?

267
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,043
Preserve peace
and extend the lives...

268
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,046
of the citizens
of our great country.

269
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:57,414
Ah, hijo mío, Adolfo.

270
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,549
I want you to meet the senator and
his lovely wife, Mrs. Raskin.

271
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,673
This is my son, Adolfo.

272
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:03,453
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Senator. Mrs. Raskin.

273
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,824
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I
need to speak to you in private.

274
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,959
Es importante.
Of course.

275
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,663
Please excuse me
for just one moment.

276
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,598
I do apologize.

277
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,906
Shut up!

278
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,656
You've given me a place to go...

279
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,126
and a reason
to get up in the morning.

280
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,429
You've been like
a second dad to me.

281
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:22,499
And I love you.

282
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,711
Bernie!

283
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,479
Hey, come on! Open up!

284
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,882
I... I wanna buy a case!

285
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,917
Bernie!

286
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,254
Aw, sh... Hey!

287
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,923
Come on!
Are you in there?

288
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:49,192
Bernie!

289
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,629
I'll take my business
somewhere else!

290
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:57,901
Bitch. Damn.

291
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,046
Hey!

292
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:15,084
One, two, three,
four assholes in front of me.

293
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,922
Five, six...
I'd better find a big stick.

294
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,461
This smart-ass is him.

295
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,698
Hey. Didn't I beat your ass,
like, a few days ago?

296
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,867
You made a big mistake
by coming over.

297
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,937
Next time I'll bring a dessert.

298
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:37,674
Smart-ass old bastard.

299
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:39,709
Hell of a way to go out.

300
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:44,581
You know, your boy Manny, he went
out crying like a little bitch.

301
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,191
Get up!

302
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,535
Clear out, guys.

303
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,076
It's time to meet
your maker, old man.

304
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,245
You okay, Vega?

305
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:52,882
I didn't need your help.

306
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:56,252
You could've fooled me.

307
00:25:58,722 --> 00:26:00,056
Come on.

308
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,991
Yeah, here we go.

309
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:23,913
You broke my fucking ribs.

310
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,082
Okay, who killed Manny?

311
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,651
Fuck you.

312
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,088
Fuck me?

313
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,299
Who killed Manny?

314
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,370
Stop!

315
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,740
You're a little sensitive there.

316
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:53,676
All right, now, who killed Manny?

317
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,279
Okay!

318
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,914
God... Stop!

319
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,949
Okay, okay.
It was Adolfo.

320
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:05,421
It was Adolfo.
He ordered the hit.

321
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,358
Where can I find Adolfo?

322
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,994
Fuck you.

323
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:19,268
Oh, God.

324
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,803
Don't.

325
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,238
I don't know.

326
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,042
I don't know, man.
I don't know. Shit.

327
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,378
I guess he couldn't
take the ribbing.

328
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:34,917
There were two things
I was good at growing up.

329
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:38,287
Hockey and fighting.

330
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,623
Hockey?

331
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,693
Yeah, hockey, fool.

332
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,261
You have a problem with that?

333
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,429
No. I mean, I just never seen...

334
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,933
A black man play hockey? I had to
deal with that shit my whole life.

335
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,301
Nobody wanted to see it,

336
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:58,041
so I had to fight my way all the
way up to the minor leagues.

337
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,779
Had at least two fights a night...

338
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:05,048
with some honky...

339
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:10,887
who didn't like colored
folks on the ice.

340
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:14,357
Yeah.

341
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,295
And then the day
I dreamed of finally came.

342
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:23,766
I was gonna get called up
to... to the big leagues.

343
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:27,036
I was gonna be
the first African-American...

344
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,906
to play in the N.H.L.

345
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,742
And just like that,

346
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,812
it was over.

347
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,949
In my final minor league game...

348
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:40,917
with the Quebec Mounties,

349
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,022
the Cracker brothers blindside
checked me into the boards...

350
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,393
and blew out my knee.

351
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:54,430
I never played again.

352
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:57,934
My life was never the same.

353
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:01,537
At least you walked away
with your health.

354
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,073
Well, I don't...
I don't have that either.

355
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:09,979
Yeah, I've got some rare liver
disease that no one ever heard of.

356
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,013
Doctors are confused.

357
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:15,017
I'm too old to be on
a donor list for a transplant.

358
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:20,957
And, uh...
So I got six months tops.

359
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,059
I'm sorry, Bernie.

360
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,129
What you sorry about?
It wasn't your fault.

361
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,265
I'll be fine. Yeah.

362
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:34,237
The way you going, you'll
be dead before me anyhow.

363
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,307
Yeah.

364
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,977
Why'd you help me?

365
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,546
I owed you one.

366
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,349
Now... Now we're even.

367
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,118
I sure appreciate it.

368
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,353
And I'm impressed.

369
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,121
You finally got out of your place.

370
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,158
Yeah, well, it's about time
I changed my life.

371
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,463
Yeah, I figure, what do
I got to lose, right?

372
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,265
Yeah.

373
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:05,434
Manny was a good kid.

374
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:08,337
Don't see that a lot.

375
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,809
So, you gonna find this Adolfo?

376
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:15,812
Oh, yeah.

377
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,447
Need a hand?

378
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:24,086
Could always use an extra one.
Good.

379
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:28,825
So let's go get
those son of a bitches.

380
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,413
Boy, what the hell you got on?

381
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:28,184
You look like
a Guatemalan tourist.

382
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,921
Well, rather that than a
walking billboard for 7UP.

383
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,257
And what you got in that packet?

384
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,625
Oranges and Chiclets?

385
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,526
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

386
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,996
Here. I got a fanny pack
for you too.

387
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:44,066
Not me. You keep that for yourself.
I ain't putting that on.

388
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:52,308
Whoo.

389
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:56,012
Whose is this?

390
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,949
It's mine.
Who the hell you think it is?

391
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:03,619
"Whose is this?"

392
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:10,693
I would've thought D.M.V. took
away your license by now.

393
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,329
They did.

394
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,936
Come on, baby.

395
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:25,675
Well, what you expect?

396
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:30,246
It's been 25 years since I
been down in this shithole.

397
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,269
Goddamn.

398
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:57,606
I've forgotten how uncomfortable
the damn city bus is.

399
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:00,076
Damn hemorrhoids
is flaring up. Shit.

400
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,678
Come on. Come on.
Just walk it off.

401
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:10,720
Now what, Kojak?

402
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,422
We get 'em to let us in.

403
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,667
What's next?

404
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,637
Uh...

405
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,773
Oh. Here.

406
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,041
Hello.

407
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,582
Damn.
Age before beauty.

408
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:44,053
What now?

409
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,755
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

410
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,591
No need to always get violent.

411
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:04,306
Ah. Looks like they knew
you were coming.

412
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,475
What's the next move, Columbo?

413
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:10,413
Listen, Carmen.
You're gonna help me.

414
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,414
I can't do it, Frank.

415
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,583
The last time I helped you,
it almost cost me my job.

416
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,453
And as of today, I have 17 years,

417
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,555
62 days, 14 hours,

418
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,090
32 minutes and 55 seconds...

419
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:25,494
before I retire and receive my
extraordinarily fat pension.

420
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:26,762
You will not mess that up.

421
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:30,766
Carmen, sweetheart, look,
you will help me because...

422
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,776
Franklin, don't start
nothing you can't finish.

423
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:45,081
You know this booty can go two or three
rounds before I really get started.

424
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,550
And if you're good,
you can bring your friend.

425
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,252
I like threesomes.

426
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:53,389
Carmen.

427
00:34:55,725 --> 00:34:57,726
He was like a son to me.

428
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:02,631
He was gonna do big things.

429
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,534
They took his life.

430
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:07,636
I can't let 'em
get away with that.

431
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,473
And neither would you.

432
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,346
I mean it, Frank. You cannot take
any of this stuff out of here.

433
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,814
Don't do like you did last time.

434
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,383
Do not take
this stuff out of here.

435
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,818
God, I love you, Carmen.

436
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,787
Well, I'll leave my door
open this evening...

437
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,389
so you can show me
just how much you love me.

438
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,192
And bring Green Machine with you.

439
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:33,729
I told you about that outfit.

440
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:39,201
Look. He's got a pickup
from some guy named Hammer.

441
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,669
Yeah, I see.

442
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,205
And here's his address.

443
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,508
Hmm.

444
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:27,449
Holy shit. Hey, fellas,
this is E.B.M., not A.A.R.P.

445
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,585
We're looking for Hammer.

446
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:33,689
He's busy right now.

447
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,691
Well, you best tell us
where he is...

448
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,195
before I put my foot up your ass.

449
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:42,198
I thought you said there
was no need for violence.

450
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,800
Different situation,
different measures.

451
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,435
Listen, Social Security.

452
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,939
This is a fraternity rush party
for freshman students...

453
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,575
in the year 2014, not 1932.

454
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,678
So if I were you, I would get
the hell off my property...

455
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,280
before I put my foot up your ass.

456
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:03,919
Where's Hammer?

457
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,789
Okay, okay, okay.
He's, uh... He's... He's...

458
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:10,960
Upstairs, third floor,
room five. Room five!

459
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,730
See? It wasn't that hard, was it?

460
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:09,318
Fuck off! I'm busy!

461
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:14,723
I'm here for a pickup!

462
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,293
Screw you!

463
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,496
What the hell?

464
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,632
- You Hammer?
- Get the hell out of here!

465
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,008
Hey, little lady.
What's your major?

466
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:43,619
Where can I find Adolfo?

467
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,753
Fuck you.

468
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,457
Didn't anybody teach you
to respect your elders?

469
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,001
Okay.

470
00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:02,938
Let's take a little off the top.
Where can I find Adolfo?

471
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,810
So I'll probably score a double
major and graduate in five.

472
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,712
I mean, what's the rush, right?

473
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,015
The real world's
not going anywhere.

474
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,018
I couldn't agree with you more.

475
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,786
I'd do the same thing.

476
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:21,757
Don't! Help!

477
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,592
Okay, okay, okay.

478
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,061
He has a beach... He has a
beach house in Malibu.

479
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:29,965
- Okay. Where in Malibu?
- I don't know!

480
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,033
Okay.

481
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,970
No! It's called...

482
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,772
It's called Villa Costa
or some shit.

483
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,775
But he's only there on weekends.
Just stop!

484
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,548
Nice cut.
Mazeltov.

485
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,551
Give me that.

486
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,863
Hey, Bernie!

487
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,564
I like you, Bernie.

488
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,834
I like you in that "I've
never had a father figure,

489
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,870
so now I'm trying
to overcompensate...

490
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,506
by getting with an older
man" type of way.

491
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,409
Bernie, let's go!

492
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,077
Okay!

493
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,947
I'm sorry.

494
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,417
I gotta run, Jessica.

495
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,152
Oh, so soon?

496
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,090
Well, Facebook me!

497
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,454
We got big issues.

498
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,656
You're interrupting Adolfo
during his me time.

499
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:01,957
Not in the mood
for issues, Big Black.

500
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:06,895
And you know I wouldn't if it wasn't
important, but this shit's important.

501
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,163
Okay. Come on.
Out with it.

502
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:12,701
Looks like one of our highest profiting
distributors just shut down today.

503
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,235
Sorry?

504
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,104
That old dude came in and kicked
the shit out of everybody.

505
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,106
What old dude?
You know.

506
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,875
The old dude.
Bad Ass.

507
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,611
I thought we had eliminated him.

508
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,979
We almost did.

509
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,082
Then some other old dude
came in and...

510
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:28,851
What? Came in and what?

511
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,552
Came in and kind of
kicked all our asses.

512
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:35,858
Excuse me? You're saying a couple of old
dudes beat the shit out of our guys?

513
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,759
Yeah. But they're not
your typical old guys.

514
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,595
Trust me.
They're more like bad asses.

515
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,763
I don't fucking care who they are!

516
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:49,571
Okay, well, this is simple.

517
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,707
If you can't take out
a couple of geriatrics,

518
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,976
then I'll bring in
someone else who will.

519
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,845
And then I'll have them kill you.

520
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,580
That sound fair? Huh?

521
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,250
Now, you're cutting
into my seaweed-wrap hour,

522
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,086
so get the fuck out of my face.

523
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:16,999
Hey. Did somebody call
for a secret door?

524
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,601
Yay!

525
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:24,306
So I put all your apps
in their own personal folder.

526
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,842
- What's that?
- The family tracker app.

527
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,277
I linked it with my mom's phone...

528
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,879
so you can always know
that we're safe and sound.

529
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,950
My brother used
to do that with us.

530
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:41,823
Look, your brother
really loved you,

531
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:47,729
and just because you can't see
him doesn't mean he's not here.

532
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,931
So you got to remember...

533
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,867
that no matter what you do
or where you go,

534
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,003
he'll always be watching over you.

535
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:57,940
Really?

536
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,775
Really.

537
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,310
Knock, knock.

538
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,878
Hey there.

539
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,981
I thought you two might be thirsty.
Perfect.

540
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,650
So, how's it coming along?

541
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,686
We're ready for the big unveiling.

542
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,688
Come on.
Ooh!

543
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:15,023
Voilà!
Oh, wow!

544
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,758
It's so cool!
I love it.

545
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,962
I exactly know where I'm
gonna put my Barbie jumper,

546
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,965
my American Girl
and my Blue's Clues!

547
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,134
So cool.

548
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:31,006
Okay, you've got
a broken head gasket,

549
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:35,877
three dead spark plugs, a
busted radiator and no gas.

550
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,380
- And what about this gun?
- Boy, put that back.

551
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:42,217
I'm not even sure
that thing even works anymore.

552
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,219
Yeah, that's what she said.

553
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:51,159
Okay, so besides everything you
said, what kind of shape's it in?

554
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:56,231
Look, Coach, it's a lot of work.
It's gonna take some time.

555
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,867
Well, get to it.

556
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,104
Yeah. Get to it.

557
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:05,240
I guess I'll get to it.

558
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,386
Yeah, I don't get it.

559
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,787
What's that?

560
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,256
That... That's not a child.

561
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:24,860
I mean, why you putting
that dog in a day care?

562
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,863
Well, Baxter's more
than just a dog.

563
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,131
He's my best friend.

564
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:32,267
Best friend, my ass. In Korea,
they'd be eatin' him right now.

565
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,137
Don't listen to him, Baxter.

566
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,772
He's got emotional issues.

567
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:40,175
Yeah, that's for sure.

568
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,177
Aw, shit.

569
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,912
Ooh.

570
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,717
You all right?

571
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,253
Yeah, I'm fine.

572
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,156
Lasts a couple of minutes,

573
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:57,459
then... I'm good as new. Okay.

574
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:03,298
You know, they got people all
over that'll... donate like a...

575
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:06,368
kidney or lung or something, man.

576
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,870
Man, I'll give you a
piece of my liver.

577
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,073
Who you... You kidding?

578
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:14,443
Yeah, you think I want
a 69-year-old...

579
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,079
tequila-soaked organ of yours?

580
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,916
And forget about six months.
I'll be dying in six weeks.

581
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:32,928
- You okay?
- What?

582
00:45:34,497 --> 00:45:36,431
Baxter.

583
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:56,284
Yeah.

584
00:45:56,286 --> 00:46:01,089
If it's any consolation,
mine looks worse.

585
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,258
This is all that's left.

586
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:06,394
Drink up.

587
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:11,266
Yeah.

588
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,903
I'm assuming you got some
good insurance coverage.

589
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,973
I got insurance.
I don't know how good.

590
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,909
What are you doin', Frank?

591
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:22,911
Hey.

592
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:26,948
I'm not in the mood for a Malark
lecture right now. All right?

593
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,450
Oh, yeah?

594
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,852
Well, the people you're dealing
with are extremely dangerous.

595
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:33,121
You're lucky you weren't
here when it happened.

596
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,991
Not to mention those kids.

597
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,159
It's a sign, Frank.

598
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,428
Leave it alone and let
Homicide deal with it.

599
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,497
Actually, Officer,

600
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,332
it was my fault.

601
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,400
Excuse me?

602
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:49,871
Uh, yeah.
You see, it was my idea.

603
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,309
And my man Frank here, he was
just along for the ride.

604
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:59,214
Are you kidding me? You're teaming
up with the grumpy old man?

605
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,016
I'm not that grumpy.

606
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,185
He's gotten less grumpy.
Okay.

607
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,953
Just lay off the case.
You hear me?

608
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:09,291
I don't wanna hear about you guys stepping
anywhere near it. You understand?

609
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:15,330
You fellas need a place to stay?

610
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,266
No. No, we're all right.

611
00:47:20,203 --> 00:47:23,939
It's okay.
¡Ay, Dios mío!

612
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,540
Frank!

613
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:28,210
Are you okay?
Yeah.

614
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,011
He's Bernie.
Bernie.

615
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,346
Hey. Rosaria.

616
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,849
- You okay?
- Yeah.

617
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:39,588
All right.
There you go.

618
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,358
I'm gonna bring in some extra blankets
'cause it gets colder in this room.

619
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,594
A bunk bed?
You gotta be sh...

620
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,262
You know what?
This is great.

621
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,631
Thank you so much for bringing us in.
Are you kidding?

622
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:52,100
It'll be nice to have
a little company around here.

623
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,436
Not to mention how much I
appreciate what you both are doing.

624
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:59,074
All right. Looks like I'll take the top bunk
'cause I don't want your butt falling on me.

625
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,177
Make sure they use the gate
for safety.

626
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,378
Don't need a gate.

627
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,447
Slept in a bunk or two in my day.

628
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,983
They had bunk beds back then?

629
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,154
All right, little lady.

630
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,458
So that's how it's gonna be, huh?

631
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,472
Hey, Bernie.
You up?

632
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:34,142
No.

633
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,413
You know, I can keep doing
this thing. You don't have to...

634
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:43,985
Boy, you better shut your mouth
before I coldcock your ass.

635
00:48:46,322 --> 00:48:48,990
Good night, John-boy.

636
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:52,260
Shut up.

637
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:09,177
Rise and shine, boys.

638
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:12,213
Jules, honey, don't.
Let them sleep.

639
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:13,982
I'm so sorry.

640
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:17,085
Bernie, how'd you end up there?

641
00:49:18,387 --> 00:49:21,089
I don't know.

642
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,058
I must have fell.

643
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,193
Told ya you needed the gate.

644
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:28,129
Okay, honey. Come on.

645
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,332
Sorry, guys.

646
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:46,581
You all right? Doesn't that
liver ever give you a break?

647
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,283
It's not my liver.

648
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,252
I had some of Rosaria's
leftovers this morning...

649
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:55,056
and I've been pissin'
out my ass ever since.

650
00:49:55,692 --> 00:50:01,196
I don't know if I'll be able to do
that beach house thing with ya.

651
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,098
I gotta get to a bathroom,

652
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,034
and I'm gonna be there
for a long time.

653
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:11,039
We'll find you a bathroom. Just
don't do it here. Don't do it here.

654
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,655
You all right?
Yeah.

655
00:50:46,142 --> 00:50:48,476
Can I help you?

656
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:50,545
Oh, hey.

657
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,397
Yeah, I was supposed to
meet my friend here.

658
00:50:53,423 --> 00:50:55,550
Guess he hasn't made it home yet.

659
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,652
Resident's name?

660
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,155
Uh, Adolfo Herrera.

661
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,689
You look familiar.

662
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,159
Yeah, I been here a couple times.

663
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,861
No, no, no. From someplace else.
TV or somethin'.

664
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:10,665
Are you an actor?
Who, me?

665
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,500
Are you kiddin'? Wish I was.

666
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:15,236
Those guys make all the dough, huh?
Tell me about it.

667
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:20,675
I've got a cousin, he shot one of those
insurance commercials. Took in five figures.

668
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,111
He worked one day.
Can you believe that shit?

669
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:27,582
Meanwhile, I'm driving around in this
piece of crap for 10 bucks an hour.

670
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,684
Sucks balls.

671
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:33,154
Anyway, if no one's
comin' to let you in,

672
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,823
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

673
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,825
He told me to wait
for him out front.

674
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,694
I'm sorry.
It's homeowners' rules.

675
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:44,199
Well, rules were
made to be broken.

676
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:47,362
Shh. I'm not gonna hurt you.

677
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,235
Who the fuck are you?

678
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:57,438
I told you I didn't want to fight.

679
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,606
Bad Ass!

680
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,713
What do you want?

681
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,249
You killed my friend Manny Parkes.

682
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,752
How do you want to die,
motherfucker?

683
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,353
Oh, finally...

684
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,890
I get the pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Señor Vega.

685
00:53:25,401 --> 00:53:26,701
I didn't order the hit.

686
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,405
- Who did?
- I don't know.

687
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,674
Freeze!

688
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,711
Back away, Vega.

689
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:44,352
I'm really sorry to barge in here,
Mr. Herrera. The side door was open.

690
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,553
You done good, Steven.

691
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,690
Really? 'Cause
I was hoping for a raise.

692
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,792
Hey, hey! Hey!

693
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,727
Don't push it.

694
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:55,863
Now,

695
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,700
as for you, Señor Vega...

696
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:04,439
I don't appreciate you barging
into my place of residence.

697
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:11,512
I'm a... I'm a recluse, you know.

698
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:14,382
I'm not big on visitors.

699
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,884
But you can relate.
Right?

700
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:19,854
So, my friend,

701
00:54:20,022 --> 00:54:21,889
I'm gonna have to say good-bye.

702
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:32,400
If I were you, asshole,
I'd step the hell back.

703
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,870
Actually, I think you better
step the hell back.

704
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:42,744
You motherfucker!
Oh, you motherfucker!

705
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:50,985
Now, where were we?
Who made the hit?

706
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,721
My father, you fuckin' asshole!

707
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,323
My father.
Okay, good.

708
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,893
Now that we're seein' eye to
eye, where can we find him?

709
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:01,029
The consulate!

710
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:04,666
- What consulate?
- The fuckin' Argentinean consulate!

711
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:08,536
A lot of security at
them consulates, Frank.

712
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,806
My uncle used to work at
the Uganda consulate.

713
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,409
They ran that joint like Fort Knox.

714
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,077
Where else can we find him?

715
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,745
I don't know.

716
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:21,049
Well, then text him!

717
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:25,586
Are you fucking insane? You want
me to set up my own father?

718
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:26,487
Yeah.

719
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,757
Text him now.
Oh, shit!

720
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:45,907
Buenos tardes, señores.
Care to sit?

721
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:49,577
If I wasn't an officer of the law,

722
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,679
I would kill you right now.

723
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:56,517
Well, that never stopped
the rest of the L.A.P.D.

724
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,619
You have the right
to remain silent.

725
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:02,023
Anything you say can be held
against you in a court of law.

726
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,093
It's never going to stick,
gentlemen.

727
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:08,996
You have the right to an attorney.

728
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,632
Leave a nice tip.

729
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:21,809
We got him.

730
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,711
Thank you.

731
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:28,683
Can we go to Chuck E. Cheese?

732
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,452
Can we go to Chuck E. Cheese?
Please? Please?

733
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:34,956
Sure. Of course we can. Sure.

734
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:58,980
Thanks, Uncle Frank.
That was so much fun.

735
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:02,717
Hey, that was so much fun
we're gonna do it again.

736
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,118
I want you to have this.

737
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,888
Oh, wait. You won that.
That's yours.

738
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:12,627
I know. That's why I want you to have it.
It can keep you safe and sound.

739
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:17,098
Oh, it's beautiful.
I'll never take it off.

740
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,637
It was so sudden.

741
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,507
He had been complaining of chest
pains earlier in the day,

742
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:30,144
and then three hours later
he had a heart attack.

743
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:33,648
I'm so sorry. He was so young.

744
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,016
Yeah.

745
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,585
It was toughest on the kids.

746
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:41,689
Thank goodness for work.
Kept my mind off things.

747
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:44,826
What exactly do you do?

748
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:48,663
Residential real estate. I can
help you buy your next home.

749
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,965
Boy, I'm sure in the
market for one.

750
00:57:54,236 --> 00:57:56,237
What about you?

751
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,473
What did you do before all this?

752
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,142
I owned a hot dog cart.

753
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,078
A hot dog cart? Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

754
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,582
Same location for almost 40 years.

755
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,084
And then Baxter got cancer,

756
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:13,588
and I sold the house to
pay for his treatments.

757
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,058
With the money left over,
I bought the center.

758
00:58:17,793 --> 00:58:20,294
Well, the kids absolutely
adore you there.

759
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:23,030
Well, they're great kids.

760
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:29,070
Manny was the closest thing I
ever came to having a son.

761
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:33,207
I know, Frank.

762
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:36,110
There was a strong connection.

763
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,979
Same with Julia.

764
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,015
You have a wonderful
little girl there.

765
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,851
Oh, man.
She is a pistol, right?

766
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,255
And she's only five.
I can't imagine her at 16.

767
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:51,559
Boys don't stand a chance.

768
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:58,799
You're a very special man,
Frank Vega.

769
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,669
You have a genuine spirit.

770
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,838
People gravitate to it.

771
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,773
Me included.

772
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:10,745
Well, you know, I just...
I try to do the right thing.

773
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:15,016
Well, then the right thing
would be to kiss me.

774
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:25,660
Never mind me. I'm just
lookin' for some fro-yo.

775
00:59:27,663 --> 00:59:31,699
So you are covered... water damage,
fire damage and electrical.

776
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:34,702
And we'll also cover the expenses
of a temporary new space...

777
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,037
until the renovation is complete.

778
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:39,140
So I won't have to pay a thing?
No, you're covered.

779
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:41,943
- Vega, you got a minute?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

780
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,412
I don't have to pay a dime.
Fully covered.

781
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:48,015
Hey, that's great, Frank.
Congratulations.

782
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,650
But listen, Frank.

783
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:50,952
They let Herrera go.

784
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,020
- What?
- He's an untouchable.

785
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,221
He's got diplomatic immunity.

786
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:59,760
You mean he can murder somebody,
deal drugs in our neighborhood,

787
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,162
and they let him go?

788
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,296
You got any real proof?

789
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:05,066
Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.
How could you let him go?

790
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,802
I've made my peace that you're
gonna do whatever you want.

791
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,370
God knows you're not
gonna listen to me.

792
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:13,240
But this thing... Unless you
have undeniable concrete proof,

793
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,109
this guy's never gonna go to jail.

794
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,044
It's a no-win.

795
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:21,282
You hear what I'm sayin', Frank?
It's a no-win.

796
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:38,065
Looks like your boy
brought himself some protection.

797
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,638
Follow that Escalade.

798
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:51,412
You bring your wallet?

799
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:51,979
Yeah.

800
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:56,384
Good. 'Cause I think this
shit's gonna be expensive.

801
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:12,366
Meat packing?

802
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,869
What the hell
is Herrera doing here?

803
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:19,073
We're gonna find out.
But first pay the man.

804
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,975
Hey!

805
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:23,277
- What do I owe you?
- 83.85.

806
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,112
Jesus Christ!

807
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:27,682
Wait here.
Okay.

808
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,383
Thank you.

809
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,812
Bring it over here.

810
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:02,383
No, you gotta pick 'em up...
You gotta pick 'em up.

811
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,752
There.

812
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:30,845
What the hell we doing, man?

813
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,047
Oh, shit. Wait.

814
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,282
What's wrong?

815
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:38,085
Nothin'.
Just... Just keep goin'.

816
01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:08,415
Boy, we ain't got no time
for checkin' inventory.

817
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:15,923
Check this out.

818
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:20,394
They were importing the stuff
through the meat.

819
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:24,398
Straight from Argentina
into our neighborhood.

820
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,134
Has a bill, has a...

821
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:32,506
What, uh...
What are you doing?

822
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:37,144
Uh, good day, gentlemen.

823
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,079
I'm Agent Black,
this is Agent Brown...

824
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:43,150
from the F.D.A.-C.D.A.
Health Commission.

825
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,387
We've been here
all of 15 minutes...

826
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:51,592
and we've discovered two
severe health code violations.

827
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,161
You wanna tell me
how you got in here?

828
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,563
Boy, don't worry about
how we got in.

829
01:03:55,565 --> 01:04:01,302
If I were you, I'd worry about how
we shut this toxic shithole down.

830
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,871
Now go get your supervisor for me.

831
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:08,108
And if I were you,
I'd show me a fuckin' badge.

832
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:13,447
Mr. Brown, show him the badge.

833
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,915
What?

834
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,116
Just show it to him.

835
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:19,987
Badges? We don't need
no stinkin' badges.

836
01:04:24,259 --> 01:04:27,994
What the hell type of answer was that?
I didn't know what to say!

837
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:31,565
It's called improvising. You'd better learn
how to do it 'fore you get us both killed.

838
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,100
You'd better learn
to shut your mouth!

839
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:36,111
Is that the kind of respect
I get for helpin' your ass?

840
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:37,572
I don't need your help!

841
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,441
We give up!

842
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,048
So what time is dinner
being served?

843
01:04:50,185 --> 01:04:53,053
I can't imagine
it's gonna be chicken.

844
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,356
Why have chicken...

845
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:59,059
when you Americans
love my fresh meat?

846
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:02,596
You gentlemen
just don't give up, do you?

847
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,498
That's commendable.

848
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,301
But I told you it wouldn't stick.

849
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,669
Yeah, it's gonna stick.

850
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:12,406
Oh, you see, that's where
you are wrong, Mr. Vega.

851
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:16,043
I am what you might call
untouchable.

852
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:19,346
I can do whatever I want
in your pathetic country.

853
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:23,384
If I want to go 120 down
P.C.H., I can do that.

854
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:29,456
If I want to sell drugs to the
neighborhood, I can do that.

855
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,258
If I want to kill...

856
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,195
one of my dealers
who's stealing from me,

857
01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:41,135
well,

858
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,237
you know I can do that.

859
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,371
So what you're saying...

860
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:48,342
is that you're just
a low-life drug dealer.

861
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:00,587
I'm an entrepreneur.

862
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:05,459
I'm building an empire
for my family,

863
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,195
just like your beloved Kennedys.

864
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:11,198
They made their millions
bootlegging alcohol.

865
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,634
I'm doing the same thing,
but with drugs.

866
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,669
Es lo mismo.

867
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:19,640
The only difference is
I'm above the law.

868
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:27,581
You see?
Untouchable.

869
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,183
Now,

870
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,686
you and I have
a little score to settle.

871
01:06:35,623 --> 01:06:37,725
Replace the inventory
you destroyed,

872
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:42,129
or pay me one-quarter
million dollars in damages.

873
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,199
Reach into my fanny pack
and get my checkbook.

874
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,438
Mi abuelo had an old saying...

875
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,641
"Un testiculo por un testiculo."

876
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:56,744
Now,

877
01:06:56,746 --> 01:07:00,447
I know it's similar to
the "eye for an eye" thing,

878
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:03,717
but it's more graphic,
more relatable.

879
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:07,488
And besides,
I just like it better.

880
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,056
So...

881
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:12,659
in exchange for you
taking something from me,

882
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,096
I'm going to take
something from you.

883
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,365
Sound fair?

884
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,301
My people on the inside...

885
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:26,707
tell me you've become pretty
close with Manny Parkes's mom.

886
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:30,077
Yeah.

887
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,312
I find that very sweet.

888
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,214
I don't know
what you're talking about.

889
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,550
Oh, but you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

890
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,486
Leave her out of this.
She's got nothing to do with it.

891
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,790
She has everything
to do with this.

892
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:49,530
Just like clockwork.

893
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,765
Unfortunately, I must leave.

894
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:56,270
But I'm sure you'll find you're in
good hands with these two gentlemen.

895
01:07:57,105 --> 01:08:00,808
Let's make it real cozy
for them, guys.

896
01:08:01,176 --> 01:08:03,744
Drop it down to three degrees.

897
01:08:04,512 --> 01:08:06,647
Caballeros.

898
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:10,384
I bid you adiós.

899
01:08:16,624 --> 01:08:18,425
"'I love to hear the wind, '
Patty says."

900
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:22,896
"'And I love how things look
beautiful in the rain, ' says Alice."

901
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:25,599
"'Well, I love snowflakes, '
says Jasmine."

902
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:30,604
"'When I watch them float
around, I want to dance.'"

903
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:33,307
Did you just read that?

904
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,609
Yes, I did.

905
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:39,580
You, mi chica,
continue to amaze me.

906
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:46,687
Uh, stay here, honey.
Okay?

907
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:09,176
Get the fuck up and check
the rest of the house!

908
01:09:14,549 --> 01:09:15,616
Shit.

909
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,485
Christ!

910
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,387
Shit don't look good.

911
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:23,257
There's gotta be a way outta here.
Yeah.

912
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:29,863
Not until we freeze over and they slide
our asses out in one big ice cube.

913
01:09:33,701 --> 01:09:34,868
Oww!

914
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,504
Yeah, that c-c-cold
hurts, don't it?

915
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,706
No.

916
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,241
I cut myself.

917
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:44,244
With what?
With Julia's bracelet.

918
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:47,481
Th-Th-The charms are
as sharp as razors.

919
01:09:51,553 --> 01:09:53,353
Hey. Hey.

920
01:09:58,326 --> 01:09:59,893
No!

921
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:03,597
You've made progress,
but still not enough.

922
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:06,433
You still want it?

923
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,451
Damn Mexican MacGyver!

924
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,753
Hang on, buddy.
Hang on.

925
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:28,689
Hurry up, man.

926
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:31,825
My left nut is frostbit.
Shit.

927
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:38,432
Okay, guy. Ready?

928
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,502
Oh, shit.

929
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:44,438
All right, man.

930
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,906
You got it. You got it.

931
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,641
Oh, shit.
You all right?

932
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:49,810
Okay... Oh, sh...

933
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,913
Whoo.

934
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,282
It's just my fake hip.

935
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,017
I gotta realign it.

936
01:11:00,054 --> 01:11:02,589
Yeah. All right.
I'm okay.

937
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,725
All right, let's go.

938
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:22,442
Out cold, bitches.

939
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:25,445
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.

940
01:11:33,621 --> 01:11:37,624
You made him wait?
You a clever Mexican, man!

941
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,059
Yeah, and you're gonna pay, bitch.

942
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:42,763
Hey, hey, you...
you taco-eatin' motherf...

943
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:51,738
I'm really sorry things ended up
the way they did, Señora Parkes.

944
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,374
Especially with your son.

945
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,078
But it's time for
a new chapter in your life.

946
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,782
I think you'll make somebody
very happy in Argentina.

947
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:06,687
Or the Middle East. I hear they
go crazy for Latinas. Who knew?

948
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:19,633
Julia! Julia!

949
01:12:20,702 --> 01:12:23,503
Rosaria! Julia!

950
01:12:23,838 --> 01:12:25,639
Julia!

951
01:12:29,977 --> 01:12:32,045
Julia! Julia!

952
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,916
Help! Help! Help! Help!

953
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:36,950
Ooh. Oh, baby.

954
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:40,354
Oh-oh! Okay, okay.
Okay, okay. It's all right.

955
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:44,424
It's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

956
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:47,394
I heard a few different voices.

957
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:50,497
They made a lot of scary noises...

958
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:53,100
and took Mommy with them.

959
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:56,803
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We're gonna find your mommy.

960
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,873
They could be anywhere
by now, Frank.

961
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:03,977
You can always find her
on your phone.

962
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:06,580
What?
Remember? Let me show you.

963
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,682
Oh!

964
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,884
That's right!

965
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:18,792
You're a good neighbor, Diane.

966
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,994
It's okay.
Don't worry, Mr. Vega.

967
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,496
She's in good hands.

968
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:24,531
Yeah, I know.
Thank you so much.

969
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:27,401
You'll be all right.
Okay, sweetheart?

970
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:32,139
Please bring back my mommy.

971
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,008
I promise.

972
01:13:38,045 --> 01:13:39,880
Come on.

973
01:13:41,549 --> 01:13:43,550
Hey-hey! Hey!

974
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:44,885
What happened to the cab?

975
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:47,788
Are you kiddin'?
That was a $90 fare.

976
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,756
I couldn't afford to
keep it here any longer.

977
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:52,192
How we supposed to get there now?
I didn't see you...

978
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:55,128
Someone call for a Bronco?

979
01:13:58,966 --> 01:14:01,101
They're heading
towards the mountains.

980
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,936
Doesn't this thing go any faster?

981
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,605
You're lucky this thing even runs.

982
01:14:12,513 --> 01:14:15,482
We fuckin' hired
the dumbest people.

983
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,484
Shit!

984
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,222
Oh, you stupid motherfucker.

985
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,057
Vega and his fuckin' buddy
got away.

986
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,725
We need to find them
before they find us,

987
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:29,162
and we gotta figure out what the
fuck we're gonna do with her.

988
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:30,997
Put Drake in the sky.

989
01:14:40,575 --> 01:14:41,741
We getting close?

990
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,977
I can't tell. There's
three dots on the screen.

991
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,147
- I don't know which is which.
- Just pick one.

992
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:53,220
There they are! Stay on their tail!

993
01:14:57,792 --> 01:15:00,160
What the hell?

994
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:04,064
They got a ghetto bird after us!

995
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:07,100
- Damn!
- Hold on.

996
01:15:13,574 --> 01:15:18,011
I knew the four-wheel drive
would come in handy one day.

997
01:15:27,255 --> 01:15:31,691
Shit!
Where'd those old bastards go?

998
01:15:35,963 --> 01:15:38,732
D.M.V. don't know shit!

999
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:40,133
This boy's got mad skills!

1000
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:44,170
Hold on, baby.
We're goin' suicide!

1001
01:15:44,906 --> 01:15:47,807
Oh, shit!

1002
01:15:53,614 --> 01:15:57,217
Ain't no 20-year-old
got reflexes like that.

1003
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:12,532
All right, let's see 'em
follow us through this.

1004
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:27,213
Yeah! I think
we lost those assholes!

1005
01:16:30,918 --> 01:16:32,018
Oh, shit!

1006
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:36,222
We gotta shake 'em off!

1007
01:16:36,824 --> 01:16:38,825
Where the hell you get that?

1008
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,761
Parting gift from The Expendables.

1009
01:16:43,831 --> 01:16:46,299
Ah! Take that!

1010
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,368
How you like us now, bitch?

1011
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:56,042
Did I ever tell you I really
like that fanny pack?

1012
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:07,387
Mama always said, no driving like a
maniac 30 minutes after you eat.

1013
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,690
- Here.
- Okay.

1014
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,225
You all right?

1015
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:14,260
I don't how much longer I got,

1016
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:19,899
but if I'm gonna go out,
I'm gonna go out in style.

1017
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:37,050
There they are.

1018
01:17:41,055 --> 01:17:42,889
I think they're on us.
What?

1019
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:46,159
Goddamn it!
This motherfucker won't stop!

1020
01:17:47,094 --> 01:17:49,329
Pull up next to him!

1021
01:17:51,365 --> 01:17:53,867
Come on!
Go, go, go!

1022
01:17:54,035 --> 01:17:55,335
Shoot him!

1023
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,804
Son of a bitch!
Shit. Come on! Catch him!

1024
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:01,174
- Come on! Catch up to him!
- I ain't gettin' my ass shot at again.

1025
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,458
I said catch 'em!

1026
01:18:02,484 --> 01:18:06,104
You a mean son of a bitch.
You know that?

1027
01:18:21,896 --> 01:18:24,097
Shit!

1028
01:18:33,174 --> 01:18:36,710
Hey, you fuckin' pussy! I got
a fuckin' ice pick in my eye!

1029
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:40,013
So suck it up and let's
get the hell out of here!

1030
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:41,247
Hey, muchachos.

1031
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:44,250
I call shotgun!

1032
01:18:54,361 --> 01:18:56,930
Hey. Hey.

1033
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:59,165
Hey! Hey!

1034
01:18:59,834 --> 01:19:01,801
Where is she?

1035
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,872
I'm gonna ask you one more time,

1036
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:08,942
and then this finger
is goin' in your good eye.

1037
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:13,279
- No, no! Okay! Okay.
- Okay. Shit.

1038
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,085
Hola, hijo.

1039
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,987
It's me. Vega.

1040
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,957
I got your boy.

1041
01:19:25,392 --> 01:19:26,926
What do you want?

1042
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,295
An even trade.
Rosaria for your son.

1043
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:34,134
Meet me at the Elysian Park
helipad in an hour.

1044
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:36,770
Just you and her.

1045
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:37,837
Bring anybody else,

1046
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:41,341
and you'll never see
your little "mi hijo" again.

1047
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,498
He's gonna be a no-show.

1048
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,234
Would you leave your kid
high and dry?

1049
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:12,438
If he was a scum-sucking
son of a bitch, I would.

1050
01:20:14,441 --> 01:20:19,379
Guess he didn't want to miss out
on his Father's Day gift, huh?

1051
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,036
You've got bolas, Vega.
I like that.

1052
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:46,506
I might have some opportunities
for you, my friend.

1053
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,575
Could be very rewarding.

1054
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:49,843
Where is she?

1055
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,512
Wanting to get right
down to business.

1056
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,447
I respect that.

1057
01:20:57,184 --> 01:21:00,186
Hey! Take it easy!

1058
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,555
Your turn.

1059
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:12,932
Had an accident on the way.

1060
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:15,501
You might want to mop him up.

1061
01:21:15,936 --> 01:21:17,904
That's embarrassing.

1062
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,372
Okay. On three.

1063
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,307
One, two, three.

1064
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:26,446
It's gonna be all right.

1065
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:30,016
- Someone's in the back!
- Adiós, señor Vega.

1066
01:21:58,212 --> 01:22:01,047
Shit still works.

1067
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,649
Huh.

1068
01:22:05,552 --> 01:22:07,553
So, what are you
gonna do now, Vega?

1069
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:10,690
You can't put me in jail.
I'll be out within an hour.

1070
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:13,993
And we all know
you can't just shoot me.

1071
01:22:14,261 --> 01:22:16,429
I'm a diplomat, for Pete's sake.

1072
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:20,633
But... I do know you can fight.

1073
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:23,102
Just like your boy Manny.

1074
01:22:23,337 --> 01:22:26,005
You would've been so proud of him.

1075
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:30,176
But in the end,
he was no match for my men.

1076
01:22:39,353 --> 01:22:41,321
Frank!

1077
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:42,922
Frank, stop!

1078
01:22:51,332 --> 01:22:53,566
Hey! Drop it!

1079
01:23:07,281 --> 01:23:08,614
Not bad, Vega,

1080
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,551
for un viejo conchudo.

1081
01:23:15,255 --> 01:23:18,157
Come on, Vega!
Show me something!

1082
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:24,664
Yeah!

1083
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:29,202
It's my turn now, bitch!

1084
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:55,728
That's for Manny, puto.

1085
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,264
Somebody...

1086
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:00,266
please call...

1087
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:02,468
ambulance.

1088
01:24:25,259 --> 01:24:30,663
All right, drop your weapons! Everybody
put your hands on your head!

1089
01:24:35,402 --> 01:24:37,236
Little late, aren't ya?

1090
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,638
Sorry. AT&T.

1091
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,275
I didn't get your text until
10 minutes after you sent it.

1092
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:45,545
Don't matter
if it's AT&T or Verizon.

1093
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,547
The police don't show up for shit.

1094
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:50,283
They got their heads
so far up their asses...

1095
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:53,152
worrying about black men
jaywalking in white neighborhoods,

1096
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:58,791
they don't have time to worry
about serious crap like this.

1097
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:02,128
I thought you said
he was less grumpy.

1098
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,429
He is.

1099
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:04,597
Frank, where's Julia?

1100
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:07,533
She's safe and sound.
She's with Diane.

1101
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:10,703
Thank you, Frank.
Thank you.

1102
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,141
He's dead.

1103
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:17,243
Huh.
Well, goddamn then!

1104
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:18,845
Looks like I found me a liver.

1105
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:20,680
Hey, fellas, just
don't stand there.

1106
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:23,382
Hurry up and get that shit on ice!

1107
01:25:30,824 --> 01:25:33,726
All right, honey, time for bed.

1108
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,461
Good night, little one.

1109
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:38,364
Good night, big one.

1110
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:41,400
Mommy?
Yeah?

1111
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:46,305
How do we work it out for
Frank to stay here forever?

1112
01:25:47,574 --> 01:25:48,875
Um...

1113
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:51,177
Go to sleep, sweetie.
Okay?

1114
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,546
Okay.
Good night.

1115
01:26:02,689 --> 01:26:03,890
You know,

1116
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,259
she does have a good point.

1117
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,793
What's that?

1118
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,829
Living here.
What?

1119
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:13,466
Just until the center's ready and
Bernie recovers from surgery.

1120
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:18,638
And if you decide you wanna stay
longer, I'm fine with that too.

1121
01:26:20,807 --> 01:26:23,676
I have to tell you,
I'm a terrible roommate.

1122
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,578
Really messy.

1123
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,747
Perfect.
I like to clean.

1124
01:26:27,948 --> 01:26:31,617
I go to bed late
and I wake up early.

1125
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:34,187
Hello. I'm a mother.

1126
01:26:35,355 --> 01:26:38,958
You know,
this could just work out.

1127
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,160
I think so.

1128
01:26:44,665 --> 01:26:48,834
Don't mind me. I'm just
grabbin' myself some pie.

1129
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:51,470
Well, I think you're in
the wrong room for that.

1130
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,806
Yeah.

1131
01:26:56,777 --> 01:26:58,878
What?

1132
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,546
Bernie's nurse, huh?

1133
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,348
Oh, my God!

1134
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,250
To Bernie.
To Bernie.

1135
01:28:07,447 --> 01:28:09,682
And then the man said...

1136
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:13,452
"Do you take this man
to be your man?"

1137
01:28:14,305 --> 01:29:14,418
