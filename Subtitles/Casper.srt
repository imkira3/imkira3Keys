How?

But there's something
you have to understand.

1165
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:29,840
You and Kat loved me so
well when I was alive

1166
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,551
that I have no unfinished business.

James, Kat is growing up
beautifully because of you.

No wonder I miss you so much.

Just a couple of things, though.
