All right. I'm gonna turn
over the next card.

7
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,995
I want you to concentrate.

8
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:52,972
I want you to tell me
what you think it is.

9
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,847
Square.

10
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,232
Good guess. But wrong.

11
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,527
Clear your head.

12
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:18,912
All right. Tell me
what you think it is.

13
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,876
Is it a star?

14
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:26,708
It is a star. Very good.
That's great.

15
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,626
Okay. All right.

16
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,802
Think hard. What is it?

17
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,466
Circle.

18
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:40,558
Close. But definitely wrong.

19
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,357
Okay.

20
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:48,274
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:49,814
All right.

22
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,154
What is it?

23
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,870
Come on.

24
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:59,998
Figure eight.

25
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:06,251
Incredible. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

26
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:10,384
- You're not cheating me, are you?
- No, I swear they're just coming to me.

27
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:12,677
Okay.

28
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,301
- Nervous?
- Yes. I don't like this.

29
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:23,724
You only have 75 more to
go, okay? What's this one?

30
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,227
It's a couple of wavy lines.

31
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:33,194
- Sorry. This isn't your lucky day.
- I know.

32
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,359
Um...

33
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,785
Wait... Um...

34
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,249
I'm getting a little tired of this!

35
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:45,911
You volunteered, didn't you?
We're paying you, aren't we?

36
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:49,331
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna be giving me electric shocks!

37
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:51,546
What are you trying to
prove here, anyway?

38
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:55,679
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP ability.

39
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:59,307
The effect? I'll tell you what the
effect is. It's pissing me off!

40
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,309
Well, then maybe my
theory is correct!

41
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:05,268
- You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
- I will, mister!

42
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,945
You may as well get used to that.

43
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:16,863
It's the kind of resentment that your
ability is going to provoke in some people.

44
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:20,287
Do you think I have it,
Dr. Venkman?

45
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:24,082
You're no fluke, Jennifer.

46
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,710
This is it. This is definitely it!

47
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:29,246
Did those UV lenses come
in for the video camera?

48
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:32,962
And that blank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

49
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:36,253
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Sure.

50
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:40,932
I'm right in the middle
of something, Ray.

51
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,811
I need a little more
time with this subject.

52
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:45,429
Could you come back in an
hour, hour and a half?

53
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,597
Peter, at 1:40 p.m.

54
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:51,189
at the main branch of The New York
Public Library on Fifth Avenue,

55
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:56,073
ten people witnessed a free-floating,
full-torso, vaporous apparition.

56
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:58,404
It blew books off shelves
from 20 feet away

57
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,945
and scared the socks off
some poor librarian.

58
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,330
I'm very excited. I'm very pleased.

59
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:07,413
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

60
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:10,420
No, Peter, you're coming with us on
this one. Spengler went down there.

61
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,628
He took PKE valences, went right
off the top of the scale.

62
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,136
Buried the needle. We're close
on this one. I can feel it.

63
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,727
I can feel it. We're
very, very close.

64
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:29,932
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
like to work with you some more.

65
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,271
Perhaps you could come back
this evening, say at...?

66
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,811
Eight o'clock?

67
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:38,858
I was just going to say, "8:00?"
You are a legitimate phenomenon.

68
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,245
As a friend, I have to tell you,

69
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,130
you've finally gone around the
bend on this ghost business.

70
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,739
You guys have been
running your ass off,

71
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,900
meeting and greeting every
schizo in the five boroughs

72
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:53,105
who says he has a paranormal
experience. What have you seen?

73
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,389
Of course, you forget, Peter,

74
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,943
I was present at an undersea,
unexplained mass sponge migration.

75
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:03,257
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a half.

76
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:11,181
- Oh, you're here.
- Yeah, what have you got?

77
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:14,568
This is big, Peter, this is very big.
There's definitely something here.

78
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:18,481
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to drill a hole through your head.

79
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:20,695
- Remember that?
- That would've worked if...

80
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:23,781
I'm Roger Delacorte. Are you
the men from the university?

81
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,539
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

82
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:31,702
Thank you for coming. I hope we can
clear this up quickly and quietly.

83
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:36,214
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

84
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,713
I don't remember seeing any legs,

85
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:42,049
but it definitely had arms,
because it reached out for me.

86
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,340
Arms? I can't wait to get
a look at this thing.

87
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:47,305
Alice, I'm gonna ask you a couple
of standard questions, okay?

88
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,803
Have you or any
member of your family

89
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,066
ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentally incompetent?

90
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,986
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

91
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,944
I'd call that a big yes.

92
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:06,408
Uh, are you habitually using
drugs, stimulants, alcohol?

93
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:09,869
- No.
- No, no. Just asking.

94
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,540
Are you, Alice,
menstruating right now?

95
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:18,879
- What has that got to do with it?
- Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

96
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:22,173
Ray, it's moving. Come on.

97
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,657
Look!

98
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:58,130
- This is hot, Ray.
- Symmetrical book-stacking.

99
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:02,213
Just like the Philadelphia
mass turbulence of 1947.

100
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,630
You're right. No human being
would stack books like this.

101
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,725
Listen! Do you smell something?

102
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:22,316
Talk about telekinetic
activity. Look at this mess.

103
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,527
Raymond, look at this.

104
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:28,243
Ectoplasmic residue.

105
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,497
- Venkman, get a sample of this.
- It's the real thing.

106
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,999
Somebody blows their nose,
and you wanna keep it?

107
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,831
I'd like to analyze it.

108
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:40,964
- There's more over here.
- I'm getting stronger readings here.

109
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,801
This way.

110
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,300
Come on.

111
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,529
Egon, your mucus.

112
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,868
This happen to you before?

113
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,367
Oh. First time?

114
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,477
It's here.

115
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:49,616
A full-torso apparition.
And it's real.

116
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:56,285
So, what do we do?

117
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:04,206
Could you come over here and
talk to me for a second, please?

118
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,545
Could you just come over
here for a second, please?

119
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:10,178
Right over here. Come here,
Francine. Come here.

120
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:13,848
- What do we do?
- I don't know. What do you think?

121
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,805
Stop that!

122
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:19,266
We've gotta make contact. One of us
should actually try to speak to it.

123
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:20,897
Good idea.

124
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,108
Hello.

125
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,322
I'm Peter.

126
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:37,452
Where are you from? Originally.

127
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,037
Shh.

128
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:45,338
All right. Okay. The usual
stuff isn't working.

129
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:49,842
Okay, I have a plan.
I know exactly what to do.

130
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:53,922
Now, stay close.

131
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:56,303
Stay close.

132
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,473
I know. Do exactly as I say.

133
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,889
Get ready. Ready?

134
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,557
Get her!

135
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,160
- Did you see it? What was it?
- We'll get back to you.

136
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:16,661
Wait!

137
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:30,049
"Get her." That was your
whole plan. Get her.

138
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:35,009
- It was scientific.
- I just got overexcited.

139
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:39,176
But wasn't it incredible, Pete? I mean,
we actually touched the etheric plane.

140
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,436
You know what this could
mean to the university?

141
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,938
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger than the
microchip. Ray, I'm very excited.

142
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,815
I wouldn't say the experience
was completely wasted.

143
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:48,818
According to these new readings,
I think we have an excellent chance

144
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:50,650
of actually catching a ghost
and holding it indefinitely.

145
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:54,817
Well, this is great. If the ionization rate
is constant for all ectoplasmic entities,

146
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:58,203
we could really bust some heads.
In a spiritual sense, of course.

147
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:01,365
Spengs, you serious about
this catching a ghost?

148
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,454
I'm always serious.

149
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:07,667
Egon, I'm gonna take back some of
the things I've said about you.

150
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,299
You... You've earned it.

151
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:18,507
The possibilities are limitless.
Hey, Dean Yeager.

152
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,645
I trust you're moving us to
better quarters on campus.

153
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,898
No, you're being moved off campus.

154
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,730
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

155
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,736
You are to vacate these
premises immediately.

156
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,899
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.

157
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:39,069
Fine. This university
will no longer continue

158
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:42,580
any funding of any kind for
your group's activities.

159
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,412
But the kids love us.

160
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:50,707
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

161
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:55,423
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustle.

162
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:58,004
Your theories are the worst
kind of popular tripe.

163
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,516
Your methods are sloppy, and your
conclusions are highly questionable.

164
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,144
You are a poor scientist,
Dr. Venkman.

165
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,767
I see.

166
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,777
And you have no place in this
department or in this university.

167
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:16,193
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.

168
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,779
They wouldn't touch us with
a 10-meter cattle prod.

169
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,285
You're always so concerned
about your reputation.

170
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:24,288
Einstein did his best stuff when
he was working as a patent clerk.

171
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:26,290
- You know how much a patent clerk earns?
- No

172
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,801
Personally, I like the university.
They gave us money and facilities.

173
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,149
We didn't have to produce anything.

174
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:33,238
You've never been out of college. You
don't know what it's like out there.

175
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,764
I've worked in the private
sector. They expect results.

176
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,969
For whatever reasons, Ray,

177
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,222
call it fate, call it luck,
call it karma,

178
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,228
I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

179
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,483
I believe that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

180
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:56,654
- For what purpose?
- To go into business for ourselves.

181
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:03,064
This ecto-containment system that
Spengler and I have in mind is gonna

182
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:07,186
require a load of bread to capitalize.
Where are we gonna get the money?

183
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:12,500
I don't know. I don't know.

184
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,750
You're never gonna
regret this, Ray.

185
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,510
My parents left me that
house. I was born there.

186
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:22,923
You're not gonna lose the house.
Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.

187
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,763
But at 19 percent? You didn't
even bargain with the guy.

188
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,428
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate alone

189
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,347
for the first five years
comes to 95,000 dollars.

190
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:34,518
Will you guys relax? We are on
the threshold of establishing

191
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,774
the indispensable defense
science of the next decade:

192
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:41,532
Professional paranormal
investigations and eliminations.

193
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:46,363
The franchise rights alone will make
us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

194
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,703
There's office space, sleeping
quarters and showers on the next floor

195
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,516
and there's a full kitchen
on the top level.

196
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:56,544
It just seems a little pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

197
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,545
What do you think, Egon?

198
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,968
I think this building
should be condemned.

199
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,676
There's serious metal fatigue in
all the load-bearing members.

200
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:07,468
The wiring is substandard. It's completely
inadequate for our power needs.

201
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,557
And the neighborhood is
like a demilitarized zone.

202
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,644
Hey, does this pole still work?

203
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:20,738
Wow, this place is great.
When can we move in?

204
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:24,902
You gotta try this pole.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

205
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:33,285
Hey, we should stay here tonight,
sleep here. You know, to try it out.

206
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:45,263
- I think we'll take it.
- Good.

207
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,382
Hi.

208
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:29,386
- Oh, Dana, it's you.
- Oh, hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

209
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,927
- I thought it was the drugstore.
- Oh, are you sick?

210
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:33,811
No, no, I'm fine. I feel great.

211
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,144
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

212
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,980
I taped <i>20-Minute Workout</i> on my
machine and played it back at high speed

213
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,315
so it only took 10 minutes.
I got a great workout.

214
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:44,279
- Good.
- Want to come in for a mineral water?

215
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,651
Oh, I'd really like to, Louis, but I have
to go to rehearsal now. Excuse me.

216
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:49,986
No sweat. I'll take a
rain check on that.

217
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,410
I always have plenty of low-sodium
mineral water and other

218
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,504
nutritious foods in the house.
But you already know that.

219
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,867
- Yeah, I know that.
- Listen, that reminds me...

220
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,940
I'm having a big party
for all my clients.

221
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,921
It's my fourth anniversary
as an accountant, you know.

222
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,003
And even though you do your own tax
return, which you shouldn't do,

223
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,025
I'd like you to stop by, being
that you're my neighbor and all.

224
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:07,254
Well, thank you, Louis.
I'll really try to stop by.

225
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:10,655
Listen, that reminds me, you shouldn't
leave your TV on so loud when you go out.

226
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,758
The creep down the hall
phoned the manager.

227
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,098
That's strange. I didn't
realize I left it on.

228
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:18,105
Oh, yeah, you know what I did? I climbed on
the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable

229
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:21,689
but I couldn't get in, so you know what
I did? I turned up my TV real loud too

230
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:25,192
so everyone would think that both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

231
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:28,946
Okay, so I'll see you later,
huh? I'll give you a call.

232
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,198
I gotta have a shower.

233
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:39,372
<i>Are you troubled by strange
noises in the middle of the night?</i>

234
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:42,709
<i>Do you experience feelings of
dread in your basement or attic?</i>

235
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:46,126
<i>Have you or any of your family ever
seen a spook, specter or ghost?</i>

236
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,168
<i>If the answer is yes, then
don't wait another minute.</i>

237
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,548
<i>Pick up your phone and call the
professionals. Ghostbusters.</i>

238
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:54,058
<i>Our courteous and efficient
staff is on call 24 hours a day</i>

239
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:56,514
<i>to serve all your
supernatural-elimination needs.</i>

240
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:59,851
<i>We're ready to believe you.</i>

241
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,129
Zuul.

242
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:18,475
You don't think it's too subtle?

243
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:22,935
You don't think people are gonna
drive down and not see the sign?

244
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:33,407
You can't park that here!

245
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:39,659
Everybody can relax,
I found the car.

246
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:42,291
Needs some suspension
work and shocks

247
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,500
and brakes, brake pads, linings,
steering box, transmission, rear end.

248
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:48,164
- How much?
- Only 4800.

249
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,004
Maybe new rings, also
mufflers, a little wiring.

250
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,682
- Janine, any calls?
- No.

251
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,343
- Any messages?
- No.

252
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:04,688
- Any customers?
- No, Dr. Venkman.

253
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,108
It's a good job, isn't it?

254
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:11,688
Type something, will you?
We're paying for this stuff.

255
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:15,199
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.

256
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,531
Janine?

257
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:20,822
Sorry about the "bug eyes"
thing. I'll be in my office.

258
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,835
You're very handy. I can tell.

259
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:32,713
- I bet you like to read a lot too.
- Print is dead.

260
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,720
Oh, that's very fascinating
to me. I read a lot myself.

261
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,728
Some people think I'm
too intellectual,

262
00:21:38,754 --> 00:21:41,580
but I think it's a fabulous
way to spend your spare time.

263
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:45,847
I also play racquetball.
Do you have any hobbies?

264
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,934
I collect spores, molds and fungus.

265
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:56,240
Hello?

266
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,470
Oh, excuse me. Is this...?
This is the Ghostbusters' office.

267
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,594
Yes, it is. Can I help you?

268
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:24,681
I don't have an appointment. I'd
like to talk to someone, please.

269
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:29,002
I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?

270
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:35,489
Um, well, I don't know. What I have
to say may sound a little unusual.

271
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:38,487
That's all we get, day in,
day out, around this place.

272
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:42,161
- Come into my office, Miss...
- Barrett. Dana Barrett.

273
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:46,620
And this voice said, "Zuul," and then I
slammed the refrigerator door and I left.

274
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:49,831
That was two days ago, and I
haven't been back to my apartment.

275
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:53,168
Generally, you don't see that kind
of behavior in a major appliance.

276
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,673
What do you think it was?

277
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:57,301
Well, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't be here.

278
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,006
Egon, what do you think?

279
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,306
She's telling the truth.
At least she thinks she is.

280
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:06,977
Well, of course I'm telling the truth.
Who would make up a story like that?

281
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,013
Some are people who
just want attention.

282
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,315
Others are just nutballs who
come in off the street.

283
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:15,853
You know what it could be? Past-life
experience intruding on present time.

284
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,648
Could be erased memory stored
in the collective unconscious.

285
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:21,863
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance
or telepathic contact either.

286
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:24,620
I'm sorry, I don't believe
in any of those things.

287
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:28,999
Well, that's all right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do,

288
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:32,708
standard procedures in a case like
this, which often bring us results.

289
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,465
Well, I could go to Hall of Records and check
out the structural details in the building.

290
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,718
Maybe the building itself has a
history of psychic turbulence.

291
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:40,219
Right. Good idea.

292
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:42,550
I could look for the name
"Zuul" in the usual literature.

293
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,224
<i>- Spates Catalog.</i> Yeah.
<i>- Tobin's Spirit Guide.</i>

294
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:49,353
Tell you what, I'll take Miss Barrett
back to her apartment and check her out.

295
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:53,516
I'll go check out Miss
Barrett's apartment. Okay?

296
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,901
Okay.

297
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:59,313
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

298
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,701
Please, let me.

299
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:13,085
If something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.

300
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:19,421
That's the closet.

301
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,217
They hate this.

302
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:30,727
I like to torture them.

303
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:34,732
That's right, boys.
It's Dr. Venkman!

304
00:24:40,254 --> 00:24:42,402
It's a lot of space.

305
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:46,444
- Just you?
- Yes.

306
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:48,404
Good.

307
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,952
What is that thing you're doing?

308
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:58,923
It's technical. It's one
of our little toys.

309
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:00,628
I see.

310
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:06,760
That's the bedroom. But nothing
ever happened in there.

311
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,845
What a crime.

312
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:16,766
You know, you don't
act like a scientist.

313
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:21,779
- They're usually pretty stiff.
- You're more like a game-show host.

314
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,362
That's the kitchen, huh?

315
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:44,760
- Dana, are these the eggs?
- Yes.

316
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:48,092
See I was over there, and these eggs
just jumped right out of their shells

317
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,849
- and started to cook on the counter.
- That is weird.

318
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:55,138
And that's when I started to hear that
awful noise coming from the refrigerator.

319
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,651
Dr. Venkman, you've come all this way.
Would you like to check the refrigerator?

320
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:05,481
Better check the fridge. Good call.

321
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:12,905
Oh, my God.

322
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,954
Look at all the junk food.

323
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:18,995
- No. Goddamn it! This wasn't...
- You actually eat this stuff?

324
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,038
Look, this wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

325
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:24,835
There was a space and there was a building
or something with flames coming out of it.

326
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,721
And there were creatures writhing around,
and they were growling and snarling.

327
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,674
And there were flames, and I
heard a voice say, "Zuul."

328
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,183
It was right here.

329
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:35,185
I'm sorry, I'm just not
getting any reading.

330
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:38,393
Well, are you sure you're
using that thing correctly?

331
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:42,560
I think so. But I'm sure there
are no animals in there.

332
00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:44,069
Well, that's great.

333
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:47,823
Either I have a monster in my
kitchen, or I'm completely crazy.

334
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:50,325
I don't think you're crazy.

335
00:26:50,718 --> 00:26:56,040
Oh, good. That makes
me feel so much better.

336
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:57,871
Let me tell you
something about myself.

337
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:01,162
I come home from work to my
place, and all I have is my work.

338
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,875
- There's nothing else in my life.
- Dr. Venkman.

339
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:07,339
I meet you, and I say, "My God, there's
someone with the same problem I have."

340
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:10,345
Yes, we both have the
same problem. You.

341
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:16,222
I'm gonna go for broke.

342
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,766
- I am madly in love with you.
- I don't believe this.

343
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,523
Will you please leave?

344
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:28,068
And then she threw me out of her
life. She thought I was a creep.

345
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,234
She thought I was a geek, and
she probably wasn't the first.

346
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,698
You are so odd.

347
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:40,083
- No.
- I've got it!

348
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:43,041
- No, no, no, no
- I'll prove myself to you.

349
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:44,955
That's not necessary.

350
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:47,921
- Yeah, I'll solve your little problem.
- Okay.

351
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:51,758
And then you'll say, "Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done."

352
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,922
- "I wonder what makes him tick."
- I wonder.

353
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:57,093
"I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick."

354
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,058
I'll bet you're gonna be thinking
about me after I'm gone.

355
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,642
I bet I am.

356
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,813
No kiss?

357
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:16,786
To our first customer.

358
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:20,074
To our first and only customer.

359
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:22,998
I'm gonna need to
draw some petty cash.

360
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,004
I should take her out to dinner.
We don't want to lose her.

361
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:31,302
This magnificent feast here represents
the last of the petty cash.

362
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:35,631
Hey, slow down. Chew your food.

363
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:39,226
Hello, Ghostbusters.

364
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:42,680
Yes, of course they're serious.

365
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,187
You do?

366
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,731
You have?

367
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,567
No kidding.

368
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:54,700
Uh-huh. Well, just
give me the address.

369
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:59,618
Yes, of course. Oh, they'll
be totally discreet.

370
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:02,412
Thank you.

371
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,826
We got one!

372
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:11,424
It's a call!

373
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,558
Come on!

374
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,463
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

375
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:04,762
- Thank you for coming so quickly.
- Jesus!

376
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:07,977
The guests are starting to ask questions,
and I'm running out of excuses.

377
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:09,478
Has it happened before?

378
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,232
Well, most of the original staff
knows about the 12th floor.

379
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:13,896
- The disturbances, I mean.
- Yeah.

380
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:16,986
But it's been quiet for years
up until two weeks ago.

381
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,942
It was never, ever
this bad, though.

382
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:23,159
- Did you ever report it to anyone?
- No. Heavens, no.

383
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,950
The owners don't like us
to even talk about it.

384
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:28,118
I hope we could take
care of this quietly.

385
00:30:28,185 --> 00:30:29,628
- It's done.
- Tonight.

386
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,333
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

387
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,090
We handle this kind
of thing all the time.

388
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:45,602
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of a cosmonaut?

389
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:49,641
No, we're exterminators. Somebody
saw a cockroach up on 12th.

390
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:54,232
- That's gotta be some cockroach.
- Bite your head off, man.

391
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,534
- Going up?
- I'll take the next one.

392
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:05,101
You know, it's just occurred to me

393
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:08,017
we really haven't had a completely
successful test of this equipment.

394
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:10,377
- I blame myself.
- So do I.

395
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,539
- Well, no sense worrying about it now.
- Why worry?

396
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:18,298
Each of us is wearing an unlicensed
nuclear accelerator on his back.

397
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,886
Yep. Well, let's get ready.
Switch me on.

398
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:01,591
What the hell are you doing?

399
00:32:02,946 --> 00:32:05,265
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

400
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,518
We thought you were someone else.

401
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:11,813
Successful test.

402
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:13,940
I guess so.

403
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,561
- I think we'd better split up.
- Good idea.

404
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:18,694
Yeah, we can do more
damage that way.

405
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,468
Venkman? Venkman!

406
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,569
Disgusting blob.

407
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:02,651
I'm gonna have to hold him myself.

408
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,987
Come in, Ray.

409
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:50,530
Venkman! I saw it,
I saw it, I saw it!

410
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:52,702
It's right here, Ray.

411
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:54,453
It's looking at me.

412
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:56,539
<i>He's an ugly little
spud, isn't he?</i>

413
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,203
I think he can hear you, Ray.

414
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:00,288
Don't move. It won't hurt you.

415
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:09,847
Venkman!

416
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:14,303
Venkman! Pete!

417
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,978
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?

418
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,562
He slimed me.

419
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,150
That's great!
Actual physical contact!

420
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:26,485
- Can you move?
<i>- Ray. Ray! Come in, please.</i>

421
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:27,991
I feel so funky.

422
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:30,652
Spengler! I'm with Venkman.

423
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,328
He got slimed!

424
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:34,410
<i>That's great, Ray.
Save some for me.</i>

425
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:37,247
<i>Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.</i>

426
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,747
Okay, we'll be right there.

427
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:44,333
Okay, sir, if you and your staff
could please wait out here,

428
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,843
we'll take care of everything.

429
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,773
There it is. On the ceiling.

430
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,531
That's the one that got me.

431
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,461
All right, boys.

432
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,372
Ready?

433
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:24,881
Throw it!

434
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:35,884
I did that. I did that.

435
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:38,725
- That's my fault.
- It's okay. The table broke the fall.

436
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,723
There's something very important
I forgot to tell you.

437
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,234
- What?
- Don't cross the streams.

438
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,024
- Why?
- It would be bad.

439
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,782
I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing.
What do you mean, "bad"?

440
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,174
Try to imagine all life as you
know it stopping instantaneously

441
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,581
and every molecule in your body
exploding at the speed of light.

442
00:35:57,806 --> 00:35:59,579
Total protonic reversal.

443
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:03,666
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

444
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:08,254
All right, Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.

445
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:17,426
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

446
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:19,344
Ray!

447
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,477
Egon!

448
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,274
Okay, all right.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

449
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:36,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

450
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:38,325
Nice shooting, Tex!

451
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:40,786
I assure you, Mrs. Van Houten,
there is no problem with the room.

452
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:43,293
It'll be ready promptly on time as
soon as your guests are with us.

453
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,545
The last throw took something out
of him, but he's gonna move.

454
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,628
I need some room to put the
trap down. Give me some room.

455
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:51,710
You'll excuse me, please.

456
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:01,178
- Gotta get this in the clear.
- Wait, wait, wait!

457
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:03,972
I've always wanted to do this.

458
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,686
And...

459
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:08,728
- The flowers are still standing!
- Okay, on my go-signal.

460
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:12,147
Spengler, I want a confinement
stream from you, okay? Go!

461
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:15,066
Okay, hold him up there. He's
gonna move. Hold him up!

462
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,655
Go!

463
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:20,329
- It's working, Ray.
- Start bringing him down.

464
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:22,240
You got him. Don't
cross the stream.

465
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:26,583
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy
with a positron collider, huh?

466
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:30,124
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

467
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:33,335
All right, I'm opening the trap now.
Don't look directly into the trap.

468
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,092
I looked at the trap, Ray.

469
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:40,680
Turn your streams off as soon as I close
the trap. Get ready. I'm closing it.

470
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:42,765
Now!

471
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,622
It's in there.

472
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,408
Hey.

473
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:08,162
Well, that wasn't such
a chore, now, was it?

474
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:13,212
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now!

475
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:15,172
Donald, stand over there.

476
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,547
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

477
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,135
Did you see it? What is it?

478
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,641
We got it.

479
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,802
What is it? Will there
be any more of them?

480
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,892
Sir, what you had there was
what we refer to as a focused,

481
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:30,810
non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

482
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,693
Real nasty one too.

483
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:34,695
And now,

484
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:37,478
let's talk seriously. Now,
for the entrapment...

485
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:40,761
we're gonna have to ask you for
four big ones, $4000 for that.

486
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:45,582
But we are having a special this week on
proton charging and storage of the beast.

487
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,243
That's only gonna come to
1000 dollars, fortunately.

488
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:52,004
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

489
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,398
That's all right. We can just
put it right back in there.

490
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,376
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

491
00:38:56,443 --> 00:39:00,093
No! All right! Anything.

492
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:01,598
Thanks so much.

493
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:03,554
Thank you. Hope we
can help you again.

494
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:06,557
Coming through! One class-five
free-roaming vapor.

495
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:09,856
<i>Good Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today the entire Eastern seaboard</i>

496
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,063
<i>is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.</i>

497
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:16,147
<i>Alleged ghost-sightings and
related supernatural occurrences</i>

498
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:18,940
<i>have been reported across
the entire tri-state area.</i>

499
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:21,656
Everybody has heard ghost
stories around the campfire.

500
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:24,992
Heck, my grandma used to spin
yarns about a spectral locomotive

501
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:27,657
that would rocket past the
farm where she grew up.

502
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,918
But now, as if some
unforeseen authority...

503
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:51,648
Stand aside, please!

504
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:55,060
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic today, ghosts and ghostbusting.

505
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,775
The controversy builds,
more sightings are reported.

506
00:39:57,837 --> 00:39:59,439
Some maintain that these

507
00:39:59,506 --> 00:40:03,327
professional paranormal eliminators
in New York are the cause of it all.

508
00:40:08,723 --> 00:40:10,120
I got it! I got it!

509
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:13,123
Pete! Ray!

510
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:24,365
<i>Still making headlines
all across the country,</i>

511
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:28,135
<i>the Ghostbusters are at it again, this
time at the fashionable dance club,</i>

512
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:32,098
<i>The Rose. The boys in gray slugged
it out with a pretty pesky poltergeist,</i>

513
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,731
<i>then stayed on to
dance the night away</i>

514
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:36,223
<i>with some of the lovely ladies
who witnessed the disturbance.</i>

515
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:39,355
<i>This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.</i>

516
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,648
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

517
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:44,530
No job is too big.
No fee is too big.

518
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:48,488
Is it just a mist, or does
it have arms and legs?

519
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:51,283
<i>As they say in TV, I'm sure
there's one big question</i>

520
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,669
<i>on everybody's mind and I imagine
you are the man to answer that.</i>

521
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:57,998
<i>How is Elvis, and have
you seen him lately?</i>

522
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,552
Do you believe in UFOs,
astral projections,

523
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:47,180
mental telepathy,
ESP, clairvoyance,

524
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,387
spirit photography,
telekinetic movement,

525
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,431
full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

526
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:59,726
Uh, if there's a steady paycheck in
it, I'll believe anything you say.

527
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:03,905
I gotta get some sleep. I'm dying.

528
00:42:03,963 --> 00:42:05,485
You don't look good.

529
00:42:05,548 --> 00:42:07,571
- I don't?
- Well, you've looked better.

530
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:09,407
You didn't used to look like this.

531
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:11,492
Can you hold, please?

532
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:14,248
Here's the paper on the
Brooklyn. She paid with Visa.

533
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:16,543
Here's tonight's worksheet.

534
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,374
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

535
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:21,540
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

536
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,585
Beautiful. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

537
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:28,051
- Congratulations.
- Can you help me, please?

538
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:32,968
Welcome aboard.

539
00:42:34,077 --> 00:42:37,074
I don't know where they get these
guest conductors. I mean...

540
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,741
someone should tell him it's not gonna
do much good to scream at us in German.

541
00:42:39,782 --> 00:42:43,061
Well, I don't think that the
man is competent to conduct

542
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,695
a major symphony orchestra.

543
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:51,028
- Um, could you wait here a minute?
- Huh? Uh, sure.

544
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,580
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

545
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,087
- That was a wonderful rehearsal.
- You heard that?

546
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,168
Yes. You're the best
one in your row.

547
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:04,799
Oh, thank you.

548
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:08,503
You're good. Most people can't hear
me with the whole orchestra playing.

549
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:10,404
Ah, I don't have to take
this abuse from you.

550
00:43:10,405 --> 00:43:12,758
I got hundreds of people
dying to abuse me.

551
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,972
I know. You're a big celebrity now.

552
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:18,354
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

553
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,352
Who's the stiff?

554
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:28,072
The stiff happens to be one of the
finest musicians in the world.

555
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:30,074
Do you have some information
for me, please?

556
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,782
Well, sure, but I prefer to
give it to you in private.

557
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:36,289
- Why don't you tell me now?
- Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

558
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:41,954
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the...

559
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,330
What's that word?

560
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,086
- "Hittites."
- Hittites,

561
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:49,344
the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

562
00:43:50,153 --> 00:43:52,722
"Zuul was the minion of Gozer."

563
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,099
What's Gozer?

564
00:43:55,158 --> 00:43:59,479
- Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
- Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

565
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:02,641
I'm working on that. If we could
get together Thursday night,

566
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:06,152
I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

567
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,552
- I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.
- Miss Barrett...

568
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:14,098
you seem to think there is something
wrong up here that says, in your mind:

569
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:17,535
"He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his clients."

570
00:44:17,597 --> 00:44:22,373
No. I'm making a special exception
in your case because...

571
00:44:22,602 --> 00:44:24,045
I respect you.

572
00:44:24,103 --> 00:44:27,392
It's corny, but I respect you as
an artist. And as a dresser too.

573
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:30,402
This is a magnificent coordination
you have going here today.

574
00:44:30,485 --> 00:44:31,828
I'll see you Thursday.

575
00:44:31,854 --> 00:44:35,156
I'll bring the <i>Roylance Guide
</i> and we'll eat and read.

576
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:44,315
- So who the hell is that?
- He's just a friend.

577
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:45,895
- A friend?
- An old friend.

578
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,727
Bye! Well, I'll see you Thursday!

579
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:51,615
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

580
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:54,651
You're still very pale,
though. A little sun.

581
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:57,491
- Well, what does he do?
- He's a scientist.

582
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:13,007
This is where we store all the vapors
and entities and slimers that we trap.

583
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:18,551
Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system.

584
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,059
Insert the trap.

585
00:45:21,828 --> 00:45:23,896
Release.

586
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:28,439
Close, lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

587
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:30,065
Neutronize your field.

588
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,192
And...

589
00:45:32,255 --> 00:45:34,983
when the light is green,
the trap is clean.

590
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:38,119
The ghost is incarcerated here in
our custom-made storage facility.

591
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:41,872
There's a man from the EPA here to
see you. He's waiting in your office.

592
00:45:41,931 --> 00:45:44,659
- EPA? What's he want?
- I don't know.

593
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:47,829
All I do know is I've been working
two weeks without a break,

594
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:50,714
and you promised me
you'd hire more help.

595
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:53,217
Janine, someone with
your qualifications

596
00:45:53,276 --> 00:45:57,256
would have no trouble finding
a topflight job in either

597
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,265
the food service or
housekeeping industries.

598
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:05,104
- Are you gonna answer that?
- I've quit better jobs than this.

599
00:46:05,705 --> 00:46:07,728
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

600
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,484
- Can I help you?
- I'm Walter Peck.

601
00:46:10,585 --> 00:46:14,315
I represent the Environmental
Protection Agency, the third district.

602
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,983
Great. How's it going down there?

603
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,203
Are you Peter Venkman?

604
00:46:22,096 --> 00:46:23,789
Yes, I'm...

605
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,291
Dr. Venkman.

606
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,248
Exactly what are you a
doctor of, Mr. Venkman?

607
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:31,836
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in
parapsychology and psychology.

608
00:46:32,481 --> 00:46:34,424
I see.

609
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:37,462
And now you catch ghosts.

610
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,630
Yeah. You could say that.

611
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:42,638
And how many ghosts have
you caught, Mr. Venkman?

612
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,474
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- And where do you put

613
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:48,515
these ghosts once you catch them?

614
00:46:48,623 --> 00:46:51,146
Into a storage facility.

615
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:54,646
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

616
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:59,488
- Yes.
- And may I see this storage facility?

617
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,029
No. And why not, Mr. Venkman?

618
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:07,826
Because you did not
use the magic word.

619
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:13,752
What is the magic
word, Mr. Venkman?

620
00:47:14,982 --> 00:47:16,425
"Please."

621
00:47:17,693 --> 00:47:21,548
May I please see the storage
facility, Mr. Venkman?

622
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:23,424
Why do you want to see
the storage facility?

623
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:25,680
Well, because I'm curious.

624
00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:28,266
I want to know more
about what you do here.

625
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,269
Frankly, there've been a lot
of wild stories in the media

626
00:47:31,332 --> 00:47:35,861
and we want to assess any possible
environmental impact from your operation.

627
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,068
For instance, the
presence of noxious,

628
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:41,526
possibly hazardous waste
chemicals in your basement.

629
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:45,913
Now, you either show me what is down
there, or I come back with a court order.

630
00:47:46,806 --> 00:47:51,002
You go get a court order, and I'll sue
your ass for wrongful prosecution!

631
00:47:51,686 --> 00:47:54,539
You can have it your
way, Mr. Venkman.

632
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:56,958
I'm worried, Ray. It's
getting crowded in there,

633
00:47:56,984 --> 00:48:00,416
and all my recent data points to
something big on the horizon.

634
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:02,718
What do you mean "big"?

635
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:07,723
Well, let's say this Twinkie
represents the normal amount

636
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:10,434
of psychokinetic energy
in the New York area.

637
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:14,351
According to this morning's
sample, it would be a Twinkie

638
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:18,067
35 feet long, weighing
approximately 600 pounds.

639
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,153
That's a big Twinkie.

640
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:23,738
We could be on the verge
of a fourfold cross-rip,

641
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:27,246
a PKE surge of incredible,
even dangerous, proportions.

642
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:31,292
We just had a visit from the
Environmental Protection Agency.

643
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,623
- How's the grid holding up?
- Not good.

644
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:35,671
Tell him about the Twinkie.

645
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:38,169
What about the Twinkie?

646
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:35,682
- Oh, Dana, it's you.
- Hello, Louis.

647
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:38,689
You gotta come in here. You're
missing a classic party.

648
00:49:38,793 --> 00:49:43,023
Yes, well, I would, Louis,
but I have a date coming.

649
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:47,860
You made a date

650
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:54,285
- tonight?
- Well, I... I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

651
00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:59,084
Oh, that's okay. You
can bring him along.

652
00:49:59,438 --> 00:50:02,712
All right. Maybe
we'll stop by, okay?

653
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:04,734
That's great. I'll tell
everybody you're coming.

654
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,805
We're gonna play Twister, we're
gonna do some breakdancing...

655
00:50:07,863 --> 00:50:09,761
Hey...

656
00:50:10,491 --> 00:50:14,391
Hey, let me in! It's Louis!
Somebody, let me in!

657
00:50:39,395 --> 00:50:41,042
Hello?

658
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,299
Oh, hi, Mom.

659
00:50:43,357 --> 00:50:45,130
I've been busy.

660
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:47,795
Well... No, everything is fine.

661
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:51,182
Yeah. No, just that one time.

662
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,434
Oh, I am.

663
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,053
I will.

664
00:50:57,204 --> 00:51:01,980
I won't. Mom, um,
I have to go. I have a date.

665
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:06,356
Yes. No, no one you know. It's...

666
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:10,113
Well, he's a Ghostbuster.

667
00:51:10,593 --> 00:51:12,866
Those guys on TV.

668
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:15,622
Yes, well, I'll have
to let you know.

669
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:18,250
Okay. Love to Dad.

670
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:22,004
Right. Bye. Bye.

671
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,439
Oh, Shit.

672
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:19,178
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength Tylenol?

673
00:52:19,245 --> 00:52:22,565
Gee, I think all I got is
acetylsalicylic acid. Generic.

674
00:52:22,623 --> 00:52:26,569
See, I can get 600 tablets of that for
the same price as 300 of the name brand.

675
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:28,980
That makes good financial
sense. Good advice.

676
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:31,820
Hey, this is real smoked salmon
from Nova Scotia, Canada,

677
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,325
24.95 a pound.

678
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,578
It only cost me 14.12
after tax, though.

679
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:37,720
I'm giving this whole thing
as a promotional expense.

680
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:41,746
That's why I invited clients instead of
friends. You having a good time, Marv?

681
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:44,583
How you doing? Why don't you have some
of the Brie. It's at room temperature.

682
00:52:44,645 --> 00:52:46,479
You think it's too warm
in here for the Brie?

683
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,753
Louis, I'm going home.

684
00:52:48,816 --> 00:52:51,590
Don't leave yet. Listen,
maybe if we start dancing,

685
00:52:51,652 --> 00:52:53,754
other people will join in.

686
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:55,764
Okay.

687
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,429
Oh, don't move. I just
gotta get the door.

688
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,564
- Ted! Annette!
- Hi.

689
00:53:04,623 --> 00:53:07,101
I'm glad you could come. How
you doing? Give me your coats.

690
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,736
Everybody, this is Ted
and Annette Fleming.

691
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:11,238
How are you?

692
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:14,241
Ted has a small carpet-cleaning
business in receivership.

693
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,654
Annette's drawing a salary from a
deferred bonus from two years ago.

694
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,870
They got 15,000 left on
the house at 8 percent.

695
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,410
So they're okay!

696
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:26,829
Does anybody want
to play Parcheesi?

697
00:53:29,857 --> 00:53:31,755
Okay, who brought the dog?

698
00:53:53,547 --> 00:53:58,699
Help! There's a bear loose
in my apartment! Help! Help!

699
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,448
Help!

700
00:54:02,514 --> 00:54:05,663
- What?
- A bear in his apartment.

701
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,378
I'm gonna bring this up at
the next tenants' meeting.

702
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:15,761
There's not supposed to be
any pets in the building.

703
00:54:30,709 --> 00:54:35,531
Let me in. There's gotta be
a way in here. I gotta get...

704
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:41,613
Somebody, let me in!

705
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,253
Nice doggy.

706
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:51,379
Cute little pooch.

707
00:54:51,438 --> 00:54:54,417
Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.

708
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:15,817
- Hey, what happened?
- Some moron brought

709
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:19,074
a cougar to a party,
and it went berserk.

710
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:24,747
Hi, I'm going up to
Dana Barrett's. Okay.

711
00:55:43,365 --> 00:55:45,513
Hello?

712
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,560
That's a different look
for you, isn't it?

713
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:52,770
Are you the Keymaster?

714
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,654
Not that I know of.

715
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:10,617
Are you the Keymaster?

716
00:56:10,684 --> 00:56:12,127
Yes.

717
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:15,464
I'm a friend of his. He
told me to meet him here.

718
00:56:16,023 --> 00:56:18,672
- I didn't get your name.
- I am Zuul.

719
00:56:18,734 --> 00:56:21,007
I am the Gatekeeper.

720
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:22,842
Oh.

721
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,647
- What are we doing today, Zuul?
- Must prepare for the coming of Gozer.

722
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:33,978
Gozer, huh?

723
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,810
The Destructor.

724
00:56:44,927 --> 00:56:46,370
Are we still going out?

725
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:53,084
You know, you could pick up the
place if you're expecting someone.

726
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:56,668
Do you want this body?

727
00:56:57,231 --> 00:56:58,799
Is this a trick question?

728
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:04,680
I guess the roses worked, huh?

729
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:06,886
Take me now,

730
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:08,676
sub-creature.

731
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:10,685
We never talk anymore.

732
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:16,810
Easy. I make it a rule never to get
involved with possessed people.

733
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:20,862
Actually, it's more of a
guideline than a rule.

734
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:22,443
You know, I can...

735
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:25,029
I want you inside me.

736
00:57:26,218 --> 00:57:27,945
Go ahead. No, I can't.

737
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,830
Sounds like you got at least
two people in there already.

738
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:32,832
Might be a little crowded.

739
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:35,244
Come on, why don't
you just quit trying

740
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,539
to upset and disturb
Dr. Venkman and just relax.

741
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:42,255
Lie down there. Relax.
Put your hands on your chest.

742
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:45,261
What I'd really like
to do is talk to Dana.

743
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,297
I want to talk to Dana.

744
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:48,886
Dana, it's Peter.

745
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:52,770
There is no Dana.
There is only Zuul.

746
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,893
Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Now, come on.

747
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,816
Come on, I want to
talk to Dana. Dana.

748
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:00,353
Just relax. Come on. Dana.

749
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:02,396
Dana. Can I talk to Dana?

750
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:06,317
There is no Dana, only Zuul.

751
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:09,077
What a lovely singing
voice you must have.

752
00:58:09,136 --> 00:58:11,238
Now, I'm gonna count
to three, Zuulie.

753
00:58:11,305 --> 00:58:12,998
And if I don't talk to Dana...

754
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,869
there's gonna be some real trouble
in this apartment, I think.

755
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:18,457
One.

756
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,504
Two.

757
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:25,757
Two and a half.

758
00:59:09,363 --> 00:59:11,181
Please come down.

759
00:59:13,075 --> 00:59:18,352
I am the Keymaster. The
Destructor is coming.

760
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:21,524
The Traveler. The Destroyer.

761
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:29,449
Gatekeeper.

762
00:59:35,055 --> 00:59:36,498
I am Vinz.

763
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:39,079
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

764
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,837
Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the
Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

765
00:59:42,896 --> 00:59:45,966
Hey, he pulls the wagon, I make
the deals. You want a ride?

766
00:59:55,075 --> 00:59:58,850
Wait for the sign. Then all
prisoners will be released.

767
00:59:58,912 --> 01:00:02,607
You will perish in flame, you
and all your kind! Gatekeeper!

768
01:00:02,874 --> 01:00:04,317
What an asshole.

769
01:00:10,632 --> 01:00:13,531
- Dropping off or picking up?
- Dropping off.

770
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:15,695
Just a moment.

771
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:20,917
- You a Ghostbuster?
- Yes.

772
01:00:20,976 --> 01:00:23,436
We picked up this guy. Now we
don't know what to do with him.

773
01:00:23,437 --> 01:00:26,040
Bellevue doesn't want him, and I'm
afraid to put him in the lock up.

774
01:00:26,106 --> 01:00:29,130
I know you guys are into this stuff,
so I figured we'd check with you.

775
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,885
All right.

776
01:00:33,822 --> 01:00:36,050
Are you the Gatekeeper?

777
01:00:38,952 --> 01:00:41,396
You better bring him inside.

778
01:00:42,414 --> 01:00:45,017
You are so kind to
take care of that man.

779
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,060
You know, you are a
real humanitarian.

780
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:49,696
I don't think he's human.

781
01:00:57,554 --> 01:00:59,201
What did you say your name was?

782
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,413
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

783
01:01:02,476 --> 01:01:04,749
According to this, his
name's Louis Tully.

784
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:07,334
Lives on Central Park West.

785
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,509
Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

786
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:13,719
- Do I?
- Yes, have some.

787
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,218
Yes, have some.

788
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:20,598
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

789
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,513
- What sign are you waiting for?
- Gozer the Traveler.

790
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,933
He will come in one of
the pre-chosen forms.

791
01:01:25,999 --> 01:01:30,354
During the rectification of the Vuldronaii,
the Traveler came as a large Torb.

792
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:34,282
Then, during the third reconciliation of
the last of the Meketrex supplicants,

793
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:37,786
they chose a new form for
him, that of a giant Sloar!

794
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:40,447
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew
what it was to be roasted

795
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:43,283
in the depths of the Sloar
that day, I can tell you.

796
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:46,795
- Egon.
- Excuse me.

797
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:51,962
There's something very
strange about that man.

798
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:56,922
Listen, I'm usually very psychic,
and I have a terrible feeling

799
01:01:56,988 --> 01:02:00,183
that something awful is
gonna happen to you.

800
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,679
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

801
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:07,266
I'll get it.

802
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:12,229
- Hello?
<i>- Egon, it's Peter.</i>

803
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,649
- Thanks, I've got it.
- I have news from the world of Gozer.

804
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:18,989
<i>- What is it, Peter?</i>
- I'm here with Dana Barrett.

805
01:02:19,052 --> 01:02:21,780
It seems the Goz has
been putting some moves

806
01:02:21,847 --> 01:02:24,996
- on my would-be girlfriend.
<i>- How is she?</i>

807
01:02:25,058 --> 01:02:28,662
I think we can get her a
guest shot on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

808
01:02:28,728 --> 01:02:31,798
I just whacked her up with
about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

809
01:02:31,857 --> 01:02:36,087
She's gonna take a little nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

810
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:38,676
- Does that make any sense to you?
<i>- Some.</i>

811
01:02:38,738 --> 01:02:41,432
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

812
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,344
Oh, wonderful. We have to
get these two together.

813
01:02:46,746 --> 01:02:49,269
I think that would be
extraordinarily dangerous.

814
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,777
Okay, well, hold onto him.
I'll be there in a little while.

815
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:55,155
Good.

816
01:02:55,213 --> 01:03:00,240
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find
Ray. I need him here immediately.

817
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:08,206
Bad news, honey,
I gotta go to work.

818
01:03:08,268 --> 01:03:11,247
Hey, will you stay here
in bed until I get back?

819
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:24,058
Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?

820
01:03:24,117 --> 01:03:25,218
Never met him.

821
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:29,891
Yeah, well, I do. And I love
Jesus' style, you know?

822
01:03:29,956 --> 01:03:34,027
This roof cap is made of a
magnesium-tungsten alloy.

823
01:03:34,085 --> 01:03:36,529
What are you so
involved with there?

824
01:03:36,588 --> 01:03:38,847
These are the blueprints for
the structural ironwork

825
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:42,815
in Dana Barrett's apartment building,
and they're very, very strange.

826
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:46,703
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the Bible about

827
01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:50,870
the last days, when the dead
would rise from the grave?

828
01:03:51,186 --> 01:03:54,085
I remember Revelations 7:12.

829
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:56,709
And I looked as he
opened the sixth seal.

830
01:03:56,775 --> 01:03:58,843
And behold, there was
a great earthquake.

831
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:01,425
And the sun became as
black as sackcloth.

832
01:04:01,696 --> 01:04:03,343
And the moon became as blood.

833
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:06,430
And the seas boiled.
And the skies fell.

834
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:11,098
- Judgment day.
- Judgment day.

835
01:04:11,164 --> 01:04:14,268
Every ancient religion has its own
myth about the end of the world.

836
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:18,109
Myth? Ray, has it
ever occurred to you

837
01:04:18,213 --> 01:04:20,441
that maybe the reason
we've been so busy lately

838
01:04:20,507 --> 01:04:23,736
is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

839
01:04:28,723 --> 01:04:33,329
- How about a little music?
- Yeah.

840
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,789
This way.

841
01:05:22,235 --> 01:05:23,549
Excuse me.

842
01:05:24,275 --> 01:05:26,831
Excuse me. Just where do
you think you're going?

843
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:30,139
Step aside, miss, or I'll have you arrested
for interfering with the police...

844
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:32,850
Oh, no. Hold on. I've seen TV.
I know you can't come in here

845
01:05:32,912 --> 01:05:34,580
without a warrant or
a writ or something.

846
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:37,810
Cease and Desist All Commerce order.
Seizure of Premises and Chattels.

847
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:40,775
Ban on the use of Public Utilities
for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers

848
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:43,690
and a federal Entry
and Inspection order.

849
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,951
Vinz, there's one more
test I'd like to perform.

850
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:51,365
Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

851
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:55,206
- Excuse me, this is private property.
- Shut this off. Shut these all off.

852
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:58,129
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines would be extremely hazardous.

853
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:00,848
I'll tell you what's hazardous.
You're facing federal prosecution

854
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:03,176
for at least a half a dozen
environmental violations.

855
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:05,934
Now, either you shut off these
beams, or we shut them off for you.

856
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,477
Try to understand, this is a
high-voltage laser containment system.

857
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,389
Simply turning it off would be
like dropping a bomb in the city.

858
01:06:16,456 --> 01:06:19,901
Don't patronize me. I'm not grotesquely
stupid, like the people you bilk.

859
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:21,633
At ease, officer.
I'm Peter Venkman.

860
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:23,545
I think there's just been a
slight misunderstanding,

861
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,740
and I want to cooperate
in any way that I can.

862
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:28,322
Forget it, Venkman. You had
your chance to cooperate,

863
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:32,240
but you thought it'd be more fun to
insult me. Now it is my turn, wiseass.

864
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:34,407
He wants to shut down the
protection grid, Peter.

865
01:06:34,474 --> 01:06:37,295
You shut that thing down, and we are
not gonna be held responsible...

866
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:41,165
- You'll be responsible. Shut it off.
- No, we won't be held responsible.

867
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:44,335
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

868
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,088
I've never seen anything like
this before. I don't know...

869
01:06:48,154 --> 01:06:51,758
Yeah, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

870
01:06:52,992 --> 01:06:56,187
- My friend, don't be a jerk.
- Step aside.

871
01:06:56,254 --> 01:06:57,897
If he does that again,
you can shoot him.

872
01:06:57,956 --> 01:07:00,290
You do your job, pencil-neck.
Don't tell me how to do mine.

873
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:03,110
- Thank you, officer.
- Shut it off!

874
01:07:25,692 --> 01:07:27,260
Oh, shit.

875
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:44,982
Clear the building!

876
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:17,010
This is it. This is the sign.

877
01:08:17,076 --> 01:08:21,101
Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
We're going out of business.

878
01:08:30,965 --> 01:08:33,113
Hey, aim up there.

879
01:08:33,468 --> 01:08:35,491
- What happened?
- Storage facility blew.

880
01:08:35,553 --> 01:08:38,202
- He shut off the protection grid.
- Oh, great.

881
01:08:38,264 --> 01:08:40,162
- That's bad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

882
01:08:40,225 --> 01:08:42,874
- Where's the Keymaster?
- Shit.

883
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:45,375
- Who's the Keymaster?
- Oh, come on.

884
01:08:45,605 --> 01:08:48,504
Hold it. I want this man arrested.

885
01:08:48,566 --> 01:08:52,136
These men are in criminal violation
of the Environmental Protection Act.

886
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:54,889
- This explosion is a direct result of it.
- Your mother!

887
01:08:54,989 --> 01:08:57,387
Come on, hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

888
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:47,768
Columbia Building, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle.

889
01:10:41,888 --> 01:10:44,161
Hey, guard!

890
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,667
Look, I want to make a phone call.

891
01:10:46,726 --> 01:10:49,329
I just work with these guys.
I mean, I wasn't even there.

892
01:10:49,395 --> 01:10:52,669
The structure of this roof cap is exactly
like the kind of telemetry tracker

893
01:10:52,732 --> 01:10:56,837
that NASA uses to identify
dead pulsars in deep space.

894
01:10:56,903 --> 01:11:03,010
Cold-riveted girders with
cores of pure selenium.

895
01:11:03,117 --> 01:11:05,345
Everybody getting this so far?

896
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:08,811
So what? I guess they just don't
make them like they used to, huh?

897
01:11:08,873 --> 01:11:11,317
No. Nobody ever
made them like this.

898
01:11:11,376 --> 01:11:16,198
I mean, the architect was either a
certified genius or an authentic wacko.

899
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:19,450
Ray, for a moment,

900
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:22,704
pretend that I don't know
anything about metallurgy,

901
01:11:22,762 --> 01:11:28,164
engineering or physics and just
tell me what the hell is going on.

902
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:30,374
You never studied.

903
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:34,799
The whole building is a huge
superconductive antenna

904
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,380
that was designed and built
expressly for the purpose

905
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:40,717
of pulling in and concentrating
spiritual turbulence.

906
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:46,558
Your girlfriend lives in the
corner penthouse of spook central.

907
01:11:47,954 --> 01:11:51,866
She's not my girlfriend.
I find her interesting because

908
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:54,252
she's a client and because
she sleeps above her covers.

909
01:11:54,293 --> 01:11:58,398
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drools. She claws.

910
01:11:58,464 --> 01:12:01,033
It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building.

911
01:12:01,092 --> 01:12:03,130
Something terrible is
about to enter our world,

912
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:07,372
and this building is obviously the door.
The architect's name was Ivo Shandor.

913
01:12:07,432 --> 01:12:11,162
I found it in <i>Tobin's Spirit Guide.</i>
He was also a doctor.

914
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:13,830
He performed a lot of
unnecessary surgery.

915
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:16,875
And then, in 1920, he
started a secret society.

916
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:20,841
- Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
- Right.

917
01:12:21,612 --> 01:12:23,214
No studying.

918
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:28,933
After the first World War, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

919
01:12:32,331 --> 01:12:35,605
And he wasn't alone. He had close to
a thousand followers when he died.

920
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:37,733
They conducted rituals
up on the roof,

921
01:12:37,795 --> 01:12:41,445
bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end of the world.

922
01:12:41,507 --> 01:12:44,611
And now it looks like
it may actually happen.

923
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,244
<i>So be good
For goodness' sake</i>

924
01:12:49,307 --> 01:12:51,284
<i>Whoa, somebody's coming</i>

925
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:54,124
We have to get out of here. We've
gotta find a judge or something.

926
01:12:54,228 --> 01:12:57,798
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.

927
01:12:58,024 --> 01:13:00,126
Are we actually going to go
before a federal judge and say

928
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:03,547
that some moldy Babylonian god is
gonna drop in on Central Park West

929
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:06,808
- and start tearing up the city?
- Sumerian, not Babylonian.

930
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:09,640
- Yeah, big difference.
- No offense,

931
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:11,471
but I gotta get my own lawyer.

932
01:13:11,537 --> 01:13:14,265
Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor
wants to see you guys.

933
01:13:14,332 --> 01:13:16,355
The whole island's
going crazy. Let's go.

934
01:13:16,542 --> 01:13:19,646
I gotta split. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

935
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:47,344
- I am the Keymaster.
- I am the Gatekeeper.

936
01:14:29,574 --> 01:14:34,225
- Back. Back. Stay back.
- Stay back. Stay back.

937
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:44,739
I've got a city blowing up, and you
guys are not giving me any answers.

938
01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:47,909
We're blocking the
bridges, the roads...

939
01:14:47,967 --> 01:14:49,569
The Ghostbusters are
here, Mr. Mayor.

940
01:14:49,635 --> 01:14:52,488
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

941
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,248
Hey, and where's this Peck?

942
01:14:54,307 --> 01:14:58,503
Peck. I am Walter Peck, sir, and
I'm prepared to make a full report.

943
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:01,039
These men are consummate
snowball artists.

944
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:04,004
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce hallucinations.

945
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,511
People think they're seeing ghosts,
and they call these bozos,

946
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:10,093
who conveniently show up
to deal with the problem

947
01:15:10,156 --> 01:15:12,099
with a fake electronic light show.

948
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:15,102
Everything was fine with our
system until the power grid

949
01:15:15,161 --> 01:15:18,891
- was shut off by dickless here.
- They caused an explosion.

950
01:15:18,956 --> 01:15:24,187
- Is this true?
- Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

951
01:15:25,671 --> 01:15:29,742
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!

952
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,743
- All right.
- Well, that's what I heard.

953
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:33,370
This is City Hall.

954
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:36,578
Now, what am I gonna do
here, John? What is this?

955
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:39,460
All I know is that was no light
show we saw this morning.

956
01:15:39,518 --> 01:15:43,543
I've seen every form of
combustion known to man,

957
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:45,583
but this beats the hell out of me.

958
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:48,219
The walls in the 53rd
Precinct were bleeding.

959
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,880
- How do you explain that?
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

960
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:52,640
Oh, Your Eminence.

961
01:15:58,496 --> 01:16:01,224
- How are you, Lenny?
- You're looking good, Mike.

962
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:04,985
We're in a real fix here. What
do you think I should do?

963
01:16:05,044 --> 01:16:08,068
Lenny, officially, the church
will not take any position

964
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,609
on the religious implications
of these phenomena.

965
01:16:11,676 --> 01:16:13,278
Personally, Lenny...

966
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:17,661
I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

967
01:16:17,932 --> 01:16:19,557
I think that's a smart move, Mike.

968
01:16:19,558 --> 01:16:21,331
I'm not gonna call
a press conference

969
01:16:21,435 --> 01:16:24,334
and tell everyone to start praying.

970
01:16:24,438 --> 01:16:25,960
Uh...

971
01:16:26,232 --> 01:16:29,131
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

972
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:31,671
Look, I've only been with the
company for a couple weeks.

973
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:34,511
But I gotta tell you,
these things are real.

974
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:38,686
Since I joined these men, I have
seen shit that'll turn you white.

975
01:16:39,453 --> 01:16:41,180
Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker.

976
01:16:41,247 --> 01:16:43,850
- My name is Peck.
- Or you could accept the fact

977
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:47,437
that this city is headed for a
disaster of biblical proportions.

978
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:51,324
- Well, what do you mean, "biblical"?
- What he means is Old Testament.

979
01:16:51,382 --> 01:16:53,610
- Real wrath-of-God-type stuff.
- Exactly.

980
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:57,201
Fire and brimstone coming down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.

981
01:16:57,263 --> 01:16:59,832
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. Volcanoes.

982
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,349
Dead rising from the grave.

983
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,542
Human sacrifice.

984
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:05,545
Dogs and cats living together.
Mass hysteria.

985
01:17:05,604 --> 01:17:07,877
Enough! I get the point.

986
01:17:09,608 --> 01:17:11,051
But what if you're wrong?

987
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:14,555
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jail, peacefully, quietly.

988
01:17:14,613 --> 01:17:18,217
We'll enjoy it. But if I'm right,

989
01:17:18,284 --> 01:17:21,558
and we can stop this thing...

990
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:27,147
Lenny, you will have
saved the lives

991
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:31,564
of millions of registered voters.

992
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:40,907
I don't believe you're seriously
considering listening to these men.

993
01:17:48,147 --> 01:17:50,750
Get him out of here.

994
01:17:50,816 --> 01:17:53,544
- Bye.
- I'll fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

995
01:17:53,611 --> 01:17:56,555
I'm gonna get you a nice fruit
basket. I'm going to miss him.

996
01:17:56,614 --> 01:17:58,136
All right. All right.

997
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:02,053
We got work to do. Now,
what do you need from me?

998
01:18:15,841 --> 01:18:17,943
Come on, let's run some red lights!

999
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:22,762
Hello, New York.

1000
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:31,684
Hello, everybody!

1001
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:35,195
Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

1002
01:19:35,254 --> 01:19:38,528
Thank you. They love you.
They love you here.

1003
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:43,659
- I like that shirt, friend.
- Ghostbusters! All right!

1004
01:19:46,223 --> 01:19:49,452
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

1005
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,371
Okay, whatever happens,
let's be professional.

1006
01:20:23,969 --> 01:20:27,073
We might have to put a little
overtime in on this one.

1007
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:25,139
There they are. There they are.

1008
01:21:31,787 --> 01:21:34,606
I was in no way prepared for that.

1009
01:21:35,374 --> 01:21:38,478
It's all right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handle it.

1010
01:21:38,544 --> 01:21:40,988
We can take it. They
want to play rough.

1011
01:21:41,046 --> 01:21:45,652
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1012
01:21:47,261 --> 01:21:48,954
- Wanna play rough?
- Yeah.

1013
01:21:49,013 --> 01:21:50,865
Let's do it.

1014
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:17,937
Where are we?

1015
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,196
It looks like we're in
the teens somewhere.

1016
01:22:22,296 --> 01:22:26,651
Well, when we get to 20,
tell me. I'm gonna throw up.

1017
01:22:58,123 --> 01:23:02,854
- Twenty-two. Is this it?
- Yep.

1018
01:23:11,637 --> 01:23:14,411
Art deco. Very nice.

1019
01:23:14,473 --> 01:23:17,452
- Where is it?
- It's at the end of the hall.

1020
01:23:57,808 --> 01:24:00,536
Hey, where do these stairs go?

1021
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,753
They go up.

1022
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:12,055
Okay, go ahead. Come on. Go ahead.

1023
01:24:13,031 --> 01:24:15,133
Watch it. Go ahead.

1024
01:24:54,323 --> 01:24:55,800
Dana.

1025
01:25:10,047 --> 01:25:14,152
Okay, so she's a dog.

1026
01:25:53,507 --> 01:25:55,325
It's a girl.

1027
01:26:00,597 --> 01:26:03,075
- It's Gozer.
- I thought Gozer was a man.

1028
01:26:03,141 --> 01:26:07,087
- It's whatever it wants to be.
- Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1029
01:26:07,145 --> 01:26:08,747
Right.

1030
01:26:09,314 --> 01:26:11,416
Go get her, Ray!

1031
01:26:23,662 --> 01:26:25,935
Gozer the Gozerian?

1032
01:26:28,166 --> 01:26:33,363
Good evening. As a duly designated
representative of the city,

1033
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:35,240
county and state of New York,

1034
01:26:35,299 --> 01:26:37,902
I order you to cease any and
all supernatural activity

1035
01:26:37,968 --> 01:26:39,945
and return forthwith to
your place of origin

1036
01:26:40,053 --> 01:26:42,952
or to the nearest convenient
parallel dimension.

1037
01:26:43,056 --> 01:26:45,784
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

1038
01:26:45,851 --> 01:26:48,545
Are you a god?

1039
01:26:54,943 --> 01:27:00,470
- No.
- Then die!

1040
01:27:24,222 --> 01:27:30,455
Ray, when someone asks you if
you're a god, you say, "Yes."

1041
01:27:31,021 --> 01:27:35,843
All right. This chick is toast.

1042
01:27:48,038 --> 01:27:50,641
- Got your stick?
- Holding it.

1043
01:27:52,584 --> 01:27:54,152
Heat them up!

1044
01:27:54,503 --> 01:27:56,025
Smoking!

1045
01:27:56,588 --> 01:27:59,532
- Make them hard.
- Ready!

1046
01:27:59,591 --> 01:28:02,945
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

1047
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:06,998
Throw it!

1048
01:28:15,774 --> 01:28:19,720
- Nimble little minx, isn't she?
- We better go full stream.

1049
01:28:19,778 --> 01:28:22,176
Aim for the flattop.

1050
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:33,725
Wasn't so hard.

1051
01:28:39,965 --> 01:28:41,567
We neutronized it.

1052
01:28:41,633 --> 01:28:44,361
You know what that means?
A complete particle reversal.

1053
01:28:44,428 --> 01:28:47,372
And we had the tools.
We had the talent.

1054
01:28:47,431 --> 01:28:49,829
It's Miller time.

1055
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:54,667
- Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
- Oh, no.

1056
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,332
What?

1057
01:29:05,782 --> 01:29:07,600
Look out!

1058
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:36,296
Sub-creatures. Gozer the
Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor,

1059
01:29:36,354 --> 01:29:41,085
Volguus Zildrohar the
Traveler has come.

1060
01:29:41,151 --> 01:29:44,130
Choose and perish.

1061
01:29:44,237 --> 01:29:47,807
What do you mean, "choose"?
We don't understand.

1062
01:29:47,866 --> 01:29:53,644
Choose. Choose the form
of the Destructor.

1063
01:29:53,747 --> 01:29:58,444
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Oh, very cute.

1064
01:29:58,877 --> 01:30:01,821
Whatever we think of. If we
think of J. Edgar Hoover,

1065
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,280
J. Edgar Hoover will appear and
destroy us, so empty your heads.

1066
01:30:05,342 --> 01:30:08,321
Don't think of anything. We've
only got one shot at this.

1067
01:30:08,386 --> 01:30:12,332
- The choice is made.
- Whoa!

1068
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:14,743
The Traveler has come.

1069
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,004
Nobody choosed anything.

1070
01:30:17,062 --> 01:30:18,630
- Did you choose anything?
- No.

1071
01:30:18,688 --> 01:30:20,189
- Did you?
- My mind is totally blank.

1072
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:22,668
I didn't choose anything!

1073
01:30:32,202 --> 01:30:34,179
I couldn't help it.

1074
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,353
It just popped in there.

1075
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:41,611
What? What just popped in there?

1076
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:44,649
- I tried to think...
- Look!

1077
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:48,156
- No! It can't be.
- What is it?

1078
01:30:48,218 --> 01:30:50,036
- It can't be.
- What did you do, Ray?

1079
01:30:50,095 --> 01:30:52,323
Oh, shit.

1080
01:31:03,108 --> 01:31:05,302
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1081
01:31:36,808 --> 01:31:38,910
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1082
01:31:38,977 --> 01:31:40,920
I tried to think of the
most harmless thing.

1083
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:43,081
Something I loved
from my childhood.

1084
01:31:43,148 --> 01:31:48,095
Something that could never, ever
possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1085
01:31:48,153 --> 01:31:50,255
Nice thinking, Ray.

1086
01:31:51,156 --> 01:31:53,258
We used to roast Stay
Puft marshmallows

1087
01:31:53,325 --> 01:31:55,268
by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1088
01:31:56,953 --> 01:32:01,274
Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1089
01:32:01,499 --> 01:32:06,776
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

1090
01:32:16,681 --> 01:32:19,785
- Oh, no.
- Mother pus bucket.

1091
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:27,088
Nobody steps on a
church in my town.

1092
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:30,220
One, two, three, roast him.

1093
01:32:49,923 --> 01:32:51,650
Funny, us going out like this.

1094
01:32:51,716 --> 01:32:54,160
Killed by a 100-foot
marshmallow man.

1095
01:32:54,219 --> 01:32:57,520
We've been going about this all wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is okay. He's a sailor.

1096
01:32:57,555 --> 01:33:01,501
He's in New York. We get this guy
laid, we won't have any trouble.

1097
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:08,462
I have a radical idea. The
door swings both ways.

1098
01:33:08,525 --> 01:33:11,128
We could reverse the particle
flow through the gate.

1099
01:33:11,194 --> 01:33:13,137
How?

1100
01:33:13,196 --> 01:33:15,515
- We'll cross the streams.
- Excuse me, Egon.

1101
01:33:15,573 --> 01:33:17,471
You said crossing the
streams was bad.

1102
01:33:17,534 --> 01:33:20,763
- Cross the streams.
- You're gonna endanger us.

1103
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:22,681
You're gonna endanger our client,

1104
01:33:22,747 --> 01:33:25,851
the nice lady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1105
01:33:25,959 --> 01:33:30,155
Not necessarily. There's definitely
a very slim chance we'll survive.

1106
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,615
I love this plan. I'm excited to
be a part of it. Let's do it.

1107
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:43,502
This job is definitely not
worth 11,500 a year.

1108
01:33:47,022 --> 01:33:48,624
Hurry.

1109
01:33:50,483 --> 01:33:52,961
See you on the other side, Ray.

1110
01:33:55,113 --> 01:33:57,887
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1111
01:34:06,124 --> 01:34:07,897
Let's turn them on, Spengler!

1112
01:34:11,046 --> 01:34:13,399
Now, Spengler!

1113
01:34:18,595 --> 01:34:20,572
Get out of here!

1114
01:35:13,650 --> 01:35:16,048
- Winston.
- Yeah.

1115
01:35:16,111 --> 01:35:17,963
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1116
01:35:23,076 --> 01:35:24,644
Venkman?

1117
01:35:24,702 --> 01:35:26,145
Spengler!

1118
01:35:27,038 --> 01:35:28,640
Venkman!

1119
01:35:31,876 --> 01:35:33,478
Spengler.

1120
01:35:34,796 --> 01:35:37,740
Oh, Spengler. Oh, are you okay?

1121
01:35:37,799 --> 01:35:39,993
I feel like the floor of a taxicab.

1122
01:35:40,093 --> 01:35:42,321
- Venky!
- Yeah, where are you?

1123
01:35:42,387 --> 01:35:44,831
Oh, thank God.

1124
01:35:45,849 --> 01:35:47,667
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

1125
01:35:47,725 --> 01:35:49,293
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

1126
01:35:49,352 --> 01:35:51,750
- You all right?
- Yeah. You okay?

1127
01:35:51,813 --> 01:35:53,415
Fine.

1128
01:36:00,488 --> 01:36:04,684
Oh, it smells like
barbecued dog hair.

1129
01:36:05,076 --> 01:36:07,144
Oh, Venkman.

1130
01:36:07,203 --> 01:36:09,522
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1131
01:36:10,123 --> 01:36:13,147
I'm sorry. I just... I just forgot.

1132
01:36:27,432 --> 01:36:29,125
Look!

1133
01:36:56,169 --> 01:36:59,068
Somebody turn on the lights!

1134
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:02,359
- Help! Somebody!
- Go check on that little guy.

1135
01:37:07,764 --> 01:37:09,787
What happened?

1136
01:37:16,314 --> 01:37:20,760
Oh. Oh. Where am I?

1137
01:37:22,487 --> 01:37:25,716
Oh, hi.

1138
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:27,933
You'll be all right.

1139
01:37:28,326 --> 01:37:31,930
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1140
01:37:33,331 --> 01:37:35,354
Are you okay?

1141
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,894
Who are you guys?

1142
01:37:37,961 --> 01:37:40,109
We're the Ghostbusters.

1143
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,362
Who does your taxes?

1144
01:37:45,009 --> 01:37:48,238
You know, Mr. Tully, you are
a most fortunate individual.

1145
01:37:48,304 --> 01:37:50,702
- I know.
- You have been a participant in

1146
01:37:50,765 --> 01:37:54,460
the biggest interdimensional cross rip
since the Tunguska blast of 1909.

1147
01:37:54,519 --> 01:37:56,792
- Felt great.
- We'd like to get a sample

1148
01:37:56,854 --> 01:37:59,833
- of your brain tissue.
- Okay.

1149
01:38:02,777 --> 01:38:05,596
I love this town!
