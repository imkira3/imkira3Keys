1
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,306
In Sixteen Hundred Seven

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,101
We sailed the open sea

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,437
For glory, God and gold

4
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,648
And the Virginia Company

5
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,401
For the New World is like heaven

6
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,195
And we'll all be rich and free

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,448
Or so we have been told

8
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,784
By the Virginia Company

9
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,953
So we have been told

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,540
By the Virginia Company

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,969
For glory, God, and gold

12
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,222
And the Virginia Company

13
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,059
- Ready to hoist the cannon?
- Aye!

14
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,769
Hey, look. Is that Smith?

15
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,021
That's him, all right.
The old sea dog.

16
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,232
Captain John Smith?
I've heard amazing stories about him.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,401
Are you coming on this voyage, too?

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,572
Course he is, you half-wit! You can't
fight Indians without John Smith!

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,576
That's right. I'm not about
to let you boys have all the fun.

20
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,038
On the beaches of Virginny

21
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,832
There's diamonds like debris

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,543
There's silver rivers flowin'

23
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,588
Gold you pick right off a tree

24
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,673
With a nugget for my Winnie

25
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,551
And another one for me

26
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,678
And all the rest'll go

27
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,057
To the Virginia Company

28
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,684
It's glory, God, and gold

29
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:48,190
And the Virginia Company

30
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,406
Full anchor release!

31
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,075
Come on, lads! Come on!

32
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,077
Give me a hand, someone!

33
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,453
Watch out!

34
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,876
Faster! She's taking on more water!

35
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,590
Look out!

36
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,680
John! Get down here!

37
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,141
The cannons are breaking loose!

38
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,855
- Reef the topsails!
- Aye, sir!

39
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,648
Steady on your course!

40
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,526
It's all right, Thomas!
We'll get her tied off.

41
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,986
Say your prayers, lads!

42
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,911
Look out!

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,872
Thomas, watch out...!

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,836
Help!

45
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,297
Man overboard!

46
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,464
Help!

47
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,550
Stay your course! He's lost!

48
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,718
Help!

49
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,596
- Pull the pin.
- Aye, sir!

50
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,061
Smith!

51
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,481
Are you crazy?

52
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,611
Hang on, Thomas. I've got you!

53
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,157
Quick... the rope!

54
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,910
Heave!

55
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,791
Come on, lads! Pull!

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,379
Pull! Pull!

57
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,131
Put your back into it!

58
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,301
Pull! Pull!

59
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,136
Hang on!

60
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,974
Ah, my lucky lad!

61
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,645
Well, that was refreshing.

62
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,814
- Well done, Smith.
- Of course...

63
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,608
...you'd all do the same for me.

64
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,735
- Yes, yes.
- Sure, sure.

65
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,279
- Of course we would!Absolutely!
- Yeah, we would.

66
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,158
Trouble on deck?

67
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,161
- Governor Ratcliffe!
- Thomas fell overboard, sir.

68
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,538
Thank heavens he's been
successfully retrieved.

69
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,832
- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,170
Don't lose heart, men. It won't be long
before we reach the New World,

71
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,674
and remember what awaits us there...

72
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:23,929
Freedom, prosperity,
the adventure of our lives.

73
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,515
You're the finest crew
England has to offer,

74
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,934
and nothing, not wind nor rain,

75
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,688
nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages
shall stand in our way.

76
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,564
Carry on, men!

77
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,485
A stirring oration, sir.

78
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,405
I'm sure the men were most exhilarated!

79
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:47,577
Let us hope so. I'll need those witless
peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?

80
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,040
This New World's
going to be great, John.

81
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,917
I'm going to get a pile of gold,

82
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,505
build me a big house, and if any
Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him.

83
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,174
Just worry about that fortune
of yours, Thomas.

84
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,344
- Leave the savages to me.
- You think they'll give us trouble?

85
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,472
Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them.

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,891
We'll kill ourselves an injun

87
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,728
Or maybe two or three

88
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:17,941
We're stalwart men and bold
ofthe Virginia Company

89
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,610
What do you suppose
the New World will look like?

90
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,571
Like all the others, I suppose.

91
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,782
I've seen hundreds
of New Worlds, Thomas.

92
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,160
What could possibly
be different about this one?

93
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,328
It's glory

94
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,829
God, and gold

95
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:37,002
And the Virginia Company

96
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,127
Steady as the beating drum

97
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,630
Singing to the cedar flute

98
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,882
Seasons go and seasons come

99
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,220
Bring the corn and bear the fruit

100
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,305
By the waters sweet and clean

101
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,724
Where the mighty sturgeon lives

102
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,227
Plant the squash and reap the bean

103
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,314
All the earth our Mother gives

104
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,733
O, Great Spirit, hear our song

105
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,027
Help us keep the ancient ways

106
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,947
Keep the sacred fires strong

107
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,575
Walk in balance all our days

108
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,828
Seasons go and seasons come

109
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,330
Steady as the beating drum

110
00:06:55,498 --> 00:07:01,336
Plum to seed to bud to plum

111
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,758
Steady as the beating drum

112
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,983
It's good to be home.

113
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,529
The Massawomecks are defeated!

114
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:32,200
With the help of our brothers,
our villages are safe again.

115
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,873
Your return has brought
much joy to the village.

116
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,459
Look at all the smiling faces.

117
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,963
Yes. But there's
one smiling face I don't see.

118
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,256
Where is my daughter?

119
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,133
You know Pocahontas.

120
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,177
She has her mother's spirit.

121
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,430
She goes wherever the wind takes her.

122
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,533
Pocahontas!

123
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,411
Your father's back.

124
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,205
Come down here!

125
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,290
He's back, Flit.

126
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,213
Come on, Meeko!

127
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,473
No! Not that... way.

128
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,025
Show-off.

129
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,999
Pocahontas?

130
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,962
Pocahontas? Are you all right?

131
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,091
You'd better be all right,
because I'm not coming in after you...

132
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,473
Don't you think we're getting
a little old for these games?

133
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,495
Help me turn this thing over.

134
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,041
What were you doing up there?

135
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,086
Thinking. Meeko!

136
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,214
About the dream again?
Have you figured it out yet?

137
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,050
I know it means something,
I just don't know what.

138
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,596
- You should ask your father about it.
- Maybe I should.

139
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,556
Come on, Flit.

140
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,851
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.

141
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,523
...faced a determined enemy.

142
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,443
The battle lasted
from the rising of the sun

143
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,862
until the evening shadows fell.

144
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,867
Our warriors fought with courage,
but none as bravely as Kocoum,

145
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,870
for he attacked with
the fierce strength of the bear.

146
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,332
- He has proven himself to be...
- He is so handsome!

147
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,709
I especially love the smile.

148
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,753
...destroying every enemy in his path.

149
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,505
Tonight, we will feast in his honour.

150
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,803
- My daughter.
- Winggapo, Father.

151
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,514
Seeing you gives me greatjoy.

152
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,309
I'm so glad you've come home safely.

153
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,437
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.

154
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,148
I want to hear everything
you've been doing.

155
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,698
Father, for many nights now,
I've been having a very strange dream.

156
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,410
It's telling me something's
about to happen, something exciting.

157
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,914
Yes. Something exciting
is about to happen.

158
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,208
Really? What is it?

159
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,920
Kocoum has asked to seek
your hand in marriage.

160
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,672
Marry Kocoum?

161
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,968
I told him it would make my heart soar.

162
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,975
But he's so... serious.

163
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,104
My daughter,
Kocoum will make a fine husband.

164
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:33,066
He is loyal and strong and will build
you a good house with sturdy walls.

165
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,652
With him,
you will be safe from harm.

166
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,613
Father, I think my dream is
pointing me down another path.

167
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,323
This is the right path for you.

168
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,325
But why can't I choose...

169
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,211
Pocahontas, come with me.

170
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,046
You are the daughter of the chief.

171
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,632
It is time to take
your place among our people.

172
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,387
Even the wild mountain stream
must someday join the big river.

173
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,266
As the river cuts his path

174
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,520
Though the river's proud and strong

175
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,191
He will choose the smoothest course

176
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,696
That's why rivers live so long.

177
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,574
They're steady

178
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,870
As the steady beating drum

179
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,039
Your mother wore this for our wedding.

180
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,501
It was her dream to see you
wear it at your own.

181
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,756
It suits you.

182
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,887
He wants me to be steady.

183
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,514
Like the river.

184
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,687
But it's not steady at all.

185
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,358
What I love most about rivers is

186
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,444
You can't step in the same river twice

187
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,738
The water's always changing

188
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,615
Always flowing

189
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,533
But people, I guess
can't live like that

190
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,285
We all must pay a price

191
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,955
To be safe we lose our chance
of ever knowing

192
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,876
What's around the river bend

193
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,754
Waiting just around the river bend

194
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,381
I look once more

195
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,300
Just around the river bend

196
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,052
Beyond the shore

197
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,762
Where the gulls fly free

198
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,889
Don't know what for

199
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,099
What I dream the day might send

200
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,353
Just around the river bend

201
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,606
For me

202
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:41,194
Coming for me

203
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,990
I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls

204
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,494
Can I ignore that sound
of distant drumming?

205
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,414
For a handsome, sturdy husband
who builds handsome, sturdy walls

206
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,418
And never dreams that
something might be coming

207
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:04,926
Just around the river bend

208
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,011
I look once more

209
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,680
Just around the river bend

210
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,598
Beyond the shore

211
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,350
Somewhere past the sea

212
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,435
Don't know what for

213
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,396
Why do all my dreams extend

214
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,275
Just around the river bend?

215
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,778
Just around the river bend

216
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,576
Should I choose the smoothest course

217
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,496
Steady as the beating drum?

218
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,625
Should I marry Kocoum?

219
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,547
Is all my dreaming at an end?

220
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,469
Or do you still

221
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:53,892
Wait for me, dream giver?

222
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,939
Just around the river

223
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,445
Bend

224
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,556
Is that my Pocahontas?

225
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,685
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.

226
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,148
Good morning, child.

227
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,817
I was hoping you'd visit today.

228
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,112
Why, your mother's necklace!

229
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,823
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

230
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,076
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.

231
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,663
Kocoum? But he's so serious!

232
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,541
I know. My father thinks
it's the right path for me.

233
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,670
But lately, I've been having
this dream, and I think it's...

234
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:08,216
Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it!

235
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:14,097
Quiet!

236
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,063
Now, child, you were saying?

237
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,732
Well, I'm running through the woods,

238
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,527
and then right there
in front of me is an arrow.

239
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,071
As I look at it, it starts to spin.

240
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,825
A spinning arrow? How unusual!

241
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:39,372
Yes, it spins faster and faster
and faster... until, suddenly, it stops.

242
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,589
Well, it seems to me this spinning arrow
is pointing you down your path.

243
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,884
But, Grandmother Willow,
what is my path?

244
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,720
How am I ever going to find it?

245
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,433
Your mother asked me
the very same question.

246
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,852
She did? What did you tell her?

247
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,855
I told her to listen.

248
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,858
All around you are spirits, child.

249
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,946
They live in the earth,
the water, the sky.

250
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:16,034
If you listen, they will guide you.

251
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,664
- I hear the wind.
- Yes.

252
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,083
What is it telling you?

253
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,335
I don't understand.

254
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,426
You will understand

255
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,971
Listen with your heart

256
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,558
You will understand

257
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:47,148
Let it break upon you
like a wave upon the sand

258
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,150
It's saying something's coming.

259
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,902
Strange clouds?

260
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,280
Listen with your heart

261
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,367
You will understand

262
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,667
What do you see?

263
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,380
Clouds. Strange clouds.

264
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,181
Look at it, Wiggins, an entire
New World chock-full of gold,

265
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,350
just waiting for me.

266
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,646
And scores of adventures
waiting for us, right, Percy?

267
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,606
Do you think we'll meet some savages?

268
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,692
Ifwe do, we shall be sure
to give them a proper English greeting.

269
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,653
Gift baskets!

270
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,365
And he came so highly recommended.

271
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,704
It's perfect, the water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.

272
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,373
Hey, there, Percy.

273
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,377
- Very well, then. Give the order.
- Already done, sir.

274
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,546
I've got a crew assembled,
and they're ready to go.

275
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,422
About the natives...

276
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,008
I'm counting on you to make sure
those filthy heathens

277
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,677
don't disrupt our mission.

278
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,638
Well, if they're anything like
the savages I've fought before,

279
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,140
it's nothing I can't handle.

280
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,309
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.

281
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,228
See ya, Percy.

282
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,941
The men like Smith, don't they?

283
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,239
- I've never been a popular man.
- I like you.

284
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,243
Don't think I don't know what those
backstabbers at court say about me.

285
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,871
Oh, yes, all that talk
about being a pathetic social climber

286
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,540
- who's failed at everything...
- I'm very well aware that this is

287
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,085
my last chance for glory.
But mark my words, Wiggins,

288
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,921
when King James sees the gold
these peasants unearth,

289
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,758
success will be mine, at last.

290
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,888
- Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Two of you up on the yardarm!

291
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,556
It's incredible.

292
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,059
And it's all ours.
I've never seen anything like it.

293
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,353
It can look like
Ratcliffe's knickers for all I care,

294
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,315
just as long as I
get off this stinking boat!

295
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,443
Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it.

296
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,877
Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut! Steady! Steady!

297
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,754
Hold up! That's far enough!

298
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,257
All right now... tie her off!

299
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,092
Here, John, tie off this end.

300
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,803
John? John?

301
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,974
- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look.

302
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,583
Hey!

303
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,801
Well... you're a strange looking fellow.

304
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,469
You hungry?

305
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,888
Here you go. It's a biscuit.

306
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,683
It's food. Well, sort of.

307
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,395
You like it, eh?

308
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,356
Well, try eating it
for four months straight.

309
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,904
You got a friend back there?

310
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,043
Hey... what the... What...? Watch out.

311
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,590
- No... get that... Look out!
- John, you better get down here!

312
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,594
- The governor's coming ashore.
- All right. I'm leaving.

313
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,737
Did you see their skin?

314
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,905
Pale and sickly.

315
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,448
They have hair on their faces like dogs.

316
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,786
My brothers, we must know
more about these visitors.

317
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,955
Kekata, what do you see?

318
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,808
These are not men like us...

319
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:19,563
...but strange beasts
with bodies that shine like the sun,

320
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,859
and weapons that spout fire
and thunder.

321
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:31,492
They prowl the earth
like ravenous wolves,

322
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,912
consuming everything in their path.

323
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,295
Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors
to the river and attack.

324
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,341
We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

325
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,845
Kocoum, in that battle we knew
how to fight our enemy,

326
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,431
but these pale visitors
are strange to us.

327
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,975
Take some men to the river
to observe them.

328
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,686
Let us hope
they do not intend to stay.

329
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,649
I hereby claim this land
and all its riches

330
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,110
in the name of His Majesty,
King James the First,

331
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,614
and do so name
this settlement Jamestown.

332
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,743
Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir!

333
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,203
Hurry now, Percy.

334
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,789
We must be all squeaky clean
for the New World.

335
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,836
Captain Smith, it appears
I've selected the perfect location.

336
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,213
Not a savage in sight.

337
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,090
Just because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not out there.

338
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:15,721
Then perhaps you should venture forth
and determine their whereabouts.

339
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,891
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.

340
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,646
Now, gentlemen, to work.

341
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,524
You men, get the ship unloaded,
you men build the fort.

342
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,443
The rest of you...
break out the shovels!

343
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,488
- It's time to start digging!
- Digging?

344
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,741
Well, of course! Let's not forget
what the Spanish found

345
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,035
when they came to the New World.

346
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,080
Gold! Mountains of it.

347
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,792
Why, for years, they've been
ravaging the New World

348
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,794
of its most precious resources.

349
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,796
But now...

350
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,675
...it's our turn.

351
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:57,304
The gold of CortÃ©z
the jewels of Pizarro

352
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,475
Will seem like mere trinkets
by this time tomorrow

353
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,229
The gold we find here
will dwarfthem by far

354
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,399
Oh, with all you got in ya, boys

355
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,361
Dig up Virginia, boys

356
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,113
Mine, boys

357
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,614
Mine every mountain

358
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,241
And dig, boys

359
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,951
Dig till ya drop

360
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,869
Grab a pick, boys

361
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,663
Quick, boys

362
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,998
Shove in a shovel

363
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,544
Uncover those lovely pebbles
that sparkle and shine

364
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,130
It's gold

365
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,551
And it's mine, mine, mine

366
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,928
Dig and diggety dig

367
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,514
And dig and dig and diggety dig

368
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,684
- Hey, nonny, nonny hi, nonny, nonny
- Ooh, how I love it

369
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,812
- Hey, nonny, nonny, hi, nonny, nonny
- Riches for cheap

370
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,024
- Hey, nonny, nonny, hi, nonny, nonny
- There'll be heaps of it

371
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:54,903
- And I'll be on top of the heap
- Diggety, diggety, diggety, dig!

372
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:58,198
My rivals back home
it's not that I'm bitter

373
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,785
But think how they'll squirm
when they see how I glitter

374
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,456
The ladies at court
will be all a-twitter

375
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,124
The king will reward me

376
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,753
He'll knight me
No! Lord me

377
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,840
It's mine!
Mine, mine for the taking

378
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,676
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold

379
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:22,681
With those nuggets dug
it's glory they'll give me

380
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:27,269
My dear friend, King Jimmy
will probably build me a shrine

381
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,939
When all ofthe gold

382
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,441
Is mine

383
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:38,030
And dig and dig and diggety dig

384
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:43,285
All of my life I have searched
for a land like this one

385
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:50,417
A wild or more challenging country
I couldn't design

386
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:56,924
Hundreds of dangers await
and I don't plan to miss one

387
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,053
In a land I can claim, a land I can tame

388
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,515
- The greatest adventure is mine
- Keep on working, lads

389
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,433
- Mine
- Don't be shirking, lads

390
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,478
Mine, boys, mine

391
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:14,858
Mine me that gold

392
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,611
- Beautiful gold
- Dig for that gold

393
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,573
Make this island my land

394
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,827
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys

395
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,037
But I've got this crick in me spine

396
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,541
- This land we behold
- This beauty untold

397
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:35,045
- A man can be bold
- It all can be sold

398
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,964
So go for the gold

399
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,549
We know which is here

400
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:44,638
Mine, mine, mine

401
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,267
No! Wait! Please...

402
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,110
Please!

403
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,197
Don't run off.

404
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,078
It's all right.
I'm not going to hurt you.

405
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,707
Here. Let me help you out of there.

406
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,546
You don't understand a word
I'm saying, do you?

407
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,303
It's all right.

408
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,324
Listen with your heart

409
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,911
You will understand

410
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,921
Let it break upon you

411
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:50,509
Like a wave upon the sand

412
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,220
Who are you?

413
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,015
Listen with your heart

414
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:02,062
You will understand

415
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,481
Pocahontas.

416
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,067
What? What did you say?

417
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,696
My name is Pocahontas.

418
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,535
I'm John Smith.

419
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,709
That's it. Keep at it, men.

420
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,712
Keep digging.
It's got to be here somewhere.

421
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,175
- There's 30 more down by the ridge.
- That makes more than 100!

422
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,887
- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.

423
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,808
How long are we going to
keep digging like this, sir?

424
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,436
We're slaving away,
busting our backs day and night...

425
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,063
For king and country. I know, I know.

426
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,233
And I share your fatigue. Wiggins!

427
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,068
Wiggins!

428
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,448
- Coming!
- Dispose of this.

429
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,454
Who's a good doggie?

430
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,831
Fetch, boy!

431
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,421
Savages! It's an ambush!Arm yourselves!

432
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,256
Run!

433
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,591
Arm yourselves!

434
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,054
Make sure every man has a musket!

435
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,847
Shoot!

436
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,977
Them, you idiot!

437
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,616
Where's that blasted Smith
when I need him?

438
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,582
Namontack!

439
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,470
Back to the village!

440
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:05,685
Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.

441
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,522
Everyone back to camp.

442
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,149
Get the rest of the cannons ashore,
finish building the fort!

443
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,609
Aye, Governor!

444
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:18,115
And you... learn to use
that thing properly.

445
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:22,244
A man's not a man
unless he knows how to shoot.

446
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:34,548
These beasts invade our shores,
and now this.

447
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,845
This wound is strange to me.

448
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,726
We will fight this enemy,
but we cannot do it alone.

449
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,063
Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation.

450
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,941
We will call on our brothers
to help us fight.

451
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,902
These white men are dangerous!

452
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,697
No one is to go near them.

453
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,119
It's called a helmet.

454
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,829
Helmet.

455
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,542
So... what river is this?

456
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,294
Quiyoughcohannock.

457
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,213
You have the most unusual names here.

458
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,967
Chickahominy.
Quiyo... Quiyoughcohannock.

459
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,137
Pocahontas.

460
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,724
You have the most unusual name, too.

461
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,267
John Smith.

462
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:32,898
Hey! Is this bottomless pit
a friend of yours?

463
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,651
- Meeko!
- Well, how do you do, Meeko?

464
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,407
It's all right. It's just a handshake.

465
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,868
Here, let me show you.

466
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,038
Nothing's happening.

467
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,041
No, no. I need your hand first.

468
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,089
It's how we say hello.

469
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,597
This is how we say hello. Winggapo.

470
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,061
Winggapo.

471
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:15,565
And how we say goodbye. Anah.

472
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,443
I like hello better.

473
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,617
Yeah, I remember you.

474
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,872
- Flitjust doesn't like strangers.
- But I'm not a stranger any more.

475
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,291
Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?

476
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,254
- Very stubborn.
- Hey!

477
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:42,259
- Meeko! Come back here.
- Don't worry. He can't hurt it.

478
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,512
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Meeko, bring that back.

479
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,889
No, it's all right. He can keep it.

480
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,849
Call it a gift.

481
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,311
What was that?

482
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,230
- My compass.
- Compass?

483
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,357
It tells you how to find
your way when you get lost.

484
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,651
It's all right.
I'll get another in London.

485
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,528
London? Is that your village?

486
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,698
- Yes. It's a very big village.
- What's it like?

487
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,034
It's got streets filled with carriages,

488
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:12,038
bridges over the rivers,
and buildings as tall as trees.

489
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,291
- I'd like to see those things.
- You will.

490
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,042
- How?
- We're going to build them here.

491
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,296
We'll show your people
how to use this land properly.

492
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,840
- How to make the most of it.
- Make the most of it?

493
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,010
Yes. We'll build roads
and decent houses...

494
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,053
Our houses are fine.

495
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,973
You think that only because
you don't know any better.

496
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,518
Wait a minute. Don't take it that...

497
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,396
Hey! Wait!

498
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,483
Wait! There's so much we can teach you.

499
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,569
We've improved the lives
of savages all over the world.

500
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,903
Savages?

501
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,072
Not that you're a savage.

502
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,782
- Just my people.
- No.

503
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,827
Listen, that's not what I meant.
Let me explain.

504
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,205
- Let go!
- No. I'm not letting you leave.

505
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,542
Look, don't do this.

506
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,171
Savage is just a word, you know?

507
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,966
A term for...
people who are uncivilised.

508
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,134
Like me.

509
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,138
Well, when I say uncivilised,
what I mean is...

510
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,360
What you mean is... not like you.

511
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,654
You think I'm an ignorant savage

512
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,157
And you've been so many places

513
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,576
I guess it must be so

514
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,245
But still, I cannot see

515
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,624
Ifthe savage one is me

516
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:43,588
How can there be so much
that you don't know

517
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:48,718
You don't know

518
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,648
You think you own
whatever land you land on

519
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:06,194
The earth isjust
a dead thing you can claim

520
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,698
But I know every rock
and tree and creature

521
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:15,370
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

522
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:19,958
You think the only people
who are people

523
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:24,212
Are the people
who look and think like you

524
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,466
But if you walk
the footsteps of a stranger

525
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:33,304
You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew

526
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:38,309
Have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon?

527
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:42,439
Or ask the grinning bobcat
why he grinned?

528
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:47,318
Can you sing with all the voices
ofthe mountain?

529
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:51,990
Can you paint with all the colours
ofthe wind?

530
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,743
Can you paint with all the colours

531
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,497
Ofthe wind?

532
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:10,341
Come run the hidden pine trails
ofthe forest

533
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,596
Come taste the sun-sweet berries
ofthe earth

534
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:18,558
Come roll in all the riches
all around you

535
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:23,104
And for once, never wonder
what they're worth

536
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:27,317
The rainstorm and the river
are my brothers

537
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,988
The heron and the otter are my friends

538
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,992
And we are all connected to each other

539
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,997
In a circle, in a hoop, that never ends

540
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:45,376
How high does the sycamore grow?

541
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:51,341
If you cut it down
then you'll never know

542
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,722
And you'll never hear the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon

543
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,809
For whether we are white
or copper-skinned

544
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:06,564
We need to sing with all the voices
ofthe mountain

545
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:11,569
We need to paint
with all the colours ofthe wind

546
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,531
You can own the earth, and still

547
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,243
All you'll own is earth until

548
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,703
You can paint

549
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,831
With all the colours

550
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:27,752
Ofthe

551
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,925
Wind

552
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,358
What is it?

553
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,945
The drums. They mean trouble.

554
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,739
I shouldn't be here.

555
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,700
- I want to see you again.
- I can't.

556
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,868
- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry.

557
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,165
I have to go.

558
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,720
All right! This one's ready to hoist!

559
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,306
Two on each side. Ready now? Push!

560
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,099
Watch it! It's slipping.

561
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,227
Come on, lads,
it's only a little picket fence.

562
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,563
- Steady! Steady!
- There you go.

563
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,149
That'll keep everything out, eh, John?

564
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,653
- Something wrong, John?
- What?

565
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:40,742
- You've been quiet the last few days.
- He's mad he missed all the action.

566
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,578
Don't worry, John. You'll get
your chance to deal with the Indians.

567
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,332
Yeah. We'll take care of them,
like we did last time, eh, mates?

568
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,959
We shot ourselves an injun

569
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,878
Or maybe two or three

570
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,505
All right, you howling nutter,
get to work.

571
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,383
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.

572
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,178
Sure! We're having loads of fun, right?

573
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,180
Look at us. No gold, no food,

574
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,726
while Ratcliffe sits up in his tent
all day, happy as a clam.

575
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,187
I'm doomed!

576
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,274
I should be wallowing in riches by now,
and I haven't found as much as a speck.

577
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:18,237
Think. Think!
It's got to be around here somewhere.

578
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,199
Where could it be?

579
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:28,206
I've mined the forests and the hills
and the swamps... and nothing!

580
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,295
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?

581
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,676
I... I...
I made it myself!

582
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,678
Take that silly...

583
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,764
Of course. The Indians.

584
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,351
Wiggins, why do you think
those insolent heathens attacked us?

585
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,771
We invaded their land, cut down
their trees and dug up their earth?

586
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:56,526
It's the gold! They have it, and
they don't want us to take it from them.

587
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,238
Well, I'll just have to
take it by force then, won't I?

588
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,076
You there! Where's Captain Smith?

589
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,747
- Well, he's... gone.
- Aye. Your singing scared him off.

590
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,292
- Go get him, for heaven's sake!
- What ifwe run into the Indians?

591
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,254
That's what guns are for.

592
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,423
Now arm yourselves and get moving!

593
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,825
Pocahontas.

594
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,828
You should be inside the village.

595
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,329
We'll be all right.

596
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,666
We're gathering food
for when the warriors arrive.

597
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,876
Don't go far.

598
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,379
- Now is not the time to be running off.
- Yes, Father.

599
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:04,093
When I see you wear that necklace,
you lookjust like your mother.

600
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,596
I miss her.

601
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,890
But she is still with us.

602
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:13,311
Whenever the wind moves through
the trees, I feel her presence.

603
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,189
Our people look to her
for wisdom and strength.

604
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,983
Someday, they will look to you as well.

605
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,777
I would be honoured by that.

606
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,696
You shouldn't be out here alone.

607
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,241
- I'll send for Kocoum.
- All right, what is it?

608
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,868
- What?
- You're hiding something.

609
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,870
I'm not hiding anything.

610
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,039
Pocahontas, you can tell me. I promise.

611
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,210
I won't tell anyone... Pocahontas, look!

612
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:44,217
- It's one of them! I'm going to get...
- What are you doing here?

613
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,260
I had to see you again.

614
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:51,390
- Pocahontas! Pocahontas!
- Please! Don't say anything.

615
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,892
Quick! This way!

616
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,644
- But...
- Nakoma.

617
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,106
- Where is Pocahontas?
- I haven't seen her.

618
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,237
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.

619
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,490
Tell her that. She listens to you.

620
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,744
Sure she does.

621
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,929
This place is incredible.

622
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,224
And to think we came all this way
just to dig it up for gold.

623
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,142
- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.

624
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,105
- What's gold?
- You know, it's yellow.

625
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,315
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.

626
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,276
Here, we have lots of it.

627
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,611
Gold.

628
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:49,949
No, no! Gold is this.

629
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,118
There's nothing like that around here.

630
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,954
- No gold?
- Not that I've seen.

631
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,623
All this way for nothing.

632
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,459
Those boys are in for a big surprise.

633
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,879
- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.

634
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,424
Will you go home?

635
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,886
Well, it's not like I have
much of a home to go back to.

636
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,305
I've never really belonged anywhere.

637
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,807
You could belong here.

638
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,401
What was that?

639
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,780
- Did you see something?
- No, no. I just...

640
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,867
I didn't see anything. Did I?

641
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,702
Look again.

642
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,706
Let it break upon you

643
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:43,544
Like a wave upon the sand

644
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,298
Hello, John Smith.

645
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,301
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

646
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,428
Then you should talk back.

647
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,472
Don't be frightened, young man.

648
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,183
My bark is worse than my bite.

649
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,271
- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?

650
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,857
Anything you want.

651
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,114
- So...
- Come closer, John Smith.

652
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,620
He has a good soul.
And he's handsome, too!

653
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,957
- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.

654
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:24,543
Smith! Smith, where are you, mate?

655
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,213
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.

656
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,092
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

657
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:35,471
If you spot one, don't ask questions.
Just shoot.

658
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:41,185
- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me! It was the tree.

659
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,855
Of course! The tree just felt
like lifting its roots...

660
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,652
Let's get out of here.

661
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,156
- Run!
- But what about Smith?

662
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,076
He's a big lad,
he can take care of himself!

663
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,411
I'm glad you're on our side.

664
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,539
There's still some snap
in these old vines.

665
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,375
I better get back before
they send the whole camp after me.

666
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:08,337
- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight, right here.

667
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:18,222
Well! I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.

668
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,434
What am I doing?
I shouldn't be seeing him again.

669
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,436
I mean, I want to see him again.

670
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,564
Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.

671
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,568
But, still, something inside
is telling me it's the right thing.

672
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,278
Perhaps it's your dream.

673
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:37,533
My dream? Do you think he's the one
the spinning arrow was pointing to?

674
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,377
The warriors are here.

675
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,767
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?

676
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,226
- There you are!
- Kocoum!

677
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,481
Look at them! Now we have enough
warriors to destroy those white demons!

678
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,779
Now that we are joined by our brothers,
we will defeat this enemy.

679
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,080
Father, I need to speak with you.

680
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,832
Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.

681
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,336
We don't have to fight them.
There must be a better way.

682
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,130
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

683
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,841
But maybe we should try talking to them.

684
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,426
They do not want to talk.

685
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,263
But if one of them did want to talk,
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

686
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,349
- Pocahontas...
- Wouldn't you?

687
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:47,686
Of course I would,
but it is not that simple.

688
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,356
Nothing is simple any more.

689
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,527
Easy, Thomas, it's me.

690
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:42,032
- Oh, John! I could've killed you.
- Not aiming like that, you couldn't.

691
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,244
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.

692
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:50,124
- Smith! There you are.
- We were looking all over for you.

693
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,419
Smith! Where have you been?

694
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,130
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

695
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,674
Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

696
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,759
We'll need that information
for the battle.

697
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,179
- What battle?
- We will eliminate these savages

698
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,140
- once and for all.
- No! You can't do that!

699
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:11,687
- Oh, can't I?
- Look. We don't have to fight them.

700
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,731
- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.

701
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,108
- You what?
- A savage?

702
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,944
They're not savages. They can help us.

703
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,531
They know the land. They know
how to navigate the rivers.

704
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,659
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?

705
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,953
It's better than hardtack and gruel,
that's for sure.

706
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,121
I like gruel.

707
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,832
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

708
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,293
They want to kill us!All of us!

709
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,421
They've got our gold,
and they'll do anything to keep it!

710
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:41,091
- But there is no gold.
- No gold?

711
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:45,304
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?

712
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,805
Yes.

713
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,559
Lies. Lies!All of it!
Murderous thieves.

714
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,770
There's no room for their kind
in civilised society.

715
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,230
But this is their land!

716
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,650
This is my land!
I make the laws here.

717
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:01,987
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian

718
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:07,493
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason and hanged.

719
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,832
Pocahontas!

720
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,668
- Nakoma.
- Don't go out there.

721
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,088
I lied for you once,
don't ask me to do it again.

722
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,673
I have to do this.

723
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,883
- He's one of them!
- You don't know him.

724
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,844
If you go out there, you'll be turning
your back on your own people.

725
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,305
I'm trying to help my people.

726
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,600
Pocahontas, please,
you're my best friend.

727
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,394
I don't want you to get hurt.

728
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:37,439
- I won't. I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no!

729
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,865
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothing.

730
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:50,327
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?

731
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,622
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been
lying to us since we left London.

732
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,624
Listen to you, you bunch of idiots.

733
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,127
Those savages didn't
attack us for nothing.

734
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,878
They're hiding something.

735
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,382
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight them.

736
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,051
- Not me. I'm not risking my neck...
- Either too hot or too cold.

737
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,721
I haven't been comfortable
since we got here.

738
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,391
Me, too. I'm itching a lot.

739
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,859
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.

740
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,320
I want to know where
he's sneaking off to.

741
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,489
- Yes, sir.
- If you happen to see any Indians...

742
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,992
...shoot them.

743
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,373
And, Thomas,
you've been a slipshod sailor

744
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,917
and a poor excuse for a soldier.

745
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,378
Don't disappoint me again.

746
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,640
- Kocoum.
- What is it?

747
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,354
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?

748
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,316
I think she's in trouble.

749
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,948
The earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?

750
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,450
The warriors are here.

751
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,577
- Pocahontas.
- John!

752
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,540
Listen to me. My men are planning
to attack your people.

753
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,708
You've got to warn them.

754
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,002
Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

755
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,213
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.

756
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,924
Pocahontas, talking
isn't going to do any good.

757
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,759
I already tried talking to my men,

758
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,220
but everything
about this land has them spooked.

759
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,018
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen!

760
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,816
Percy?

761
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,904
- Easy, Percy! Come here!
- Meeko, come back!

762
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,740
You see what I mean? Once two sides
want to fight, nothing can stop them.

763
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,077
- Come here, both of you!
- It's all right. He's a friend.

764
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,412
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

765
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,375
- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!

766
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:05,546
- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!

767
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,972
It's enough to make your sap boil.

768
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:20,727
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look!

769
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:28,026
- The ripples.
- What about them?

770
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:32,739
So small at first,
then look how they grow.

771
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,785
But someone has to start them.

772
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,954
They're not going to listen to us.

773
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:43,333
Young man, sometimes the right path
is not the easiest one.

774
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,169
Don't you see?

775
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:49,631
Only when the fighting stops
can you be together.

776
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,263
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

777
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,760
Kocoum, no!

778
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,976
Kocoum!

779
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,356
Leave him alone!

780
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,874
Kocoum, stop!

781
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,337
Both eyes open.

782
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,306
- Thomas!
- Is he...

783
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,225
You killed him.

784
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,227
- I thought that...
- Get away from him!

785
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,479
Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only...

786
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,647
He killed him!

787
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,984
Get all the wagons...

788
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:35,737
Thomas, get out of here!
Get out of here!

789
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,844
Who did this?

790
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,971
Pocahontas was out in the woods.

791
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,058
Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked them.

792
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:52,898
Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger.

793
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,485
- At sunrise, he'll be the first to die!
- But Father!

794
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,030
I told you to stay in the village.

795
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,032
You disobeyed me.

796
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,827
- You have shamed your father!
- I was only trying to help.

797
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,915
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!

798
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,875
Take him away!

799
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,642
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.

800
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,729
Pocahontas...
I sent Kocoum after you.

801
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,733
I was worried about you.

802
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,027
I thought I was doing the right thing.

803
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,030
All this happened because of me.

804
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:45,283
And now I'll never see John Smith again.

805
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,079
Come with me.

806
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:57,713
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed Kocoum.

807
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,134
Be quick.

808
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,154
Pocahontas.

809
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:28,118
- I'm so sorry.
- For what? This?

810
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,620
I've gotten out of
worse scrapes than this.

811
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,247
Can't think of any right now, but...

812
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,249
It would've been better
ifwe'd never met.

813
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:38,712
- None of this would've happened.
- Pocahontas, look at me.

814
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:44,551
I'd rather die tomorrow than live
a hundred years without knowing you.

815
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,638
- Pocahontas.
- I can't leave you.

816
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:50,182
You never will.

817
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:55,061
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.

818
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:11,453
Help! Somebody help! Help!

819
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,205
- Help!
- Easy, lad. What is it?

820
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,873
It's Smith! They got him!

821
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,209
- Who got him?
- The savages!

822
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:19,085
- Savages?
- They captured him! Dragged him off!

823
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,879
- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north.

824
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,089
- How many were there?
- I don't know. At least a dozen.

825
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,383
Filthy beasts!

826
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:29,346
It's perfect, Wiggins! I couldn't
have planned this better myself.

827
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,390
The gold is as good as mine.

828
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,227
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us.

829
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,729
Thomas is right!
We've got to do something.

830
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:42,567
And so we shall. I told you
those savages couldn't be trusted.

831
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,946
Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done to him!

832
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:49,908
But now I say it's time to
rescue our courageous comrade.

833
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,285
At daybreak, we attack!

834
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,123
What can you expect
from filthy little heathens?

835
01:03:57,291 --> 01:04:00,377
Here's what you get
when races are diverse

836
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,212
Their skin's a hellish red

837
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,839
They're only good when dead

838
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,424
They're vermin as I said and worse

839
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,344
They're savages, savages

840
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,514
- Barely even human
- Savages, savages

841
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,266
Drive them from our shore!

842
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,934
They're not like you and me

843
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,727
Which means they must be evil

844
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,605
We must sound the drums ofwar

845
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,732
They're savages, savages

846
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,609
Dirty, shrieking devils

847
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,572
Now we sound the drums ofwar

848
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,870
This is what we feared

849
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,746
The paleface is a demon

850
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,791
The only thing they feel at all is greed

851
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,626
Beneath that milky hide

852
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,336
There's emptiness inside

853
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:46,298
I wonder ifthey even bleed

854
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,633
They're savages, savages

855
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,302
Barely even human

856
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,053
Savages, savages

857
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,388
Killers at the core

858
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,223
They're different from us

859
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,309
Which means they can't be trusted

860
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:00,270
We must sound the drums ofwar

861
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,314
They're savages, savages

862
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,065
First we deal with this one

863
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,817
Then we sound the drums ofwar

864
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,319
Savages, savages

865
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,154
Let's go get a few, men!

866
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,906
Savages, savages

867
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,657
Now it's up to you, men!

868
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,409
- Savages
- Savages

869
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,161
Barely even human

870
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,664
Now we sound the drums

871
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:24,878
Ofwar

872
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,387
They're going to kill him at sunrise,
Grandmother Willow.

873
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,014
You have to stop them.

874
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,684
- I can't.
- Child, remember your dream.

875
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:43,563
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
I followed the wrong path.

876
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,899
I feel so lost.

877
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,126
The compass.

878
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,345
The spinning arrow.

879
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,681
It's the arrow from your dream!

880
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:21,017
I was right. It was pointing to him!

881
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,402
- Sunrise.
- It's not too late, child!

882
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:34,239
Let the spirits of the earth guide you!

883
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:40,161
You know your path, child.
Now follow it!

884
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,250
This will be the day

885
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,585
Let's go, men!

886
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,922
This will be the morning

887
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,924
Bring out the prisoner!

888
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,385
We will see them dying in the dust

889
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,761
I don't know what I can do

890
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,680
Still I know I've got to try

891
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,390
Now we make them pay

892
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,058
Eagle, help my feet to fly

893
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,601
Now, without a warning

894
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,520
Mountain, help my heart be great

895
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,063
Now we leave them
blood and bone and rust

896
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:10,942
- Spirits ofthe earth and sky
- It's them or us

897
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,570
Please don't let it be too late

898
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,031
They're a bunch of
filthy, stinking savages

899
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,365
- Savages
- Demons

900
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,533
- Devils
- Kill them!

901
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,076
- Savages
- Savages

902
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:21,578
What are we waiting for?

903
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:25,248
Destroy their evil race
until there's not a trace left

904
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:30,962
How loud are the drums ofwar?

905
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:35,300
Now we see what comes
oftrying to be chums

906
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:40,764
Is the death of all I love
carried in the drumming of

907
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,140
- War
- No!

908
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:49,439
If you kill him,
you'll have to kill me too.

909
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,816
Daughter, stand back.

910
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,945
I won't! I love him, Father.

911
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,578
Look around you.

912
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,998
This is where the path
of hatred has brought us.

913
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,087
This is the path I choose, Father.

914
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,755
What will yours be?

915
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:52,377
My daughter speaks
with a wisdom beyond her years.

916
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,713
We have all come here
with anger in our hearts,

917
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,967
but she comes with
courage and understanding.

918
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:04,013
From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing,

919
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,349
it will not start with me.

920
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:10,895
Release him.

921
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,082
Now is our chance! Fire!

922
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,042
- No.
- What?

923
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,753
- They let him go!
- They don't want to fight!

924
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:39,090
It's a trick, don't you see? Fire!

925
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,805
Fine! I'll settle this myself.

926
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,434
No!

927
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,978
John!

928
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:58,943
You shot him!

929
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:02,614
He stepped right into it!
It's his own fault!

930
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,283
- Smith was right all along.
- We never should've listened to you.

931
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,535
- Get the gun!
- Traitors!

932
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,704
Unhand me, I say. How dare you!

933
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,623
Put him in chains!

934
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,209
I'll see you all hanged for this!

935
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,044
And gag him as well!

936
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,849
Is he going to make it, Thomas?

937
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,809
The sooner he gets to England,
the better.

938
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,645
Let's hope the wind is with him.

939
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:36,147
- Is the ship ready yet?
- Any minute now.

940
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,942
Just loading the last bit of cargo.

941
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,491
Untie me at once!
I'll have your head for this!

942
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,827
And he came so highly recommended.

943
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,505
The ship's almost ready.

944
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,299
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide.

945
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:06,844
No, not yet. She said she'd be here.

946
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,264
Look.

947
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,709
Going back is his only chance.

948
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,378
He'll die if he stays here.

949
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,555
Here.

950
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,057
It's from Grandmother Willow's bark.

951
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,059
It'll help with the pain.

952
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,479
What pain?
I've had worse pain than this.

953
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:01,566
Can't think of any right now, but...

954
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,409
You are always welcome
among our people.

955
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,911
Thank you, my brother.

956
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,208
I thought you didn't like strangers.

957
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,261
My mother's necklace.

958
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,516
See ya, Percy.

959
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,285
Come with me?

960
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,250
You must choose your own path.

961
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,684
I'm needed here.

962
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,730
Then... I'll stay with you.

963
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,733
No. You have to go back.

964
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,653
- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.

965
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:32,990
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you...

966
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,034
...forever.

967
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:05,189
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed, John.

968
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,698
- The crew a-ready?
- Aye, sir!

969
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,783
Set the mainsails.

970
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,538
Weigh anchor!

971
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:23,791
Let go of the topgallants!
