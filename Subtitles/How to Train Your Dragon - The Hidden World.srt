166

just lean on my shoulder

Mm. That does sound
like a nuisance.

00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:29,950
But I'm in the business
of killing dragons,

Because the flock is protected

Not possible.

Look, Berk's dragons
will follow the alpha.

So we'll pay you to capture him

This is Berk, son.

It's our home.

226
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,538
It was the home
of your grandparents

227

and their grandparents
before them.

228
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:06,278
And it's my job as chief
to protect us, Hiccup.

229
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,580
And one day,
when you're all grown up,

230
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:10,749
that job will be
passed on to you.

Okay.

232
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:15,821
And it's very important, son,
because out there,

233
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:20,593
beyond the sunset,
lies the home of the dragons.

234
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:23,562
- Wow.
- Aye.

235
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:26,800
Legends tell of ships
that sailed too close to it,

236
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:29,536
only to drop off
the edge of the world,

237

never to be seen again.

238

But those sailors
who turned back

239
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:37,543
told tales of a great waterfall

240
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:41,114
and dragons guarding
the entrance to a Hidden World.

- Not just a nest, Hiccup,

all dragons come.

Even Night Furies?

244
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:52,224
Especially Night Furies.

245
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:54,661
Those are scary.

246
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,196
Don't you worry.

247
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:59,132
One day, I'll find
the Hidden World

248
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:01,301
and seal it up,

249
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:05,241
so that people and dragons
will fight no more.

250
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,117
What?

251
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,286
Oh, all right.

252
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:22,589
You do know it's not
a chew toy, don't you?

253
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,858
Is this what you want?
Oh, do you want this leg?

254
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,363
Do you want my leg?
Go get it.

255
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:41,743
Getting pretty good
at gliding on your own, bud.

256
00:14:54,856 --> 00:14:58,657
Oh, so this is where you come
to get away from Gobber.

257
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:01,463

what you're talking about.

Ugh.

Well, he's right, you know.

260
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,268
R-Really?

We're nowhere near
ready for that.

264

No, that's-that's crazy.

265
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:19,445
I mean, he's right
about all of this.

266
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:23,582
It does seem like the
whole world knows about us now.

267
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:25,951
Yep. And the more dragons
we bring back here,

268
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:28,354
the bigger of a target
we become.

269
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:29,589
Ugh.

270
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:33,825
I just wish there was some way
to make them leave us alone.

271
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,396
There might be.

272
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:40,832
Dad used to talk about
an old mariners' myth,

273
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:43,369
of a secret land
at the edge of the world

274
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,638
where dragons live
totally out of reach.

275
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,642
Well, sailors are
known for tall tales.

276
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:52,678
True. But what if it's real?

277
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,715
It could be the answer
to all of our problems.

278
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:59,252
How? By moving
the dragons there?

279
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:01,988
Uh-uh. All of us.

280
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,822
Seriously?

281
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:07,393
And abandon our home
of seven generations?

282
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:10,797

Yeah, I think we need
a real solution, Hiccup.

285
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:22,242
Well, we could just
take Gobber's advice

286
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:23,475
and tie the knot.

287
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:25,477
That should fix everything.

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,129
Toothless has a girlfriend.

327
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,166
I never took you
for a romantic.

328
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:41,701
Like, ever.

329
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,668
But it's so sweet.

330
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,071
I mean, look.

331
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:55,615
Okay. That's just sad.

332
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:58,117
- And weird.
- Yeah, you better do something.

333
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,721
Seriously? I'd rather shovel
poop all day than watch that.

334
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:03,723
All right.
Let's head back to the woods

335
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:05,159
and see if we can find her.

336
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:09,829
Ah, good idea.

337
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,163
A little privacy.

338
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:12,898
- Uh...
- Shh.

339
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,266
- It's boy talk.
- What?

340
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:16,936
Come on,
let's go work this out.

341
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:18,236
So, you want to get married.

342
00:21:18,238 --> 00:21:19,772
Uh, no, actually.

343
00:21:19,774 --> 00:21:21,674
Good news.
I've been to two weddings.

344
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:25,544
I crashed both, but none
as high profile as this one.

345
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:28,179
Lots of pressure, judgment,
and not just by me.

346
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:30,715
Look, we talked about it.
We're not getting married.

347
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:33,319
Cold feet.
I've seen it before.

348
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:36,589
Don't worry, Little Hiccy.
I'm here.

349
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:38,057
Wait, Hiccy?

350
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:40,059
Now, I've seen the way
Astrid looks at you.

351
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:41,593
Everyone has. That doubt.

352
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:43,029
That not so subtle
disappointment.

353
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:46,032
That longing for something
more than you.

354
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:47,934
You need to focus on
being worthy.

355
00:21:47,936 --> 00:21:49,936
I mean, she's a warrior queen,
for Thor's sake.

356
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:52,938
And you are neither.

357
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,639
But with me as your best man...

358
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:56,309
your spirit guide,
if you will...

359
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:59,311
you'll learn to embrace
your inner Viking.

360
00:21:59,313 --> 00:22:01,313
Show these naysayers,
of which there are many,

361
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:04,750
that you're more than
just a malnourished runt

362
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:07,352
with bad hair, strange teeth,
and a twig for a neck.

363
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:10,322
You're-you're
really bad at pep talks.

364
00:22:10,324 --> 00:22:12,291
Stop letting these insecurities

365
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,892
get the best of you.

366
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:16,061
Everyone's watching.
I mean, everyone.

367
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:18,063
You need to man up.
Do as I do.

368
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:21,167
It'll be hard,
but you have my word.

369
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,337
And until I break that word,
I won't give up.

370
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:26,237
Hey.

371
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:29,041
Hey! What, am I wasting
my time here?

372
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:32,714
You see some shiny thing in
the woods... Ooh, what is that?

373
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,924
Toothless!

374
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:46,658
Don't move a muscle.

375
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,897
Hey!

376
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:59,138
- Someone's here.
- Huh?

377
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,805
He managed to slip
past our scouts

378
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,273
and lay a trap in the woods.

379
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:05,110
- It ruined boy talk.
-: Oh.

380
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:07,379
- Gah, let me at him!
- Slow down, Gobber.

381
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:10,215
Let's get a search team on
the ground, scouts in the air.

382
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:12,251
Toothless and I
will fly the coastline.

383
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:16,222
Yeah, I wouldn't advise taking
Toothless anywhere, Chief.

384
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,390
I know this handiwork.

385
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:21,726
Grimmel the Grisly.
Famous back where I'm from.

386
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:24,030
The smartest dragon hunter
I ever met.

387
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:26,131
Well, next to me, of course.

388
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:29,334
Well, he can't be that smart.
He left his trap unmanned.

389
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:33,673
Nothing's accidental
when it comes to old Grimmel.

390
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:35,340
He lives for the hunt,

391
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:37,342
to get inside the mind
of his prey,

392
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:39,811
to control its every choice.

393
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:41,379
It's all a game to him.

394
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,314
Well, he doesn't know
who he's playing with.

395
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:45,317
Yeah. Well, we've dealt with
his kind before.

396
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,352
Don't underestimate him,
Hiccup.

397
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:50,089
Mark my words.
He'll be back.

398
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:52,694
Then we'll be waiting for him.

399
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:07,439
All right.

400
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:09,841
All right, come on,
give me a clue here.

401
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:12,014
Give me a clue, Dad.

402
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,836
Oh, I hope you don't mind
if I help myself.

403
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,775
This is, uh, mmm, quite good.

404
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:44,880
Oh, that is impressive.
But let me finish my drink.

405
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:49,717
Toothless!

406
00:24:52,887 --> 00:24:55,221
What did you do to him?

407
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:58,157
Eh, nothing
that he won't sleep off.

408
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:02,762
May I?

409
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:03,897
Chief Hiccup.

410
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,933
Hmm? Do I say Chief
or do I call you Hiccup?

411
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,204
What do you prefer?

412
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:15,907
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

413
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:17,776
Oh.

414
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:20,012
Well, your father knew of me.

415
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,915
Now, there was a chief.

416
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:27,520
One of the greatest dragon
hunters to have ever lived.

417
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:30,089
What would he think of you?

418
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:35,226
He had it right, you know.

419
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:37,228
Making it his mission
to destroy the beasts

420
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,497
so that you could grow up
in a better world.

421
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:41,466
He changed his mind.

422
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:43,838
And look where that got him.

423
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:48,541
So let's get to the point.

424
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:51,243
I am the Night Fury killer.

425
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:55,814
I've hunted
every last one but yours.

426
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:58,417
You are going to give me
that dragon, or I will...

427
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,319
I will never give him up.

428
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:07,328
You wish dragons to live free
among us like equals?

429
00:26:09,197 --> 00:26:11,397
A toxic notion, my boy.

430
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:15,033
History has shown that we are
the superior species.

431
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:19,504
What if word of your
misguided ideas were to spread?

432
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:22,608
It would be the undoing
of civilization

433
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,145
as we know it.

434
00:26:26,147 --> 00:26:28,082
Hmm.

435
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,156
Did we get him?

436
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:37,292
Now!

437
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:40,993
Sorry to barge in.

438
00:26:40,995 --> 00:26:43,928
You think you can
come into my home,

439
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:48,099
sit in my father's chair,
and threaten my dragon?

440
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:50,069
This is Berk.

441
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:53,571
And we have defended our way of
life from far worse than you.

442
00:26:53,573 --> 00:26:55,340
Ooh.

443
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:58,276
A fighting spirit.
I love it.

444
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:01,613
Only I'm afraid
you're mistaken.

445
00:27:01,615 --> 00:27:05,251
You've never seen
anything like me.

446
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:15,530
Astrid, look out!

447
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:24,637
Look out! Son, get clear.

448
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:28,909
Run!

449
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:38,550
Have my dragon ready

450
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:43,558
when I return, or I will
destroy everything you love.

451
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:55,000
- Grab the buckets!
- How did this happen?!

452
00:27:56,938 --> 00:27:58,937
- Inside.
- It's the middle of the night.

453
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:01,205
- What are we doing here?
- All right.

454
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:03,978
All right, everybody.
Settle down, please.

455
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:07,012
Fishlegs.

456
00:28:07,014 --> 00:28:09,447
Have you ever seen
that species of dragon before?

457
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,385
Let me at him!

458
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,219
I'll give him
a piece of my mind!

459
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:18,023
And by mind, I mean fist!

460
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:20,525
Did you miss the part
where we almost died?

461
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:23,161
Have you seen my house?

462
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:25,630
This is a new kind of enemy.

463
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:28,300
And I underestimated him.
Now, that's on me.

464
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:30,301
But I will not do that again.

465
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:33,539
We're Vikings.
We don't run from a fight.

466
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,640
At least, I don't.
You might.

467
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:37,509
I agree with Hiccup.

468
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:39,511
We haven't seen
the last of Grimmel.

469
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:42,414
He's a predator,
single-minded and patient.

470
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,582
He won't stop
until he gets what he wants.

471
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:45,684
I'm with Eret.

472
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:48,686
We have to take
this threat seriously.

473
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:50,688
Grimmel is just
a sign of the times.

474
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,126
Our enemies are getting
smarter, more determined.

475
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:58,563
We're not just overcrowded.
We are exposed and vulnerable.

476
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:02,167
Short of full-blown war
and risking everyone we love,

477
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:05,436
I don't...

478
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:08,773
I don't see a way
of staying here any longer.

479
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:10,542
What would Stoick think of this?

480
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:13,113
Hey! Hear him out!

481
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:22,521
If we want to live in peace
with our dragons,

482
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:24,555
we need a better plan.

483
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:27,259
So what are you saying, Chief?

484
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:29,427
I'm saying
we have to disappear.

485
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:31,362
Off the map.

486
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:34,599
Take the dragons to a place
where no one will find them.

487
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,601
And where might that be?

488
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:39,437
He's talking about a quest
for the Hidden World.

489
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,305
The hidden what?

490
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:42,440
Out to lunch. - Yeah.

491
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:45,444
My father was obsessed with it
when I was a boy.

492
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:47,212
He made notes and maps

493
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:51,050
in search of the ancestral home
of all dragons,

494
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:54,285
tucked away somewhere
beyond the edge of the world.

495
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:56,421
It may be the solution we need.

496
00:29:56,423 --> 00:29:59,257
We are dragon people.

497
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,359
It's where we belong.

498
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:05,363
Look, I know this is our home.

499
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:08,132
My father left me
to protect it.

500
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:11,136
But Berk is more
than this place.

501
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:13,071
We are Berk.

502
00:30:13,073 --> 00:30:14,705
The people, the dragons.

503
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:18,476
I say Berk is wherever we go.

504
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:19,811
I don't know.

505
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,179
What do you think?

506
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:24,183
I'm with him! Who else?!

507
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:26,185
♪ ♪

508
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:44,669
Excuse me. Coming through.

509
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:46,772
Just, let me just
get right through here.

510
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:50,609
Fishmeat, look, eat your rocks.
Eat your rocks.

511
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:53,111
Gods! People who fly
with babies are the worst.

512
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:57,849
I feel like I'm always asking
you this question, but...

513
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,851
Wake up, Grump! Wake up!

514
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:02,253
Is there an actual plan or...?

515
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:05,357
Just keep flying until
we reach the end of the world.

516
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,826
Ah. Seems sensible.

517
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:10,628
<i>So, where are they?</i>

518
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,563
Gone. Obviously.

519
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,699
The Night Fury escaped you?

520
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:16,869
- Again?
- I encouraged it.

521
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:20,304
They've abandoned
their only defensible position.

522
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:21,907
<i>Running scared</i>

523
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,309
<i>with what little
they can carry.</i>

524
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:26,211
It just keeps going.

525
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:28,914
That's 'cause the world
is actually round.

526
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,515
The sun's round. The moon is round.

527
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,884
Stars are round.

528
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:33,718
Even though
they're small and stupid.

529
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,754
Right? Stars.

530
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,924
Don't fret.
They won't get far.

531
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:42,194
The Night Fury is distracted.

532
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:45,898
I introduced him
to your female.

533
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,899
<i>Furies mate for life, you see.</i>

534
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:50,769
What you picking up on, bud?

535
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:54,372
The Light Fury!

536
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:55,773
- She's following us!
- Wow!

537
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:57,775
Cool.

538
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:01,812
- Would ya look at that?
- Where'd she go?

539
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:03,782
Is she made of sky?

540
00:32:03,784 --> 00:32:06,121
Whoa! Hold up, Toothless!

541
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:14,926
Well, look who it is.

542
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:17,628
Uh...

543
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,263
Oh, hey, it's really nice
to finally...

544
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:33,946
This is perfect. So great.

545
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:35,783
Not a word.

546
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,586
<i>Y-Yes, yes,
but where did they go?</i>

547
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:43,222
I have to explain this.

548
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:45,890
Night Furies can't survive
in the cold,

549
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:47,126
so they haven't gone north.

550
00:32:47,128 --> 00:32:49,227
<i>They're trying to put distance
between themselves</i>

551
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:50,596
<i>and enemies to the east</i>

552
00:32:50,598 --> 00:32:51,929
and south.

553
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:53,764
<i>And Night Furies cannot fly</i>

554
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:57,502
<i>long distances without rest.</i>

555
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:59,972
Their flight path
must include stops.

556
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:01,376
Potty break!

557
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:06,011
<i>Therefore, they've gone...</i>

558
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:10,784
<i>They can only have gone...</i>

559
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:16,321
<i>Does anyone want
to take a guess?</i>

560
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:17,755
Anyone?

561
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:19,757
W-W... W-W-W...

562
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,892
Ah, east!

563
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:23,629
West.

564
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:26,465
Hmm? Simple, you see?

565
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,466
Oh, isn't this fun?

566
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:30,635
Yes? No?

567
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:34,606
Yes. Yes.

568
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:36,941
Where is your love of the hunt?

569
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:39,477
I thought you were conquerors.

570
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:41,680
You'll have your prize in time.

571
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:46,651
Just allow me a few more days
to enjoy this.

572
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:48,653
I have dearly missed it.

573
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:50,289
<i>All right.</i>

574
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,457
Looks like we're camping here
for tonight.

575
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:54,425
Well, thank Thor for that.

576
00:33:54,427 --> 00:33:56,428
Yes. My own place.

577
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,798
I plan to build a hut,
only for the bearded.

578
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,666
Ruffnut, you got to stay out.

579
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:03,468
Chin whiskers don't count.

580
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,671
I see a tower of
manliness in the shape of me.

581
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:09,908
It's gonna be taller than Eret
with bigger muscles.

582
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,443
W-What?

583
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:13,544
- Get out of my house!
- Hey.

584
00:34:13,546 --> 00:34:15,579
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, there's a problem.

585
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:16,881
Ever since you showed up,

586
00:34:16,883 --> 00:34:18,450
you've been trying
to upstage me.

587
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:20,651
You're just so jealous.
It's delusional.

588
00:34:20,653 --> 00:34:22,553
Yeah, delusion's
a good word for it.

589
00:34:22,555 --> 00:34:24,088
Listen, son of Eret.

590
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,524
When Hiccup blows it as chief,
I'm next in line.

591
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:28,926
Number two, 'cause
I'm clearly Valka's favorite.

592
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:31,863
So, you better start
showing me some respect.

593
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:34,566
Strange little man.

594
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:36,334
Ah, don't mind him.

595
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:39,671
It's not your fault you have
the body of a Norse god.

596
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:41,707
I myself have the same problem.

597
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,843
This one's mine.

598
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:47,546
Blacksmith's stall
goes right here.

599
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:50,916
One, two, three, four, five.

600
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:53,551
- Where's...? Oh.
- Uh, okay.

601
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:55,954
Uh, hold on, gang.
I-I said make camp.

602
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:59,024
- Did you see them?
- Not build a new village.

603
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,925
Who died and made you chief?

604
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:03,595
What? Ow!

605
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:05,930
Granted, this place
is very nice,

606
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:08,100
but it's not the Hidden World.

607
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:11,102
We don't even know
if this Hidden World exists.

608
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:14,372
Yeah. This place is real.

609
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:16,140
Eh, there's nothing
more stubborn

610
00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:18,744
than a mob of
tired, hungry Vikings.

611
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:22,814
Well, I guess this can
work as a base in the meantime.

612
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:25,850
It's defensible, hidden.

613
00:35:25,852 --> 00:35:28,120
All right. You can stay.

614
00:35:28,122 --> 00:35:29,854
Say hello to New Berk!

615
00:35:29,856 --> 00:35:31,722
Let's get building, lads.

616
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:34,126
Until Toothless and I
find the Hidden World.

617
00:35:34,128 --> 00:35:36,660
Get off it!

618
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,129
Now, about that voice.

619
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:41,600
Can we lose the whole
honking goose thing?

620
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,834
It's hard to imagine
wedded bliss

621
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:46,771
with that going off
every minute.

622
00:35:46,773 --> 00:35:48,640
If you're going
to continue west,

623
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:50,941
I should head back to make sure
we weren't followed.

624
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:53,178
Great idea. I'll go with you
for protection.

625
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,814
No! You're far
too important here.

626
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:59,084
Yeah.

627
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,051
Just be careful.

628
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:02,553
Look at this place!
It's amazing!

629
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:04,455
- That's a nice rock.
- What?

630
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:08,727
This plan to hide us
from the rest of the world.

631
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:10,629
Though-though I wish
it were possible,

632
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:13,164
I fear it can't last, Hiccup.

633
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:16,934
I mean, you know I tried
to do the same for years.

634
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:22,039
But greedy humans
always find a way.

635
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:25,644
I just... I only ask
that you think about it.

636
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:26,977
This one's mine.

637
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,946
I threw my axe down first.

638
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:31,582
Do you still think
I'm crazy or...?

639
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:35,986
Let's just say
this whole idea is very you.

640
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,155
Well, thanks for
supporting me last night.

641
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:39,691
It meant a lot.

642
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:42,227
Don't thank me yet.

643
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:44,195
I just hope
you're right about this.

644
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:47,667
- I like it here.
- I always wanted a sunset view.

645
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,184
Toothless.

You tried this once before.
He didn't want it.

Well, until now,

Now he's love crazed.

677

Only we're the ones
going crazy.

678
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:26,017
The sooner he brings back
that Light Fury, the better.

679
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:28,285
Yeah, but to do that,
he'll need to fly without me.

What if Grimmel found him?

- What if he needs me?
- Would you relax?

713

He's probably having
the time of his life.

She never comes around.

she's always rushing off.

716
00:50:54,414 --> 00:50:56,847
I'm saying how-how do we know

717
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:58,515
if she's right for us?

718
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,517

- You know what I mean.

719

She's so wild and skittish.
I'm just gonna say it.

Can't tame 'em all, Hiccup.

One day, you'll have to snip
those apron strings

723
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:12,028
and let Toothless
stretch his wings.

724

Reminds me of a talk I had
with Stoick about you.

- Who?
- Those bloody Hobgobblers.

I swear they're popping up
faster than rabbits.

728
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,544
I think they want to eat me.

729
00:51:26,546 --> 00:51:28,745

I'm tasty.

watching you walk.

00:51:33,418 --> 00:51:35,486
Lose the limp.
No one's gonna marry that.

733
00:51:35,488 --> 00:51:37,354
I have a prosthetic leg.

734
00:51:37,356 --> 00:51:39,523

Come on. Chin up, Hiccy.
Puff out that chest.

737
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,530
Move that butt to the left a little bit.

738
00:51:55,707 --> 00:51:58,475
Mom, are you hurt?
W-What happened out there?

739
00:51:58,477 --> 00:52:00,745
I don't know how,
but Grimmel is tracking us.

740
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:04,615
Ah! This is all because
of the Hobgobblers.

741
00:52:04,617 --> 00:52:06,716
He has a hundred ships,
maybe more,

with enough cages
for all of our dragons.

743

we have to take him
out of the mix.

Uh, and how would we do that?

746
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:19,662

747
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:21,832
Capture him?

748

just keep your helmets on.

810
00:57:25,938 --> 00:57:27,403
Toothless and I will find her.

811
00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:29,338
Toothless has
the Light Fury now.

812
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,108
He's probably
not even coming back.

813
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,341
What?

814
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:34,343
You gave him
his freedom, Hiccup.

815
00:57:34,345 --> 00:57:36,245
What were you expecting?

816
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:38,115
I never thought
he'd stay away for good!

817
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:40,850
I-I...

818
00:57:40,852 --> 00:57:44,256
Look, I'll-I'll figure it out.
I just need more time.

819
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:48,791
He thinks he has to lead alone.

820
00:57:48,793 --> 00:57:52,329
Well, because
his father had to.

821
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:55,932
He doesn't realize
the strength you have together.

822
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:59,336
- Do you still believe in him?
- Of course.

823
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:01,137
I wish he did.

824
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:05,508
But he thinks he's nothing
without Toothless.

825
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:08,180
Then help him
realize the truth.

826
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:13,983
- Get on.
- What?

827
00:58:13,985 --> 00:58:15,218
We're going to find him.

828
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,454
Really?

829
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:20,758
Everybody, stay put.

830
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,459
We will get Ruffnut back.
Don't worry.

831
00:58:23,461 --> 00:58:25,129
Worry?

832
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:27,930
If they're stuck with Ruffnut,
I'm more worried about them.

833
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:33,336
Why the long face?

834
00:58:33,338 --> 00:58:35,405
I mean, mine's long,
but yours is really long.

835
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:38,175
All face and no brain, like
you got stretched at birth.

836
00:58:38,177 --> 00:58:39,776
Do you have a twin, too?

837
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:41,512
Tuffnut took up all the room
in Mom's belly.

838
00:58:41,514 --> 00:58:43,379
Otherwise I'd have
a rounder head and more brains.

839
00:58:43,381 --> 00:58:45,515
That's science.

840
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:47,917
My braids are like
little Zipplebacks. See?

841
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:52,289
Even the mold spots
look like eyes. It's so cute.

842
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:53,990
They even have
little horns and everything,

843
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:55,325
just like Barf and Belch.

844
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:57,026
Except me and Barf
can't stand Belch,

845
00:58:57,028 --> 00:58:58,227
so they're really just Barfs.

846
00:58:58,229 --> 00:58:59,296
It's warm in here.

847
00:58:59,298 --> 00:59:01,465
I know what you're thinking.

848
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:04,267
You've never had
a prisoner this hot.

849
00:59:04,269 --> 00:59:06,068
All the boys love me.

850
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,204
Except Eret,
who totally lost his chance.

851
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:10,240
That ship has sailed, boy.
Sorry.

852
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:11,575
And Hiccup is
practically married

853
00:59:11,577 --> 00:59:12,742
to that round-head, Astrid.

854
00:59:12,744 --> 00:59:16,113
But Snotlout and Fishlegs,
they're basically my harem.

855
00:59:16,115 --> 00:59:18,515
I just can't choose, you know?

856
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:21,117
Snotlout's a beefcake but
almost too pretty, you know?

857
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,452
Sometimes I think he's more
in love with himself than me.

858
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:26,823
There's only room for one
beauty in this relationship.

859
00:59:26,825 --> 00:59:29,392
Fishlegs would keep
me alive longer if I had to

860
00:59:29,394 --> 00:59:31,227
eat one of them, stranded
on some glacier somewhere.

861
00:59:31,229 --> 00:59:33,030
But he never shuts up about dragons.

862
00:59:33,032 --> 00:59:34,430
Don't you hate
when people never stop talking?

863
00:59:34,432 --> 00:59:36,332
- Yes, I do.
- They just keep going and going.

864
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:38,836
Blah, blah, blah.
It's so boring.

865
00:59:38,838 --> 00:59:40,838
- Can't we just feed her to your dragons?
- I'm hungry.

866
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,238
Hey, what do you have
to eat around here?

867
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,506
I'm allergic to fish.
You should know that.

868
00:59:43,508 --> 00:59:46,843
That's all they have
at that stupid new island.

869
00:59:46,845 --> 00:59:48,412
Do you have any clams?

870
00:59:48,414 --> 00:59:50,247
They're like little mouths
with slimy food inside

871
00:59:50,249 --> 00:59:52,349
that's already chewed,
like the way Mom used to do it.

872
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:55,519
- Enough!

873
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:57,954
Until I turned 12 and she was
like, "Chew your own food."

874
00:59:57,956 --> 00:59:59,523
And I was like,
"No, I kinda like it."

875
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:02,258
Most annoying creature
ever to cross my path.

876
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,061
Aw.

877
01:00:04,063 --> 01:00:07,164
Oops, you let the dragons out.

878
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:09,032
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

879
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:10,867
- No, this one's gonna get you.
- Get...

880
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:13,202
Take him and go!

881
01:00:13,204 --> 01:00:15,939
Please! I beg you!

882
01:00:15,941 --> 01:00:18,341
The Deathgrippers
will have to forgo dinner.

883
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:21,611
Ew, you feed
your dragons dragons?

884
01:00:21,613 --> 01:00:23,914
- Go!
- Where's your bathroom?

885
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,015
I got to...

886
01:00:25,017 --> 01:00:27,316
Okay! Gods.

887
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:30,387
No wonder you have gray hair.

888
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:32,256
Stress is not good for you.

So long, losers!

890
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,604
- Where-where is she heading?
- She's tracking something.

two to become number one.

972
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:19,127
Yep.

973
01:12:19,129 --> 01:12:22,097
I feel like the same screwup
I was before I met Toothless.

974
01:12:22,099 --> 01:12:23,932
I can see that.

975
01:12:23,934 --> 01:12:26,101
Are you just gonna stand there
and agree with everything?

976
01:12:26,103 --> 01:12:26,935
Well, you're right.

977
01:12:26,937 --> 01:12:29,771
You're back
to where you started,

978
01:12:29,773 --> 01:12:32,108
but I was the first
to believe in you.

979
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,810
And I have watched you doubt

980
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:36,279
whether you're worthy
ever since.

981
01:12:36,281 --> 01:12:38,114
But you know what?

982
01:12:38,116 --> 01:12:41,985
I am the person I am today
because of you.

983
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:45,053
I never told you that,
but it's true.

984
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,757
You are the bravest,
most stubborn,

985
01:12:47,759 --> 01:12:51,761
most determined knucklehead
I know.

986
01:12:51,763 --> 01:12:54,029
Toothless didn't
give you that, Hiccup.

987
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:57,367
- He just made it...
- Easier.

988
01:12:57,369 --> 01:13:00,970
And now it's gonna be
a lot harder.

989
01:13:00,972 --> 01:13:04,407
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

990
01:13:04,409 --> 01:13:07,142
Probably something stupid.

991
01:13:07,144 --> 01:13:09,915
That's the Hiccup I know.

992
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:15,918
Suit up, gang.
We're going to get them back.

993
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,921
- What?
- He's lost his mind.

994
01:13:18,923 --> 01:13:22,025
Now, that's marriage material.

995
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:25,261
At last, faithful pupil,
you are ready.

996
01:13:25,263 --> 01:13:30,432
Um, how are we gonna get our
dragons back without dragons?

997
01:13:30,434 --> 01:13:31,801
Trust me.

998
01:13:35,406 --> 01:13:37,873
- Watch yourselves.
- You're next.

999
01:13:39,443 --> 01:13:40,810
Move it.

1000
01:13:43,682 --> 01:13:45,948
Um, that's right, alpha.

1001
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:47,920
No surprises.

1002
01:13:56,294 --> 01:14:01,864
So, jump off the cliff
in these.

1003
01:14:01,866 --> 01:14:03,365
That's the best you've got?

1004
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:06,168
No, you guys are
the best I've got.

Aw.

Ruffnut, that was my line.

1008
01:14:12,242 --> 01:14:14,243
- Let's go!
- Try to keep up!

1009
01:14:18,383 --> 01:14:19,949
Yeah! - Yeah!

1010
01:14:19,951 --> 01:14:22,718
- I'm doing it!
- All right! - Oh!

1011
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,985
Get clear!

1012
01:14:32,796 --> 01:14:35,097
Aw.

You didn't think I'd actually
hand you the Night Fury,

1014
01:14:37,268 --> 01:14:38,266

1015
01:14:38,268 --> 01:14:39,968
He's mine to kill.

what I started.

Best of luck controlling them
without an alpha.

Perfect timing.
