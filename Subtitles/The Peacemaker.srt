2
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,835
Mr. Minister...?

3
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,048
- Someone paged me. But no one's there.

4
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,301
- I paged you.

5
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,055
- Yes?

6
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,477
- It couldn't wait until tomorrow at Parliament?

7
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,192
- No.

8
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:27,183
Have our S.T.A.R.T. friends given
us permission to do our jobs yet?

9
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,977
- Yes, sir. And we didn't even have to ask.

10
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,688
- Something wrong, Sergeant?

11
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,360
- I didn't Join the Russian Army to dismantle
it for the Americans, sir.

12
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,113
- None of us did...the world changes.

13
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,866
We must change with it.

14
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,221
Everything is ready?

15
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,265
- Everything is ready, General.

16
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,227
- Good luck.

17
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,604
- Thank you, sir.

18
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,926
What are they doing?

19
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,379
8 minutes, 40 seconds.

20
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,049
8 minutes, 40 seconds.
No time to relax, boys.

21
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,344
Oh, my God.

22
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,997
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

23
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,832
- Calm down.

24
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,667
- We're going to die.

25
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,503
- We're 1 5 km away. Under a mountain.

26
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,338
I want my money.

27
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:23,964
I want my money. Be strong.
You're an officer.

28
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,507
Be strong.
You're an officer.

29
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:26,842
I'm so afraid...

30
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:27,551
I'm so afraid... No, no.
It's time to be strong.

31
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,177
No, no.
It's time to be strong.

32
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,180
I don't think I am.

33
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,141
Pity.

34
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,031
Take him away.

35
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,745
What happened?

36
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,915
I don't know, Dr. Kelly.
Please come with me, ma'am.

37
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,630
I've got estimates
on cloud size coming through.

38
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,006
All right. What have we got?

39
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,093
NORAD's got R-4
going over sector 9877.

40
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,762
It's been localized.
Sixty degrees longitude, 50 lat.

41
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,972
What about NPIC?

42
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,225
Ground blast 40 minutes ago in the
Ural Mountains. Two trains collided.

43
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,104
One was carrying warheads to Trabinsk.
Nice hair. Very au naturel.

44
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,690
Nuclear forces are going from
DEFCON four to DEFCON three.

45
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,859
- Secure fax is coming in right now.
- Reports coming in now.

46
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,445
NMCC is concerned the Russians
are gonna use this incident

47
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,281
- to avail troops into Chechnya...
- That's not our problem.

48
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,285
- Estimates from Livermore?
- Five to 700 kilotons.

49
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,998
Mark Appleton's looking for you.
He's upstairs.

50
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,417
- All current data on my desk?
- Yes.

51
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,085
I'm gonna need a minute.

52
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,589
- Radiation pattern projections in?
- Yeah, but those aren't confirmed.

53
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,842
- Well, get them confirmed.
- Russia. What a fucking mess.

54
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,844
God, I miss the Cold War.

55
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,555
Get Essler down here now.
I need a translator.

56
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,016
Essler's gone.
He quit to run JPL three weeks ago.

57
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,894
- Right. Who'd we appoint?
- My memo's sitting on your desk.

58
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,230
Jesus Christ, who the hell's
in charge down there?

59
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,817
Mark? Excuse me. Hi. Sorry.

60
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,029
Forget Chernobyl. This is huge.

61
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,032
Dr. Julia Kelly, Acting Chair,
Nuclear Smuggling Group.

62
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,284
You know Terry Hamilton,
National Security Advisor.

63
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,787
Yes, sir. We met at
last year's Christmas party.

64
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,705
I'm briefing the
president in 35 minutes.

65
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,041
I need to explain to him how,
with our own START team there,

66
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,876
a goddamned accident
like this could happen.

67
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,003
It wasn't an accident, sir.

68
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,047
I'm sorry?

69
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,841
We believe that train
was carrying SS-1 8s.

70
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,178
- SS-1 8s pencil out at One Point Safe.
- What's she saying?

71
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,264
Sir, it means if you fire a bullet
directly into the warhead,

72
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,725
there's less than a one-in-a-million
chance of the bomb going off.

73
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,603
The warhead has to be ignited
by its own nuclear trigger.

74
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,397
Would you hold this, please?
Here we have the satellite imagery.

75
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,901
This is the two trains approaching.
Here's the collision itself.

76
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,403
Check out the field of regard.

77
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,407
These two shots are at the same height
because they occurred at the same time.

78
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,244
Look at the blast.
It's two degrees higher...

79
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,914
- ...after the satellites passed over.
- Elapsed time between shots?

80
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,334
Between the wreck and the detonation,
four and a half minutes.

81
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:34,005
Somebody set that nuclear weapon off.
This was a terrorist act.

82
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,925
Full NSC briefing at 9am.

83
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,094
The Russians' accident story
will stand for now.

84
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,180
No background leaks to the press.
Nobody shows up on Nightline.

85
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,932
- Doctor...?
- Kelly.

86
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,103
Dr. Kelly, I'm putting your group
on point until I find a replacement.

87
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,771
Yes, sir.

88
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,650
Get me the latest satellite overviews
and keep the updates coming.

89
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,286
OK... State, we're gonna need
talking points for the president.

90
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,954
We're also gonna need to know anybody

91
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,039
that might want to
detonate a nuke on Russian soil.

92
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,959
General, I'm gonna need a military
liaison with intel background

93
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,794
- and Russian contacts.
- You got it.

94
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:17,132
And General? Make sure he's willing
to take orders from a woman.

95
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,303
Now, Colonel Devoe, let's deal
with the events of May 1 8th.

96
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,807
You were arrested in a bar brawl
in a Moscow disco called...

97
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:30,228
- ..."Night Crawler?"
- Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

98
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:35,317
You were in the company of a prostitute
and a Russian Army colonel named...

99
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,321
- ...Dimitri Vertikoff?
- Yes, ma'am, that is also correct.

100
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,616
Dimitri and I went into this bar
to try and buy some nerve gas

101
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,244
off this ex-KGB guy that
we had heard was selling

102
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,331
black market surplus
munitions to Iraq.

103
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,918
The fight started because, well, we'd
run up a bit of a bar tab and we were...

104
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,630
I believe the exact amount was $5200?

105
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,966
We had dinner and I bought
a couple of... rounds.

106
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,011
Colonel Vertikoff
identified the KGB guy

107
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,681
and we were able to stop
the nerve gas from getting to Iraq.

108
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,518
- So how do you repay a man like that?
- A sports utility vehicle?

109
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,480
That's exactly right.
Dimitri has a teenage daughter.

110
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:14,856
She likes to go four-wheeling.

111
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,777
I know this Ford guy in Maryland who
cut me a great deal on these Explorers.

112
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,237
I like the Bronco a little
bit better myself, but...

113
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,531
Colonel, let me get this straight.

114
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,035
You spent taxpayers' money
to buy and ship

115
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,579
a Ford Explorer 8,000 miles

116
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,458
to the teenage daughter
of a Russian colonel?

117
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,293
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,631
Think of it as exporting goodwill.

119
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,844
We never discussed detonating a bomb.

120
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,057
- If they'd discovered missing warheads,
they would have found us in hours.

121
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,936
Now it'll be days before they even
reach the crash site.

122
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,774
I hate these new ones. They don't seem real.

123
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,111
He looks bug-eyed, deformed.

124
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,738
- They'll have the roads blocked.

125
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,366
Your Russian is awful. Speak English.

126
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,784
It was stupid. Understand?

127
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,954
Your friends made this deal,
but this is my operation.

128
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,832
Don't make me start thinking
of why I don't need you.

129
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,793
- They will never let us through!
- Of course they will.

130
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,505
Section 21A, Nuclear Disaster Protocol.

131
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:07,969
One: Secure area. Two: Control debris.
Three: Evacuate casualties.

132
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,605
It was stupid.

133
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,942
But they would have the technical
know-how and should not be ruled out.

134
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,322
Now, moving on, we come to
Shamil Basayev, a scientist.

135
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,326
He claims responsibility for having
placed a canister of radioactive cesium

136
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,661
in a park in Moscow last June.

137
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,914
But his underworld ties suggest
he could be part

138
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,124
of a much bigger operation.

139
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,088
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev,

140
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,049
Chechen leader since the
Russians assassinated Dudayev.

141
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,677
He has threatened to attack
Federation nuclear power plants.

142
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,347
There are other possibles
on our terrorist list,

143
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,642
as outlined in section four
of your packet.

144
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,602
Our reaction to the crisis
is as follows:

145
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,021
We have initiated
an intelligence directive

146
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,148
with the Nuclear Smuggling Group
acting as hub.

147
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,527
DIA and NRO, heads up.
You'll continue responsibility

148
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,946
- for primary sat imagery...
- Excuse me, ma'am?

149
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,740
- I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt.
- Yes?

150
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,828
These terrorists, have they asked
for anything yet? A list of demands?

151
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,539
Russians out of Chechnya,
that sort of thing?

152
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,708
No, but it's not unusual for days,
even weeks to go by

153
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,877
before a claim of
responsibility is made.

154
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,547
- Yeah...
- Air Mob Command is standing by...

155
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,716
Excuse me again. Ma'am, I'm sorry.

156
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,554
That's a satellite shot of the two
trains just before they collided.

157
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,890
Dr. Kelly, perhaps you should
discuss Special Op possibilities?

158
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,058
Right.

159
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,062
General Garnett has Special Operations
Command at full alert. Excuse me?

160
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,690
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to keep interrupting.

161
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:47,068
You see these blobs right here at one
meter resolution here and here?

162
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:51,239
Those are people jumping off the
passenger train before it crashes.

163
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:55,952
Now take a look at that train.
That's the one with the nuke.

164
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,455
Nobody's jumping off that.
Why not?

165
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,460
They were already dead.

166
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,256
How many warheads were on the train?

167
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,259
The Russians haven't confirmed yet.

168
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,344
So we have no idea
of potential yield.

169
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:22,061
- Are you suggesting this was a robbery?
- I'm suggesting that whoever did this

170
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,772
had access to Russian
satellite positioning intel.

171
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,233
That leaves out your Chechen rebels.

172
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,949
I would like to point out that
1 500 people were killed last night.

173
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,328
You don't do that unless you're trying
to make a very profound statement.

174
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,539
Do you know how much a functioning
nuke is worth on the open market?

175
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,750
- 200 million dollars, cash.
- 200 million dollars

176
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:47,462
makes for a very profound statement.
Now, I'm sorry, ma'am,

177
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,007
the detonation was a smoke screen.
This was a hijacking.

178
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:55,678
And whoever stole these things
got off the bus a long way back.

179
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:04,812
Well, we will certainly be considering
your theory. Thank you very much.

180
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,023
It's just an opinion.

181
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,987
Whoever has current data on the blast,
I need it on my desk, ASAP.

182
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,447
You got it!

183
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,993
Ken, try to get Russian Missile
Command on the phone, please.

184
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,911
First reports in say the explosion

185
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,539
- was seen 500 miles...
- All right, anything from DIA yet?

186
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,582
We should have Russian intel
within a half hour.

187
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,961
Great. Sue, I need
the START observers' report.

188
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,381
Not just the summaries. Not just
the abstracts. The whole thing.

189
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,883
- I'm all over it.
- And where is my military liaison?

190
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,802
- Has anybody seen...?
- Right here.

191
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:23,391
Lieutenant Colonel Tom Devoe,
reporting as ordered, ma'am.

192
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,478
My enthusiasm sometimes
gets the best of me.

193
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:32,817
- I hope I didn't offend you in there.
- No, of course not.

194
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,070
- Coffee?
- Sure. I'd love some.

195
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,824
- It's over there.
- Russian Missile Command's on line six.

196
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,076
And I would like to
reiterate our commitment

197
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,329
to helping you come up
with some answers.

198
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:49,625
- Yes. No, I understand, General.
- I... brought you some coffee.

199
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:59,469
That's right. Well, we need to know
exactly who was on that train.

200
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,557
No, I am the man in charge.
I report directly to the president.

201
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,727
What do you want me to say?

202
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,983
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

203
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,363
Yes, well... I see.

204
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,450
No, I understand. I think I have...
I mean, I know I have a couple of...

205
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,624
Well, if you would be able to get back
to me with the names of the men...

206
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,376
- I'm gonna...
- ...who were on the train

207
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,795
and the number of warheads,
that would be great.

208
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,005
...go to my office.

209
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,132
And how long do you think
that will take?

210
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,676
Well...

211
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,848
I'll be expecting your call.

212
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,725
Thank you.

213
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,324
To repeat, CNN has confirmed

214
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,160
- the detonation of a nuclear device.
- Push that through as fast as we can.

215
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,330
Radioactive cloud moving slowly
toward South Central Mongolia.

216
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,583
We've got confirmation. There were
ten warheads on that train.

217
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,669
Departure orders... 40 men on board.

218
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,712
- This is meaningless.
- It's in Russian.

219
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:22,176
It's meaningless because they haven't
listed anyone's rank.

220
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,387
Where'd you learn to speak Russian?

221
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,055
Princeton.

222
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,307
The blue-blooded backbone
of our country.

223
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,519
- My father's a mailman.
- Well, you'd never know.

224
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,106
Ilin, Kodoroff, Kulik, Levindovsky...

225
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:39,861
- Kodoroff? Alexsander Kodoroff?
- Yeah. You know him?

226
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,030
Yeah, I know him. Goddamn it!

227
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,242
I don't know about the rest of these
guys, but General Alexsander Kodoroff

228
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,288
doesn't ride around on a nuclear
transport train. Get me NMCC intel.

229
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,541
- It's like Ivana Trump on a subway.
- Can you go get the files?

230
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,254
- I'd have that enhanced off the Urals.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,881
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

232
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:05,052
Kodoroff's under investigation for
corruption. Gonna be indicted.

233
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,388
Gave a speech nine days ago
in St. Petersburg.

234
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,058
Mostly nationalistic bluster,
bemoaning the loss of empire,

235
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,436
the necessary unity
of the Slavic peoples.

236
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:17,773
Family history, phone records,
bank statements,

237
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:22,737
urinalysis from a Moscow
traffic stop last month, .367.

238
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:26,491
- I'm amazed he could turn the key.
- That's definitely a few cocktails.

239
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,493
Saw his dentist on Tuesday,

240
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,245
had dinner with some
very attractive people on Friday.

241
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,498
We haven't been able
to ID them yet.

242
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,084
- Jesus, Costello, you're slipping.
- I'm getting old, sir.

243
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,253
- I'm getting old.
- You're not old.

244
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,297
General Garnett's old.

245
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,175
If you don't mind me asking, sir,
is Kodoroff involved?

246
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,093
We don't know. He was on the train.

247
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,930
- You see, that's funny.
- Why is that?

248
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,266
Because the General's got
this Finnish mistress, right?

249
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,101
- She lives in Helsinki. Right.
- Laina.

250
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,145
Guy calls her every day,
like clockwork.

251
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,563
- Never misses.
- So?

252
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:02,109
Well, the thing is, if this Kodoroff guy
was on that train,

253
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,446
and he's so dead, who's bouncing
calls to Laina in Helsinki

254
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,074
off some satellite over
southern Russia?

255
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,202
That's a secure phone, I need it.

256
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,287
- Sir, I gotta go.
- Excuse me, General.

257
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,668
Sir, if a top-ranking
Russian general is involved,

258
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,712
any intel we get from Moscow
is either compromised...

259
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,468
- ...or a flat-out lie.
- You're right.

260
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,471
- Dimitri, Tom Devoe.
- What do you want?

261
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,056
What's the matter? You busy?

262
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,309
I'm with two women.
Call me back some other time.

263
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,103
How you guys holding up?

264
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,606
I think the only virtue is people
are forgetting Chechnya.

265
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:44,360
Yeah. Listen, D, I've got
the troop manifest from that train.

266
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,780
Alek Kodoroff got vaporized
out there, did he?

267
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,118
- Yeah. What a shame.
- Yeah.

268
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:56,455
So how is it he's calling Laina
from a bird over southern Russia?

269
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,708
How's he doing that, D?

270
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,423
Hey, D, you still there?

271
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,927
You must be wrong about that, Tom.
Our figures indicate

272
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,722
the fallout should have
dissipated by then.

273
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,100
Let me fax you what we've got.
Your number?

274
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,394
Hold on. Fax number, please?
Give me the fax.

275
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,187
Hang on,
I'll give you the number.

276
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,025
All right: 001-703-51 168.

277
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,738
Six, eight...
I'm going to hang up now. Bye.

278
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,412
That scared him.

279
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,835
- Is this the fax?
- Yes, sir.

280
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,053
Information on the nuclear weapon
incident in Russia's Ural Mountains

281
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,223
is still sketchy at this hour,
but we do have a few new facts

282
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,893
about the magnitude of the disaster.

283
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:01,896
Seismographs around the world
detected the blast.

284
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,482
And we have reports that
the explosion was seen

285
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,402
as far away as Lithuania
on the Baltic Sea.

286
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,322
Initial projections indicate
the nuclear fallout will affect

287
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,410
all of Russia and northern Europe.
Still no word on casualties...

288
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,872
Now there's word that President Clinton
will issue a statement on...

289
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:25,378
- "Vienna, 2pm, Bacherplatz."
- Why Vienna?

290
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,922
- Kordech.
- Maybe.

291
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,133
Kordech is a front for
the Russian Mafia in Vienna.

292
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,427
And it's a trucking company.

293
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:38,474
Whether it was an accident or an
act of terrorism remains a question.

294
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,527
I need NORAD's sector
9877 intel from the Urals,

295
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:54,198
updated fallout patterns and
troop movements from NATO HUMINT.

296
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:58,285
Honey roasted. Think anybody'd
mind if I stole a couple of bags?

297
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,038
My old man would get
a kick out of the Executive Seal.

298
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,458
Go ahead. Knock yourself out.
And would you call Langley?

299
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,794
We're still waiting on the
psych profile on Kodoroff.

300
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,797
- He's an asshole. Save you a trip.
- Thanks.

301
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:14,260
- I'll settle for the official version.
- OK, officially, he's an asshole.

302
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:15,970
He'll do anything for money.

303
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,639
Which is the good news.
It makes him fairly predictable.

304
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,976
Really? I'd say he's
been anything but predictable.

305
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,980
He took an order for an expensive,
hard-to-find product

306
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:30,484
and he intends to make good
on delivery. Supply and demand.

307
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:35,823
Your area of expertise, right, Colonel?
At least that's the word on the Hill.

308
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,455
- You've been checking up on me.
- I like to know who I'm working with.

309
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,421
I'd like to know something.

310
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,718
You moved from Lawrence Livermore
to the White House.

311
00:34:55,886 --> 00:35:00,181
So, first you build the bombs
to blow up the entire world,

312
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,224
and now you want to save it.

313
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,102
Make up your mind.
Which is it gonna be?

314
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,148
Well, I believe this week
we're saving it.

315
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,988
- So, it's really that simple?
- It is, to me, that simple.

316
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:19,700
And when you've been the boss for
more than two weeks, you'll know that.

317
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,872
Three weeks. You've done
some checking yourself.

318
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,334
Well, I like to know
who I'm working with.

319
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:33,506
Doctor, you can run your charts
and your theories all you want.

320
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,008
In the field, this is how it works:

321
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,512
The good guys, that's us,
we chase the bad guys.

322
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,807
And they don't wear black hats.
They are, however, all alike.

323
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,975
They demand power and respect

324
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,353
and they are willing
to pay top dollar to get it.

325
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:50,064
And that is our highly motivated buyer.

326
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,900
- What about other motivations?
- Not important to me.

327
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,777
Whether it's important to you or not,

328
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,904
there are people out there
who don't care about money

329
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,823
and don't give a damn about respect.

330
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,243
People who believe the killing of
innocent men and women is justified.

331
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,913
For them, it is about rage,
frustration, hatred.

332
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,332
They feel pain and they're determined
to share it with the world.

333
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,585
OK, that does me no good.
Let's deal with the facts at hand.

334
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:15,089
Twenty-three hours ago,
General Alexsander Kodoroff stole

335
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,801
- ten nuclear warheads.
- He's just a delivery boy.

336
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,723
I'm not afraid of the man who
wants ten nuclear weapons, Colonel.

337
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,685
I'm terrified of the man
who only wants one.

338
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,953
No, no, no... listen, listen

339
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:33,000
Music should flow like a language, child-

340
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,502
Listen.

341
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,511
Joy-

342
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,688
Sadness, you understand?

343
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:14,541
Changing a single note can turn joy to sorrow. Your turn.

344
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,566
Professor...?

345
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,491
Hello...

346
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:47,908
Hello... - Dusan?

347
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:48,409
Hello... - Dusan?
Who's this?

348
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,368
Hello... - Dusan?
Who's this? - It's me, Vlado.

349
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,369
Is everything okay?

350
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,662
Is everything okay?
- Yes, we're on schedule.

351
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,748
Brother, listen to me...

352
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,878
I'm scared.

353
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,182
Look who's the secret agent! Nice hat.
You don't stand out at all.

354
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,059
Dress shoes with khakis?

355
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,313
- Look at you.
- Leave me alone.

356
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,232
What are they doing to you?
Let me tell you,

357
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,943
- whatever happens, deny it.
- OK, I'll try that.

358
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,739
Now these are CDs, they are for Tasha.
You will not like them.

359
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,158
- How is she?
- Sixteen.

360
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,828
And in love with a 20-year-old
motocross racer. I am worried sick.

361
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,955
- She said to say hello.
- Send her my love.

362
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,750
Is Kodoroff involved with Kordech?
Is that why we're in Vienna?

363
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,461
This is Dr. Julia Kelly.
Colonel Dimitri Vertikoff.

364
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,546
Dr. Kelly heads
the Nuclear Smuggling Group.

365
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,506
- With the White House.
- With the White House.

366
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,550
A beautiful woman with a Ph.D.

367
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,552
You're way out of your league.

368
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,804
- You have no idea, Colonel.

369
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,557
That's good. That's good, yes.

370
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,019
I think we can do business, Dr. Kelly.
Let's take a walk.

371
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,605
OK, let's take a walk.

372
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:13,368
...they sit here and drink.
Well, we might as well join them.

373
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:18,165
...were monitoring Kordech for years.
But it's been a Mafia, ex-KGB operation.

374
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:22,211
Until recently. You have to see it
in the context of my country.

375
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,714
Alek Kodoroff comes from
a generation of officers who grew up

376
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,801
in a crumbling system. Those pictures
in your head about Russia...

377
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:33,180
...bread lines, shitty little
apartments, ancient cars...

378
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:36,683
Kodoroff and his friends
made sure that it never applied to them.

379
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,144
But now, even that system is crumbling.

380
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,524
This was Kodoroff's way out,
his big score.

381
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,527
So you brought us here because
you can't investigate Kordech yourself.

382
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,155
No, I can't investigate
without alerting Kodoroff.

383
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,367
Half the men used to be in my unit.

384
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:59,039
Mr. Dietrich Shummaker schedules
all Russian shipping for Kordech.

385
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,707
- You have an appointment at four.
- Good.

386
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,585
- Let's go see a man about a truck.
- Cheers.

387
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,214
It's gasoline.

388
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,777
- Do you have them?
- Yes. We have to begin immediately.

389
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,559
No, you just have to remember the plan.
I'm Anthony Haden.

390
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,102
- I'm Patty Carson.
- All right.

391
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,397
We go in,
we get the information and get out.

392
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,899
Call me Tony. Here we go.

393
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,108
- Hi.
- Hi.

394
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,612
I'm Anthony Haden, this is
my associate Patty Carson and I think...

395
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:15,073
- ...Herr Shummaker is expecting us.
- Right. Please follow me.

396
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,918
Please make yourselves comfortable.

397
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,419
Thank you.

398
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,549
Trucking business
must be pretty good.

399
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,220
Wonder what chateau in
the Loire Valley these came from.

400
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,972
Mr. Haden, welcome.

401
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:44,645
Thank you very much for seeing us.
This is my associate, Ms. Carson.

402
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,146
Nice place you have here.

403
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,690
My personal taste runs to the Italians.

404
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:52,611
But the German late baroque
was heavily influenced by the Italians.

405
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:57,824
Several of our paintings are Italian.
That's a Tiepolo.

406
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,828
Oh, yeah.
I'm a big LeRoy Neiman fan myself.

407
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,998
Are you familiar with his work?

408
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,335
No, I'm afraid not.
Please, come in.

409
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,837
- Sure.
- Into my office.

410
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:16,009
- Oh, now this is nice.
- Thank you. Have a seat.

411
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,181
How can we help you?

412
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,185
Well, I wanted some information
about trucking in Russia.

413
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,730
I might not be the right man.
If you need to rent equipment...

414
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,233
You're the head of transportation,
right?

415
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:35,320
The head?
No, I just do the scheduling.

416
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,531
Right. You're the guy
who gets things done.

417
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,574
Smart. Put a German on it.

418
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:46,999
Yes, well...
As I said, how can I help you?

419
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,502
What we want to know is,
if I wanted to rent a vehicle

420
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,381
to steal and transport nuclear
weapons from somewhere, let's say,

421
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:58,677
inside the Urals,
would you be the guy to talk to?

422
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,185
Would you be that guy?

423
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,914
No, I'm afraid not.
I believe our meeting is over.

424
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:33,295
- All right. Well, thank you...
- Do you like Ford Explorers?

425
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,797
- We have to go.
- Range Rovers? Land Cruisers...

426
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,050
- We really have to go.
- No, Patty, we have to stay.

427
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,386
- May I ask you to leave...?
- No!

428
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,638
You should have taken the money, Hans!

429
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:48,518
- Now get up and get behind that desk.
- You broke my nose.

430
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,771
Not a word.
Get the duct tape out of my briefcase.

431
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,689
I'm not gonna shoot you
unless I have to.

432
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,151
And if I have to, I'm gonna feel
real bad about it. Now sit down.

433
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,778
- Give me the duct tape.
- Here.

434
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,292
I need the password.
What's the password?

435
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,586
Hang on. Password.

436
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,130
- No.
- All right. Hang on.

437
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,092
All right, Hans, we'll do it your way.

438
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,136
How's the backhand? Password.

439
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,015
- Hasselhoff.
- Hasselhoff.

440
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,394
Hasselhoff...
How do you spell Hasselhoff?

441
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,399
Way to go, Hans. Very brave.

442
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,365
I'm in.

443
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:47,911
I need the trucking invoices
for the last seven days.

444
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,162
All right.

445
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:04,386
- This is your plan?
- Yep.

446
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:08,223
- This is your big plan?
- This is my plan.

447
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,359
Let's go. Hurry up.

448
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,699
- Let's go. Come on.
- Almost. Just logging off.

449
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,952
- Stay on. Who cares? Leave it running.
- Got it!

450
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,043
All right, hang on tight.

451
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,547
And... Thank you very much,
Herr Shummaker.

452
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,495
- Go.
- Come on! Come on!

453
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,413
- Go. Go.
- Hurry up.

454
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:24,216
- You get it?
- Got it. You all right?

455
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,678
No. No, I'm not all right.
Brilliant idea, just smash his face in.

456
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,681
That is how things get done here.
A couple of bribes and

457
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,767
it would've never happened at all.
Am I right?

458
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,936
Check the seats.
They go all the way back.

459
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,522
- Oh, yeah. An embassy car?
- Cool.

460
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:43,193
Of course. CD player, bulletproof
glass. It has everything.

461
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,361
Oh, shit.

462
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:51,785
- We may have a problem.
- This is going to cost us.

463
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,912
What do you have? Give me.
That's enough.

464
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,413
- Yeah?
- I'll be back.

465
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,583
Hold this.

466
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,967
- So you think he set us up?
- Who?

467
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,637
- Your friend.
- No.

468
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,641
- How can you be so sure?
- Because he's my friend.

469
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,315
He needs more money.
Come here.

470
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,071
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

471
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,740
Get down!

472
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,368
Out! Out!

473
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,820
- Get up front! Get up front!
- Up front?

474
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,827
- They're behind us.
- How many?

475
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,537
Two. Three!

476
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,749
All right. Reach into that briefcase.
Pull out an extra magazine.

477
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:29,215
- Where is it?
- In the briefcase. Reach in.

478
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,217
Goddamn it!

479
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,253
Seat belt.

480
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:23,770
No!

481
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,146
Come on. What's wrong with you?

482
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,814
Come on. What's wrong with you?!

483
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,152
What are you doing?

484
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,320
Shit!

485
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:13,671
No!

486
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,181
- Come on.
- The invoices!

487
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,433
- Come on!
- We need the invoices!

488
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,269
- Come on, goddamn it!
- No!

489
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,272
Go, go, go!

490
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:26,054
Dimitri has a...

491
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,723
...a daughter, Tasha.

492
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:33,144
Sixteen. She lives in Rybinsk.

493
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,024
I remember when she was three.

494
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:46,199
She's... She's beautiful.

495
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,836
It doesn't make sense.

496
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:02,006
You don't...

497
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:07,011
...kill a Dimitri Vertikoff.
There are certain rules.

498
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,722
Killing him isn't useful.

499
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:12,725
Is it ever?

500
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,084
I never watched anybody die before.

501
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,434
Welcome. You've got mail.

502
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:02,442
I emailed Shummaker's files to
my AOL account before I logged off.

503
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,947
Did it work?

504
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,161
Yeah.

505
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,539
We're looking for a vehicle
hired in the Urals

506
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,666
on about June 29th, right?

507
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,335
- No, the truck's too small.
- Yeah, yeah...

508
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,380
St. Petersburg. Wrong direction.
Point of origin: Chelyabinsk.

509
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:28,634
Registration number: 7056BM.

510
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,262
Destination: Imisli 44-E.

511
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:35,433
Azerbaijan, it's just south of Russia.

512
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,560
It's 5 miles from fucking Iran.

513
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,021
Kodoroff crosses that border
and those nukes are gone.

514
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:42,482
We got a payment number.
Looks like a bank routing code.

515
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:47,320
There's no names of any clients here.
44-E. Does that mean anything to you?

516
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:48,988
- What?
- Shummaker put a private memo

517
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,574
on the invoice. It can't be
copied and it wouldn't show up...

518
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:55,495
This is Devoe. We have a target vehicle,
it's a cargo truck. Registration...

519
00:56:55,662 --> 00:57:00,124
...7056 Bravo Mike.
Traveling south from Chelyabinsk...

520
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,794
- ...to Imisli in Azerbaijan.
- 44-E...

521
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,671
Now, I'm requesting
a high priority tasker.

522
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:10,968
Any birds, any birds find this truck.
We got nukes heading for Iran.

523
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:14,597
What the hell is 44-E?

524
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,049
Gentlemen...please.

525
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,886
Zarko Preljevik has died.

526
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:59,725
He never regained consciousness after being
shot outside his church.

527
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,395
His death is a tragic loss -

528
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,691
to his family, to his country,
to our hopes for peace.

529
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,572
We know you've avoided politics, Dusan,

530
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,575
but you are the alternate.

531
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,871
Your people need you.

532
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,267
I am a Serb.

533
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,102
I'm a Croat.

534
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,770
I'm a Muslim.

535
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:49,859
You will look at what
I have done and say:

536
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:54,280
"Of course. Why not?
They are all animals.

537
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,700
They have slaughtered
each other for centuries."

538
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:02,288
But the truth is, I am not a monster.

539
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,333
I'm a human man.

540
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,501
I'm just like you...

541
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,129
...whether you like it or not.

542
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:13,758
- Got your problems recruitin'...
- Let's go, hut! Move now, hut!

543
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,261
- Hey, Rich. How you doing?
- Good, good.

544
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,180
We haven't seen you
since the Great Scud Hunt.

545
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,140
- That's right.
- Captain Santiago, sir.

546
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:22,642
Hello, Captain.

547
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,519
This is Lieutenant Beach.

548
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,648
We'll be running the operation
from the ground, sir.

549
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,858
- Gentlemen, tell me you found him.
- Damn close, sir.

550
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,818
Giving him an average speed
of 65 clicks,

551
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,987
if their destination
of Imisli is correct

552
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,656
and if they're taking a direct route,

553
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,824
we've got them somewhere
about here, in Dagestan.

554
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,161
Still in Russia, below Makhachkala
on the Caspian Sea.

555
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,997
We've snuck a peek at everything
within a 200 square mile area.

556
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:50,002
We haven't turned up your truck, but we
think they're stuck here, in Kumuh.

557
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,338
There's a hell of
a traffic jam down there, sir.

558
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:55,800
The trucks are too close together.
We can't get an angle on the plates.

559
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,260
What's going on down there?

560
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,929
Renewed fighting between
Armenia and Azerbaijan.

561
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:03,140
Roads are clogged
with refugees fleeing north.

562
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:08,062
Ken? Ken, get me a copy
of Kodoroff's intel phone records.

563
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,731
- What are you thinking?
- I need an outside line here.

564
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,817
Someone get me an outside line, please.

565
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:37,008
Filthy fucking refugees.

566
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:40,594
Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kazakhstani.

567
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,223
Don't curse them.

568
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:48,561
I don't care what bitch gave
birth to them... Muslim, Serb.

569
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:54,942
I don't hate them for who they are.
I hate them because they are poor.

570
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:06,203
- Hey, Alek. How's the ride down there?
- Who is this?

571
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,706
Doesn't traffic drive you
nuts when you're in a hurry?

572
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:12,293
- Who the fuck is this?!
- It's Tom Devoe. How the hell you been?

573
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:16,422
I gotta know. You still humping that
Finnish stewardess with the bad skin?

574
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:21,510
Tom, are you still trading
stolen cars on the black market?

575
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:28,017
Hey, Alek... you watched
CNN during Desert Storm.

576
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:32,063
Remember all those television shots
from the nose cone of the GBU missiles

577
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,898
slamming into those trucks?

578
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,109
Remember that picture?

579
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:40,279
How it kept getting closer
and bigger on the screen?

580
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:44,325
You just about see the faces
of those drivers and then...

581
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:48,496
...zap, the picture went dead. We didn't
get to see what happened next.

582
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:51,791
Well, guess what, Alek?

583
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,753
You will, you son of a bitch.

584
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,131
Shit. Get out of the way.

585
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,100
- I guess that upset him.
- Can you get an angle?

586
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,936
In a minute. He rear-ends some guy,
that can't detonate that nuke, can it?

587
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:14,271
As long as no one opens
the primary, they're safe.

588
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,481
Come on.

589
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:24,240
Come on, sweetie, come on.

590
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:26,951
It's coming.

591
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:33,874
- 7056 Bravo Mike. That's it.
- How long do we have him on satellite?

592
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,418
One hour, 46 minutes.

593
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,587
Contact Russian command.
Give them the location of the truck.

594
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,257
- Ken?
- Boom.

595
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,396
- Wait, we have to go now.
- We have surveillance for one hour.

596
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,231
It doesn't matter what

597
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,609
- the State Department says.
- Yes, sir, absolutely.

598
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,695
- No, I understand, sir.
- Fine. Thank you.

599
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,989
- Yes. Yes, sir. Will do.
- Thank you, sir.

600
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,407
All right.

601
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,076
- OK, go. You go.
- No, you go first.

602
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,037
I was talking to the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

603
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:55,164
He says State Department's
dragging their feet.

604
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,916
I was just talking to the president.

605
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,168
Says it's a Russian problem.
They have to manage it.

606
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,712
No, we have the advantage now.
We have to take it.

607
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,756
The Russians say they are handling this.

608
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:06,509
The Russians couldn't find snow
in the middle of fucking winter.

609
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:11,555
It's this simple. When that satellite
is out of range, those nukes are gone.

610
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,144
It's onlyjet fuel.

611
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,107
- Get up into NATO airspace.
- Good for you.

612
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,152
- Let's go. Rich, let's giddyup.
- Colonel, Colonel! Wait.

613
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,072
Wait, Colonel! With Russia
insisting they're handling this,

614
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,199
you will not take action
without authorization.

615
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,910
What do you think I am?
Some gung ho, stupid son-of-a-bitch?

616
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,912
No, I don't think you're stupid.

617
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,706
I think you're a talented soldier
with sloppy impulse control.

618
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,209
And I don't want you provoking
an international incident

619
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:44,004
- because of a personal agenda.
- My personal agenda is my business.

620
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:47,967
Now you are not in Washington
anymore. You are in the real world.

621
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,220
And in the real world, there are
nuclear arms heading for Iran.

622
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,974
So whether you agree with me or not,
get me authorized!

623
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:34,763
We must go, Dusan.

624
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:01,332
Cobra Three, this is Tango Six,
what have we got?

625
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,793
Russian command has been notified
of the target vehicle's location.

626
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,504
Proceed to position
and await further instructions.

627
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:11,050
- Ken, does NRO have anything else yet?
- They got us on standby.

628
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,218
Take this down.
How much time are we looking at?

629
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,346
We can track them for
another 45 minutes.

630
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,473
Let's alert IFOR
at the Bazta checkpoint.

631
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,058
They'll have to pass through there.

632
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,616
Put that away.

633
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,177
Step out of the truck please.

634
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,107
I'm sorry, General...

635
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,901
we've been ordered to check all vehicles.

636
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,946
- We're just carrying medical supplies.
Let us through.

637
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:16,699
- I'm sorry sir, but I have orders.

638
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:20,285
- Look at your code book, Sergeant.

639
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,790
Today's authorization code is...
X16...7KTR...8.

640
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,211
Yes... but I still have to search
the truck.

641
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,754
- What is your name and unit?

642
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,966
Name and unit, you hear me?

643
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,640
I'm sorry, General. Go ahead, General.

644
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,767
- Thank you, Sergeant.

645
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,403
Stop.

646
01:07:57,282 --> 01:08:00,117
- I'm sorry, sir. You'll have to get out of the truck.

647
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:02,995
Get out of the truck immediately!

648
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,831
- Of course.

649
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,850
There's been a tragic setback
in the ongoing effort

650
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:28,353
to secure lasting peace
in the former Yugoslavia.

651
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,356
So far, no one has taken
responsibility for the killing

652
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:35,194
of the Bosnian-Serb Finance Minister,
Zarko Preljevik,

653
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,030
who was assassinated
in a Sarajevo church yard.

654
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:41,408
Word of Prelijevik's violent death
has sent shock waves

655
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:43,452
through the international community.

656
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,371
The well-liked moderate
was considered a crucial player

657
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:50,375
in the upcoming peace talks, scheduled
to begin this week in New York.

658
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:55,380
Reporting live from Sarajevo,
this is Jean Rogers for CNN.

659
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,343
44-E...

660
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,765
The 44th parallel runs through...

661
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,479
...Sarajevo.

662
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:15,400
Where's that bank routing number
off the Kordech invoice?

663
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,153
- Dr. Kelly, get over here.
- Check it against banks in Sarajevo.

664
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,072
- Doctor?
- What's going on?

665
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,827
The Russian roadblock... They're all
dead, ma'am. I think they're all dead.

666
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,454
Cobra Three, they got 'em?

667
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,834
Negative, Tango Six. How much
longer do we have them on satellite?

668
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,544
Less than ten minutes.

669
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,921
Alert the Russians
of the truck's current position.

670
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,798
Tell them they have men down out there.

671
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:39,550
Stand by to track...

672
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,139
We've now reached the
Federation airspace, Cobra Three.

673
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,393
We're running out of time.
Suggest we go.

674
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:52,437
Negative, Six. Do not proceed
without authorization.

675
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,940
- The Russians have troops in the area?
- Negative.

676
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,693
Cobra Three, we're gonna lose them
on satellite. We have to go.

677
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,611
Get me a secure phone linked to NMCC.

678
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,865
Negative, Six.
Do not proceed without authorization.

679
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,783
You will not proceed.

680
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,248
When we lose the satellite,
do we have any other eyes in the area?

681
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,918
Sir, we have the target vehicle
approaching the Iranian border.

682
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:19,089
Requesting permission to enter Russian
Federation airspace and take it out.

683
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:22,926
Dr. Kelly, in your estimation, is this
our only remaining course of action?

684
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:25,888
Based on available intel,
the Russians having no forces in place,

685
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,973
our analysis of
the satellite SIGINT and...

686
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:33,312
I'm not asking for analysis.
I'm asking for a decision.

687
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,147
Must advise we go, sir.

688
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:38,108
Dr. Kelly, if there are nuclear
weapons on that truck

689
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,402
and the Russians can't interdict...

690
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:43,864
...are you willing
to risk a war to stop it?

691
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,994
Yes, sir.

692
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,413
Yes, sir, I am.

693
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:55,000
Six, this is Cobra Three. We have a go.
I repeat: We have a go.

694
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,419
Avoid foreign casualties,
secure the target vehicle,

695
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:00,631
- detain anyone found inside.
- Copy, Cobra.

696
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:04,426
Six to Task Force. We're cleared
as briefed. Let's rock and roll!

697
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:08,347
This is Red Dog Pack to Three.
Execute! Execute!

698
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,951
Why aren't they finished back there?

699
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,985
Unidentified aircraft, you have entered
Russian Federation airspace.

700
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,820
Identify yourself immediately.

701
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,488
Commander...

702
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:10,492
Russian control tower,
this is Air Force 53762.

703
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,204
A flight of three US Air Force
helicopters in pursuit of

704
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:18,500
stolen nuclear weapons.
Request a weapons hold status.

705
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,252
Three American Air Force helicopters.

706
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,338
Low altitude, approximately
1 75 kilometers per hour.

707
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,507
Requesting weapons hold status.

708
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,843
Intrusion, section 1 87.

709
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:31,179
Activate tracking and firing sequence.

710
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,432
All batteries...on my command.

711
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:37,602
You must return to Turkish airspace,
US Air Force.

712
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:41,273
Your intrusion is not authorized.
You have crossed International Line.

713
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,276
Battery one tracking.

714
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:47,946
They've locked onto us.

715
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,615
Battery two tracking.

716
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,743
A second battery's locked on to us.

717
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,453
Get Southern command on the line.

718
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,455
Tell them we have unauthorized entry -

719
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:57,706
by three U.S. attack helicopters.

720
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,709
This is Air Force 53762.

721
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:05,005
We are in pursuit of stolen
nuclear weapons on their way to Iran.

722
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:08,842
Repeat, put your weapons on hold.

723
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,802
Batteries tracking and ready to fire.

724
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,391
Reverse course immediately
or we will begin to fire.

725
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:19,269
This is Red Dog Three.
We're lit up like a Christmas tree!

726
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,105
This is Air Force 53762.

727
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:24,816
Those weapons could be going
to Chechnya or Georgia.

728
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,444
We repeat, put your weapons on hold!

729
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:30,906
They haven't answered yet, sir!

730
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:32,741
We'll lose track in 8 seconds!

731
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:45,420
Take them out.

732
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,924
Here they come!

733
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:54,721
Number one is down.

734
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:58,809
Cobra, we have a downed aircraft
two miles east of checkpoint four.

735
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:02,270
- Number Three, acknowledge.
- This is Red Dog Three.

736
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,815
Do you see the aircraft?
Do you see any survivors?

737
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,651
Negative. The whole
fucking forest is up in flames.

738
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:11,154
Number Three, duck behind
the hill! Behind the hill.

739
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,494
How many men on that chopper?

740
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,037
Nine.

741
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:27,712
Cobra Three, we're out of range.
Target is two miles out.

742
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:42,519
Here it is.

743
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:56,074
What's he doing?

744
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,744
Will it work?

745
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,330
It can be activated
by a single man,

746
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,876
and will render a nuclear yield
of one to two kilotons.

747
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,252
Why is he doing that now?

748
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:11,256
Because that was the deal. One warhead
for us, to do with as we wish.

749
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,217
- After I get my money.
- Helicopters!

750
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:24,728
All right! Gentlemen,
whatever you do, do not shoot

751
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:26,813
any civilians. Do you understand?

752
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,133
Take out the road!

753
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:03,034
Rig me a heavy lift line!

754
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:08,331
Those fuckers you can shoot!

755
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:06,222
Let's get him out!
Pull up!

756
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,289
Where are they going, Alek?

757
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:34,417
- Where are they going?
- Fuck you!

758
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:44,761
- Get it down! Let's go! Lower it!
- Heavy line! Let's go!

759
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,641
Grab it and get out!

760
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:52,602
- Drop the cable! Drop it!
- Bring it down!

761
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,646
More! More!

762
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:02,320
Come on! Get on! Hook on!

763
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,921
- More!
- Lower it! We gotta lower it!

764
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,844
Goddamn it!

765
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:44,988
Go!

766
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,317
We're clear, we're clear!

767
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:26,988
All right, open them up!
Let's go! Let's go!

768
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:29,157
- You all right, sir?
- Yeah! Open them up!

769
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,742
Let's go! Open them up! Let's go!

770
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:34,078
Give me the radio.
Cobra Three, are you there?

771
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,372
Six, what happened?

772
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:41,127
One assault aircraft is gone.
Nine men are dead.

773
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,588
Kodoroff is dead.
And we have recovered...

774
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,673
- Something's going on.
- ...eight nuclear warheads...

775
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,091
...in their containers.

776
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,385
- That's not enough warheads.
- What?

777
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:52,096
That's not enough warheads.
That's not enough damn warheads.

778
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,890
For once, you could say something nice.

779
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:57,227
It was an SS-1 8. Ten warheads.
One detonated, eight with you.

780
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,229
That leaves one unaccounted for!

781
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,565
Colonel Devoe!
There's somebody alive down here.

782
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:05,318
Hold on a minute. Take this.

783
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:08,404
- Motherfuck!
- Goddamn it!

784
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,450
We got a live one, Colonel.

785
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:20,583
- Do you speak English?
- Yes. I... I went to Harvard.

786
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,752
Go, Crimson!

787
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,213
- Help me up, please.
- Where's the other warhead?

788
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,799
- Please bring me up.
- Listen to me very carefully.

789
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:31,553
You are gonna die unless
you tell me where the other warhead is.

790
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,639
- I don't know. He took it. He's gone.
- Who?

791
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,268
I don't know his name. He's with
the ones who arranged this.

792
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:41,646
- Kodoroff?
- No, Kodoroffjust handled the money.

793
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,439
It was the other one.

794
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:47,610
He made me dismantle the primary,
make it mobile.

795
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:51,239
- How?
- It's in his backpack.

796
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:52,991
Help me up, please?

797
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,421
I'm going back to the rig!

798
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,756
- Help me up!
- Just hang on. We'll bring you up.

799
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,174
OK!

800
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:19,183
Kelly, a guy got away with a bomb.

801
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:23,396
Copy, Devoe. All right. Come on back.

802
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:32,071
We got it! The bank account
on the Kordech invoice

803
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,617
is registered to an address in Grbavica,
Serbian suburb of Sarajevo.

804
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:40,455
Good. Get this information to IFOR.
Tell them to proceed with caution.

805
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,417
Roger.

806
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,595
Where are you going?

807
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,860
You made it.

808
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,947
- I told you I would.

809
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:58,282
- Is it heavy?

810
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,371
- We must go.

811
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,966
- Check it out!
- Are you all right?

812
01:24:57,134 --> 01:25:00,344
- I've been better. How about you?
- I've been better.

813
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:04,348
We traced the money back
to a man named Vlado Mirich.

814
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:08,102
IFOR found a tape in his apartment.
They're uplinking it to us now.

815
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,688
They say it has some sort
of terrorist message on it.

816
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:14,025
Colonel, the guy you caught
is Dr. Amir Taraki, Pakistani.

817
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:17,445
Ph.D. in astrophysics.
Educated at Harvard.

818
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:20,615
That's right, we educated
half the world's terrorists.

819
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,825
You need to tell me
exactly what he said.

820
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:26,162
He removed the primary from the
warhead and put it in a backpack.

821
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,080
The primary is packed with plutonium.

822
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,708
Detonated, it could
still take out ten city blocks.

823
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,586
- IFOR tape is transmitting right now!
- Kill maybe 1 00,000 people

824
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,963
in a densely populated area
like Sarajevo or Tuzla.

825
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,759
You will look at
what I have done and say:

826
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:44,597
"Of course. Why not?
They are all animals.

827
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:47,600
They have slaughtered
each other for centuries."

828
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:51,062
But the truth is...

829
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:52,855
...I'm not a monster.

830
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:54,816
I'm a human man.

831
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:58,611
I'm just like you,
whether you like it or not.

832
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,907
For years, we have
tried to live together,

833
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:06,619
until a war was waged on us.

834
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,246
On all of us.

835
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:12,834
A war waged by our own leaders.

836
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:17,588
And who supplied
the Serb cluster bombs,

837
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:19,423
the Croatian tanks,

838
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:22,510
the Muslim artillery shells...

839
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,346
...that killed our sons and daughters?

840
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:31,185
It was the governments of the West
who drew the boundaries of our country.

841
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:34,730
Sometimes in ink,
sometimes in blood.

842
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:36,774
The blood of our people.

843
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,902
And now you dispatch
your "peacekeepers"

844
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:43,698
to write our destiny again.

845
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:49,912
We can never accept this peace
that leaves us with nothing but pain.

846
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,834
Pain the "peacemakers"
must be made to feel.

847
01:26:55,502 --> 01:27:00,631
Their wives, their children,
their houses and churches.

848
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:05,177
So now you know.
Now you must understand.

849
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:10,600
Leave us to find our own destiny.

850
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:14,353
May God have mercy on us all.

851
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,857
IFOR can shut down Bosnia.
He's never gonna get to Sarajevo...

852
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:20,693
Wait, wait. He's not going there.

853
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,988
We weren't meant to find this until
after he had detonated the bomb.

854
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,074
Now... "Pain the peacemakers
must be made to feel."

855
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,120
The peacemakers aren't in Bosnia.
They're in Europe and the US.

856
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:34,498
- They're signing a treaty this week?
- Tomorrow at the UN.

857
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:37,501
- What is the address of the UN?
- By the river, east side.

858
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:41,505
44th Street. 44-E...

859
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:45,801
He's going to New York.

860
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,532
What do you got, Ken?

861
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,743
The only way that we can close down
the airport is with

862
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:12,745
the Federal Nuclear Emergency
Response Plan.

863
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:15,790
- It has to come from her.
- All right. I'll give it to her.

864
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:41,565
I wanted to know...

865
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,819
...who they were.

866
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:26,610
All right...

867
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:30,614
Secure line to NMCC.

868
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,577
This is Dr. Julia Kelly.

869
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:39,123
I am issuing a Presidential Directive
for a Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan.

870
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,751
We have a possible
weapon of mass destruction

871
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:46,005
coming into the United States
by unknown terrorist or terrorists.

872
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,319
- Check in the rear.
- Yes, sir!

873
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,656
Commencing diplomatic evacuation,
perimeter is secured.

874
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,742
Repeat, perimeter is secured.

875
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:19,371
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention, please? I'm with the UN.

876
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,999
We've been informed of a serious
threat to the treaty signing.

877
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:25,211
So we have to get you off this plane
to insure your safety.

878
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:27,338
Now, if you would all please
stand up now.

879
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,048
Come on, please stand up. Thank you.

880
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:32,968
We'll have you move to the exits
in the rear and front of the aircraft

881
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:34,303
in an orderly fashion.

882
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,435
We're getting 'em out.

883
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:02,748
- Glad you could make it. Coffee?
- No, thank you, sir.

884
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,625
I popped a couple of
stay-awakes on the plane.

885
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,210
- Dr. Kelly?
- I'm fine.

886
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,212
How many stay-awakes did she take?

887
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,714
This is Mark Carey, Energy.

888
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:14,176
Over here, Special Agent in Charge,
David Branigan, FBI.

889
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,386
Welcome to New York.

890
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:17,721
We're running NYPD and Agency
response out of here,

891
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:19,014
in coordination with DOE.

892
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,433
- Evacuation plans?
- FEMA and National Guard on alert.

893
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,644
- What about NEST?
- Energy has containment teams

894
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:26,438
on alert in Battery Park,
awaiting instructions.

895
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,482
We're running casualty scenarios.

896
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:32,069
Initial blast would throw 60 rads
of prompt radiation out three miles.

897
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:33,904
That's most of
Lower Manhattan and Queens,

898
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:37,575
Two-point-five to three million people.
Fifty percent survival rate.

899
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:39,952
We'll need to monitor
and localize wind patterns and

900
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,246
we need radiation detectors
on the ground and in the air.

901
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:44,665
- Intel report from IFOR.
- Let me see that.

902
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:50,004
All right, Vlado Mirich, Bosnian-Serb,
radical. Been missing for a week.

903
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:52,339
Father fought with Tito.
No wife or children.

904
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:55,050
Has a half-brother,
a classical pianist in Sarajevo.

905
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:56,635
Served as a cultural liaison.

906
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,929
Mirich's been arrested
three times for smuggling

907
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,806
- and black marketeering.
- It's gotta be him.

908
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,933
- No, no, something doesn't fit.
- What?

909
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:05,895
The man in the tape he's no
black marketeer. And not a nationalist.

910
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:10,107
Remember what he said? He said,
"I'm a Serb, a Croat and a Muslim."

911
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,276
He is holding everybody responsible.

912
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:15,196
I checking all incoming
passenger manifests.

913
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:19,283
I have a V. Mirich on Swissair
flight 1204, from Zurich to Kennedy.

914
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:21,452
- Arriving when?
- Touched down seven minutes ago.

915
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,495
Call JFK. Get to security.
Send them a picture.

916
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:25,623
- We're up to Kennedy airport.
- Got it!

917
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,833
Excuse me. Excuse me!

918
01:32:29,336 --> 01:32:32,755
All right, cover all the exits. Nobody
gets out of here. Nobody gets out!

919
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:36,300
- Devoe? Who's Devoe?
- Swissair flight 1204, non-residents.

920
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:37,885
Twenty. Station 20. This way.

921
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:45,601
He's not here. He's not here.

922
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:49,188
We got a possible identification
at desk seven. Far corner.

923
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:54,318
Excuse me.

924
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:00,783
Vlado Mirich?

925
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,207
Yes?

926
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,630
Who the hell is this?

927
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:20,135
Unloading the charter bus is cancelled.

928
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:26,308
...is a requirement in designated areas.
A shuttle will be provided.

929
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:31,480
All right.

930
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:34,650
Passport's fake. Claims he bought it
on the street in Sarajevo.

931
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:38,195
We've been able to detained eight men
who tried to enter today using passports

932
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,072
issued by countries
of the former Yugoslavia.

933
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,700
- None matches your description.
- Eight? That's it?

934
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:44,827
- Where the hell is he?
- Even with the treaty signing?

935
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:47,162
- That doesn't include the delegations.
- The what?

936
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:49,206
- They don't go through customs.
- Give me that!

937
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:50,624
- Oh, shit.
- Must've been

938
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,126
a couple hundred of them.

939
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,756
- ...Julius Caesar.
- What is Brutus?

940
01:33:57,924 --> 01:33:59,383
- Right.
- Half-brothers, $800.

941
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:01,677
Answer. The other Daily Double.

942
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:04,596
I need one now...

943
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:31,957
No, ma'am, let me explain.

944
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,752
We are talking about a possible
terrorist situation.

945
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:36,920
We need to detain the entire delegation.

946
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:40,090
These are diplomats, here as guests
of the US State Department. I can't...

947
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:42,217
Then I need their names
and room numbers.

948
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:45,888
- We're looking for a Vlado Mirich.
- What floor they're on, too.

949
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:48,932
This man isn't named Vlado Mirich.
This is Dusan Gavrich.

950
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,101
He's an alternate for
the Bosnian-Serb delegation.

951
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,270
Their minister was
assassinated last week.

952
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:55,356
Mr. Gavrich is attending in his place.

953
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:57,816
The brother.

954
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:06,677
Go, go!

955
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:21,150
Diplomatic papers.
They never even searched it.

956
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:23,861
Still warm.

957
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:39,751
Move.

958
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:37,392
Nina!

959
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:46,610
Dana!

960
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:20,978
Help me!

961
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:23,438
Help my child!

962
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:26,149
Please help me!

963
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:05,188
East 44th Street.

964
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:10,319
- DOE, you have anything yet?
- Choppers are up.

965
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:13,530
Couple of plus-2 spikes,
but nothing approaching target levels.

966
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:15,699
The backpack's gonna
be leaking radiation,

967
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:18,368
so they should be able to locate him
within a three to four block area.

968
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:21,038
Set up road blocks here.
Gonna close off Second Avenue

969
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:24,374
and funnel him down 43rd to the UN.
Deploy snipers between

970
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:26,877
- First and Second and take him out.
- Command Center.

971
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:28,378
- General, we're closing down...
- Ken?

972
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:30,339
...the east side of Second Avenue

973
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:34,885
from 55th to 42nd and the north side
of 42nd from Sixth to the river.

974
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:37,721
We're gonna be positioned at the UN.

975
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:43,101
Instruct all field agents, all snipers,
subject cannot be aware of the hunt.

976
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,240
Move it.

977
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:03,955
Something big at UN today.

978
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:06,249
Traffic bad all morning.

979
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:15,425
Chopper, Hunter One, anything?

980
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:16,927
That's a negative.

981
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:20,597
HQ, Kelly, we're gonna work our way
south down into the funnel.

982
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:23,600
Suggest stopping anyone
with a backpack north of 55th.

983
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:25,936
- How soon will you get to the UN?
- What are you talking about,

984
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:28,563
"It's a State issue?"
This is a national emergency.

985
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,112
Get over here! Spread 'em!

986
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,907
Put your hands on your head!
Don't move!

987
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:44,538
Who are the fascists now?

988
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:49,960
Come on!

989
01:40:50,128 --> 01:40:51,461
All right!

990
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:53,588
Let's go!

991
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:12,190
Go, go, go!

992
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:15,652
Come on! Let's move it.

993
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,655
- Go!
- Yeah, come on, move.

994
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:21,658
Move!

995
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:33,545
Get out of here. Let's go.

996
01:41:37,258 --> 01:41:39,509
- What the hell is this?
- We have instructions to secure...

997
01:41:39,677 --> 01:41:42,345
It looks like Desert
fucking Storm out there!

998
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:44,848
- If he sees us, we're all dead.
- Get them out!

999
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:46,057
- Colonel!
- Yeah?

1000
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:47,350
...but clear it!

1001
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:48,894
Where's the containment trucks?

1002
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:50,937
- It's gridlock out there!
- Where are they?

1003
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:53,648
Colonel, we picked up
a diffused radiation source

1004
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:56,443
somewhere between Third and Second,
and 54th and 46th.

1005
01:41:56,611 --> 01:41:59,196
- Can you be more precise DOE?
- Not at this altitude.

1006
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:01,823
All right, I'm on my way.
Listen, you keep an open channel!

1007
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:04,409
When we locate him,
you move out with the NEST team.

1008
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:32,562
HRT Command, put me in
direct with your closest shooter.

1009
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,898
- Hunter One, copy.
- Leader, this is One.

1010
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:39,486
- Expect he's coming your way, One.
- Roger that. Do we have a green light?

1011
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:40,862
Affirmative.

1012
01:42:56,254 --> 01:42:59,214
- Can't get through here.
- Around the barriers, folks.

1013
01:42:59,382 --> 01:43:01,299
Good, that's good.

1014
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:03,426
- Do not walk that way.
- OK.

1015
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:05,637
- Turn around.
- Thank you!

1016
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:08,431
- Move to the left, please.
- Roundabout.

1017
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:12,936
I think he's somewhere between First
and Second, probably below 46th.

1018
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:17,983
- All positions, do you see target?
- No, sir. Not me.

1019
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:20,277
Come on.

1020
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:22,779
Come to Papa.

1021
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:34,124
This is Four. Target acquired.
300 meters.

1022
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,961
- Not clean. Too many friendlies.
- Four, this is Leader. Take the shot.

1023
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:40,380
There's a child, a family.

1024
01:43:41,299 --> 01:43:43,133
Acknowledged. Take the shot.

1025
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:47,929
Shoot him. Come on.

1026
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:52,309
Four, this is Leader.
I repeat, take the shot!

1027
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:54,644
Take the shot!

1028
01:43:55,771 --> 01:43:57,439
Shoot him! Take the shot!

1029
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:03,945
- Oh, God.
- Goddamn it, somebody shoot him!

1030
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:12,078
This is One. I have target acquired!
400 yards, inbound.

1031
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:15,165
No shot. Should open at 43rd.

1032
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:21,338
FBI!

1033
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,677
I need to get the hell through here.

1034
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:29,846
You and the rest of New York, pal.
Take it easy.

1035
01:44:30,014 --> 01:44:31,640
Just get out of here.

1036
01:44:32,767 --> 01:44:36,478
Dispatch, this is 1 501 .
I need backup on 43rd Street

1037
01:44:36,646 --> 01:44:37,979
as soon as you can get it.

1038
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:42,359
Leader, this is Hunter One,
waiting for target to clear.

1039
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:46,696
You with the backpack...
get your hands up.

1040
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:48,782
Get your hands up.

1041
01:44:49,951 --> 01:44:52,827
I am a diplomat with the United Nations.

1042
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:57,040
I must be allowed to pass.

1043
01:44:58,376 --> 01:45:00,377
Leader, I may have lost him.
He stopped.

1044
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:02,545
- What?
- He may have stopped. I'm not sure.

1045
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:05,340
- He went behind some trees.
- He's gotta be there!

1046
01:45:05,508 --> 01:45:06,967
Reacquire!
Move if you have to.

1047
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:08,385
What do you got in the backpack?

1048
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:11,054
- Cuffs.
- You got it.

1049
01:45:14,392 --> 01:45:16,559
- Did you engage?
- Negative, sir.

1050
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:19,396
Someone's shooting,
corner of 43rd and Second.

1051
01:45:20,523 --> 01:45:21,898
Is he down?

1052
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:29,072
- Is he down? Is he down?
- Negative. Negative!

1053
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,533
They're southbound,
toward 42nd.

1054
01:45:31,701 --> 01:45:33,493
Stay in contact
with the containment trucks

1055
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:35,328
and have them ready
to move on my command.

1056
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:37,580
- Come here.
- Where are you from?

1057
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:40,542
- Philadelphia.
- Give me the keys.

1058
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:55,890
- Hey!
- Out of the way!

1059
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:58,643
- DOE, you have him?
- He's eastbound on 42nd.

1060
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:03,898
- Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

1061
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:14,409
Go!

1062
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:18,997
Come on!

1063
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:21,666
Move it.

1064
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:16,846
- East of Second, off 41st!
- He's in there! He went down there!

1065
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,807
- There!
- You stay behind me!

1066
01:47:31,362 --> 01:47:33,363
Drop your weapon and
show me your fuckin' hands!

1067
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:37,158
We got him. Alley off 41st.

1068
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:55,885
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1069
01:48:22,204 --> 01:48:25,832
The signal just quit. You're right
there. He's gotta be indoors!

1070
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,626
Vlado.

1071
01:48:45,269 --> 01:48:47,103
Move! Move! Move! Move!

1072
01:48:58,115 --> 01:49:00,491
- Anybody have him?
- Negative. Nothing to the south end.

1073
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:02,660
- Same to the north.
- DOE, what do you got?

1074
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:04,621
Still picking up
a diffused energy source,

1075
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:08,458
somewhere in the area.
We're circling back now.

1076
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,254
He knows he'll never make it to the UN.

1077
01:49:13,422 --> 01:49:15,131
He doesn't have to.
He's got a nuclear weapon.

1078
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:17,675
All he has to do is sit behind
a dumpster and take out

1079
01:49:17,843 --> 01:49:19,802
- half of Manhattan, including the UN.
- He doesn't want

1080
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,764
to die behind a dumpster.
He wants his death to mean something.

1081
01:49:22,932 --> 01:49:24,307
Keep circling.

1082
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:27,101
Wait, guys, fan out.
We've established a new perimeter.

1083
01:49:27,269 --> 01:49:30,647
Gotta be within 200 yards. I shot him.
Look for blood, door to door.

1084
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:33,900
No sign, Colonel. He probably
ducked into a building.

1085
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:35,151
Keep looking.

1086
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:38,529
We'll continue
circling a six block area.

1087
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:44,077
Devoe!

1088
01:49:45,955 --> 01:49:47,163
Listen.

1089
01:50:22,992 --> 01:50:24,659
Go, go!

1090
01:50:25,995 --> 01:50:27,870
Hurry along. Come on.

1091
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:31,207
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1092
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:34,002
Father, take these children out
of here, now! Move it!

1093
01:50:47,558 --> 01:50:49,684
Come on. Come on.
Give me your hand.

1094
01:50:49,852 --> 01:50:51,477
Give me your hand. Let's go.

1095
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:54,856
Go. Go, go, go, go.

1096
01:51:09,913 --> 01:51:13,583
You cannot stop this. Never.

1097
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:16,836
OK.

1098
01:51:18,756 --> 01:51:20,506
OK, just...

1099
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:23,551
...just stay still. Stay there.

1100
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:28,181
Stay still. It's OK.

1101
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:35,772
You don't want to die like this.

1102
01:51:37,441 --> 01:51:39,150
Tell me about the bomb.

1103
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:44,947
Is it on a trigger?
Is it on a timer?

1104
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:48,409
Is it activated?
Come on. Talk to me.

1105
01:51:48,577 --> 01:51:50,620
We can decide on a way out of this.

1106
01:51:51,288 --> 01:51:52,413
No.

1107
01:51:55,626 --> 01:51:58,628
Who decided for my wife?

1108
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:01,923
My child, murdered.

1109
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:07,970
For what?

1110
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:13,476
For breathing?

1111
01:52:14,645 --> 01:52:16,062
For smiling?

1112
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,733
And now, I am left.

1113
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:29,283
Who decides for me?

1114
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:33,246
Mr. Gavrich, what is it you want?

1115
01:52:41,422 --> 01:52:43,172
I want it to be...

1116
01:52:44,341 --> 01:52:45,800
...like it was.

1117
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:51,180
Sir, it's not our war.

1118
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:57,520
It is now.

1119
01:52:58,147 --> 01:52:59,188
No!

1120
01:53:03,026 --> 01:53:04,527
Son of a bitch.

1121
01:53:04,695 --> 01:53:07,071
Where the hell is NEST?
Get NEST in here!

1122
01:53:08,699 --> 01:53:09,740
It's on a timer.

1123
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:12,243
All right, listen,
the bomb's on a timer, all right?

1124
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:14,370
Ken, Ken.

1125
01:53:14,538 --> 01:53:16,539
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know. I'm on it.

1126
01:53:16,707 --> 01:53:19,292
- Ken, tell me NEST is here.
- Affirmative. We've cleared 43rd.

1127
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:21,544
They'll be there in four minutes.

1128
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:26,340
They're not gonna make it.

1129
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:30,553
- They're not gonna make it.
- OK. You're gonna have to do this.

1130
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:33,055
Do you understand? Take a look.
Tell me what you see.

1131
01:53:33,223 --> 01:53:35,933
Take a look at this
and tell me what you see.

1132
01:53:37,895 --> 01:53:41,814
An SS-1 8 primary with a plutonium core.
A bomb inside a bomb.

1133
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:46,235
It has a capacitor relay detonator.
Double pull, double throw.

1134
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:48,905
The only way of knowing
is to open it up.

1135
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,574
What?

1136
01:53:53,535 --> 01:53:55,912
Let's move it into the chapel.
Get it off him!

1137
01:53:56,079 --> 01:53:57,747
- Get it off him! What?
- Hang on!

1138
01:53:57,915 --> 01:54:01,209
We got a trip wire. We gotta move
the man with the bomb, all at once!

1139
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:04,587
- Here we go. Ready? Go!
- Let's go! Let's go! Careful!

1140
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:07,590
Gate!

1141
01:54:09,176 --> 01:54:12,595
- Why in here?
- It'll help contain the radiation.

1142
01:54:12,763 --> 01:54:15,139
All right. You need to
get out of the church. Please.

1143
01:54:15,307 --> 01:54:18,392
Try to evacuate as many people
from this area as you can.

1144
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:21,854
OK, I need something for the screws.

1145
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:23,272
- Here.
- Anything! Quick!

1146
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:24,690
- Go! Go!
- All right.

1147
01:54:35,452 --> 01:54:39,956
- Devoe, get out of here.
- OK, I'll be in the truck.

1148
01:54:46,421 --> 01:54:47,713
Shit.

1149
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:06,857
The plutonium core
is surrounded by explosive panels.

1150
01:55:08,277 --> 01:55:10,528
Give me the knife.
I need the knife back.

1151
01:55:10,696 --> 01:55:12,822
If we can separate one of the panels...

1152
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:17,743
...we may be able to blow up
the outer bomb without...

1153
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:21,455
...the core going to nuclear yield.

1154
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:24,625
You gonna blow this up?
You'll blow up the bomb?

1155
01:55:24,793 --> 01:55:28,421
You know what you're doing, right?
You've done something like this before?

1156
01:55:28,589 --> 01:55:32,133
Defuse stolen nuclear primaries
jury-rigged by Pakistanis?

1157
01:55:33,010 --> 01:55:34,135
No.

1158
01:55:48,317 --> 01:55:49,692
Damn!

1159
01:55:54,698 --> 01:55:57,116
I need your gun. Give me the gun!
I need the gun!

1160
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,367
Go!

1161
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:03,164
Easy, easy, easy!

1162
01:56:03,665 --> 01:56:05,166
All right...

1163
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:06,876
Fourteen. Thirteen.

1164
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:08,711
- I know. Oh, God.
- Twelve.

1165
01:56:08,879 --> 01:56:11,839
Eleven. Let's go!
Ten. Nine.

1166
01:56:12,007 --> 01:56:15,176
Eight. Come on! Seven!
Come on! Six! Five!

1167
01:56:15,344 --> 01:56:17,887
Go, go, go, go, go!

1168
01:56:29,733 --> 01:56:31,484
Julia, Julia...

1169
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:33,402
Come here. Are you OK?

1170
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:36,947
Hey, are you OK? Hey!
Come here. Come here!

1171
01:56:38,867 --> 01:56:39,909
Come here...

1172
01:56:42,204 --> 01:56:44,789
- You OK?
- I think so.

1173
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:49,251
All right.

1174
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:54,423
You're OK.

1175
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:01,180
Yeah, all right.

1176
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:04,266
- Hey, listen, you're OK. All right?
- No.

1177
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:07,395
- You're OK!
- Need you to go with these men.

1178
01:57:07,562 --> 01:57:09,814
Julia. All right, go, go, go!

1179
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:12,108
Go.

1180
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:14,235
- Julia!
- I'm bleeding.

1181
01:57:14,403 --> 01:57:15,986
Hey, Julia!

1182
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:21,283
Julia!

1183
01:58:16,173 --> 01:58:18,382
So...
They give you any new medals?

1184
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:19,842
Yes, they did.

1185
01:58:20,761 --> 01:58:23,471
- Well, you worked very hard for them.
- Thank you.

1186
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:30,978
So we've got kind of a tradition
over at military ops.

1187
01:58:31,146 --> 01:58:35,024
Whenever combatants come back
from the field in one piece,

1188
01:58:35,192 --> 01:58:38,319
we buy each other a beer.

1189
01:58:39,863 --> 01:58:42,198
- You made that up.
- Yes, I did.

1190
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:52,708
Well... I got ten more to go.

1191
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,214
I'll wait.

1191
01:58:59,305 --> 01:59:59,355
