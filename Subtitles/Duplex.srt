00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,378
<i>So, you're</i>
<i>finally settling down.</i>

3
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,546
<i>You've saved up</i>
<i>a little nest egg</i>

4
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,251
<i>and are ready to dive into</i>
<i>the real estate market.</i>

5
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,726
<i>Let's do a little</i>
<i>shopping around.</i>

6
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,194
<i>The American dream home.</i>

7
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,855
<i>Two bedrooms, two bathrooms,</i>

8
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,492
<i>one doghouse, one garage,</i>
<i>two garbage cans.</i>

9
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,069
<i>It's cozy, safe,</i>

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,264
<i>and just barely within</i>
<i>your overstretched budget.</i>

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,704
<i>Not for you?</i>

12
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,108
<i>For the same price,</i>
<i>you can buy 200, 000 acres</i>

13
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,442
<i>of prime Sahara wasteland.</i>

14
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,745
<i>Put up a cottage.</i>
<i>Nothing but you and the sky.</i>

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,944
<i>It's like a beach</i>
<i>without the ocean.</i>

16
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,385
<i>And talk about quiet neighbors.</i>

17
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,686
<i>Too remote?</i>
<i>Oh, I understand.</i>

18
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,693
<i>You need the thrill</i>
<i>and excitement of the big city.</i>

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,285
<i>With that same nest egg,</i>

20
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,093
<i>you can get a slice</i>
<i>of prime real estate.</i>

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,929
<i>Not this real estate.</i>

22
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,661
<i>Cozy and affordable,</i>

23
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,704
<i>this lovely fixer-upper</i>
<i>is the perfect place</i>

24
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,036
<i>for a dynamic couple like you.</i>

25
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,167
<i>No need to putter around</i>
<i>the house.</i>

26
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,144
<i>It's all right there</i>
<i>where you stand.</i>

27
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,513
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>Feeling a little cramped?</i>

28
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,986
<i>Well, just a stone's</i>
<i>throw away,</i>

29
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,649
<i>just one bridge</i>
<i>or a tunnel ride,</i>

30
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,818
<i>just outside the big,</i>
<i>bustling city,</i>

31
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,159
<i>there is a place</i>
<i>with wide-open spaces,</i>

32
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,632
<i>friendly natives,</i>
<i>and spacious dwellings.</i>

33
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:45,170
<i>And it's all within</i>
<i>your price range.</i>

34
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,537
<i>It's almost</i>
<i>too good to be true.</i>

35
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,741
When I told you

36
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,445
I had a particular building
in mind for you,

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,511
this is the one
I was talking about.

38
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,717
It's a historical home
on one of the best blocks

39
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,384
in all of Brooklyn.

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,258
- Remember what we talked about.
- I know. Poker face.

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,888
Built-ins, built-ins.

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,331
Oh, the kitchen's
a little small.

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,595
Well, rip out this
awful room divider,

44
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,137
and you've got
an eat-in kitchen.

45
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,969
And over here
you have your library.

46
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,666
Wow.

47
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,833
For your books.

48
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,103
Oh, you like books?

49
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,705
I have a little collection
of first-edition novels.

50
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,079
Alex is a writer.

51
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,243
The parlor.

52
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,258
Oh, my God.

53
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,469
So, this staircase.
This leads to where?

54
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,510
I thought you realized.
This is a duplex.

55
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,307
As in two floors
for the price of one?

56
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,543
I believe it's right there
in the listing sheet.

57
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,083
So, why was it sealed off?

58
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,552
Were there, like, a slew of
murders up there or something?

59
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,079
No, there's just a sweet, little
old lady that lives upstairs.

60
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,989
A tenant?

61
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,754
Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,625
So, rent control means
we can't kick her out, right?

63
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,925
Alex!

64
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,558
That's a legitimate question.
You cannot evict her.

65
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,102
She has to decide to leave
or, God forbid...

66
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,195
Poor thing hasn't been
feeling well lately.

67
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,140
She's gotta be close
to 100 years old.

68
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,678
Mrs. Connelly?

69
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,111
It may take her a while.
She's hard of hearing.

70
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,581
Mrs. Connelly?

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,792
Kenneth.

72
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,262
There's my favorite girl.

73
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,698
How you feeling today,
Mrs. Connelly?

74
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,031
I don't feel too good, Kenneth.

75
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,128
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
Mrs. Connelly.

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,176
I brought by a young couple that
may want to buy the apartment.

77
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,643
- Hi.
- Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

78
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,146
I'm Nancy Kendricks.

79
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,580
This is my husband, Alex Rose.

80
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,446
Hello.

81
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,917
We were wondering
if we could look around.

82
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,615
I don't feel up to it.

83
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,919
I'm sorry, dear.

84
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,755
Nice seeing you again, Kenneth.

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,076
You have a Mommy-and-Me
park over here.

86
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,906
You got shopping that way.

87
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,139
No traffic.
It is ideal.

88
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,910
Here's my card
if you want to make an offer.

89
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,541
There's a lot of heat
on this place.

90
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,416
I'd say it'll be
off the market by Monday.

91
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,115
Adios.

92
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,887
Three fireplaces?

93
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,626
Guys, the place sounds
incredible.

94
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,691
And surprisingly affordable.

95
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,827
It's kind of affordable.

96
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,461
It's really at the high end
of our price range.

97
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,040
But when you factor in
that it's a duplex.

98
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,507
It's a duplex?

99
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,372
Yes.

100
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,376
Oh.

101
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,504
You know, it's Brooklyn,
first of all.

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,276
We weren't even thinking
about Brooklyn, so...

103
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,183
Oh, actually, which reminds me.
Did you bring it?

104
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,049
Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,749
Is this the latest in
the Don Piper mystery series?

106
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,088
Fresh off the presses.

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,060
I inscribed this copy
to you guys.

108
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,686
- Oh!
- Coop, thank you.

109
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,890
I am sure it's not
gonna be as brilliant

110
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:37,026
as your new book, but a couple
decent metaphors in there.

111
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,364
Turn of phrase.

112
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,939
We forgot to tell them
the big news.

113
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,769
Oh, God.
Yes.

114
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,774
What is it?

115
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,277
Go ahead.

116
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,870
We're pregnant.

117
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,149
Wow!

118
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,945
Congratulations.

119
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,212
Congratulations, man.

120
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,378
I'm so happy for you!

121
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,651
You guys must have
just found out.

122
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,751
No. Unh-unh.
I'm four months along. Yeah.

123
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,523
- Four months?
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,291
- Oop!
- Oh, honey.

125
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,525
Stop.

126
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,328
Hello!

127
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,269
I mean, we're not
gonna want to live here

128
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,273
once we start having babies.

129
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,310
And that upstairs would make
the cutest playroom.

130
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,745
Well, I don't want Mrs. Connelly
coughing on my baby.

131
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,304
You know what I mean.

132
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,443
Besides, do you realize how much
the duplex is gonna be worth

133
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,282
once we get both floors?

134
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,480
I know how much it costs.

135
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,750
It's gonna be worth
a bazillion times that.

136
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,987
Really? A bazillion?
That's an incredible return.

137
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,394
Come on, Alex, what better way
to finish your novel

138
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,956
than in your own 19th-century
oak writer's nook?

139
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,036
It would be nice
not to write at Starbucks

140
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,661
with the other novelists.

141
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,036
Because you deserve
your own nook.

142
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,469
That's my train.

143
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,341
All right.
Let's do it.

144
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,005
Really?

145
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,346
- Yeah.
- Aah!

146
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,716
Oh, this is so wonderful.
We're gonna have a home.

147
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,345
Yeah. All right.
I love you.

148
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,411
I love you!

149
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,010
I could have sworn
we had more stuff.

150
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,774
It's gonna look great.

151
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,745
Mrs. Connelly, it's
Nancy Kendricks and Alex Rose,

152
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,981
from downstairs.

153
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,023
Let me look at you.

154
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,122
Oh!

155
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,595
Hi.

156
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,861
We just wanted to come up
and say hi.

157
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,368
Oh, what a nice surprise.

158
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,233
Come in.
Come in.

159
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,965
Thank you.

160
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,906
Wow.

161
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,171
What an amazing apartment!

162
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,305
Oh, thank you, dear.
Sit down.

163
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,645
We brought you this
little housewarming gift.

164
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,651
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

165
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,085
I'll open it for you.
I don't drink, myself.

166
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,713
It's a sin.

167
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,816
Irish Catholics don't drink?

168
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,332
What are you doing?

169
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:29,431
Oh, I'm just taking a few
little pictures for research.

170
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,537
If I knew you
were coming, I'd have tidied up.

171
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,719
Hey, Nancy.

172
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,775
Yeah?

173
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,186
Blow me down!

174
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,056
- Oh!
- What did you say?

175
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,560
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Oh, God!

176
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,929
I'm coming, slowly but surely.

177
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,799
- I'll just turn off this music.
- Alex! Alex!

178
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,940
Sit down, dears.
Sit down.

179
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:09,170
I've brought you a little
something to nibble on as well.

180
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,274
Oh, Bugles.
Wow.

181
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,013
I didn't realize
they even still made Bugles.

182
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,689
Here you go.

183
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,653
That's a magnificent parrot.

184
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,427
It's not a parrot, dear.
He's a macaw.

185
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,460
He's named after
my late husband, Richard.

186
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,600
I've had Little Dick
for 40 years.

187
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,279
Come along, dear.
Don't be shy.

188
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,541
It's French onion.

189
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,445
Oh.

190
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,694
Mrs. Connelly,
how are you feeling?

191
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,195
Why do you ask, dear?

192
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,394
Well, because the last time
we saw you, you were quite ill.

193
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:07,531
Oh, I had a bit of a cold,
but I'm in fine fettle now.

194
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,733
Tell me about yourselves.

195
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,504
What do you do, Alan?

196
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,237
Alex.

197
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,303
Alex is a writer.

198
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,679
Oh, a writer.
Hmm.

199
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,050
I always thought of that as
more of a hobby than a real job.

200
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,386
I suppose I'm forgetting
about Joyce.

201
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,289
Joyce. James Joyce.
Of course.

202
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,349
Wonderful writer.

203
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,225
He died drunk and penniless.

204
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:37,394
Well, Alex's first novel
was published in hardback,

205
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,596
and he's about
to finish his second one.

206
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,673
Oh, what's it about?

207
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,767
Well, I like to call it
an urban epic.

208
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,778
It's about three generations
of this family

209
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,475
that own a printing press,
and I tell a story.

210
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:55,486
That's nice.
Let me give you a refill.

211
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:59,115
Big Dick had the taste, too.

212
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,421
He was a seaman.

213
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,727
The drink took him
from me in 1963.

214
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,997
We'd been married for 58 years.

215
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,637
'63.

216
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,676
So, when are you two
planning on having children?

217
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,766
Soon.

218
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,869
Yeah, not for a couple of years.

219
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,177
You sound just like
Mr. Connelly.

220
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,014
We never had any children.

221
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,077
It's too late for me now.

222
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,817
Oh, look at the time.

223
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,952
I had no idea it was so late.

224
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:36,824
Oh.

225
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,796
The time's rolled on.

226
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,560
We haven't had a chance
to see the apartment.

227
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,932
Oh, dear, I'm afraid
there's no time now.

228
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,162
Really?

229
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,000
We must say good night.

230
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,506
Oh, okay.

231
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,378
Oh.

232
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,379
Uh-oh.

233
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,084
Oh, no. That was your...
I think it's your couch.

234
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,245
- I think the chair...
- Alex.

235
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,255
That was a little...

236
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,655
Come along, dears.
Come along.

237
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,386
How could you?

238
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,387
"A macaw. Any long-tailed,
brightly colored parrot."

239
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,956
A macaw is a parrot.
I knew it.

240
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,594
Don't you think that
as landlords,

241
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,170
we have some legal right

242
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,900
to see the back of her apartment
if we want to?

243
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,237
I mean, I'll look it up
on the Internet.

244
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,334
That's what I'll do.

245
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,638
I wonder how old she is.

246
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:35,120
Oh, my guess is that she's
somewhere between 95 and 105.

247
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,253
- She looked pretty good tonight.
- Yeah, she did.

248
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,595
She looked kind of healthy.

249
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,961
Yeah.

250
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,192
That's nice.

251
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,666
Yeah.

252
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,173
Hi.

253
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,280
Hello, Mr. Peabody.

254
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,884
I saw myself in the mirror,

255
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,718
and I thought it was
my mother's tush.

256
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,996
Mrs. Connelly?

257
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,432
Mrs. Connelly?

258
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,028
Oh, yes?

259
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,470
Who is it?

260
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,803
Hi, it's Alex.

261
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,571
I was wondering if you
could turn down your TV,

262
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,840
'cause we can hear it.

263
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,816
Oh, I fell asleep.
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,909
- That's okay.
- I'll do that.

265
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,783
Okay.
Thank you.

266
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,195
No, Starvin' Marvin,
that's my potpie.

267
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,389
Cartman, you butt-pipe.

268
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,364
This is the time of year
to share.

269
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,764
Oh, yeah, you're right.

270
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,666
Are you going to eat
your peach cobbler?

271
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,467
No, you don't want all that.
Why don't you share it with me?

272
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,269
Everybody's
asking me about fiber.

273
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,707
In the next few minutes,

274
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,575
you're going to learn about
an amazing...

275
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,211
If I want a slimmer waist.

276
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,981
Use it on carpets. OxiClean
seeks out organic stains.

277
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,250
There's no more bald jokes.

278
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,269
I gotta go. Have a good day.
See you later.

279
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,539
And finish that chapter!

280
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,910
I will.

281
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,255
- Good morning, Alex.
- Good morning, Mrs. Connelly.

282
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,960
I wanted to give you this back.

283
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,730
I won't drink it,
and I thought you might want it.

284
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,898
Oh, thank you.
That's nice of you.

285
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,239
All right, if there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

286
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,849
There is one thing.

287
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,221
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I don't hear anything.

288
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,351
It was very distinctive.

289
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,864
The pipes went
bang-bang-bangity-bang-bang.

290
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,696
Bang! Bang!

291
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,762
Well, they're not
doing that anymore,

292
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,362
or it stopped,
so, I'll tell you what, though.

293
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,533
If you hear it again,
come get me. I'll take a listen.

294
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,611
Oh, all right then.
It's a deal.

295
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,943
Ooh, Alan, dear boy, I wonder...

296
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,948
- Alex.
- Pardon?

297
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,540
Alex.
My name's Alex.

298
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,051
I know.

299
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,916
No, I think you said "Alan."

300
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,218
Oh, no, I don't think so.

301
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,088
I don't forget names.

302
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,594
Could you give me a hand
with the garbage?

303
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,324
We don't want to be
feeding the mice.

304
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,719
What in heaven's name
are you doing with me drawers?

305
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,090
Now, I would move
the pull quote just a teeny bit

306
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,857
so that you'll have room
to squeeze in the text.

307
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,899
You're such
a good squeezer, Nancy.

308
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,627
That's because, until yesterday,

309
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,397
I lived in an apartment
the size of a small child.

310
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,268
But look at the new place.

311
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,637
Oh, my God!

312
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,198
- Isn't it gorgeous?
- Yes.

313
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,245
There's, like,
this living room/parlor area.

314
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,781
Nancy, did you finish
the "Celebrity Scene" page?

315
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,214
Oh, tickety-boo.

316
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,648
I don't know what that means.

317
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,844
It means you'll have it soon.

318
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,910
Well, if you mean
I'll have it soon,

319
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,047
why don't you say
I'll have it soon?

320
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,958
"Tickety-boo"
is just confusing for everybody.

321
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,693
Oh, Mr. Peabody.
How did that get in there?

322
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,324
Ohh.

323
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,907
Alex?

324
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,805
Alex?

325
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,438
Hey.

326
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,278
Hi!

327
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,046
Hi.
How was work?

328
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,179
Oh, Herman's freaking out,
as usual.

329
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,316
Were you napping?

330
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,487
No, I was just rearranging
my book collection.

331
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,530
In the dark?

332
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,656
And then I closed my eyes
for a second.

333
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,395
Just to think, and, you know.
Is this dinner?

334
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,232
Mm-hmm.
So, how was your nook?

335
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,398
Did you get, like, five
or six million pages written?

336
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,999
More like five or six words.

337
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,376
Our upstairs neighbor had me
doing chores for her all day.

338
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,312
Really?

339
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,906
Yeah.

340
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,213
Well, you just gotta set
some boundaries.

341
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,221
Just tell her you're working.
She'll understand.

342
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,415
What is that?

343
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,357
Oh, I picked up a few things
on the way home.

344
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,916
It's an area rug.

345
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,791
- Do you love it?
- Yes. How much was it?

346
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,831
It doesn't seem
to cover much of an area.

347
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,128
It was $200
or something like that.

348
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,600
I don't really remember.

349
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,601
That was 200 bucks?

350
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,103
Yeah, but, you know,
it's a runner,

351
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,833
'cause it goes in between
the two rooms

352
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,499
and then ties them together.

353
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,136
Ooh, and look!
Look, look, look, look, look!

354
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,080
It's an original Pablo Flinch.

355
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,912
Really? Cool.

356
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:44,012
Is it, like, a Mayan
guacamole bowl or something?

357
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,785
It's a stool.

358
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,554
Here.

359
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,094
Try it.

360
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,698
What are we, hobbits?

361
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,341
It's a water stain!

362
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,278
I told Mr. Rose the problem
with the pipes this morning.

363
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,942
They were going
bang-bang-bangity-bang-bang.

364
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,884
Bang. Bang.

365
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,215
Yeah, the whole bathroom

366
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,017
could have explode.

367
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,115
471 bucks.

368
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,990
What time?

369
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,156
- You were here three hours?
- Yeah.

370
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,359
Sweetie, these were
original tiles.

371
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,901
How could you not hear banging?

372
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,402
Sweetie, I was asleep!

373
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,133
Napping, and in the middle
of the afternoon.

374
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,037
Shameful.

375
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,104
I'm not gonna pay
for unauthorized repairs.

376
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,669
I did the work, my friend.

377
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,647
I can rip the pipes
out of the wall.

378
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,345
What?

379
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,118
I don't know what you're saying.

380
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,383
Do it! Do it!

381
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,321
You do it.
You do it.

382
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,417
- Alex!
- What?

383
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,223
Okay, forget it.
Plug it up.

384
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,630
I begged Mr. Rose
to do something.

385
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,601
I was terrified, Nancy.

386
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,796
Okay, well, the next
time that happens,

387
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,805
Mrs. Connelly,
just call me, okay?

388
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,341
I gave you my business card.

389
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:15,641
Alan, before I forget,
it's the first of the month.

390
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,080
Right.

391
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,209
$88.

392
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,953
Do you want to count it?

393
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:28,019
Remember, if she bothers you,
just lay down the law.

394
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,187
Be firm, but nice.
Two positives, then a negative.

395
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,026
- What is that?
- Psychology.

396
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,464
Don't wait up for me.
I got to work late.

397
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,934
- I love you.
- I love you.

398
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,188
Good morning, Alex.

399
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,955
Good morning, Mrs. Connelly.

400
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,225
I wondered if I could ask you
a quick question.

401
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,131
Right.
You know what?

402
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,069
Can I just say this to you?

403
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,232
You know I'm working
on a book, right?

404
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,639
And this book is due
in about three weeks.

405
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,578
And my editor is expecting it
on her desk at that time, okay?

406
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,639
- It's a contractual deadline.
- I see.

407
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,344
So I have to be working
on that book all the time

408
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,979
here in my apartment,
which is also my office.

409
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,181
It's just like my office.

410
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,520
If I was a lawyer,
and I went off to an office,

411
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,891
you couldn't knock on my door,
'cause you wouldn't be there.

412
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,363
So let's just pretend
that I'm a lawyer, okay?

413
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,490
This is my office,

414
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:46,868
and unless it's a really, really
super-important emergency, okay,

415
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,408
between the hours
of 9:00 and 6:00, I'm not here.

416
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,069
I'm off,
away in my office, okay?

417
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,842
And then after 6:00,
I'm here, okay?

418
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,678
I completely understand.

419
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,980
And I apologize
for bothering you.

420
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,749
Not at all. Okay,
have a good day, all right?

421
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,255
It's just...

422
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,792
What? What is it just?
What is it?

423
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,659
I bought a copy
of your book yesterday,

424
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,897
and I wondered if you'd sign it.

425
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,133
Of course, if you're too busy,

426
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:27,678
I can come back
out of business hours.

427
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,873
Oh. No.
That... no.

428
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,349
Oh, that's so nice.
You didn't have to buy a copy.

429
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,479
- I have a million copies.
- It's money well spent.

430
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,617
Just write something that I
can treasure for years to come.

431
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,718
Okay.

432
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:54,528
How about, "To my favorite
upstairs neighbor"?

433
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,766
Signed "Alex Rose."

434
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,343
Here you go.
And I hope you like it.

435
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,537
Oh, I know I will.

436
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,274
Okay. All right.
Good day.

437
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,213
Alex?

438
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,144
Yeah?

439
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,510
I know we've just had
this discussion,

440
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,956
but I was wondering
if the firm of Rose & Rose

441
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,960
could accompany an old lady
to the pharmacy.

442
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,326
It's pissing down out there.

443
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,993
And I need to renew
my monthlies.

444
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,730
It won't take any time at all.

445
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:34,040
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36...

446
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,012
How much is the Nicorette?

447
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,106
$43.97.

448
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,479
I lost me place.

449
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:48,322
One, two, three...

450
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:53,387
8, 9, 10...

451
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:58,698
1, 2, 3...

452
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:06,506
22, 23, 24...

453
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:12,448
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30.

454
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,576
Okay, good?

455
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:20,723
Oh, blueberries.

456
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,893
1, 2, 3...

457
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,954
I thought you
were gonna talk to her.

458
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,192
I did, honey.
I did.

459
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,360
I was very clear with her.
She's just...

460
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,837
She manipulated me somehow.

461
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,807
She manipulated you?

462
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,709
She's very crafty.

463
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:45,239
She's a crafty old lady.

464
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,678
Well, I'll tell you what.

465
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,187
Tomorrow's gonna be better,
because you know why?

466
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,020
It's gonna be Saturday,
and that's our day off,

467
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,026
and we're gonna get to sleep in.

468
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,994
- Okay?
- Yeah.

469
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,260
I promise everything
will be better tomorrow, okay?

470
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,102

Good morning.

474
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,261
Good morning, Nancy.

475
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,132
This is Nancy Kendricks.

476
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,674
Hello, dear.

477
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,802
Are those musical instruments?

478
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,675
Yes!

479
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,079
We are a brass ensemble.

480
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,949
We've got a concert
at St. Augustus on Friday.

481
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,823
Let's go out shopping.

482
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,396
I'll deliver it this afternoon?

483
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,561
Yes, that's great.

484
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,104
Hey, honey, look.

485
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,605
Oh!
Oh, what'd you get?

486
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,232
Remington Royal.
50 bucks.

487
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,900
How much were
they asking for it?

488
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,807
50 bucks.

489
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,449
Look, I got a peacock.

490
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,449
Oh.

491
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,008
- Isn't it great?
- Cool.

492
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,417
What does it do?

493
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,478
It's there to be decorative
and pretty

494
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,490
and aesthetically pleasing.

495
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,458
So what do we need a daybed for?

496
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,791
Oh, for all your napping.

497
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,228
Honey, I took one nap
for two minutes.

498
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,890
I didn't even shut my eyes.

499
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,298
Hey, what's in the bag?

500
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,359
Answer to our prayers.

501
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,463
Try it next to that one,
'cause then the couch will go...

502
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,771
Whoo#hoo#hoo#hoo#hoo.

503
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,812
Wow.

504
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,113
You know what I just realized
that we forgot to do?

505
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,281
We forgot to christen
the apartment.

506
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,325
That's what I was thinking.

507
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,896
<i># Agua de beber #</i>

508
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,232
<i># Agua de beber camar #</i>

509
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:24,104
<i># Agua de beber #</i>

510
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,643
I love our home.

511
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,049
Aah!

512
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,749
- What was she doing?
- Oh, my God.

513
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,120
I don't know. You think
she saw the whole thing?

514
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,215
Ew!

515
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,527
Hey, where are you going?

516
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,227
Oh, now's my chance.
I got to get up there.

517
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,360
Wait.
What are you gonna do?

518
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,062
The answer to our problems.

519
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,799
- Clap Me.
- What does it do?

520
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,898
When she falls asleep,
we can control her TV.

521
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,033
You be the lookout.

522
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,772
If you hear her coming,
knock on the pipe, okay?

523
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,904
Like, make a noise.

524
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,005
Okay. Okay. Okay.

525
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:06,714
Shut up.

526
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,343
Shut up.

527
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,241
Hello.

528
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:36,110
Well, hello, Little Dickey.
I'm back again, aren't I?

529
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,376
Guess what I've got in the bag.

530
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,216
I got hot dogs.
Hot dogs for Dickey boy.

531
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,278
I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

532
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,518
I'm going to give it
a wee chew meself first.

533
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,389
Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

534
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,230
Mm. It's so nice, Dickey.
It is.

535
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,790
It's so good.

536
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,597
Mm.

537
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,802
I tell you what.

538
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,636
Shall we have a bit of music?

539
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,040
A bit of music
and a bit of a dance.

540
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,740
I'll put on your favorite,
the tune you like the most.

541
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:13,079
The one that was
Big Dick's favorite, too.

542
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,420
There's a-boy.

Mrs. Connelly?

00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,762
Nancy?

561
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,097

Mrs. Connelly?

00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,171
Mrs. Connelly?

565
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,710
Oh, Nancy.

566
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,144
What a nice surprise.
I'll make you some tea.

567
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,115
It's nice to see you here.

568
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,174
We'll have some tea.

569
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,742
Oh!

570
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,481
And biscuits.

571
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,523
Ow! Ooh!

572
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,216
Honey?

573
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,526
Oh!

574
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,464
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

575
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,468
What happened to you? You were
supposed to be the lookout.

576
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:14,538
I know.
I know.

577
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,380
All right, here we go.

578
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,348
- Ready?
- Yeah.

579
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,550
You're a genius!

580
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,365
That is so weird.

581
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,912
How would she know that? How
would she know how to use it?

582
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,178
You didn't leave the box
up there or anything, did you?

583
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,569
Nancy Kendricks.

584
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,439
Nancy, Mrs. Connelly.
I have a favor to ask.

585
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,637
Emergency!

586
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:35,974
Hurry!

587
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,139
Run!

588
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,649
Mrs. Connelly,
you know, honestly,

589
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,116
we're going to print today,

590
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,176
and everything's
just crazy around here.

591
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,687
Can't you ask Alex?

592
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:45,984
I knocked and knocked.

593
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,992
He must be in
a deep, deep sleep today.

594
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,187
We didn't get it
until this morning.

595
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,059
Nancy! Nancy!

596
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,224
We have 27 minutes
to get this to press.

597
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,459
Get off the phone!

598
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,332
Okay, thank you, Mrs. Connelly.

599
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,405
Where is my new hot list?
Where is it?

600
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:02,564
I'm almost done.

601
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,971
- 5 seconds!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

602
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,806
- Okay. Okay.
- Hurry!

603
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,602
This is it?

604
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,611
Yes.

605
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,648
- Did you check it?
- Yes.

606
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,208
I don't want it tickety-boo.
I want it tickety-now!

607
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,185
It's good. It's cute.
I like it.

608
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,123
Is it, like,
800, 900 square feet?

609
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,354
No, it's, like, 1,800.

610
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,920
But it might seem cozy
'cause of the fireplaces.

611
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,659
There are 3 fireplaces.

612
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,963
So, here it is.
The third fireplace.

613
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,004
Wow.
This apartment is amazing.

614
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,803
I'm so glad that you like it.
Whew. Relief.

615
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,240
Wonderful collection.

616
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,641
- Mmm, thank you.
- Yeah.

617
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,372
Just make sure you save space

618
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,677
for the Alex Rose
first editions.

619
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,716
Ah, yes.

620
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,444
So.

621
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,712
So, yeah.

622
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,515
How's the ending turning out?

623
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,852
The ending is gonna be great.

624
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,087
I'm kind of circling it
'cause I don't want to force it.

625
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,187
Just make sure you
turn it in by Wednesday.

626
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,930
Management's being very strict
with all our mid-level authors.

627
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,264
I'm only mid-level?

628
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,997
Right now.

629
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,439
Of course, you won't be after
you hand in your masterpiece.

630
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,943
We're replacing most
of the furniture we have,

631
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,206
but we're going
for a Miller/Eames look.

632
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,611
You love Eames, Terrence.

633
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,876
I just got a new piece.

634
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,786
Did you bring that guy with
the girl in the leopard thing?

635
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,347
Oh, that's Chick.

636
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,952
That's the guy who's advising me
on the Don Piper mysteries.

637
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,087
What, is he a detective
or something?

638
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,722
No.

639
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,892
He's a hired gun.

640
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,493
He kills people for a living.

641
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,300
You brought a hit man
into the party?

642
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,737
Relax.
He's very discreet.

643
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,335
He's got a perfectly legitimate
day job as a cover.

644
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,641
And what do you do, Chick?

645
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,944
I'm a pornographer.

646
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,746
Here, let me give you a card,
you know, just in case.

647
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,790
She's this funny old Irish lady
named Mrs. Connelly,

648
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,985
and she's actually in a brass
ensemble at the church tonight.

649
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,221
There's all sorts
of incredible details.

650
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,560
I mean, I can't wait
for you guys to see it.

651
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:11,466
It's beautiful.
Ooh, Herman, get in here.

652
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,776
Herman?

653
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,779
Being a landlord
doesn't give you the right

654
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,689
to enter your tenant's premises
anytime you feel like it.

655
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,819
I just wanted my friends
to have a look-see.

656
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,363
You were supposed to be
at the church performing.

657
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,127
Heavens no.
It's next Friday.

658
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,965
We've got a big week
of practice ahead of us.

659
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,901
You terrified the poor woman.

660
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,473
Mrs. Connelly, you can press
charges if you want.

661
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,133
No, I don't want to do that.

662
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,337
They're such a nice couple.
Good night, now.

663
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,506
Good night, Mrs. Connelly.

664
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,880
I'm gonna be watching
the two of you very closely.

665
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,418
- Hey, Alex, right?
- Hey, Chick.

666
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,121
How you doing?
Brought you a housewarming gift.

667
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,527
Oh, that's so sweet.

668
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,999
Well, look,
this is very tasteful stuff.

669
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,262
You know, for couples.

670
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,634
That is so thoughtful.
Thank you.

671
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,230
My card's inside "Ass Patrol,"
in case you need more.

672
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,309
Take it easy.

673
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,241
- Thanks for the party.
- Okay.

674
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,905
I got an award for this one.

675
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,286
She was supposed to be
at church.

676
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,591
You can't fire me
because you got maced.

677
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,358
Believe me.

678
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,332
I wish that's why
I was firing you.

679
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:55,338
Did you happen to see
the restaurant hot list?

680
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,505
Oh, my God.

681
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,316
So...

682
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,722
How's Mr. Peabody doing?

683
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,664
Alex?

684
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,200
Oh.
Oh, no, no, no.

685
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,997
There's no napping right now.

686
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,595
You have to finish your book.
We need money. I got fired.

687
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,572
Yeah, I know.
I saw it.

688
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,941
Oh, you saw it.

689
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,106
Yeah. It's horrible.
My parents read this magazine.

690
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,583
Now they know my penis
is called Mr. Peabody.

691
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,279
It wasn't my fault.

692
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,914
She was calling me
when you were napping.

693
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,221
I wasn't napping,
for the 1,000th time!

694
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,784
Okay, maybe I took a nap
at one point.

695
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,887
When did napping
become against the law?

696
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,798
Honey, I can't work here. It's
impossible. I've been trying.

697
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,132
I've written three pages
in the last six weeks.

698
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,637
Three pages.
The book is due on Wednesday.

699
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,699
If we don't hand in the book, I
don't know what we're gonna do.

700
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,404
We can't pay for anything.
The runners, the stools.

701
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,743
We can't pay for the
tangelo bowl you like.

702
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:15,582
We can't pay for your
little happy mug-vase thing.

703
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,814
Well, what if you
got out of the house

704
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,187
and went to write at, like,
a Starbucks or something?

705
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,886
And what? You're gonna stay here
and try to find work

706
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:27,260
while she has you running around
doing things for her?

707
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:31,324
Doing all the little errands,
the chores she asks you to do?

708
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,403
I don't think you could take it.

709
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,564
I mean, I love you,
but, honestly,

710
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,507
I've been there, and I don't
think you could take it.

711
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,411
I can take it.
I'll be fine.

712
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,095
Nancy?

713
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,836
- Hello, Mrs. Connelly.
- Nancy, dear.

714
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:11,102
I couldn't help noticing that
Alex left the house this morning

715
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,665
while you stayed home.

716
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,337
I was downsized from my job.

717
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,779
Aw, I'm sorry.

718
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,679
But I'm sure it's for the best.

719
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,686
Let Mr. Rose get out there
and bring home the bacon.

720
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,381
I always thought it was strange.

721
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:29,688
A husband staying home while
you were out there providing.

722
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,920
Well, he's a writer.

723
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,656
Writer.

724
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,496
The man naps more
than a newborn pup.

725
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,127
What's he writing about?
Sheep?

726
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,204
Is there something,
Mrs. Connelly?

727
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:44,570
Oh, I guess you could say
there was something.

728
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:48,237
I've got something on display
in me kitchen.

729
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,081
That is not a mouse dropping.

730
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,878
It's a raisin.

731
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,250
That is the leavings
of a mouse.

732
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,482
It's a raisin.

733
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:07,091
I sprayed it with Lysol.

734
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,960
Ohh.

735
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:15,334
And she puts on this sweet face,
and she acts all innocent.

736
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:19,099
Nancy, could you help me?

737
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,046
I think I found
the leavings of a mouse.

738
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,343
As if she didn't know
it was a raisin.

739
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,646
I know.

740
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,523
I've never designed
religious leaflets, per se.

741
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,363
1:00. Great, Rabbi.
Thank you so much.

742
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,366
Nancy?

743
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,300
Okay.

744
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,599
Nancy?

745
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,904
Nancy?
Are you down there?

746
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,845
What is it, Mrs. Connelly?

747
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,747
Little Dickey's caught
in the dumbwaiter shaft.

748
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,217
Well, how did he get there?

749
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,275
Aaah!

750
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,424
Oh, don't hurt him.

751
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,359
Oh, ooh, Dickey boy.

752
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,523
Oh, careful.

753
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,931
Aah!

754
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,696
Shame on you.

755
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,432
Scaring a helpless,
little macaw like that.

756
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,339
Scaring a helpless,
little macaw like that.

757
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,011
This is not going well.

758
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,071
I told you she's a mean,
crafty old lady.

759
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,344
At this rate, I'm never gonna
finish the book in time.

760
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,010
Damn rent control.

761
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,350
I wish we could just
kick her out.

762
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,754
What if we tried
being nice to her?

763
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,486
Maybe we could get her a gift.

764
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,789
- A gift?
- Yeah.

765
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:48,161
And ask her if
she wouldn't mind leaving.

766
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,824
- We ask her?
- Yeah.

767
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,128
Just ask her?

768
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:54,728
Maybe it'll take
a little begging, but nicely.

769
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,671
Well, she might go for begging.

770
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:11,113
There's a chart that shows
what's inside of each chocolate.

771
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,985
That's all right, dear.

772
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,992
Mrs. Connelly,
let me come right to the point.

773
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,858
Alex and I are trying
to have a baby.

774
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,453
I saw.

775
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,260
In the living room.

776
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,267
Right.

777
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,633
The thing is,
when we do have our baby,

778
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,932
we're gonna need the upstairs.

779
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,473
I don't understand, dear.

780
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,875
We're willing to pay you
something.

781
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,503
You want me to leave?

782
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,810
Don't you think
you'd be more comfortable

783
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:43,342
with people who are more
in your demographic?

784
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,356
In sunny Miami Beach.

785
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:53,323
I'm Irish.
I'd sizzle up like a sausage.

786
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:57,629
Besides, this is my home.

787
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,497
Home.

788
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:04,406
The Emerald Isle, hmm?

789
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,444
Back to the old sod.

790
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:11,978
Well, now, there's a thought.

791
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:16,486
I haven't been back home
for 50 years.

792
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,386
Ooh.

793
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,789
A caramel.

794
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,027
So, about Ireland.

795
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,606
And you moving there.

796
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,268
Most likely
they have television now?

797
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,039
Oh.

798
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,079
Of course they do.

799
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,772
Yeah, color.

800
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,354
I've made up me mind.

801
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,888
I'll do...

802
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,562
Mrs. Connelly!

803
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,139
- She's choking!
- Oh, God!

804
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,674
- Mrs. Connelly.
- Do something!

805
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,936
Oh, God!
Ooh, Alex! Alex!

806
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,605
Come on!
Come on!

807
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,147
- Yeah, good.
- Come on!

808
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,876
Come on!

809
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,948
Whew!

810
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,081
Oh, my God!

811
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,749
Oh!

812
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:31,586
Clear!

813
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,464
Alex, what are you doing?

814
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,464
CPR!

815
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,525
Wait! Stop it!
Stop it!

816
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:44,633
Oh, God.
One, two, three, four, five.

817
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,937
Okay, give her mouth-to-mouth.

818
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,342
- Oh, no. Really?
- Yes. Yes, do it!

819
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,675
Okay.

820
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:55,345
No, you got to blow
in her mouth. Come on.

821
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,681
One breath, come on.

822
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,746
One, two, three, four, five.

823
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,051
Okay, again.

824
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,385
Okay, one breath.
That's it.

825
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,692
One, two, three, four, five.

826
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,993
Again!

827
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,772
Oh.

828
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,347
What are you doing?

829
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,742
You were choking on a chocolate.

830
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,118
You choked on a chocolate.

831
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,784
Oh.

832
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:42,131
Oh. Oh.

833
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,792
Go on, Mrs. Connelly.

834
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:49,362
The last thing I remember,
I ate one of their chocolates.

835
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:53,910
And when I woke up,
he was having his way.

836
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,002
And she was holding me down.

837
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,910
No, I was trying
to save her life.

838
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:02,884
He stole me drawers once
for sniffing.

839
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,977
That's ridiculous.

840
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,488
She was choking on the
chocolate, so I did--

841
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,923
Shut up!

842
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,120
We keep a list of people like
you down here at the station.

843
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,630
The sexual predator list.

844
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,689
Sexual predator?

845
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,726
And to think
they want to have children.

846
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,873
We should've just let her choke.

847
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,066
Oh, I know.

848
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,612
What can I get you?

849
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,955
Listen, I got 12 hours
to finish this book.

850
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,290
I was wondering if I could
sit here and write all day.

851
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,489
- Be my guest.
- Thanks.

852
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,841
Nancy.

853
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,244
I was going to ring you.

854
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:08,580
I'm afraid there's a bit
of a problem up here.

855
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,746
I have to go on a job interview,
so I'll take care of it later.

856
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:15,622
Oh, that's okay.
I'll ring the rug man.

857
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,064
Good.
Knock it in.

858
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,726
Knock it in good.

859
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,772
I don't want to slip
and break me neck.

860
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,671
No, we wouldn't want that.

861
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,506
This is the problem area here.

862
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,274
It's loose as a Dublin whore.

863
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,180
Oh, go on, knock it in.

864
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,984
Yes!

865
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,924
Now, just knock it in.

866
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,960
Go on, knock.

867
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,428
Come on, use some elbow grease.

868
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,795
Aah!
Okay, I will.

869
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,597
You threw her down the stairs?

870
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,202
No.

871
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,372
But I imagined it.

872
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,212
And I liked it.

873
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,376
I'm evil.

874
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,546
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

875
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,681
Thank you.

876
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,282
Come on, she's practically
ruined our lives.

877
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,385
It's natural to have thoughts
like that.

878
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,397
- Really?
- Yeah.

879
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,366
I mean, I've even had a couple.

880
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,730
Aaaah!

881
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,939
Like what?

882
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,272
Just, you know,
snapping her neck

883
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,904
or electrocuting her.

884
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,077
You know,
just beating her to death,

885
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,276
decapitating her,

886
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,877
drowning her, just,
you know, bludgeoning her,

887
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,412
in a humane way, but...

888
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:58,222
Dicing her up
into little, little pieces.

889
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:02,459
But asphyxiating her first
so she didn't feel anything.

890
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,523
I'm glad you clarified that.

891
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:07,195
You're evil, too.

892
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,398
I'm finished.
That's what I am.

893
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,099
And it was incredible.

894
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,177
The last 60 pages
just poured out of me.

895
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:17,338
Let's open that really great
champagne and celebrate.

896
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,506
Alex?!

897
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,176
Alex?!
Nancy?!

898
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,116
Ooh!
Come quick.

899
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,851
A huge rat just ran
under me cupboard.

900
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,859
Oh, come.
Come on, quick.

901
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:31,859
Quick, Alex!

902
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,260
- I'll pop the cork.
- I'll be right back.

903
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,856
Are you sure it was a rat,
Mrs. Connelly?

904
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,628
I saw its face.

905
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,794
You saw its face?

906
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:45,932
All right, let's see if we can't
find this big, bad rat.

907
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,341
You sure it might not
have been a dust bunny?

908
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,539
'Cause sometimes
they look rodent-like.

909
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,912
Aah!
The rat!

910
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,644
- Where?
- There!

911
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,447
Oh.
Oh, that's not a rat.

912
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,988
That's like
a little field mouse.

913
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,455
Alan!
Your purse fell into the fire.

914
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:05,460
Oh, no.

915
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,520
Alan!

916
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,455
Oh, don't!
Oh, don't!

917
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,092
My book!

918
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,102
Ow!

919
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,502
Oh, Alan!

920
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,938
Oh!
Oh!

921
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,268
You'll burn yourself!

922
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,437
Door!
Nancy, door!

923
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,879
Get the door!
Nancy, door!

924
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,143
Is that your book?

925
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,650
Okay.
Oh!

926
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,118
- Door!
- Okay! Oh, my God!

927
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,421
Oh!

928
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,991
No!
No!

929
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,032
- No! No! No!
- Alex!

930
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,035
Stop!
No, stop!

931
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,070
Aah!
No!

932
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,171
No!

933
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:10,554
I swear she did that on purpose.

934
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,838
And now
here's tonight's Health Watch.

935
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,346
A deadly
virus has hit New York City.

936
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,644
Doctors warn that this
particular strain

937
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,015
is extremely dangerous
in children under 5

938
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,179
and especially to the elderly.

939
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,950
Symptoms include high fever,

940
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,513
Symptoms include high fever,

941
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,616
accompanied by nausea
and violent diarrhea.

942
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,692
Mr. Rose?

943
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,528
Would you sprinkle some salt
on the steps?

944
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,033
They're terribly icy.

945
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,603
You better not go outside then.

946
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,370
Ow!
Ow!

947
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,175
Mother--

948
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,416
A giant tow truck
runs it over,

949
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,921
followed by an S.U.V.
That it was dragging.

950
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,615
Alex, that's horrible.

951
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,682
I know.
I know.

952
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,625
Can you believe it?

953
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,095
No, I can't.

954
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:22,722
I tried to warn you, Alex.

955
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:26,929
We're canceling every contract
that's in breach.

956
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,837
In breach?
I have the crushed PowerBook.

957
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm sorry, darling.

958
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,906
If you put as much energy
into your work

959
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,343
as you do into excuses,

960
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,176
you might have made
the deadline.

961
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,341
- Do you have the shark?
- Yes, we do.

962
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,909
Excellent.
I'm gonna have that, no bones.

963
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,313
Hi.

964
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,840
How do you feel?

965
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,970
Like I'm knocking
on death's door.

966
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,813
Well, look who's here.

967
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,450
Come in, both of you.

968
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,160
Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

969
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,628
Happy Thanksgiving.

970
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,629
Oh, thank you.

971
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:05,134
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm grand.

972
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,600
But how are the two of you?

973
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,695
You look rather sallow.

974
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,831
No, no.
We're fine.

975
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,568
We brought you some popcorn.

976
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,339
Oh.
Oh, how lovely.

977
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:20,645
I adore popcorn.
So does Little Dick.

978
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:24,118
So, did you have a nice
Thanksgiving dinner?

979
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,087
Oh, yes, dear.

980
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,614
That lovely Italian lady
in the post office

981
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,354
brought me a sumptuous dinner.

982
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,623
The only problem is
some of the carcass

983
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:37,224
didn't go down the disposal.

984
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,997
That's 'cause you don't have
a disposal.

985
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,696
I don't?

986
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,820
It's really stuffed up.

987
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,038
All right!

988
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,047
If you ask me, you two have got
some sort of bug.

989
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:34,814
Thank God Officer Dan took me
to have a flu shot last week.

990
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,951
Upchuck is a delicacy
for Little Dick.

991
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:38,891
He's salivating.

992
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,555
He's salivating.

993
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,023
How much can we get, Kenneth?

994
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,092
That depends on how far you're
willing to drop the price.

995
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,139
First of all, you way overpaid.

996
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,639
And then you got that tenant.

997
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,643
You said
she was a sweet old lady.

998
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:57,202
Oh, I can't imagine those words
coming out of my mouth.

999
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,078
So you're saying that we're
stuck in this hellhole?

1000
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,779
Yeah. Unless you're willing
to take a huge, huge loss.

1001
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:05,047
How huge?

1002
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,385
Huge, huge.

1003
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,221
We're just totally
screwed, right?

1004
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,421
Yeah. I would say
screwed is apt.

1005
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:16,590
Do you think that Jean would
ever give you a second chance?

1006
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,793
No.
No, it's over.

1007
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,893
Besides, how could I have time
to rewrite my novel

1008
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,938
and still do my faithful
servant duty to her

1009
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:26,169
as her little
indentured servant person,

1010
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,005
her little butt boy?

1011
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,544
I mean, I got a lot of duties.

1012
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,046
'Cause she might need me
to count grapes with her

1013
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,983
or help her fix her heater
or go take her to the laundry.

1014
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,145
Or I gotta go help her
clean her banana skins

1015
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:41,281
and I gotta go help her
clean out her garbage

1016
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,949
or go and wipe her ass!

1017
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,586
God forbid she should have
any shit hanging off her ass!

1018
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,459
- Alex.
- No. Really.

1019
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,361
'Cause then I gotta run
like a little bunny

1020
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:52,560
and I have to go up there and
I gotta go wipe her little ass.

1021
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,500
And then I have to go, "Oh,
good for you, Mrs. Connelly,

1022
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,572
for having such a nice,
little poopy.

1023
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,867
You got some poopy
on your diapie?

1024
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,670
Ooh, let me go and clean it off
with my tongue!"

1025
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:01,869
Excuse me, sir.

1026
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,207
I mean, enough is enough!

1027
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,645
Excuse me.

1028
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,411
Off we go, Dickey boy.

1029
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:12,146
Okay.

1030
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:14,588
Okay, come on.
We don't have that much time.

1031
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,919
I know.
She's running errands.

1032
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,688
That only gives us 12 hours.

1033
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:24,561
You, there.
Me, there.

1034
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,748
A little salt in her sugar bowl.

1035
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,047
Hey, come check this out!

1036
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,678
Roger.

1037
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:48,753
Alex?

1038
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,850
Tripped on the rug.
I'm all right.

1039
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,256
You sure you know
what you're doing?

1040
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,457
I rewired the lamp
in your office.

1041
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,195
Cool. 'Cause if the shock
doesn't get her,

1042
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,202
a little bit
of gas poisoning should.

1043
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,829
Out goes pilot one.

1044
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,505
Out goes pilot two.

1045
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,339
An hour at 375 ought to do it.

1046
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:15,180
Did you remember to blow out
the pilot for the oven?

1047
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,218
Oh.

1048
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,776
Honey.

1049
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,838
Alex.

1050
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,846
The stain is dripping on us.

1051
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,882
I know.

1052
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,612
Isn't it soothing?

1053
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,374
- Alex.
- Hi.

1054
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,308
We got a water stain downstairs,
so I got to look at the pipes.

1055
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,403
What has happened to your face?

1056
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,244
Oh, I just fell asleep in one
of those tanning machines.

1057
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:23,149
You look like a roast mutton.

1058
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,248
How are you doing, mutton head?

1059
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:27,914
I'm almost done.

1060
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,720
Ah!

1061
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,139
On the average,

1062
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,479
she gets up to change
the channel 19 times a night

1063
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,713
walking this 48-inch footpath.

1064
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,687
By the time she gets
to the back end

1065
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,553
of that "Hawaii Five-O"
marathon,

1066
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,148
the acid should have eaten
through the floorboards.

1067
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,319
And we'll finally be happy.

1068
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,090
It wasn't our fault,
Officer Dan.

1069
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,222
You should find the plumber.

1070
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,595
- Right?
- Right.

1071
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:21,269
You know, we might want to get
a hotel room just in case.

1072
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,745
Sweetie, now that we have a hole
in the ceiling,

1073
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,808
I thought maybe it could be
a new place

1074
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,285
for the staircase to go.

1075
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,379
Yeah.
Looks good.

1076
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,416
Where are you going?

1077
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:39,290
A little insurance.

1078
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:44,033
Alex, no!
Not Mr. Peacock.

1079
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,867
Honey, Mr. Peacock's gonna have
to take one for the team, okay?

1080
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,987
That's it.

1081
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,117
She's watching "Riverdance."

1082
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,458
I didn't know people still
watched "Riverdance."

1083
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,537
You know, this is actually
harder than it looks.

1084
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:42,280
Holy Mary and Joseph!

1085
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,657
I could have fallen
right through.

1086
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,326
The floorboards here,
they're rotten to the core.

1087
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:55,393
Awhile back she hired this
Russian guy to fix the pipes.

1088
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,029
And I don't know
if you noticed,

1089
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,439
but there's all this
water damage that he left.

1090
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:04,105
With all due respect
to Mr. "D", Alex,

1091
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,809
you were up here yourself
fiddling with me pipes

1092
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,182
a few days ago.

1093
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,187
Fiddling with her pipes, huh?

1094
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,519
Now, that's another fine
right there.

1095
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,784
For what?

1096
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:18,725
You can't plumb without
a license in New York City.

1097
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,127
Plumb?
I can't plumb?

1098
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:24,325
Are you sassing me, Mr. Rose?

1099
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,027
He's not sassing you.

1100
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,966
Yeah, no, I'm not sassing you.

1101
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,537
I'm not.

1102
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:30,731
I didn't think so.

1103
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,671
'Cause I know
a city building inspector

1104
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,939
that eats chickenshit slumlords
like you for lunch.

1105
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,207
You got it?

1106
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,078
I get it.
You know, slumlord--

1107
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:44,609
And you're gonna buy
Miss Connelly a brand-new TV.

1108
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:48,623
In fact, Miss Connelly,
I'm gonna pick it out myself.

1109
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:52,787
Oh! Could you get one of
those clappy things?

1110
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:53,954
It makes my viewing
so much easier.

1111
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,521
It makes my viewing
so much easier.

1112
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,363
Smoke.
Smoke, smoke.

1113
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:07,738
Mesca.
Loot, loot.

1114
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,603
Gun?

1115
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,907
What?

1116
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,675
Gun.

1117
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:17,684
Gun?

1118
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:18,981
Gun?

1119
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:27,296
So this is what it's come to?

1120
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,431
I guess so.

1121
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,077
I don't think
I've ever held a gun be--

1122
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,588
I think I've got everything
I need here.

1123
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,248
We've got an unlicensed
gun charge,

1124
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,087
and then pending
an investigation--

1125
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,786
It was an accident.

1126
01:04:58,861 --> 01:04:59,759
It's my experience

1127
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,059
that wives don't accidently
shoot their husbands

1128
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,928
in the penis.

1129
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,367
And as much as this particular
man might deserve it,

1130
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:12,464
spousal abuse is a very serious
crime in this state.

1131
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,641
You two have a good night now.

1132
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,142
He thinks you're abusing me.

1133
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,017
Well, you did shoot me.

1134
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,188
You're very lucky.

1135
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,954
Your hand deflected the bullet

1136
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,928
away from the tissue
of the actual organ

1137
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:36,089
and just nicked the scrotum.

1138
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:41,364
What about the,
you know, the berries?

1139
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:46,702
Oh.

1140
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,711
<i># Wake up, wake up,</i>
<i>wake up, wake up #</i>

1141
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,805
<i># Oh, baby, now,</i>
<i>let's get down tonight #</i>

1142
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,611
You feel that?

1143
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,184
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

1144
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,279
- That's good.

1145
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,916
Okay. I'm gonna run
a few more tests,

1146
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,859
but I think you should be
out of here by tomorrow.

1147
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,195
Poor Mr. Peabody.

1148
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:12,757
He took one for the team.

1149
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,564
I just think that we're going
about this murder thing

1150
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:16,638
all wrong.

1151
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,707
You think?!

1152
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,365
Maybe we should just
keep it simple.

1153
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,672
Maybe we should just
keep it simple.

1154
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:28,877
This is so not simple.

1155
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:30,179
Yeah, but you know

1156
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,380
she triple chain-locks
the front door at night.

1157
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:36,948
A little more,
a little more. Okay.

1158
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:56,943
Where is she?

1159
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,508
Maybe she's in her chair.

1160
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,800
You caught me.

1161
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:27,035
I can't help but sneak a fag
once in a blue moon.

1162
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:29,475
We...

1163
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,479
We thought
that you might be cold,

1164
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,708
so we brought you
an extra pillow.

1165
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:37,116
Oh, such consideration.

1166
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:42,055
So unlike the other landlords.

1167
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:47,358
Many have passed
through the dwelling below,

1168
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:53,835
but I just know
you two have come to stay.

1169
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:59,005
Officer Dan put in
me new television.

1170
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,236
52 inches.

1171
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:05,110
And he gave me
these noise boxes,

1172
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,479
there and by me chair.

1173
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:11,077
So it's like I'm in the cinema.

1174
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:17,717
Oh, it's going to be
so wonderful here.

1175
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:21,126
You two lovelies...

1176
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,495
me...

1177
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,467
Officer Dan.

1178
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:32,371
We're going to be
one big, happy family.

1179
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,873
The Irish have a saying

1180
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:41,076
that it's unlucky to come in
one door and go out of another.

1181
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,176
Something to do with the dead.

1182
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:47,814
Evil spirits and the like.

1183
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,086
Good night now.

1184
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,300
Do you know what, dears?

1185
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:12,677
I think I've enough warmth
as it is.

1186
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,744
Night.

1187
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,487
That was, without question,

1188
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:28,689
the weirdest 7 minutes
of my life.

1189
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:41,940
Captain Connelly battled waves
twice the size of that!

1190
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,706
Didn't he, Little Dick?

1191
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,913
We're just gonna be one big,
happy family!

1192
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,329
What?!
Is it us?!

1193
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,200
Are we doing such a bad job
of trying to kill her?!

1194
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:11,637
It's not our fault!
She's a freak of nature!

1195
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,306
Hey! I thought you were supposed
to get rid of these.

1196
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,077
I did!

1197
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,176
It's strange.
I don't know how that got there.

1198
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:25,743
Yeah, right.

1199
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,289
"Ass Patrol"!

1200
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,552
Hand me that "Ass Patrol."

1201
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,810
Now, depending on her mood,

1202
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,711
she could be watching TV
over here

1203
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,681
or sneaking a cigarette
over there.

1204
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,617
I realize this is
just horribly cluttered.

1205
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,814
When we get in there, we're
gonna go for a cleaner look.

1206
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,447
It's...

1207
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,523
Sorry.

1208
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,256
What's the easiest way
into this hag's place?

1209
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:13,859
Well, we found the dumbwaiter
to be rather effective.

1210
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:17,905
Yeah, and you really don't have
to pull that hard to climb it.

1211
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:21,841
You know, we could even leave
the back door open for you.

1212
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:25,676
So, Chick, how much is this
gonna set us back?

1213
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,079
25K.

1214
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,515
O-- 2-- Okay.

1215
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,985
'Cause we had had
a slightly different figure

1216
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:34,648
in our heads.

1217
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,988
We were thinking maybe something
a little closer to, like...

1218
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,257
half a "K."

1219
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,496
The bottom-line price
for wet work is $25,000.

1220
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,673
Okay.

1221
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,773
When do you think
you could do it?

1222
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,473
I'll do it Thursday night.

1223
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:01,106
- Christmas Eve?
- Yeah.

1224
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,016
I got a little function.
Then I'll swing by.

1225
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,520
Put the cash in the dumbwaiter.

1226
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:08,681
- Got it?
- Got it.

1227
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,850
- Okay.
- Cool.

1228
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:13,053
Don't forget your computer.

1229
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:15,221
Thank you so much.

1230
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,129
Good night.

1231
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:29,710
Okay, now all we need
is $25,000.

1232
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,747
"Piper grabbed the leash of the
only partner he'd ever known,

1233
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:35,613
and the private eye and his
Jack Russell headed downtown.

1234
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:39,120
'I guess it's just one of those
things worth killing for, huh?"'

1235
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,259
We'll take a break
and come back for some Q&A.

1236
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:46,624
Dental surgery.

1237
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,663
$25,000?!

1238
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,756
The thing is,
with Nancy losing her job,

1239
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:54,428
and with the mortgage and now
with me losing my book contract,

1240
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,003
things have gotten desperate,

1241
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:59,370
and I wouldn't even be asking
if it wasn't serious.

1242
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:03,943
Did you get the money?

1243
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:05,570
No. He didn't think
I needed it.

1244
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:09,208
But I did get a nice,
new, signed first edition

1245
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:10,751
for my collection.

1246
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,083
He wrote it in 4 days.
Want to know how?

1247
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,589
Listen to this.
Let's see.

1248
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,522
"Her hair was bright yellow

1249
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:20,153
like the color of your pee
after you take a multivitamin."

1250
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,993
It's a nice metaphor, asshole!

1251
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,226
Stupid, freaking asshole!

1252
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,427
I hate you and your stupid
Don Piper mystery

1253
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:30,699
and your stupid pregnant wife
who's gonna have a little baby

1254
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:34,742
that has a freaking six-pack
because its mother never eats!

1255
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,971
Honey.

1256
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,982
Honey, we're gonna get
that money.

1257
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,778
How?

1258
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:47,015
How are we gonna get $25,000
in two days?

1259
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:05,264

1279

1280

1282
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:42,163
Merry Christmas!

1283
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,637
That's good, kids.
That is good.

1284
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,140
Now, you save those voices
for the neighbors, okay?

1285
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,269
Officer Dan,
what a pleasant surprise.

1286
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,869
What can we do for you?

1287
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,507
I have cookies
I want to take to Miss Connelly.

1288
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:58,280
Oh, okay.
Oh, that's nice.

1289
01:15:58,353 --> 01:15:59,513
No.
I'll take them up myself.

1290
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:01,112
I'll bring them up for you.

1291
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:03,123
If you don't mind...

1292
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:09,928
I don't--

1293
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,125
I don't think she's even
up there.

1294
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,658
She's not, so you should just
leave it at the door.

1295
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:36,918
Hey!
Cut that out.

1296
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,516
Stop it.
Hey!

1297
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,256
Stop it!
What the heck is going on?

1298
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,763
There are kids here.

1299
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,427
I knew there was domestic abuse
in this house.

1300
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,503
I'm gonna come back
in 10 minutes.

1301
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,765
Come on, kids.
Let's go.

1302
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,669
Good save.

1303
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:59,039
I knew they'd send a brute.

1304
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,351
Aah!
You shot me!

1305
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,857
I've got you, you brute!

1306
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:14,293
Who are ya, bringing a knife
to a gunfight?

1307
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,558
Let go of me!

1308
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,367
What's he doing?

1309
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,203
He's doing his job.

1310
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,837
If you want to dance with me,

1311
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:34,438
you've gotta buy me
a drink first.

1312
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,585
Is that smoke?!

1313
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:47,417
Get off me, you crazy bitch!

1314
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,681
Wait, wait.

1315
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:47,085
What?
What?

1316
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,921
Here we go.
You all right?

1317
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:56,054
Yeah.
Where's Little Dickey?

1318
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,758
Dickey, Dickey.
Here you go.

1319
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,562
Here, here.

1320
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:00,692
Oh, Dick.

1321
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:03,828
Dickey.

1322
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,770
Hello.

1323
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,940
Never thought you had it in you.

1324
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,979
Thank God I bought
that fire extinguisher.

1325
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,106
We were just
trying to help her out.

1326
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:15,649
Her and Little Dickey.

1327
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:18,083
I'll just write this citation up
for electricity.

1328
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:19,814
Thank you.
Thanks.

1329
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:20,344
Thank you.
Thanks.

1330
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,662
Believe it or not,
I need two more autographs,

1331
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,600
and that will be it.

1332
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:38,036
- So how's the new place?
- It's cute.

1333
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:41,439
I'll tell you, the Bronx
is an up-and-coming borough.

1334
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,308
You didn't lie, Kenneth.
It all looks incredible.

1335
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:47,075
I told you they'd fix it up,
didn't I?

1336
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,208
Friedmans, meet Alex and Nancy.

1337
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,216
- Hi.
- Hey.

1338
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,843
We can't thank you enough.

1339
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,219
This is just a dream house.
It's so quiet.

1340
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,417
Honey, won't this be perfect
for your sleep disorder?

1341
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,153
I'm drowsy already.

1342
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,024
Hey, who wants to run upstairs
and say hello?

1343
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:02,723
Well, we should get going.

1344
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,959
We should.
We have to...

1345
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:05,658
Yeah.

1346
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,326
Nonsense!

1347
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:09,562
You pulled the woman
out of a burning building.

1348
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:12,333
You'd break her heart
if you didn't say goodbye.

1349
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,930
Come on!

1350
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:17,239
Mrs. Connelly,
I brought you a surprise!

1351
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:20,509
Mrs. Connelly!!

1352
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,447
The hearing on this one.

1353
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:25,816
Look who's here.
She's asleep.

1354
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:27,514
Sweetheart.

1355
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:33,087
She's stiff as a board.

1356
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,756
No.
She's just hard-of-hearing.

1357
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,623
Mrs. Connelly!

1358
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,643
She's dead.

1359
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:51,109
Oh, poor thing.

1360
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,976
No.

1361
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,948
She can't be dead.

1362
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,678
I guess it was just her time.

1363
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,681
Come on, I'll call
the Friedmans.

1364
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,020
You don't have to stay here
for this.

1365
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:06,390
Come.
Come, come, come.

1366
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,889
Must have been
all the excitement.

1367
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,848
I can't believe it.

1368
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:38,688
She was so full of life.

1369
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:43,320
I mean, for all our differences,

1370
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:47,630
that old lady really had
a lot of spunk.

1371
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,829
A lot of it.

1372
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:53,464
Do you think she's up in heaven?

1373
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:56,609
Well, I'll tell you something.

1374
01:21:56,678 --> 01:22:00,876
Wherever she is,
she's in a better place.

1375
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:12,517
You should have seen their faces
when I said she was a goner.

1376
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,529
So cheap, though I wish
I could have been there.

1377
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,359
Trust me.

1378
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:19,798
It wasn't easy holding
me breath all that long.

1379
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:23,326
Next time, I want a bigger cut
of your commission, Kenny.

1380
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,963
What are you talking about?
We give you everything, Ma.

1381
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:27,405
There's barely enough left

1382
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:30,876
for Danny and I to have
a cruise to the Caribbean.

1383
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,211
I'm the one putting
me caboose on the line.

1384
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:34,873
Oh, come on.

1385
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,713
You had it easy
with Alex and Nancy.

1386
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:40,721
They were a nice couple.
I do hope they'll be all right.

1387
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,017
Ah, they'll be fine.

1388
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:44,558
He's a writer.
They thrive on adversity.

1389
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:48,494
I hope his next book is better
than his last one.

1390
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:52,659
Maybe this time he'll write
about something he knows.
