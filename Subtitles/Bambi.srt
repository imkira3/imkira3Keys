1
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:17,809
Love is a song that never ends

2
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:23,690
Life may be swift and fleeting

3
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:29,195
Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music

4
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,909
Comes each day like the dawn

5
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:40,498
Love is a song that never ends

6
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:46,337
One simple theme repeating

7
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:52,093
Like the voice of a heavenly choir

8
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:58,766
Love's sweet music flows on

9
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:11,654
Like the voice of a heavenly choir

10
00:01:12,489 --> 00:02:55,132
Love's sweet music flows on

11
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,998
Wake up.

12
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,543
-What now?
-Wake up, Friend Owl.

13
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,796
What's going on around here?

14
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,215
-Wake up.
-It's happened.

15
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,258
The new prince is born.

16
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,845
-We're going to see him.
-Come on. You better hurry up.

17
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,777
Well, look.

18
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,615
-Well.
-Isn't he cute?

19
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:32,039
Well, this is quite an occasion.

20
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,961
Yes, sir,
it isn't every day a prince is born.

21
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,798
You're to be congratulated.

22
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,677
-Yes, congratulations.
-Congratulations.

23
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,929
Thank you very much.

24
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,100
Come on. Wake up. We have company.

25
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,649
Hello. Hello, there.

26
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,902
-Hello, little prince.
-Hello. Hello, there.

27
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,738
Hello, little prince.

28
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,509
Look. He's trying to get up.

29
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,618
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?

30
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,161
Thumper.

31
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,873
Well, he is.

32
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,293
Aren't you?

33
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,137
Looks to me like
he's getting kind of sleepy.

34
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,893
I think it's time we all left.

35
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,686
Come on.

36
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,831
Thumper. Come on.

37
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,836
Whatcha gonna call him?

38
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,758
Well, I think I'll call him Bambi.

39
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,765
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.

40
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,642
Bambi.

41
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,687
My little Bambi.

42
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,220
Walking already.
Well, what do you know.

43
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,406
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mrs Quail.

44
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,075
And where's the young prince this...

45
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,290
-Good morning, Bambi.
-Good morning, young prince.

46
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,878
Goodbye.

47
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,717
Good morning, young prince.

48
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,142
Good morning, young prince.

49
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,033
Good morning.

50
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,328
Nice sunny day.

51
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,717
-What's the matter?
-What happened?

52
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,762
Did the young prince fall down?

53
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,265
-Is he hurt?
-No, he's all right.

54
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,770
He doesn't walk very good, does he?

55
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,730
Thumper.

56
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,149
Yes, Mama?

57
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,528
What did your father tell you
this morning?

58
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,535
If you can't say something nice,

59
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,833
don't say nothing at all.

60
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,129
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.

61
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,258
Come on, get up. Get up.

62
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:46,311
-Get up.
-Try again.

63
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,547
I'm thumping.
That's why they call me Thumper.

64
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,592
Thumper!

65
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,529
Come on. You can do it.

66
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,366
Hop over it. Like this.

67
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,871
Hop over it.

68
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,416
Like this.

69
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,932
You didn't hop far enough.

70
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,854
That's it. Now the other one.

71
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,618
Gee whiz, what happened that time?

72
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,471
Those are birds.

73
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,937
Look, he's trying to talk.

74
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,358
He's trying to say "bird."

75
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,737
Say "bird."

76
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,201
Bird.

77
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,624
Bird.

78
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,085
Come on, say "bird," say "bird."

79
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,171
Say "bird." Say "bird."
Come on, say "bird."

80
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,257
Say "bird."

81
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,844
Bird.

82
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,057
He talked. He talked, Mama.

83
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,560
The young prince said "bird."

84
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,521
Bird, bird, bird...

85
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,292
Bird.

86
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,586
No, that's not a bird.

87
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,921
That's a butterfly.

88
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,132
Butterfly?

89
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,592
Butter...

90
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,806
Butterfly.

91
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,850
No, that's a flower.

92
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,271
-Flower?
-It's pretty.

93
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,028
Pretty.

94
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,579
Flower.

95
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,164
Me?

96
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,379
No, no, no, no.

97
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,258
That's not a flower.

98
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,011
-He's a little...
-That's all right.

99
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,891
He can call me a flower if he wants to.

100
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,606
I don't mind.

101
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,029
Pretty. Pretty flower.

102
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,995
Gosh.

103
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,010
I think I better go home now.

104
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,903
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

105
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,155
Beating a tune
As you fall all around

106
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,283
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

107
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,952
What can compare
With your beautiful sound?

108
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,788
Beautiful sound
Beautiful sound

109
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,166
Drip, drop
Drip, drop

110
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,793
Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy

111
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,004
Your pretty music
Can brighten the day

112
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,007
Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy

113
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,718
You come along
with a song right away

114
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,678
Come with your beautiful music

115
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,348
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

116
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,059
Beating a tune
As you fall all around

117
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,686
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

118
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,189
What can compare
With your beautiful sound?

119
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,942
Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy

120
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,778
You come along
With your pretty little song

121
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,072
Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy

122
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,532
You come along
With your pretty little song

123
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,160
-Gay little roundelay
-Gay little roundelay

124
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,746
-Song of the rainy day
-Song of the rainy day

125
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,332
How I love to hear your patter
Pretty little pitter-patter

126
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,043
Helter skelter, when you pelter
Troubles always seem to scatter

127
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,504
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

128
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,340
Beating a sound as you fall all around

129
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,676
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

130
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,637
-Little April shower
-With your beautiful sound

131
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,815
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

132
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,443
Beating a tune
As you fall all around

133
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,112
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

134
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,782
What can compare
With your beautiful sound?

135
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,910
Beautiful sound

136
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,736
Mother, what we going to do today?

137
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,405
I'm going to take you to the meadow.

138
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,951
Meadow? What's the meadow?

139
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,912
It's a very wonderful place.

140
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,832
Then why haven't we
been there before?

141
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,543
You weren't big enough.

142
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,337
-Mother, you know what?
-What?

143
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,507
We're not the only deer in the forest.

144
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,969
-Where did you hear that?
-Thumper told me.

145
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,012
Well, he's right.

146
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,723
There are many deer in the forest
besides us.

147
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,309
Then why don't I ever see them?

148
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,437
-You will, sometime.
-On the meadow?

149
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,273
Perhaps.

150
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,649
Hush now.

151
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,319
We're almost there.

152
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,206
-The meadow.
-Wait.

153
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,792
Bambi, wait.

154
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,380
You must never rush out
on the meadow.

155
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,465
There might be danger.

156
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,886
Out there, we're unprotected.

157
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,430
The meadow is wide and open,

158
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,099
and there are no trees or bushes
to hide us.

159
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,518
So we have to be very careful.

160
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,521
Wait here.

161
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:19,777
I'll go out first.
And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.

162
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,207
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.

163
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,004
Come on.

164
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,558
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

165
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,060
Good morning, young prince.

166
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,855
Hello. What ya eatin'?

167
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,108
-Clover.
-It's awfully good.

168
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,193
It's delicious.

169
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,779
Why don't you try some?

170
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,785
No, not that green stuff.

171
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,496
Just eat the blossoms.

172
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,582
That's the good stuff.

173
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,334
Thumper.

174
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,757
-Yes, Mama?
-What did your father tell you?

175
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,717
About what?

176
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,846
About eating the blossoms
and leaving the greens?

177
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,223
Oh, that one.

178
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,062
Eating greens is a special treat.

179
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:04,358
It makes long ears and great big feet.

180
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,655
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

181
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,659
I made that last part up myself.

182
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,416
Watch out.

183
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,189
That's little Faline.

184
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,110
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?

185
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,947
Well, maybe he wouldn't be
if you'd say hello.

186
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,244
Hello, Bambi.

187
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,917
I said hello.

188
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,336
Well, aren't you going to answer her?

189
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,717
You're not afraid, are you?

190
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,097
Well, then, go ahead.

191
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,272
Go on, say hello.

192
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:22,413
Hello.

193
00:26:49,900 --> 00:28:27,121
You.

194
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,518
He stopped and looked at me.

195
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,645
Yes, I know.

196
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:37,233
Why was everyone still
when he came on the meadow?

197
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,652
Everyone respects him.

198
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:45,616
For of all the deer in the forest,
not one has lived half so long.

199
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:50,120
He's very brave and very wise.

200
00:29:51,289 --> 00:30:42,381
That's why he's known as
the Great Prince of the Forest.

201
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,737
Faline.

202
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,491
Bambi.

203
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,370
Mother.

204
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,710
Bambi.

205
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,259
Mother.

206
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,301
Come on out, Bambi.

207
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,222
Come on.

208
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,808
It's safe now.

209
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,852
We don't have to hide any longer.

210
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:25,067
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?

211
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:33,075
Man was in the forest.

212
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,596
Mother, look.
What's all that white stuff?

213
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,225
Why, it's snow.

214
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,810
-Snow?
-Yes.

215
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,355
Winter has come.

216
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,004
Hiya, Bambi.

217
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,715
Watch what I can do.

218
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,400
Come on. It's all right.

219
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,860
Look.

220
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,696
The water's stiff.

221
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,548
Some fun, huh, Bambi?

222
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:28,185
Come on, get up. Like this.

223
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,200
No, no, no.

224
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,430
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

225
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,205
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.

226
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:54,646
Guess you better unwind it.

227
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,937
Wake up. Wake up, Flower.

228
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,444
Is it spring yet?

229
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,655
No. Winter's just started.

230
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,034
What you doing? Hibernating?

231
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,208
What do you want to do that for?

232
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,714
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

233
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:33,370
Well, good night.

234
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,002
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

235
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,671
It seems long.

236
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,258
But it won't last forever.

237
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,973
I'm awful hungry, Mother.

238
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,350
Yes, I know.

239
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,695
Bambi, come here.

240
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,822
Look.

241
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,659
New spring grass.

242
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,018
Bambi. Quick.

243
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,519
The thicket.

244
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,152
Faster. Faster, Bambi.

245
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,072
Don't look back. Keep running.

246
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,241
Keep running.

247
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,797
We made it.

248
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,382
We made it, Mother.

249
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,676
We...

250
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,762
Mother.

251
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,684
Mother!

252
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,568
Mother, where are you?

253
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,991
Mother!

254
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,957
Mother!

255
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,252
Mother!

256
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,343
Mother!

257
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,103
Mother!

258
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,903
Your mother can't be
with you anymore.

259
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,005
Come.

260
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,549
My son.

261
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,074
Let's sing a gay little spring song

262
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,745
This is the season to sing

263
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,582
So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best

264
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,627
And warble a song about spring

265
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,129
Spring, spring, spring

266
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,423
Let's get together and sing

267
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,972
Let's sing a gay little spring song

268
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,768
Just like the bird on the wing

269
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,396
Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright

270
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,149
So let's get together and sing

271
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,818
Sing, sing, sing

272
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,197
Let's sing a song about spring

273
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,700
Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May

274
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,120
Get into the mood
And be merry today

275
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,916
Forget all your troubles
And warble away...

276
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,125
Wait.

277
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,753
What now?

278
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,007
Hey.

279
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,843
Stop that racket.

280
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,095
Scat.

281
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,724
Let's sing a song about spring

282
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,352
I'll fix 'em.

283
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:01,364
There. I guess that'll teach 'em.

284
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,579
Oh, what's the use?

285
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,252
This is the season to sing...

286
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,717
Same thing every spring.

287
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,435
Love's sweet song.

288
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,731
Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.

289
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,544
Stop it.

290
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,300
Get out of here. All of you.

291
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,846
And you, too.

292
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:12,059
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?

293
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,437
Why, it's the young prince.

294
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,189
Bambi!

295
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,401
My, my, how you've changed.

296
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,321
Turn round there. Let me look at you.

297
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,158
I see you've traded in your spots
for a pair of antlers.

298
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:35,666
You know, just the other day
I was talking to myself about you.

299
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,544
And we were wondering
what had become of you.

300
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,630
Hello, Bambi.

301
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,674
Remember me?

302
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:45,927
Thumper.

303
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,346
Right.

304
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,977
Hi, fellas.

305
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,771
Flower.

306
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,148
Yeah.

307
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,745
Well, what's the matter with them?

308
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,164
Why are they acting that way?

309
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,917
Why, don't you know?

310
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,378
They're "twitterpated."

311
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,214
Twitterpated?

312
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,094
Yes. Nearly everybody gets
twitterpated in the spring time.

313
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,724
For example,

314
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:39,146
you're walking along,
minding your own business,

315
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:43,109
you're looking neither to the left
nor to the right,

316
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,361
when all of a sudden

317
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,573
you run smack into a pretty face.

318
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:54,704
You begin to get weak in the knees.

319
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,790
You begin to get weak in the knees.

320
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,334
Your head's in a whirl.

321
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,672
And then you feel light as a feather.

322
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,966
And before you know it,

323
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,594
you're walking on air.

324
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,683
And then you know what?

325
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,352
You're knocked for a loop.

326
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,772
And you completely lose your head.

327
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,693
Gosh, that's awful.

328
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,987
-Gee whiz.
-Terrible.

329
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,905
And that ain't all.

330
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,992
It can happen to anybody.

331
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,370
So you'd better be careful.

332
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:40,333
It could happen to you, and you, and...

333
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,796
Yes, it could even happen to you.

334
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,885
Well, it's not going to happen to me.

335
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,804
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

336
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,248
Twitterpated.

337
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,731
Hello.

338
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,734
Hello, Bambi.

339
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,614
Don't you remember me?

340
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,537
I'm Faline.

341
00:53:53,146 --> 00:54:18,504
Bambi.

342
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,261
I bring you a song

343
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:53,807
And I sing as I go

344
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:57,060
For I want you to know

345
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:01,648
That I'm looking for romance

346
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,487
I bring you a song

347
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,907
In the hope that you'll see

348
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,160
When you're looking at me

349
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:16,580
That I'm looking for love

350
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,668
I'm seeking that glow

351
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,546
Only found when you're young
and it's May

352
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,674
Only found on that wonderful day

353
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,802
When all longing is through

354
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:35,098
I'm seeking that glow

355
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:38,352
Only found when a thrill is complete

356
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,730
Only found when two hearts
gently beat

357
00:56:41,814 --> 00:56:48,320
To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new

358
00:56:49,113 --> 00:56:52,199
I bring you a song

359
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,953
For I'm seeking romance

360
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,914
You're by my side
There's a moon up above

361
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,042
It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright

362
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:07,923
It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love

363
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:21,979
I bring you a song

364
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:25,816
For I'm seeking romance

365
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,860
And you

366
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,936
It is Man.

367
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,731
He is here again.

368
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:52,027
There are many this time.

369
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,866
We must go deep into the forest.

370
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,659
Hurry. Follow me.

371
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,246
Faline.

372
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,845
Bambi.

373
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,932
Bambi, where are you?

374
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,573
Faline.

375
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,450
Listen.

376
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,535
-He's coming.
-Hush.

377
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:25,120
Be quiet.

378
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:30,667
-He's coming closer.
-Be calm. Don't get excited.

379
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,754
-We better fly.
-No. No, don't fly.

380
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,923
Whatever you do, don't fly.

381
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:40,552
He's almost here.
I can't stand it any longer.

382
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,904
Bambi.

383
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,337
Faline.

384
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:03,635
Bambi! Bambi!

385
01:02:31,539 --> 01:03:12,704
Quick, Faline. Jump.

386
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:08,343
Get up, Bambi.

387
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:14,099
Get up.

388
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,147
You must get up.

389
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,985
Get up.

390
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,655
Get up.

391
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:44,504
Now, come with me.

392
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,708
Bambi.

393
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,627
Wake up. Wake up, Friend Owl.

394
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,963
Wake up, Friend Owl.

395
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,216
What now?

396
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,304
Hey, what's going on around here?

397
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,180
-It's happened.
-Happened?

398
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,224
Yes. In the thicket.

399
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,184
Hurry up, Bambi.

400
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:48,563
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.

401
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:20,345
Oh. Well.

402
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:28,728
Look.

403
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,564
Two of them.

404
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:42,617
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.

405
01:08:44,828 --> 01:08:47,955
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.

406
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,962
Love is a song

407
01:08:55,047 --> 01:09:00,301
That never ends

408
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:03,596
One simple theme

409
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,101
Repeating

410
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,688
Like the voice

411
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:16,317
Of a heavenly choir

412
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:23,116
Love's sweet music

413
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:42,552
Flows on
