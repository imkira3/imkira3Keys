2
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:26,937
It's the big house on the left.
"Casa de Porter"!

3
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,043
Hello?

4
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:53,899
See ya, Porter!

5
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:02,825
Just the one.
It's not five o'clock yet.

6
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,500
I beg your pardon, little pig.
What d'ya say?

7
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:15,921
Sandy? - Yep.
- Thought you were comin' Thursday.

8
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:19,550
It is Thursday.
- Looks like I missed your boat.

9
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,096
Oon't worry, buddy,
Uncle Paul will make it up to you.

10
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:28,684
What is this place anyway?
- It was an abandoned fishing camp.

11
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:33,147
It was a real dump when I got here.

12
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:37,484
Come aboard, I'll show you around.

13
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:39,945
Hey! Heel!

14
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:41,614
Here, boy.

15
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:46,577
We're in the poo, mate.

16
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:04,011
You like spaghetti this much?
- I'm quite a bargain hunter.

17
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:09,475
When the cruise ships are in the area,
you can do some terrific deals.

18
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:14,688
Any passengers that want Spaghetti-os
are out of luck.

19
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,149
I'm sure.

20
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:20,903
They're not exactly Omaha steaks,
but you won't go hungry.

21
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:28,452
There's gotta be some mistake.
You cannot be my uncle.

22
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:34,542
You know they say: You can choose
your friends, but not your relatives.

23
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:40,464
Why don't you unpack?
I'll rustle us up some grub.

24
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,926
How much did she pay you
to take me off her hands?

25
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,224
I resent that. When your mother
called, I didn't hesitate.

26
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:53,018
If anyone
knows about divorce, it's me.

27
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:55,938
I mean, family's very important.

28
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,608
You guys are all I've got.

29
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:01,026
How much?

30
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:10,035
A hundred dollars a week.
Just for the summer.

31
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:13,706
Oh boy, she really low-balled ya.

32
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,292
Story of my life, kid.

33
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,629
This concert's history.

34
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,110
All aboard!

35
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,116
Come on, sailor! Shake a leg!

36
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:53,078
You don't get up, you don't eat.
Time to rock and roll!

37
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:02,296
Spaghetti-os with or without?
- Without what? - Pee-wee franks.

38
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,800
Suit yourself.

39
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,303
But out on the ocean,

40
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:13,474
you can't order a pizza.

41
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:18,729
You ever been fishing?

42
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:26,779
What d'ya catch? - A whale.
But I threw it back.

43
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,201
Most people think fishing's
a bamboo pole and a 6-pack of suds.

44
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:34,995
But it's tougher than that.
- Oh really.

45
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:37,456
What about seasickness?

46
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,293
Look, I can handle it.

47
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:55,975
Sure ya can.

48
00:09:14,493 --> 00:09:15,744
Where's the bait, sailor?

49
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,414
Bait my butt!

50
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:39,226
You okay?

51
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,428
At least it floats!

52
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:17,723
Funny. Buck-faced wombat!

53
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:26,023
Just keep your eyes on the horizon.
- For how long?

54
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,651
As long as it takes to keep it down.

55
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,130
Oamn dolphins stealing all the bait.
- They're scaring the fish away.

56
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,369
That's not fishing, kid.
That's murder.

57
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:03,954
It's pathetic.

58
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,438
Hey, kid!

59
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,858
You see where that dolphin went?

60
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:37,446
Yeah.

61
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:41,116
That way.

62
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:46,163
You sure?

63
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:00,928
Alright, Oirk!

64
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,055
Come on!

65
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:11,397
Go on, get outta here!

66
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:15,109
Go on. Go!

67
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,241
Go!

68
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:54,273
You gonna be at this concert?
- The Chili Peppers are mine!

69
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:57,026
You're splitting?
- Am I splitting!

70
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:03,657
Hey, Tommy.

71
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:06,118
You returning to the mainland?

72
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:10,289
I can't make it with no fish.
Fish are gone, I'm gone.

73
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,834
What, you givin' up the good life?

74
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:18,005
Good life's ancient history. I can't
feed a cat with what I catch.

75
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,550
Oon't worry.

76
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:26,096
I'm on the 5 A.M. Ferry.
Pick me up, we'll be at the concert.

77
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:28,599
Gotta go, it's the hippy!

78
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:34,188
Thought you might
like a change. - Why?

79
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:37,650
I dunno.

80
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,988
Yo, Marvin!

81
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,200
Aren't you a bit warm?

82
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:53,791
What's with him?
- Marvin's a little shy.

83
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:59,421
Give him a spring and a wire,
he'll make an outboard motor.

84
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:05,511
I don't want to hurt him.
- But sweetheart...

85
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:10,391
Okay, we'll put him back
in with his friends,

86
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:14,395
and we'll use this guy.
He won't mind at all.

87
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,022
Have fun fishing!
- Okay.

88
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,526
Become a marine biologist
and you can bait hooks too...

89
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:23,988
In Boston you wouldn't get to see me.

90
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:27,366
Just my luck.
This must be Sandy.

91
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:30,661
Hi, I'm Cathy.
He probably told you about me.

92
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,997
No.

93
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,166
Can you get my stuff?

94
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:45,259
So, how's he doing?
- Like a pizza, but upside down.

95
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:50,681
I'll straighten him out.
You cooking dinner tonight?

96
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:53,225
Why? You tired of Spaghetti-o's?

97
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:16,624
You heard Tommy's leaving the island.

98
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:19,960
We haven't had a decent catch
since spring. - I know why.

99
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:23,714
The fish are loaded with dioxin.

100
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:27,801
What's dioxin?
- It's a by-product of herbicide.

101
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:30,095
How's that getting in our water?

102
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:32,264
Careful!

103
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:41,148
Will he ever take off that raincoat?

104
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:44,818
Maybe we could get it cleaned
with him still inside.

105
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,279
You never take me seriously!

106
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:50,950
That's not fair!
Hit me with your best shot.

107
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:53,702
When are we getting married?

108
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:03,128
Gotta go fix the net.
- Porter Ricks!

109
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:13,347
Think he'll ever grow up?

110
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,398
What are you doing?

111
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,533
Hey, Sandy. Oo I look cool or what?

112
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,951
Or what.

113
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,957
It's the shirt. It was given to me
by Brian Wilson. - Who?

114
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:50,212
Brian Wilson. Beach Boys.
What are they teaching you kids?

115
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,259
I'm tired. Gonna hit the hay early.

116
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:58,137
Good. Cathy's number's on the wall.

117
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:01,265
There's spaghetti if you're hungry...
- Yeah.

118
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:04,476
I'm late. See ya in the A.M., kid.

119
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:08,731
See ya in the A. M... not!

120
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,233
FERRY OEPARTURES

121
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:42,056
Hello?

122
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:15,232
Is that you?

123
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:32,374
Come on!

124
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,710
Cool!

125
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:07,344
Sorry. Gotta jet. See ya!

126
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:40,002
Shake a leg, sailor!
You don't get up, you don't eat.

127
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,259
Sandy?

128
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:53,891
Earthquake!

129
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:01,023
Jeez!

130
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,491
Storm's comin'. Board up the windows.

131
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,661
I can't, Russ.
Looking for a runaway nephew.

132
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:17,623
Call off the search.
He took the first ferry out.

133
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:26,632
By the way, I'll need $22.50.
He put it on your tab.

134
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:42,690
He's so cute!

135
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:59,498
Sandy?
I am by nature a gentle soul.

136
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:04,920
However, I can crush a coconut...

137
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:07,256
with my bare hands.

138
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:10,968
Hold that thought
as we make our exit...

139
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:14,263
with dignity.

140
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:40,915
Get that rope!

141
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:47,046
Sandy! Get the line!

142
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:21,247
Oamn! Nice going, kid!
- You know what you just did?

143
00:27:21,664 --> 00:27:25,000
I probably saved your life.
- You made me blow Chili Peppers.

144
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:29,755
Next concert's in Orlando.
I don't have tickets. - I don't give...

145
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:34,260
Great! Bloody great.
"Yeah, I'd love to see Sandy.

146
00:27:35,678 --> 00:27:37,596
Send him down. It'll be great."

147
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:44,645
Lt'll cost me
my house and my boat, but...

148
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:48,315
I should give up
and join Tommy on the mainland.

149
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:53,612
Why didn't you just let me go?
- I'm not finished with you yet.

150
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:59,285
Oon't talk like my father.
I'm not looking for another father.

151
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,871
Good.

152
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,250
Make's us even.
'Cause I'm not looking for a son.

153
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,961
Especially
a screw-up teenager like you.

154
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:14,550
You don't know me.
You know nothing about me.

155
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:19,013
Tell you what I do know, kid.

156
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:22,516
This here is the earth.

157
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:27,229
This is the great big ocean.
Here's our tiny island. Your mum

158
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:29,106
is way over there.

159
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:34,028
No matter how you scream,
she can't hear ya.

160
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:40,075
You got no friends, no money,
no malls to hang around. You're stuck.

161
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:42,828
All you have is me.

162
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,290
So get used to it.

163
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:51,504
And relax. Got a long, ugly
day ahead of us... and night.

164
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,383
Gonna use that pillow?

165
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:00,137
Thanks.

166
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,205
He snored all bloody night!

167
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:39,134
Oh man!

168
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:50,813
Is nothing sacred?

169
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,862
Jeez!

170
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:02,116
Get off there!

171
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:15,754
Look...

172
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:19,925
Since I know you love being here,
I'll make a deal.

173
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:23,679
You work for me,
help clean this mess up,

174
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:26,390
and I'll get you
to that concert in Orlando.

175
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:30,436
How?
I don't even have tickets.

176
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:32,980
Kid, this is Porter Ricks.

177
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:36,650
If it exists, I can get it.
We'll make that show.

178
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:39,820
We?
- Think I'd let you go alone?

179
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:44,867
Besides, I can dig the Chili Peppers.
Not the Beach Boys, but who is?

180
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:46,994
Is it a deal?

181
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:02,760
Haul her in!

182
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:09,350
Start with the fish pan netting. Mast
and stuff's in the shed or in town.

183
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:12,645
I'm gonna have to stay
with the boat on the mainland.

184
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:15,606
You gonna be alright?
- I'll be fine.

185
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:21,153
Cathy will drop in on you.

186
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:25,449
You can reach me through
the coastguard station.

187
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:28,160
But nothing's gonna happen, right?
- Right.

188
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:30,538
Right.

189
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:30,764
You...

190
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:40,556
Like my dolphin?
- Your dolphin?

191
00:36:41,974 --> 00:36:45,477
That's right. I found him.

192
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,771
What's his name?

193
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:55,487
His name's Flipper.

194
00:36:57,656 --> 00:37:01,076
Never seen one alone like this.

195
00:37:02,244 --> 00:37:05,664
Alone he'd be no match for Scar.
- Who's Scar?

196
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:09,251
The hammerhead that stalks
these waters. Big and ugly.

197
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:15,049
They say he took out a tourist boat.
He likes those out-of-towners.

198
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,436
That jerk tried to kill Flipper.

199
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:30,606
He was shooting at him.

200
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:34,443
That's Oirk Moran, a bottom-feeder.

201
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:40,491
What are you doing?
- I'm hypnotizing him.

202
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,535
It's not working.

203
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:46,455
You make him do something.

204
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,044
Okay. Sure.

205
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:55,589
Alright.

206
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:57,716
Alright, Flipper...

207
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:01,011
What do you wanna do today?

208
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:11,230
Jump!

209
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,947
Awesome!

210
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,242
You know...
- Where did he go?

211
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,808
I'm Kim.
- Sandy.

212
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,647
He's hungry.
- Really?

213
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:57,276
Where d'you get fish to feed him?
- Feed him?

214
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,906
He's your dolphin.
- Well, yeah...

215
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:05,201
Come on, I got an idea.

216
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:21,800
Lookin' good, Porter.
- Thanks.

217
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,847
Oid most of it myself.
Most of it.

218
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:29,308
Now I just have to pay for it.

219
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:34,063
Take a lesson from your nephew.
He's becoming quite a businessman.

220
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,525
What's he been up to?
- You'll see!

221
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:46,825
Fish go in the bucket. One dollar
to see Flipper, the Wonder Oolphin.

222
00:39:50,913 --> 00:39:51,914
FLIPPER THE WONOER OOLPHIN

223
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:55,334
One dollar. Oid you put your fish in?

224
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:58,671
One dollar. In there. Wow!

225
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:00,881
TOSS A QUARTER. FLIPPER RETURNS.

226
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:18,566
OROP 25 CENTS HERE

227
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,655
PENNIES

228
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:28,117
Oon't ask me,
I can't explain how he does it.

229
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,414
What's this, a penny?

230
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,668
It's a Lincoln penny!
Vintage, man! Enjoy!

231
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,326
Marvin! Come on in. No charge!

232
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,657
1 dollar, thanks. Fish in the bucket.

233
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:53,827
1 dollar, thanks.
Fish go in the bucket. Excuse me!

234
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:57,206
You need a fish to get in.

235
00:41:57,623 --> 00:42:00,709
I don't have to pay, Kim.
I own this circus.

236
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,713
What's going on here?
- Oh, hi!

237
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:09,969
My best havanas! - It's the
Flipper Show! - Who's Flipper?

238
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:16,976
Alright, the Flipper Show is over.
All you kids go home, now!

239
00:42:17,393 --> 00:42:19,770
Come on.
- Sorry.

240
00:42:20,187 --> 00:42:22,314
You can have your fish back.

241
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:24,859
Give me my fish!
- Now!

242
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,114
See ya, Sandy.
Go easy on him, Mr. Ricks.

243
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:36,620
You were gonna fix the house!
- I did it so Flipper could eat.

244
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:41,333
Who do you think you're dealing with?
You did it to turn some coin.

245
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:45,421
I didn't do too bad
for myself either. Hey!

246
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,258
Half cut!
As for you, you oversized guppy...

247
00:42:54,722 --> 00:42:56,557
I'll have to bring out the heavy guns.

248
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:11,697
We're gonna try a new approach.
It's called "Oealing with your crap."

249
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,366
This is how it works. Number 1:

250
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:19,830
You're gonna take responsibility for
your actions and the consequences.

251
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:23,375
Number 2: You're
gonna start getting up on time.

252
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:26,504
And at work,
you're gonna hump, not gripe.

253
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:31,133
You'll have to use your brain,
the weakest muscle in your body.

254
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,219
And as fo the dolphin:

255
00:43:33,636 --> 00:43:39,058
If the damn thing won't go away,
you'll feed it. In your own time.

256
00:43:39,475 --> 00:43:41,602
And stand up straight!

257
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:46,232
Oh, and you wanna be
a big man with a cigar, right?

258
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:48,943
Fire up that puppy!

259
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,113
Keep it stoked! From now on,
when I smoke, you smoke.

260
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,479
Washed your hands? Sit down.

261
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:29,775
Stogies down.

262
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:33,320
Let's eat.

263
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:38,367
Mom, when are you picking me up?
- In 2 weeks. What's in your mouth?

264
00:44:38,784 --> 00:44:40,995
Cigar.
- A what?

265
00:44:42,371 --> 00:44:46,208
I've been smokin' up a storm.
Uncle Porter lets me drink beer.

266
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:50,462
He also knows a lot of
loose women. - Put your uncle on!

267
00:44:55,968 --> 00:44:59,638
Yeah, Porter.
- He can't smoke. He's just a kid!

268
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:01,724
Hang on a sec, love...

269
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:07,855
It's OK,
he' s about to kick the habit.

270
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:11,942
Ready for another?

271
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:16,197
Oh, please,
I'll never smoke again!

272
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:20,701
Good. Now go and
take care of that poor little fish.

273
00:45:42,848 --> 00:45:44,850
Good boy. Thanks.

274
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,981
Bring it to Sandy. Go on!

275
00:45:56,862 --> 00:45:58,447
Porter!

276
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:04,787
I can't find Marvin anywhere.
I'm really worried. - Jump in.

277
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:10,709
1 minute 20.

278
00:46:12,545 --> 00:46:13,546
Hey, Sandy!

279
00:46:15,464 --> 00:46:16,715
Marvin, what's up?

280
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:19,677
Cool, huh?

281
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:22,763
Come on down.

282
00:46:31,146 --> 00:46:34,650
Careful on the dock, Marv.
It's kinda slippery!

283
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:40,489
Alright, Marv. Meet Flipper!

284
00:47:05,014 --> 00:47:07,099
Marvin!
- Flipper!

285
00:47:12,605 --> 00:47:15,065
Way to go, Marv!

286
00:47:26,952 --> 00:47:28,746
Are you guys telling secrets?

287
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,293
We were wondering what the deal
is with you two? - What d'ya mean?

288
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,005
You in for the long haul,
or is it just a fling?

289
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,384
Sorry, is that the wrong question?

290
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:47,056
Not at all, Sandy.
I'd be interested in the answer.

291
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:49,517
Eat up, it's getting cold.

292
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:05,574
Well, the gang's all here.

293
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,453
Word has it you have a pet dolphin.

294
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:13,165
I wouldn't call it a pet, Oirk.

295
00:48:13,582 --> 00:48:17,878
No? The way fishing's been,
we don't need a dolphin...

296
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,674
to tear holes in nets and steal bait.

297
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:24,969
But you know that, don't you?

298
00:48:25,386 --> 00:48:29,390
We're talking about one dolphin.
- You stay out of this.

299
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:32,643
One dolphin is one too many.

300
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:41,235
Bad smell around here.

301
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:50,494
What's his problem? - He resents
anything smarter than he is.

302
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:54,039
That includes about everything,
even these clams.

303
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:09,013
Get him!
- Out of the way!

304
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,684
What are you doing?
You're hurting him!

305
00:49:15,811 --> 00:49:16,812
That's enough!

306
00:49:17,605 --> 00:49:22,234
You've had your fun. Let him go.
- It's the Greenpeace Warrior!

307
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:29,450
The animal means something
to the kid. - It does?

308
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:33,454
Well, isn't that sweet?

309
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,998
Isn't that sweet, boys?

310
00:49:36,415 --> 00:49:39,210
The kid and the fish are pals.

311
00:49:39,627 --> 00:49:42,379
I'd watch how I make friends.
- Enough!

312
00:49:53,432 --> 00:49:57,937
You got no right to do that.
I should teach you a lesson.

313
00:49:58,354 --> 00:50:00,481
Yeah, I'd like that.

314
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:05,528
I have a thirst for knowledge.
Teach me.

315
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,453
School's out, is it?

316
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,168
Thought so.

317
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,796
Maybe next time.

318
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,801
You can count on it, Ricks!

319
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:42,064
Good boy.
Come here, let me see those teeth.

320
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:51,031
Here you go.
- That'll fit.

321
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:58,622
Slow down!

322
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,965
Hey, Buck, How are ya?
- Fine, and you?

323
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:12,928
Pretty good. Bit of storm damage,
nothing we can't handle.

324
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:16,849
Lucky dolphin! Gets the pro treatment.
- How are ya?

325
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:21,562
Fine, except a little bird told me
you found yourselves this animal.

326
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:24,648
Porter, you can't keep a dolphin.

327
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:29,403
Here's the funny part: We're not
keeping it. He just stays.

328
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:34,867
I tried to chase him away,
but he's taken a fancy to us.

329
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:39,246
He's also harassing the fish.
- What? - We can't allow that.

330
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:43,292
Who told you that?
- It doesn't matter.

331
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:48,756
The law says, unless an animal's in
licensed captivity, he must be at sea.

332
00:51:52,468 --> 00:51:56,847
You're here to take him?
- You can't! He's used to being fed.

333
00:51:57,264 --> 00:51:59,808
That animal
can't fend for itself anymore.

334
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,729
Help me out here, old buddy.

335
00:52:04,772 --> 00:52:08,776
They'll stick him in some
aquarium and revoke your license.

336
00:52:18,661 --> 00:52:22,831
Good boy. Easy now.

337
00:52:23,249 --> 00:52:25,709
Slow down, guys.

338
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:34,218
You wanna come, or wait here?

339
00:52:38,514 --> 00:52:39,765
All set, Porter!

340
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:52,278
Wait!

341
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:09,503
It's okay.

342
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,470
Good boy.

343
00:53:37,865 --> 00:53:41,202
Let him down slowly.
Easy, easy!

344
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,297
Almost out of gas.

345
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,886
It's cold.

346
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:30,895
Here.
- Thanks.

347
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:02,551
Jeez!

348
00:56:40,506 --> 00:56:42,258
Let's get outta here!

349
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,150
Another day in paradise.

350
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,867
You sleep here all night?

351
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:16,417
I know you miss him.
He belongs out there.

352
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:21,839
Things seem to mess up
when you care about them.

353
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:26,802
It's like they say:
"To live is to love.

354
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:31,140
All reason's against it,
all instinct's for it."

355
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:35,227
What does that mean?
- I dunno. Read it on a calendar.

356
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:42,693
It's good to care. People who don't
wind up drooling cream spinach.

357
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,501
How come you don't have any kids?

358
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:05,799
Kids require commitment.
That's not one of my strengths.

359
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:09,220
If had a kid,
he'd might turn out like me.

360
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:12,223
Might not be bad.

361
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:17,728
He could turn out like you.
- Now that'd be a nightmare!

362
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:28,155
Special delivery.

363
00:58:30,324 --> 00:58:31,909
I got us front and center.

364
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:36,664
You're really going
to the concert? - Why not?

365
00:58:37,122 --> 00:58:40,292
I was grunge before they named it.

366
00:58:44,213 --> 00:58:47,800
Speakin' of grunge,
there's a load of dirty laundry

367
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:51,053
with your name on it. Enjoy.

368
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:08,946
What's the matter?

369
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,052
What's wrong?

370
00:59:36,515 --> 00:59:40,519
Sandy, do something!
- Hold him up, don't let him sink.

371
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,403
I'll be back.

372
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,574
How are the kids?
- They're all fine.

373
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:56,202
Come quick! He came back.

374
00:59:56,619 --> 00:59:58,829
I think he's dying.

375
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:10,174
His breathing is shallow.
He's probably dehydrated.

376
01:00:11,884 --> 01:00:13,886
Who's for pizza?

377
01:00:16,931 --> 01:00:18,098
I see a dolphin.

378
01:00:18,557 --> 01:00:22,311
The only thing keeping him alive
is a strong will to live.

379
01:00:23,312 --> 01:00:25,981
Oo you have a blender?
- Pardon?

380
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,457
What is it?
- Kind of a dolphin shake.

381
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:48,587
An emergency supply of iron, protein,
calcium, bunch of other nutrients.

382
01:00:49,004 --> 01:00:52,758
Oo you have any Jell-O?
- Jell-O?

383
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:58,222
Marshmellow cream...

384
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:00,266
Rancid...

385
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:03,602
Oead...

386
01:01:04,937 --> 01:01:06,480
How about tropical punch?

387
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:21,203
Sorry.
- No problem, I got a handy vac.

388
01:01:29,545 --> 01:01:31,839
I've seen him eat a cockroach.

389
01:01:40,848 --> 01:01:41,932
It's better from you.

390
01:01:45,603 --> 01:01:47,313
Come on, buddy.

391
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:51,567
You can do it.
Please, Flipper, just try it.

392
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:57,323
Come on.

393
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,117
That's it. There.

394
01:02:10,252 --> 01:02:11,253
Come on.

395
01:02:53,963 --> 01:02:56,674
Listen, sorry about that time
I yelled at you.

396
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:11,438
I saved you
a couple of slices, extra anchovies.

397
01:03:43,512 --> 01:03:45,598
This is quite a spread for you.

398
01:03:46,015 --> 01:03:50,978
I was going to do croissants, but
you might've had a heart attack.

399
01:03:51,937 --> 01:03:57,067
It's the thought that counts.
Like bringing someone flowers.

400
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,820
You'll do it one day.

401
01:04:00,279 --> 01:04:03,532
I bought you flowers!
- You're such a liar!

402
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:07,828
What d'ya call that?
- Weeding.

403
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,084
Here are the test results.

404
01:04:26,013 --> 01:04:30,017
I can't believe it.
He's just like a little kid.

405
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:32,895
All he wants to do is play.

406
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:35,189
Come here!

407
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:38,025
Go on!

408
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:42,613
Good boy, that's it.

409
01:04:44,365 --> 01:04:47,201
Our friend was poisoned!

410
01:04:49,245 --> 01:04:54,542
Oioxin levels are off the chart.
Another meal and he'd be glowing.

411
01:04:54,959 --> 01:05:00,005
Someone poisoned him? - Or the water,
which is why the fishing's so bad.

412
01:05:01,757 --> 01:05:05,094
Ooesn't make sense.
Nearest industry's on the mainland.

413
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:09,473
Maybe the mainland's found
a place to dump toxic garbage.

414
01:05:10,724 --> 01:05:12,601
Uh-oh...
- What now?

415
01:05:13,018 --> 01:05:16,313
The other night Kim and I
were looking for Flipper.

416
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:21,694
Oirk Moran's boat was out there.
They were tossing barrels over the side.

417
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:26,365
Oo you remember where you were?

418
01:05:26,782 --> 01:05:30,828
Oefinitely. - Can you show us?
- No problem.

419
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:35,165
This is it. Right here.
- No, it was over here.

420
01:05:35,624 --> 01:05:40,171
No, I'm positive. This is it.
- I'm telling you, I remember.

421
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:42,882
Actually, it was more this way.

422
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:48,220
No, over here. - I'm telling you...
- I know it was here somewhere.

423
01:05:49,638 --> 01:05:53,142
"Somewhere"?
Could you be more specific?

424
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:54,977
It was dark.

425
01:05:55,394 --> 01:06:00,274
Hey, I'm from Chicago.
It's not like there are street signs.

426
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:05,905
Oid you notice
the lighthouse on the way out?

427
01:06:06,906 --> 01:06:09,283
I'm pretty sure this was the spot.
- Me too.

428
01:06:09,742 --> 01:06:13,495
If you're at all right,
Oirk Moran's been dumping poison

429
01:06:13,913 --> 01:06:17,750
smack in the middle of my fishing
grounds. Let's head back.

430
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,760
We know why
the fishing's been so lousy lately.

431
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:32,556
What is it this time?
Algae blooms, el Niño, bad karma?

432
01:06:32,973 --> 01:06:36,644
Somebody's poisoning
these waters. - We may know who.

433
01:06:37,102 --> 01:06:39,897
When Flipper came back sick...
- Wait a minute!

434
01:06:40,314 --> 01:06:42,608
That dolphin's back?

435
01:06:43,692 --> 01:06:48,405
We're talking about toxic waste.
Costs big bucks to dispose of.

436
01:06:48,822 --> 01:06:52,576
If you can just dump it in the
ocean... - Look at these test results!

437
01:06:52,993 --> 01:06:58,207
I'm not interested! Bring me
hard evidence and I'll bust 'em!

438
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:03,629
Buck! - Any idea how many
marine parks I've turned away?

439
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:06,340
That animal
would be a fine attraction.

440
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:09,635
Son-of-a...
- Easy, Oirk.

441
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:17,351
If Flipper's still here on Monday,
I will see to it that he's

442
01:07:17,768 --> 01:07:19,770
jumping hoops at Sea World on Tuesday.

443
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:26,068
Still talking about that dolphin?
- No. Actually,

444
01:07:26,485 --> 01:07:30,239
we were talking about
the slime-ball who's been

445
01:07:30,656 --> 01:07:33,117
dumping toxic waste offshore.

446
01:07:34,243 --> 01:07:36,871
That explains
why fishing's been so lousy lately.

447
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:40,916
You have an active imagination.

448
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:44,336
Just yesterday,
a fella landed a marlin there,

449
01:07:44,753 --> 01:07:46,422
trophy size.

450
01:07:46,839 --> 01:07:49,717
These things happen.
Nature has its

451
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:53,429
rhythms.
The fishing'll be back.

452
01:07:53,846 --> 01:07:56,140
And you'll be the boy who cried wolf.

453
01:08:01,103 --> 01:08:03,022
Remember that dolphin.

454
01:08:09,945 --> 01:08:13,365
What did he say?
- He needs more evidence.

455
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:16,035
Like the dead fish ain't enough!

456
01:08:21,624 --> 01:08:26,587
And Flipper has to be gone by Monday.
- That gives us three days.

457
01:08:27,004 --> 01:08:30,674
For what? - To deploy our
secret weapon: Flipper.

458
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:34,136
What are you talking about?
- Project Quick Find.

459
01:08:34,553 --> 01:08:37,348
The Navy started it after Korea.

460
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:43,270
They trained dolphins to find things
like missiles. It was top secret.

461
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,941
How do you know about it?
- Part-time work.

462
01:08:47,358 --> 01:08:50,778
You didn't tell me. - You never told
me about whatshername at the marina.

463
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:54,698
That was years ago.
How d'ya know about that?

464
01:08:55,991 --> 01:08:58,202
Cast off. We got work to do.

465
01:08:58,661 --> 01:09:01,747
Sandy, come up on the bow.
- Hey, Sandy.

466
01:09:02,164 --> 01:09:04,291
We could miss that concert.
- What concert?

467
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:12,049
Microphone?
Nitrox, pressure gauge?

468
01:09:12,466 --> 01:09:15,094
GPS...
- Nitric oxide,

469
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:18,138
ATP, dramomine...

470
01:09:21,016 --> 01:09:23,561
Seasickness.
- I don't need this. - Sandy,

471
01:09:23,978 --> 01:09:26,105
never hurl in front of a woman.

472
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:30,776
Thanks.
- Something to live by.

473
01:09:35,364 --> 01:09:36,365
Nice outfit!

474
01:09:40,744 --> 01:09:41,745
Figures.

475
01:09:46,959 --> 01:09:48,836
Wait for me!

476
01:10:37,843 --> 01:10:41,430
Porter, can you help Marvin
set up the computer?

477
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:46,185
Computer? No problem.
What are you gonna do?

478
01:10:47,061 --> 01:10:49,063
I'm command central.

479
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,859
I'm keeping track of Flipper.
Tell me when the grunt work's done.

480
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:57,947
Grunt work?
We both know I'm good at that...

481
01:11:00,241 --> 01:11:04,578
Sandy, make sure Flipper's ready.
Kim, you spot. Marv, this is for you.

482
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:10,960
Flipper's secret is
echo-location. - Echo what?

483
01:11:11,377 --> 01:11:17,466
Oolphin sonar. Flipper sends a beam
of sound and receives an echo back.

484
01:11:17,883 --> 01:11:20,177
He's good at that.
- Like a dog.

485
01:11:20,594 --> 01:11:24,890
Instead of using his nose,
he uses his... echo... thing.

486
01:11:27,142 --> 01:11:30,813
Exactly.
The Navy took it one step further.

487
01:11:37,236 --> 01:11:41,907
Come in, Central Command. We're in
spashdown area, awaiting orders.

488
01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:46,912
Copy that. Send Flipper
when the ball is secure. Over.

489
01:11:47,329 --> 01:11:49,790
Go on, boy. Find it!

490
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:15,274
Negative on station 1.

491
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:20,029
Proceed to next station.

492
01:12:20,446 --> 01:12:25,326
I love all this Navy talk.
You still have your old uniform?

493
01:12:37,755 --> 01:12:40,049
Guppy says negative on station four.

494
01:12:41,926 --> 01:12:43,177
Oamn.

495
01:12:43,636 --> 01:12:46,722
Negative on station 15.

496
01:13:26,387 --> 01:13:29,473
We must have
searched the whole ocean by now.

497
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:35,855
We should come back tomorrow.

498
01:13:37,857 --> 01:13:40,818
This Martha Stewart's a clever woman.

499
01:13:41,235 --> 01:13:45,948
She's made curtains out of fishing
nets. That'd work at my place.

500
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:54,331
I think
you really need to get a life.

501
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,640
It's just sea swells.

502
01:14:32,661 --> 01:14:35,497
I think he found something.

503
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,376
Hey, look!

504
01:14:47,426 --> 01:14:50,763
What's happening?
- He found something. What now?

505
01:14:51,388 --> 01:14:55,226
It's time for
the "Flippo-Cam". - The "Flippo-Cam"?

506
01:15:00,648 --> 01:15:02,942
You made this?

507
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:06,403
You're starting to scare me.

508
01:15:36,892 --> 01:15:38,352
Giant squid astern!

509
01:15:39,728 --> 01:15:40,729
Marv, I...

510
01:15:47,236 --> 01:15:48,696
I don't see anything.

511
01:16:09,466 --> 01:16:11,468
I bet that's his family.

512
01:16:48,088 --> 01:16:49,089
POISON

513
01:16:49,548 --> 01:16:52,676
Oh my God!
- Gross.

514
01:16:53,093 --> 01:16:55,471
HAZAROOUS WASTE

515
01:17:04,563 --> 01:17:09,318
We better get hold of old Buck!
- Buck? Try the coastguard.

516
01:17:09,735 --> 01:17:12,029
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.

517
01:17:14,615 --> 01:17:16,992
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.

518
01:17:22,248 --> 01:17:23,249
Gotcha!

519
01:17:25,376 --> 01:17:29,755
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.
It's not working.

520
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,639
What happened?

521
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:42,351
Marvin, what's wrong?

522
01:17:59,451 --> 01:18:03,038
That'll send a signal
so we can find the spot again.

523
01:18:05,165 --> 01:18:08,502
I'm not going without Flipper.
- This isn't the time.

524
01:19:58,654 --> 01:20:01,198
This is Porter Ricks.
Anyone out there?

525
01:20:02,491 --> 01:20:03,826
Hey, Marv.

526
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,954
Where's Sandy?

527
01:20:10,207 --> 01:20:11,208
Oh my gosh.

528
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:12,668
Mr. Ricks!

529
01:20:13,878 --> 01:20:16,589
Alright, Buck...
- Sandy's gone. - Not now...

530
01:20:17,006 --> 01:20:18,340
Buck, I...

531
01:20:20,342 --> 01:20:21,260
Oh God.

532
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,235
Scar!

533
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:58,214
No!

534
01:21:09,934 --> 01:21:11,685
Help!

535
01:21:42,925 --> 01:21:45,302
Come on, swim!

536
01:22:19,003 --> 01:22:22,506
That a boy, come on. You're safe.

537
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:27,845
That's one courageous little dolphin.

538
01:22:30,097 --> 01:22:32,183
Too bad you saw us that night, son.

539
01:22:47,615 --> 01:22:49,700
Thanks buddy!

540
01:22:50,117 --> 01:22:52,494
That's a good boy!

541
01:23:06,175 --> 01:23:08,385
You alright?
- I'm fine.

542
01:23:08,844 --> 01:23:11,514
Thank God.
Your mother would have killed me.

543
01:23:13,057 --> 01:23:17,853
You remember that story about Scar?
- Yeah. - It's true.

544
01:23:23,526 --> 01:23:24,985
Thanks.

545
01:23:27,154 --> 01:23:28,155
You're welcome.

546
01:23:33,369 --> 01:23:38,165
Get that piece of sea slime
out of here. - Let's go.

547
01:23:38,582 --> 01:23:41,752
I don't think we got it in time.
EPA's on the way.

548
01:23:42,545 --> 01:23:46,298
Oon't worry. We'll clean these
waters up, thanks to Flipper.

549
01:23:47,883 --> 01:23:50,553
What about Flipper?
He saved my life.

550
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:52,930
How about it, Buck?

551
01:23:57,643 --> 01:24:00,813
As long as he's free,
he can make this his home.

552
01:24:04,525 --> 01:24:06,902
We'll have him looking out for us.

553
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:09,947
How about it, Sandy?

554
01:24:22,084 --> 01:24:27,214
He should go. - What?
- He belongs with his family.

555
01:24:41,937 --> 01:24:43,480
What is it?

556
01:24:49,069 --> 01:24:51,822
No, I can't come.

557
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:57,328
Go on, it's okay.

558
01:25:06,795 --> 01:25:07,796
Please!

559
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:11,467
Just go!

560
01:26:51,984 --> 01:26:53,360
Hi Mom!

561
01:26:55,487 --> 01:26:56,947
Hey bud!

562
01:26:58,115 --> 01:27:00,659
How was your summer?
- It was a total blast.

563
01:27:01,118 --> 01:27:02,912
A total blast, huh?

564
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:07,541
I can't wait to hear about it.

565
01:27:17,259 --> 01:27:18,344
See ya around, Marv.

566
01:27:20,346 --> 01:27:23,015
What's the matter?

567
01:27:26,143 --> 01:27:28,437
He'll be back. You'll see.

568
01:27:33,609 --> 01:27:35,819
Gonna miss you.

569
01:27:36,237 --> 01:27:37,947
I'll miss you too.

570
01:27:43,661 --> 01:27:46,705
Gimme a sec?
- Come on, let's go on the boat.

571
01:27:50,835 --> 01:27:53,212
Gonna miss me?

572
01:28:03,264 --> 01:28:05,307
Bye.
- Bye.

573
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:14,149
Take it easy, kid.
- All aboard!

574
01:28:21,532 --> 01:28:23,659
Bye.
- Take care.

575
01:28:39,842 --> 01:28:40,843
Wait!

576
01:28:43,721 --> 01:28:47,850
I forgot one thing.
Can I come back next summer?

577
01:28:49,685 --> 01:28:52,980
I think you'd better. I just made
a deal for 150 pound of spam.

578
01:28:58,569 --> 01:28:59,945
Go on, get!

579
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:26,055
There!

580
01:29:27,681 --> 01:29:29,308
Hey, check it out!

581
01:29:32,895 --> 01:29:34,605
Hey, come on, guys!

582
01:29:35,305 --> 01:30:35,789
