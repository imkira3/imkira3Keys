1
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,522
So you want me to tell
you the story of my life.

2
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,109
Like I said, that's what I do.
I interview people.

3
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,861
I'm a collector of lives.

4
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,696
FM radio, KFRC.

5
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,365
You'll need a lot of tape for my story.

6
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,118
No problem. I got a bag full of tape.

7
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,538
You followed me here, didn't you?

8
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah, I suppose I did.

9
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,459
You seemed very interesting.

10
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,379
This is where you live?

11
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,797
No.

12
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,549
It's just a room.

13
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,387
What do you say we get started?

14
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,892
What do you do?

15
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,643
I'm a vampire.

16
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,732
I haven't heard that before.

17
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,484
You mean this literally, I take it?

18
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,069
Absolutely.

19
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,239
I was waiting for you in that alley.

20
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,658
Watching you watching me.

21
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,494
And then you began to speak.

22
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,664
What a lucky break for me.

23
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,750
Perhaps lucky for both of us.

24
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,839
You said you were...

25
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,674
...waiting for me.

26
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,345
What were you going to do?
Kill me, drink my blood?

27
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,596
Yes.

28
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,766
But you needn't be concerned now.

29
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,522
You really believe this, don't you,
that you're a vampire?

30
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,191
We can't begin this way.

31
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,109
Let me turn on the light.

32
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,197
- I thought vampires didn't like light.
- We love it.

33
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,784
I only wanted to prepare you.

34
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,120
Christ!

35
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,956
Don't be frightened.

36
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,625
I want this opportunity.

37
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,877
How the hell did you do that?

38
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,546
The same as you do.

39
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,549
A series of simple gestures.

40
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,134
Only I moved too fast for you to see.

41
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,054
I'm flesh and blood...

42
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,806
...but not human.

43
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,476
I haven't been human for 200 years.

44
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,479
Please...

45
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,990
How can I put you at ease?

46
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,993
Shall we begin like '"David Copperfield'"?

47
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,327
'"I am born...

48
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,704
'"...I grew up. '"

49
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,918
Or shall we begin when I was
born to darkness, as I call it.

50
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,173
That's where we should start,
don't you think?

51
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,260
You're not lying, are you?

52
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,013
Why should I lie?

53
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,392
1791 was the year it happened.

54
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,191
I was 24.

55
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,443
Younger than you are now.

56
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,197
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.

57
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,451
The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.

58
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,207
I had lost my wife in childbirth.

59
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,627
She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.

60
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,963
I would've been happy to join them.

61
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,968
I couldn't bear the pain of their loss.

62
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,721
I longed to be released from it.

63
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,486
I wanted to lose it all:

64
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,154
my wealth...

65
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,323
...my estate...

66
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,408
...my sanity.

67
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,585
How many aces are in a deck?

68
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,838
Are you calling me a cheat?

69
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,760
No, I'm calling you a piece of stinking offal!

70
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,269
You lack the courage of your convictions.
Do it!

71
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,772
Most of all, I longed for death.

72
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,691
I know that now.

73
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,026
I invited it.

74
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,530
A release from the pain of living.

75
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,470
My invitation was open to anyone.

76
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,390
To the whore at my side.

77
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,560
To the pimp that followed.

78
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,732
But it was a vampire that accepted.

79
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,093
Give me your money or you die!

80
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,630
Do you still want death?

81
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,966
Or have you tasted it enough?

82
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,300
Enough.

83
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,063
He left me there, on the banks
of the Mississippi...

84
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,234
...somewhere between life and death.

85
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,338
Who are you?
What're you doing in my house?

86
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,884
I've come to answer your prayers.

87
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,763
Life has no meaning anymore... does it?

88
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,895
The wine has no taste.

89
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,063
The food sickens you.

90
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:08,150
There seems no reason for any of it...
does there?

91
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,699
What if I could give it back to you?

92
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,618
Pluck out the pain...

93
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,745
...and give you another life?

94
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,706
One you could never imagine.

95
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,876
And it would be... for all time.

96
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,588
And sickness...

97
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,256
...and death...

98
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,759
...could never touch you again.

99
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,929
Don't be afraid.

100
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,224
I'm going to give you the choice...

101
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,391
...l...

102
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,227
...never had.

103
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,239
That morning, I was not yet a vampire...

104
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,242
...and I saw my last sunrise.

105
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,245
I remember it completely...

106
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,290
...and yet I can't recall
any sunrise before it.

107
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:11,255
I watched the whole magnificence
of the dawn for the last time...

108
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,257
...as if it were the first.

109
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,930
And then I said farewell to sunlight...

110
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,057
...and set out to become...

111
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,183
...what I became.

112
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,623
Have you said your good-byes to the light?

113
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,522
I've drained you...

114
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,816
...to the point of death.

115
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,028
If I leave you here...

116
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,529
...you'll die.

117
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,615
Or...

118
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,869
...you can be young always, my friend...

119
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,872
...as we are now.

120
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,334
But you must tell me...

121
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,294
...will you come...

122
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,504
...or no?

123
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,675
Yes.

124
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,390
Yes.

125
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,622
Your body's dying.

126
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,583
Pay no attention.

127
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,127
It happens to us all.

128
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,408
Now look...

129
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,827
...with your vampire eyes.

130
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,805
What did you see?

131
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,808
No words can describe it.

132
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,979
Might as well ask Heaven what it sees.

133
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,856
No human can know.

134
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,985
The statue seemed to move, but didn't.

135
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,489
The world had changed,
yet stayed the same.

136
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,828
I was a newborn vampire,
weeping at the beauty of the night.

137
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,877
Perhaps you'd like another cigarette?

138
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,840
I would. It's not bothering you, is it?

139
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:27,010
I don't assume it would.
It's not like you'll die from cancer.

140
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,346
I don't think so.

141
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,725
- What about crucifixes?
- Crucifixes?

142
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,853
Can you look at them?

143
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,939
Actually, I'm quite fond of
looking at crucifixes.

144
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,900
And the stake through the heart?

145
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,193
Nonsense.

146
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,570
And coffins?

147
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,864
Coffins.

148
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,741
Coffins, unfortunately, are a necessity.

149
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,745
Don't worry.

150
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,914
Soon...

151
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,877
...you'll be sleeping as
soundly as you've ever slept.

152
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,422
And when you awake...

153
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,383
...l'll be waiting for you...

154
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,761
...and so will all the world.

155
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,732
Blood, I was to find,
was a necessity as well.

156
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,612
I awoke the next evening with
a hunger I had never felt.

157
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,407
Once you taste this...

158
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,744
...you'll never go to another tavern again.

159
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,913
You think so?

160
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,958
But what if I'd rather taste your lips?

161
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,086
My lips are even sweeter still.

162
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,312
My friend...

163
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,273
...should taste those lips.

164
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,608
Is his...

165
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,984
...kiss...

166
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,361
...as deep...

167
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,946
...as yours?

168
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,990
Deeper, ma chérie.

169
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,484
I will not take her life.

170
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,362
I've done it for you.

171
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,700
She's dead...

172
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,036
...as a doornail, my friend.

173
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,547
It's so easy, you almost feel sorry for them.

174
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,889
You'll get used to killing.

175
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,641
Just forget about that mortal coil.

176
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,061
You'll become accustomed to it,
all too quickly.

177
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,487
Are you not hungry?

178
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,323
Au contraire, ma chérie.

179
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,408
He could eat the whole colony.

180
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,512
I will finish it.

181
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,846
Now leave us.

182
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,689
Can't you pretend, you fool?

183
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,359
Don't give the game away.

184
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,861
We're lucky to have such a home.

185
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,123
Pretend to drink, at least.

186
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,631
Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste.

187
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,070
I know.

188
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,322
It gets cold so quickly.

189
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,241
We can live like this?

190
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,826
On animal blood?

191
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,163
I wouldn't call it living. Call it surviving.

192
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:07,416
Useful trick if you're on a ship for a month.

193
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,088
There's nothing in the world
now that doesn't hold some...

194
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,506
Fascination.

195
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:16,675
Yes.

196
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,013
- I'm bored with this prattle.
- We can live without killing.

197
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,347
It's possible.

198
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,099
Anything is possible.

199
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,185
But just try it for a week.

200
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:31,106
Come into New Orleans and let
me show you some real sport.

201
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,620
Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night.

202
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,206
A fresh young girl...

203
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:50,250
...was his favorite for
the first of the evening.

204
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:54,463
For seconds, he preferred a gilded,
beautiful youth.

205
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,468
But the snob in him
loved to hunt in society.

206
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:03,305
The blood of the aristocrat
thrilled him best of all.

207
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,059
The trick is not to think about it.

208
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,810
You see that one?

209
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,395
Widow St. Clair.

210
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:14,733
She had that gorgeous young fop
murder her husband.

211
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,527
How do you know?

212
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,488
Read her thoughts.

213
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,492
Read her thoughts.

214
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,666
I can't.

215
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,087
The '"dark gift'" is different for each of us.

216
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,591
But one thing is true of everyone.
We grow stronger as we go along.

217
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,511
Just take my word for it.

218
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,181
She blamed a slave for his murder.

219
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,433
Imagine what they did to him.

220
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,271
Evil-doers are easier, and they taste better.

221
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:25,804
Where are we going?

222
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,563
Nowhere.

223
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,817
Now, young man, you really amaze me!

224
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,823
I'm old enough to be your grandmother.

225
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,423
Oh, yes, that's the melody.

226
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,592
I remember it.

227
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,189
Murderer!

228
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,024
My little Papillion’s!

229
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,610
My butterflies, he killed them!

230
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,949
You... whining coward of a vampire...

231
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,702
...who prowls killing rats and poodles!
You could've finished us!

232
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,871
You've condemned me to Hell!

233
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,581
I don't know any Hell.

234
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,380
That's more like it!

235
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,965
Anger! Fury!

236
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,717
That's why I chose you!

237
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:53,475
But you can't kill me, Louis.

238
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,567
Feed...

239
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,902
...on what you will.

240
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:06,238
Rats, chickens...

241
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,573
...poodles.

242
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,492
I'll leave you to it...

243
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,911
...and watch you come around.

244
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:14,246
Remember:

245
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,748
Life without me...

246
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,584
...would be even more...

247
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,085
...unbearable.

248
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,146
Consider yourself lucky.

249
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:25,400
In Paris, a vampire must be
clever for many reasons.

250
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,402
Paris?

251
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:30,572
Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.

252
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,242
You came from Paris?

253
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,744
As did the one who made me.

254
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:40,833
Tell me about him.
You must've learned something from him.

255
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,420
I learned absolutely nothing.

256
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:49,174
I wasn't given a choice, remember?

257
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,427
You must know something
about the meaning of it all.

258
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:55,264
Why? Why should I know these things?

259
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,932
Do you know them?

260
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,350
That noise...

261
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,519
...it's driving me mad!

262
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:03,939
We've been here for weeks
with nothing but that noise!

263
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:05,691
They know about us.

264
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:09,778
They watch us dine on empty plates
and drink from empty glasses.

265
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:11,697
Come...

266
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,615
...to New Orleans then.

267
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:17,619
The Paris Opera's in town.
We can try some French...

268
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,121
...cuisine.

269
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,958
Forgive me if I have a
lingering respect for life.

270
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,046
You'll soon run out of chickens, Louis.

271
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,539
Monsieur Louis?

272
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,000
You don't want any supper?

273
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,003
No, ma chérie.

274
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,173
We're worried about you, Master.

275
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:15,928
When is it that you go riding in the field?

276
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,307
And how long since you've
been to the slave quarter?

277
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,270
Everywhere there is death.

278
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:30,275
Are you still our master at all?

279
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,361
That will be all, Yvette.

280
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,781
I will not go unless you listen to me.

281
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:40,118
You must send away this friend of yours.

282
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,789
The slaves are all frightened of him...

283
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:47,543
...and they are frightened of you.

284
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:55,133
I'm frightened of myself.

285
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,184
Hear me now!

286
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,603
This place is cursed!

287
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,104
Damned!

288
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,024
And, yes, your master is the Devil!

289
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,694
Get out while you can! You're all free!

290
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,529
Do you hear me?

291
00:28:58,614 --> 00:28:59,698
Run!

292
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:00,741
Run!

293
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,951
Save yourselves!

294
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,252
Perfect! Perfect!

295
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:57,089
Just burn the place!
Burn everything we own!

296
00:29:57,214 --> 00:29:59,800
Have us living in a field, like cattle!

297
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,094
You thought you could have it all.

298
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:03,679
Shut up, Louis!

299
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:06,265
Come on!

300
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,871
Where are we?

301
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:32,374
Where do you think, my idiot friend?

302
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,043
We're in a nice, filthy cemetery.

303
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:37,379
Are you happy?

304
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:40,048
Is this fitting? Proper enough?

305
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,467
We belong in Hell.

306
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,386
What if there is no Hell?

307
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:47,681
Or they don't want us there?
Ever think of that?

308
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,476
But there was a Hell.

309
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,230
And no matter where we moved to,
I was in it.

310
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:59,902
We rented rooms on the
waterfront of New Orleans.

311
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:03,489
Your skin is icy.

312
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,595
Your friend has no head for wine.

313
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,434
Don't worry.

314
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:36,730
I can warm that cold skin of
yours better than she can.

315
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:38,273
Do you think so?

316
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:40,776
Why...

317
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,903
...you're warm now!

318
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,281
But the price is high.

319
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,951
Your pretty friend, I exhausted her.

320
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,039
Soft.

321
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,626
So soft.

322
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,256
I can see you lying on a bed of satin.

323
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:05,425
Such things you say.

324
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,054
Do you know what manner of bed?

325
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,000
Should we put out the light?

326
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,841
And then put out the light.

327
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,608
But once I've put out thy light...

328
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,611
...I cannot...

329
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,364
...give it vital breath again.

330
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,202
Its needs must wither.

331
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,882
For you, Louis.

332
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,884
You can pretend it's wine.

333
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,270
She's not dead!

334
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:44,316
You're in love with your mortal nature.
You resist what can bring you peace.

335
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,776
You call this peace?

336
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:49,655
We're predators, whose all-seeing
eyes give them detachment!

337
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:52,491
- The girl, Lestat!
- Take her! End that hunger!

338
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:53,575
No!

339
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,917
Now, my child.

340
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,255
You're tired, you want to sleep!

341
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:17,391
It's a coffin!

342
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:19,268
A coffin! Let me out!

343
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,562
I'm not dead!

344
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:26,275
It's your coffin, enjoy it. Most of us
never get to know what it feels like.

345
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:27,943
Why do you do this?

346
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:32,739
I like to do it. I enjoy it.
Take your aesthete's taste to purer things.

347
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,784
Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it!

348
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:38,704
For do not doubt you are a killer, Louis!

349
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,589
- What's that?
- It's a coffin.

350
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,633
So it is. You must be dead.

351
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,970
I'm not dead, am I?

352
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:56,638
You're not dead.

353
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:57,973
Not yet.

354
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,808
Finish this now!

355
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:01,143
You finish it!

356
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:02,936
Save me from him!

357
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:04,229
Save me!

358
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,816
You'll let me go?

359
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,444
I can't die like this!

360
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,070
I need a priest.

361
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:15,032
My friend is a priest.
He'll hear your sins before you die.

362
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,159
Unless... I make her one of us.

363
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,243
No!

364
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:22,331
Then take her, Louis, end her suffering!
End yours!

365
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:24,458
No!

366
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,020
Now...

367
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:47,022
...are you happy?

368
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,361
My God!

369
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,989
To think you...

370
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,492
...are all I have to learn from.

371
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,039
In the Old World...

372
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,543
...they called it the '"dark gift. '"

373
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,381
And I gave it to you.

374
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:37,322
Don't go that way, Monsieur.
It's the plague.

375
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,909
- Go back the way you came!
- The way I came...

376
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:57,384
Mama.

377
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,452
Please help us.

378
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,121
Papa left us and didn't come back.

379
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:36,590
Please, wake Mama, Monsieur.

380
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:06,119
My philosopher. My martyr.

381
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:08,664
'"Never take a human life. '"

382
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,668
This calls for a celebration.

383
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:25,138
There's still life in the old lady yet.

384
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:29,935
Come back!

385
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:32,312
You are what you are!

386
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,316
Merciful death.

387
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,862
How you love your precious guilt.

388
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,456
Her blood coursed in my veins...

389
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,500
...sweeter than life itself.

390
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:56,086
And, as it did, Lestat's words
made sense to me.

391
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,088
I knew peace only when I killed.

392
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:02,885
When I heard her heart in that terrible
rhythm, I knew what peace could be.

393
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:40,881
All I need to find you, Louis,
is follow the corpses of rats.

394
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:51,099
Pain is terrible for you.

395
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:56,104
You feel it like no other creature,
because you're a vampire.

396
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:00,067
You don't want it to go on.

397
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,318
No.

398
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:08,116
Then do what it is in your nature to do...

399
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:11,912
...and you will feel as you felt
with that child in your arms.

400
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,916
Evil is a point of view.

401
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,919
God kills indiscriminately...

402
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,964
...and so shall we.

403
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:27,761
For no creatures under God are as we are.
None so like Him...

404
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,221
...as ourselves.

405
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:33,809
I have a gift for you.

406
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,562
Come.

407
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:41,483
Please.

408
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,124
- She's here.
- What are you saying?

409
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,169
You need...

410
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,129
...company...

411
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,423
...more congenial than mine.

412
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:11,513
Remember how you wanted her?

413
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,141
The taste of her?

414
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:18,145
I thought I'd killed her.

415
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,524
Don't worry.

416
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,153
Your conscience is clear.

417
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,375
Claudia.

418
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:48,884
Listen to me.

419
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,553
You're ill, my precious.

420
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:56,016
And I'm going to give you
what you need to get well.

421
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:09,571
No.

422
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,199
You want her to die then?

423
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,091
That's it. Yes.

424
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:44,439
Stop!

425
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,277
Stop!

426
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:49,945
Enough!

427
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:30,986
I want some more.

428
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,655
Of course you want more.

429
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,187
Gently, chérie.

430
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,190
They're so innocent.

431
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,693
They must not be made to suffer.

432
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,196
Good.

433
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,658
Yes.

434
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:19,326
All right, now.

435
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:20,661
Stop.

436
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:25,207
That's enough, chérie.

437
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:28,168
You must stop before the heart stops.

438
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:30,671
I want more.

439
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:32,089
I know.

440
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,550
But it's best in the beginning...

441
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:37,511
...lest the Death takes you down with it.

442
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,722
You've done very well. Look at you.

443
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,350
Not a drop spilt. Very good.

444
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,563
Where is Mama?

445
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,860
Mama's gone...

446
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:56,530
...to Heaven, chérie, like that sweet lady...
right there.

447
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,533
They all go to Heaven.

448
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,577
All but us.

449
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:05,080
Do you want to frighten our daughter?

450
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:06,832
I'm not your daughter.

451
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:08,542
Oh, yes, you are.

452
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:11,336
You're my and Louis' daughter now.

453
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:14,423
You see, Louis was going to leave us.

454
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:17,384
He was going to go away.

455
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,887
But now he's not.

456
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,598
Now he's going to stay...

457
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:24,600
...and make you happy.

458
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:28,061
Louis.

459
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:35,611
You fiend.

460
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:37,696
One happy family.

461
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:49,708
He did it to make you stay with him?

462
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,251
Perhaps.

463
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:55,631
He knew me. He knew I would love
her more than the waking world.

464
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,426
But there was more to it.

465
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:03,472
He lavished affection on her,
there is no doubt about that.

466
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:08,810
Perhaps, in the end,
he did it because he was lonely too.

467
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:11,897
- I need more light.
- She needs more light.

468
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,691
- I'll go blind without another lamp.
- She'll go blind.

469
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:17,236
Or let me fit this child during the day.

470
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:21,114
Well, I am afraid, madame,
that my days are sacrosanct.

471
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:24,660
A little child, she was.

472
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:26,787
But also a fierce killer...

473
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:31,834
...now capable of the ruthless pursuit
of blood with all a child's demanding.

474
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:35,295
Let me kiss it better.

475
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:50,310
Now...

476
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:54,523
...who will we get to finish your dress?
Be practical!

477
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,984
Remember, never in our home!

478
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,654
She slept in my coffin at first...

479
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:03,699
...curling her little fingers around my hair...

480
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:06,618
...till the day when she
wanted her own coffin.

481
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:16,670
But still, whenever she awoke...

482
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:18,839
...she would crawl into mine.

483
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:33,812
They died fast in those days, before,
she learned to play with them...

484
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:37,316
...to delay the moment till
she had taken what she wanted.

485
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:53,332
Why are you crying, child?

486
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:55,167
Are you lost, my love?

487
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:56,919
Mama!

488
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:00,005
Hush, now, don't cry.

489
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:01,840
We'll find her.

490
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,434
Mind the thumb, girl. Mind the thumb.
That little digit.

491
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:29,284
They're expensive, my dear.

492
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:34,122
Maybe too expensive for
a young girl like you.

493
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:50,055
Claudia! What have we told you!

494
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:52,558
Never in the house.

495
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,311
Give me some room.

496
00:48:57,646 --> 00:48:59,398
To me, she was a child.

497
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:01,984
But to Lestat, a pupil...

498
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:05,654
...an infant prodigy with
a lust for killing like his own.

499
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:09,324
Together, they finished off whole families.

500
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:18,083
Wonderful, wonderful.

501
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:21,086
Now try something
on a more somber note.

502
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:37,853
Time can pass quickly for
mortals when they're happy.

503
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:40,022
With us, it was the same.

504
00:49:40,189 --> 00:49:43,525
The years flew by like minutes.
The city grew.

505
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:45,861
Sailboats gave way to steamships...

506
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:49,865
...disgorging an endless menu
of magnificent strangers.

507
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:53,035
A new world had sprung up around us.

508
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:55,454
And we were all Americans now.

509
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,631
This filthy modern tide!

510
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:10,385
What I wouldn't give for a drop
of old-fashioned Creole blood!

511
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,888
Yankees are not to your taste?

512
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:16,642
Their Democratic flavor
doesn't suit my palate, Louis.

513
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:37,246
Now that is pure Creole.

514
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:43,252
Trust Claudia to have found her.

515
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:47,005
What?

516
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,258
Don't you want her?

517
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:51,468
I want to be her.

518
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:55,013
Can I?

519
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:56,765
Be like her one day?

520
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:04,690
More melancholy nonsense.
You grow more like Louis daily!

521
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:06,692
Soon you'll be eating rats.

522
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:11,113
Rats? When did you eat rats, Louis?

523
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:13,991
It was a long, long time ago.

524
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:15,701
Before you were born.

525
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:18,871
And I don't recommend them.

526
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:26,211
Thirty years had passed, yet her body
remained that of an eternal child.

527
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:31,633
Her eyes alone told the story of her age,
staring from under her curls...

528
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,218
...with a questioning...

529
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,804
...that would one day need an answer.

530
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:47,065
Another doll.

531
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:49,401
I have dozens, you realize.

532
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,529
I thought you could use one more.

533
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,407
Why always on this night?

534
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:58,076
What do you mean?

535
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:01,413
You always give me a doll on
the same night of the year.

536
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:04,833
I didn't realize.

537
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,835
Is this my birthday?

538
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:13,258
You dress me like a doll.

539
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,677
You make my hair like a doll.

540
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:16,762
Why?

541
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:20,557
Some of these, Claudia, are so old...

542
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:22,351
...tattered.

543
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,438
- You should throw them away.
- I will, then!

544
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:41,286
What have you done?

545
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:43,455
What you told me to do!

546
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:46,583
- You leave a corpse here to rot?
- I wanted her!

547
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:49,086
- I wanted to be her!
- She's mad!

548
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:51,880
She pollutes the very house we live in!

549
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:55,801
Do you want me to be a doll forever?

550
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:58,136
Don't!

551
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,472
Why not? Can't I change...

552
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,266
...like everyone else?

553
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,419
Which one of you did it?

554
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:33,005
Which one of you did it?

555
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:35,841
Which one of you made me the way I am?

556
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:37,426
What you are?

557
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:41,013
A vampire gone insane,
that pollutes its own bed!

558
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,015
And if I cut my hair again?

559
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,017
It will grow back again.

560
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:46,852
But it wasn't always so!

561
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:49,688
I had a mother once.
And Louis, he had a wife.

562
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,024
He was mortal, same as she.

563
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:54,026
And so was I!

564
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:55,944
You made us what we are!

565
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:57,529
Stop her.

566
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:59,239
Did you do it to me?

567
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:07,706
How did you do it?

568
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:10,042
And why should I tell you?

569
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:12,669
It's in my power.

570
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:15,047
Why yours alone?

571
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:16,965
Tell me how it was done!

572
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:18,550
Be glad...

573
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:20,802
...I made you what you are.

574
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:24,223
You'd be dead now if I hadn't.

575
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:27,226
Like that damned corpse!
Now get rid of it!

576
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:29,394
You get rid of it.

577
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:42,074
Louis, why?

578
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:44,326
You've got to tell me.

579
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,501
You see the old woman?

580
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,587
That will never happen to you.

581
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,423
You will never grow old.

582
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:00,843
And you will never die.

583
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:06,014
And it means something else too,
doesn't it?

584
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:12,020
I shall never, ever grow up.

585
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:18,443
I hate him.

586
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:24,241
Tell me how it came to be that I am this...

587
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,243
...thing.

588
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:35,294
For thirty years I'd avoided that place.

589
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:39,298
Yet I found my way back there...

590
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:42,259
...with hardly an upward glance.

591
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,151
You...

592
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:00,986
...fed on me?

593
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:02,571
Yes.

594
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:06,325
And he found me with you.

595
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,830
Then he cut his wrist
and fed you from him...

596
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:14,291
...and you were a vampire then...

597
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,002
...and have been every night thereafter.

598
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:22,090
You both did it.

599
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,510
I took your life.

600
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:28,931
He gave you another one.

601
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,518
And here it is.

602
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:34,436
I hate you both.

603
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:48,867
I walked all night.

604
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:52,454
I walked as I walked years before...

605
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:55,958
...when my mind swam with guilt
at the thought of killing.

606
00:56:57,209 --> 00:57:01,463
I thought of all the things
I'd done and couldn't undo.

607
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:04,967
And I longed for one second's peace.

608
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:16,728
Locked together in hatred.

609
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:23,652
But I can't hate you, Louis.

610
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:31,994
Louis, my love.

611
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,914
I was mortal till you...

612
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,751
...gave me your immortal kiss.

613
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,590
You became my mother and my father.

614
00:57:46,175 --> 00:57:48,510
And so I'm yours forever.

615
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:53,265
But now it's time to end it, Louis.

616
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,102
Now it's time to leave him.

617
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:02,941
He will never let us go.

618
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:15,954
Really?

619
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:30,969
What is it now? You irritate me.
Your very presence...

620
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,221
...irritates me!

621
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:33,722
Does it?

622
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:37,226
I found someone who'll be a
vampire better than you both!

623
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:39,520
Is that supposed to frighten me?

624
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:43,565
You're spoiled,
because you're an only child.

625
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,651
You need a brother.

626
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:47,736
Or I do.

627
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,239
I'm weary of you both.

628
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:53,909
I suppose we could people
the world with vampires...

629
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:55,661
...the three of us.

630
00:58:56,453 --> 00:58:57,996
Oh, not you...

631
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,957
...my little Claudia.

632
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:02,000
You're a liar.

633
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,003
But you upset my plans.

634
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:07,965
What plans?

635
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:10,843
I came to make peace with you.

636
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:14,012
Even though you're the father of lies...

637
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,099
...I want things to be as they were.

638
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:20,018
Stop pestering me then.

639
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,858
I must do more than that.

640
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:28,902
I've brought a present for you.

641
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:32,865
Then I hope it's...

642
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:34,741
...a beautiful woman...

643
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,287
...with endowments you'll never possess.

644
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,625
Why do you say such things?

645
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:54,511
You haven't fed enough.

646
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,139
I can tell by your color.

647
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:05,147
Come and see.

648
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:23,832
Don't be angry with me.

649
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,627
When I saw them,
I knew they were for you.

650
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:29,213
Drunk...

651
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:32,633
...on Brandywine. A thimbleful.

652
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:43,143
You certainly have...

653
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,853
...outdone yourself.

654
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,233
I promise I'll get rid of the bodies.

655
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:04,873
We forgive each other then?

656
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:07,584
Yes.

657
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,393
Absinthe?

658
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:29,022
You've given them absinthe?

659
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:30,399
No.

660
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:31,900
Laudanum.

661
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:34,486
Laudanum.

662
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:35,696
Yes.

663
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,448
It killed them, unfortunately.

664
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:41,201
But it keeps the blood warm.

665
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:46,957
You let me drink...

666
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,544
...dead blood?

667
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:52,796
You let me...

668
01:01:52,963 --> 01:01:54,173
...drink...

669
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:57,426
One lesson you taught me...

670
01:01:57,551 --> 01:01:59,511
...never drink from the dead.

671
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:04,308
Put me in my coffin.

672
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:06,143
Put me in my coffin.

673
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,145
I'll put you in your coffin!

674
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:14,234
My God!

675
01:02:31,752 --> 01:02:33,253
Lift me up!

676
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:49,853
Good night, sweet prince.

677
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:55,275
May flights of devils wing you to your rest.

678
01:02:56,985 --> 01:02:58,695
Should we burn him?

679
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:00,113
Bury him?

680
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:02,199
What would he have liked?

681
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:07,371
The swamp?

682
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:32,813
He belongs with those reptiles.

683
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:37,151
He deserved to die.

684
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:41,155
Then perhaps so do we,
every night of our lives.

685
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:46,410
He was my maker.

686
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:49,079
He gave me this life...

687
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:50,831
...whatever it is.

688
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:56,170
It shouldn't have been this way.

689
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,796
I did it for us.

690
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,258
So we could be free.

691
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:08,932
You missed him?

692
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:12,186
He was all I knew.

693
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:14,062
It's as simple as that.

694
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:17,941
We were like two orphans
learning to live again.

695
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:22,196
We booked a passage to Europe.

696
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:25,782
Over the weeks,
while waiting for the boat...

697
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:29,453
...she studied the myths and
legends of the Old World...

698
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,956
...obsessed with the search of
what she called "our kind. "

699
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:49,223
Look who we forgot.

700
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:55,312
Let's set them free.

701
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:57,815
- Yes.
- Yes.

702
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:04,905
It's the carriage.

703
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:53,162
Listen, Louis...

704
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:56,540
...there's life...

705
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:58,876
...in these old hands still.

706
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:03,964
Not quite furioso.

707
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:08,051
Moderato...

708
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:10,971
...cantabile, perhaps.

709
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:13,223
How could it be?

710
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:15,309
Ask the alligator.

711
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:17,895
His blood helped.

712
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:23,984
Then, on a diet of the blood of snakes...

713
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:25,903
...toads...

714
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:30,491
...and all the putrid life...

715
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:32,493
...of the Mississippi...

716
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,204
...slowly...

717
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:38,832
...Lestat became something...

718
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,918
...like himself again.

719
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,341
You've been...

720
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:49,510
...a very...

721
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:51,220
...very...

722
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:53,055
...naughty little girl.

723
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:57,494
The ship is sailing without us!

724
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,308
Though the fire seemed to spread...

725
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:23,812
...I stood on that deck,
fearful, he would come out again...

726
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:26,940
...from the river like some monster,
to destroy us.

727
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,194
And all the while I thought...

728
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:31,820
"Lestat...

729
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:34,114
"...we deserve your vengeance.

730
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:37,117
"You gave me the 'dark gift'...

731
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:41,830
"...and I delivered you into the
hands of Death for the second time. "

732
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:02,267
Though the ship was
blessedly free of rats...

733
01:09:02,434 --> 01:09:06,271
...a strange plague nonetheless
struck its passengers.

734
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:10,192
Claudia and I alone seemed immune.

735
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,862
We kept to ourselves...

736
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:16,615
...pondering the mystery of each other.

737
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:21,119
We reached the Mediterranean.

738
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:25,207
I wanted those waters to be blue...
but they were black...

739
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,125
...night-time waters.

740
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:29,211
And how I suffered then...

741
01:09:29,628 --> 01:09:33,549
...straining to recall the color
that in my youth I took for granted.

742
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:42,141
We searched village after village...

743
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:43,809
...ruin after ruin...

744
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:45,727
...country after country.

745
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:48,147
And always we found nothing.

746
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:54,069
I began to believe we were the only ones.

747
01:09:55,487 --> 01:09:58,323
There was a strange
comfort in that thought.

748
01:09:58,657 --> 01:10:02,411
For what could the damned really
have to say to the damned?

749
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:05,664
You found nothing?

750
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:07,166
Peasant rumors...

751
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:09,751
...superstitions about garlic...

752
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:11,170
...crosses...

753
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:13,505
...the old stake in the heart.

754
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,508
But one of our kind?

755
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:18,010
Not a whisper.

756
01:10:19,845 --> 01:10:24,016
There are no vampires in Transylvania?
No Count Dracula?

757
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:25,726
Fictions, my friend.

758
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:28,312
The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman.

759
01:10:29,855 --> 01:10:30,856
Paris...

760
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,691
...September, 1870.

761
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:35,944
The city I'd always dreamed of.

762
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:40,699
I was Creole, after all,
and Paris was the mother of New Orleans.

763
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:44,786
A universe whole and entire unto herself.

764
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:21,657
We were alive again.

765
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:23,492
Just the two of us.

766
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:27,996
And so euphoric was I
that I yielded to her every desire.

767
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:42,094
So it was...

768
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:45,264
...when I'd given up the
search for vampires...

769
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,766
...that a vampire found me.

770
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:18,857
Buffoon!

771
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:21,693
Santiago!

772
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:34,122
I've searched the world for an
immortal and this is what I find!

773
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:52,641
Bring the petite beauty with you.

774
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:55,561
No one will harm you.

775
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:57,062
I won't allow it.

776
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:01,066
And...

777
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,152
...remember my name:

778
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,321
Armand.

779
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,248
Remember what I told you.

780
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:20,335
They have different powers.
They'll read your thoughts.

781
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:35,267
He's the one, that's the vampire.

782
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:38,353
Two lovers...

783
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,607
...wandering down their violet way...

784
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:45,611
...whose passionate embraces,
each to each...

785
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:49,364
...permit no meditations on decay...

786
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:53,368
...until they find themselves...

787
01:14:53,452 --> 01:14:55,037
...within my reach!

788
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:05,214
Vampires who pretend to be humans
pretending to be vampires.

789
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,965
How avant-garde.

790
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:10,552
The monk whose soul with
Heaven doth commune...

791
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:13,138
...and spends his days...

792
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:15,724
...in pious contemplation...

793
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:21,980
...finds he will meet his Maker all too soon.

794
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:26,401
For all his prayers gets no remuneration.

795
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,408
The lesson endeth here...

796
01:15:33,826 --> 01:15:35,577
...and it is this:

797
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:40,165
Each one of you,
my clammy hands must touch.

798
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:45,254
Each one must bend his
forehead to my kiss.

799
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:49,007
But, hark!

800
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:51,844
Methinks a mortal doth approach!

801
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:57,015
What have we here?

802
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,852
What beauty by my side?

803
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:03,856
A rose in bloom, a shrinking violet?

804
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:08,360
Perhaps she has a mind to be my bride.

805
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:11,446
Perhaps my lesson has not ended yet!

806
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:15,534
I don't want to die!

807
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:18,287
But Death we are and have always been.

808
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:19,872
Someone help me!

809
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:21,707
Please!

810
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:33,719
- What have I done?
- We all die!

811
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:35,220
But I'm young!

812
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:39,725
Death is no respecter of age!
It can come any time, any place.

813
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:56,158
Just as this flesh is pink now...

814
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:59,578
...so it will turn gray and wrinkle with age.

815
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:01,580
Let me live! I don't care!

816
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:04,333
Then why should you care if you die now?

817
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:08,420
And suppose Death had a heart
to love and to release you?

818
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:11,089
To whom would he turn his passion?

819
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:14,092
Would you choose a person
from the crowd there?

820
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:16,094
A person to suffer as you do?

821
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:18,013
Monsieur Vampire, take me!

822
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:20,098
I adore you!

823
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:23,018
You wait your turn!

824
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:25,437
Well...

825
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:30,192
Do you know what it means
to be loved by Death?

826
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:34,446
To become our bride?

827
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:35,841
No pain.

828
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:41,930
No pain.

829
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:56,111
Monstrous.

830
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:47,412
We live beneath.

831
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:49,498
Let me show you.

832
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,089
Monstrous.

833
01:19:58,006 --> 01:19:59,424
Yes.

834
01:20:00,425 --> 01:20:02,344
But very beautiful.

835
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:25,617
Welcome to my home.

836
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,050
Try him.

837
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,492
Two vampires...

838
01:21:07,493 --> 01:21:09,411
...from the New World...

839
01:21:10,245 --> 01:21:12,915
...come to guide us into the new era...

840
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,584
...as all we love slowly rots...

841
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:18,670
...and fades away.

842
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:22,007
Are you the leader of this group?

843
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:24,426
If there were a leader...

844
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:26,595
...I would be the one.

845
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:29,556
- So you have the answers?
- So you have questions?

846
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:33,685
What are we?

847
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:37,064
Nothing...

848
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:39,608
...if not vampires.

849
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:44,947
Who made us what we are?

850
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:47,616
Surely you know the one who made you?

851
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:49,785
Yes, but the one who made him?

852
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:51,703
The source...

853
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:53,205
...of all this...

854
01:21:54,122 --> 01:21:55,207
...evil.

855
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:58,627
I understand.

856
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:02,297
I saw you in the theater.

857
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:05,801
Your suffering...

858
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:09,638
...your sympathy for that girl.

859
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:12,808
You die...

860
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:14,643
...when you kill.

861
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:19,398
You feel you deserve to die
and you stint on nothing.

862
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:23,152
But does that make you evil?

863
01:22:24,153 --> 01:22:28,073
Since you comprehend what you call
goodness, doesn't that make you...

864
01:22:28,157 --> 01:22:29,241
...good?

865
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:31,660
Then there is nothing?

866
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:33,745
Perhaps.

867
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:37,082
But perhaps...

868
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,335
...this...

869
01:22:40,752 --> 01:22:43,255
...is the only real evil left.

870
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:46,842
Then God does not exist?

871
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:49,470
I know nothing of God.

872
01:22:50,471 --> 01:22:51,805
Or the Devil.

873
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:56,310
I have never seen a vision,
nor learned a secret...

874
01:22:56,477 --> 01:22:59,480
...that would damn or save my soul.

875
01:23:01,315 --> 01:23:02,816
As far as I know...

876
01:23:02,983 --> 01:23:05,152
...after 400 years...

877
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:07,654
...I am the oldest...

878
01:23:07,946 --> 01:23:09,823
...living vampire...

879
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,450
...in the world.

880
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:15,454
Then it's as I always feared.

881
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:26,006
You fear too much.

882
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:30,344
So much you make me fear...

883
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:37,643
The one who made you...

884
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:40,187
...should have told you this.

885
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,316
The one who left the Old
World for the New...

886
01:23:44,483 --> 01:23:45,943
He knew nothing.

887
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:47,694
Nor did he care.

888
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:48,862
Knew?

889
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:50,364
Come, beloved.

890
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:53,492
It's time we were on our way.

891
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:54,660
I'm hungry...

892
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:55,828
...and the city awaits.

893
01:23:57,871 --> 01:24:00,499
The place was empty as we left.

894
01:24:00,707 --> 01:24:02,501
Silent as the grave.

895
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:06,171
And as we blundered through it,
again came the thought:

896
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:08,507
"I have wronged Lestat.

897
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:10,926
"I have hated him for the wrong reasons. "

898
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:12,636
How did you wrong him?

899
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:16,223
You said a name.

900
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:19,059
Yes, a name I don't care to say again.

901
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:21,228
There is but one crime...

902
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:23,355
...among us vampires here.

903
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:28,068
It is the crime that means
death to any vampire:

904
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:31,697
To kill your own kind.

905
01:24:35,868 --> 01:24:39,079
- Do you think I'd let them harm you?
- No, you would not.

906
01:24:39,246 --> 01:24:40,914
Danger holds you to me.

907
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:42,624
Love holds you to me.

908
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,251
- Love?
- Love.

909
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:47,546
You would leave me for Armand
if he beckoned you.

910
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:49,423
Never.

911
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:53,051
He wants you as you want him.
He's been waiting for you.

912
01:24:53,218 --> 01:24:55,554
He wants you as a companion.

913
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:57,598
He bides his time there.

914
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,559
He finds it as dull and lifeless as we do.

915
01:25:00,726 --> 01:25:01,768
Perhaps.

916
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:06,106
Do you know what his soul said to me
without saying a word?

917
01:25:07,274 --> 01:25:09,234
'"Let him go, '" he said.

918
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:11,403
'"Let him go. '"

919
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,574
Is that what I should do?

920
01:25:16,742 --> 01:25:18,410
Let you go?

921
01:25:19,411 --> 01:25:20,787
My father...

922
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,414
...my Louis...

923
01:25:22,581 --> 01:25:24,124
...who made me?

924
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:27,794
It will be all right.

925
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:30,923
You really believe that?

926
01:25:38,931 --> 01:25:40,057
The soldier...

927
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,309
...on returning from the war...

928
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:46,146
...thinks victory has enured
him against sorrow...

929
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,440
...till Death comes by...

930
01:25:48,816 --> 01:25:50,901
...and chops him from his horse.

931
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:58,951
I was waiting for you.

932
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:02,830
Listen to me.

933
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:07,793
Claudia is very dear to me.

934
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:09,378
She's my daughter.

935
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:10,963
Your lover.

936
01:26:11,797 --> 01:26:13,173
No, my beloved.

937
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,800
My child.

938
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:18,345
You say so. You're innocent.

939
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:21,473
She's in danger, isn't she?

940
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:22,933
- She is.
- Why?

941
01:26:25,811 --> 01:26:28,147
I could give you reasons.

942
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:31,191
Her silence.

943
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:33,485
Her youth.

944
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:37,656
It's forbidden to make one so young...

945
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:40,033
...so helpless...

946
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:42,661
...that cannot survive on its own.

947
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:44,621
Then blame the one who made her.

948
01:26:44,705 --> 01:26:46,915
Did you kill this vampire
who made you both?

949
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:48,625
Is that why you won't say his name?

950
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:50,419
Santiago thinks you did.

951
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:53,422
- We want no quarrel with him.
- It's already begun.

952
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,592
If you want to save her...

953
01:26:56,675 --> 01:26:59,178
...send her away!
- Then I leave too.

954
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,394
So soon?

955
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:13,066
Without any of those answers
you so longed for?

956
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,610
You said there are none.

957
01:27:14,693 --> 01:27:16,904
But you asked the wrong questions.

958
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:34,046
Do you know...

959
01:27:34,755 --> 01:27:36,757
...how few vampires...

960
01:27:37,758 --> 01:27:40,427
...have the stamina for immortality?

961
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,973
How quickly they perish of their own will.

962
01:27:49,102 --> 01:27:50,729
The world...

963
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:52,898
...changes.

964
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,443
We do not.

965
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:00,072
Therein lies the irony...

966
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,282
...that finally kills us.

967
01:28:02,783 --> 01:28:06,245
I need you to make contact with this age.

968
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,913
Me?

969
01:28:08,747 --> 01:28:10,415
Don't you see?

970
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,752
I'm not the spirit of any age.

971
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:16,588
I'm at odds with everything.

972
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:18,590
I always have been.

973
01:28:20,092 --> 01:28:22,970
That is the very spirit of your age.

974
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:25,806
The heart of it.

975
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:29,268
Your fall...

976
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:31,270
...from grace...

977
01:28:31,436 --> 01:28:34,148
...has been the fall of a century.

978
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:37,317
But the vampires in the theater?

979
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,612
Decadent...

980
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,781
...useless.

981
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:46,493
They can't reflect anything.

982
01:28:47,161 --> 01:28:48,162
But...

983
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,955
...you do.

984
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:53,375
You reflect...

985
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:55,127
...its broken heart.

986
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:09,475
A vampire...

987
01:29:10,851 --> 01:29:12,811
...with a human soul.

988
01:29:14,021 --> 01:29:16,982
An immortal with a mortal's passion.

989
01:29:19,276 --> 01:29:20,486
You...

990
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,362
...are...

991
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:25,866
...beautiful, my friend.

992
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:31,371
Lestat must have wept when he made you.

993
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:36,210
You knew Lestat?

994
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:40,339
Yes.

995
01:29:41,548 --> 01:29:43,008
I knew him.

996
01:29:44,843 --> 01:29:48,180
Knew him well enough
not to mourn his passing.

997
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:53,519
I felt a kind of peace at last.

998
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:58,565
I had found the teacher which Lestat
could never, I knew now, have been.

999
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:02,402
I knew knowledge would
never be withheld by Armand.

1000
01:30:02,694 --> 01:30:06,198
It would pass through him
as through a pane of glass.

1001
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:22,422
Madeleine...

1002
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,008
...Louis is shy.

1003
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:41,942
Drink.

1004
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:44,778
Do it.

1005
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:48,031
Because I cannot do it.
I haven't the strength.

1006
01:30:48,198 --> 01:30:52,536
- You saw to that when you made me.
- You don't know what you ask!

1007
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:55,622
I have.

1008
01:30:55,706 --> 01:30:59,042
You have found your new companion!
You will make me mine!

1009
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,628
How do we seem to you?

1010
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:04,298
Do you find us beautiful?

1011
01:31:04,798 --> 01:31:06,133
Magical?

1012
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,638
Our white skin, our fierce eyes?
Do you know the thing you will become?

1013
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:14,558
Your evil is that you cannot be evil!

1014
01:31:14,725 --> 01:31:17,394
And I shall suffer for it no longer!

1015
01:31:17,728 --> 01:31:20,147
Don't make me do this! I cannot!

1016
01:31:20,564 --> 01:31:22,399
Yet, you could do it to me.

1017
01:31:22,733 --> 01:31:27,654
Snatching me from my mother's hands,
like two monsters in a fairy tale.

1018
01:31:28,322 --> 01:31:30,157
And now you weep!

1019
01:31:30,324 --> 01:31:33,243
I haven't tears enough
for what you've done to me!

1020
01:31:33,494 --> 01:31:35,579
You give her to me, Louis!

1021
01:31:35,746 --> 01:31:38,248
Do this before you leave me!

1022
01:31:40,584 --> 01:31:41,668
Oh, God!

1023
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:44,087
I love you still!

1024
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:46,924
That's the torment of it!

1025
01:31:47,925 --> 01:31:49,927
Who'll care for me, my love...

1026
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:53,430
...my dark angel, when you are gone?

1027
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:02,773
What do you think she is, Madeleine?

1028
01:32:04,358 --> 01:32:05,776
A doll?

1029
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:10,614
A child who cannot die.

1030
01:32:11,865 --> 01:32:13,867
And the child who did die?

1031
01:32:15,786 --> 01:32:17,287
My daughter.

1032
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:15,762
What's happening to her?

1033
01:33:15,846 --> 01:33:17,347
She's dying.

1034
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:20,267
It happened to you too...

1035
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:23,270
...only you were too young to remember.

1036
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:27,024
But if she dies?

1037
01:33:28,025 --> 01:33:30,194
It's only mortal death.

1038
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:36,200
Bear me no ill will, my love.

1039
01:33:39,036 --> 01:33:40,954
We are now even.

1040
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:43,707
What do you mean?

1041
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:48,462
What died in that room
was not that woman.

1042
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:53,967
What has died is the...

1043
01:33:55,385 --> 01:33:57,387
...last breath in me...

1044
01:33:58,305 --> 01:34:00,140
...that was human.

1045
01:34:04,394 --> 01:34:06,146
Yes, Father.

1046
01:34:07,147 --> 01:34:09,066
At last we are even.

1047
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:17,491
It's time for justice, little one.

1048
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:37,469
Get me Armand.
He wouldn't stand for this.

1049
01:34:37,636 --> 01:34:39,429
Death for the others.

1050
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:41,431
For you...

1051
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,934
...eternity in a box.

1052
01:34:45,144 --> 01:34:46,979
Walled in a dungeon.

1053
01:34:47,146 --> 01:34:49,606
Your only company will be your screams.

1054
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:52,943
Perhaps it will take centuries.

1055
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:55,737
Take them!

1056
01:36:10,854 --> 01:36:12,731
Pleasant dreams.

1057
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:16,944
No! No!

1058
01:36:18,028 --> 01:36:19,446
Help!

1059
01:36:55,274 --> 01:36:56,483
Wake up!

1060
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:04,927
Where's Claudia?

1061
01:38:05,677 --> 01:38:08,305
Claudia. I cannot help her.

1062
01:38:08,806 --> 01:38:11,308
- Where's Claudia?
- I can't save her!

1063
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:15,354
I will only risk losing you!

1064
01:38:17,564 --> 01:38:18,816
Don't!

1065
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:07,925
Come, Louis.

1066
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:10,677
Not here.

1067
01:40:19,186 --> 01:40:21,480
So a vampire can cry?

1068
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:24,858
Once...

1069
01:40:25,192 --> 01:40:27,110
...maybe twice, in eternity.

1070
01:40:29,154 --> 01:40:32,866
And maybe it was to quench those tears
forever that I took such revenge.

1071
01:41:29,923 --> 01:41:32,551
Stop him! It's burning!

1072
01:41:32,718 --> 01:41:34,261
Get him! Stop him!

1073
01:43:39,887 --> 01:43:42,181
You didn't even warn them, did you?

1074
01:43:44,183 --> 01:43:45,225
No.

1075
01:43:47,394 --> 01:43:49,688
And you knew what I would do.

1076
01:43:50,898 --> 01:43:52,232
I knew.

1077
01:43:52,691 --> 01:43:54,693
I rescued you, didn't I?

1078
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,737
From the terrible dawn.

1079
01:44:01,074 --> 01:44:03,744
You were their leader. They trusted you.

1080
01:44:03,911 --> 01:44:04,912
No.

1081
01:44:06,038 --> 01:44:08,540
You made me see their failings, Louis.

1082
01:44:10,042 --> 01:44:11,376
They were...

1083
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:14,296
...doomed, stuck in their decadent time.

1084
01:44:15,214 --> 01:44:17,758
They had forgotten the first lesson...

1085
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:20,093
...that we must be powerful...

1086
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:21,553
...beautiful...

1087
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,430
...and without regret.

1088
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:26,016
You can teach me this?

1089
01:44:26,099 --> 01:44:27,559
Yes.

1090
01:44:27,768 --> 01:44:29,770
To be without regret?

1091
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:34,233
Then, what a pair we could make.

1092
01:44:36,944 --> 01:44:40,113
But what if it's a lesson
I don't care to learn?

1093
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:42,741
What?

1094
01:44:43,116 --> 01:44:45,786
What if all I have is my suffering?

1095
01:44:46,078 --> 01:44:47,913
My regret?

1096
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:51,458
Don't you want to lose it?

1097
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:53,627
So you can have that too?

1098
01:44:54,461 --> 01:44:56,588
The heart that mourns her...

1099
01:44:57,089 --> 01:44:59,258
...whom you burnt to a cinder?

1100
01:44:59,424 --> 01:45:00,968
I swear I didn't...

1101
01:45:01,135 --> 01:45:02,761
But I know you did.

1102
01:45:03,637 --> 01:45:04,930
I know...

1103
01:45:06,431 --> 01:45:07,599
...you...

1104
01:45:08,267 --> 01:45:09,977
...regret nothing.

1105
01:45:11,937 --> 01:45:13,480
You feel...

1106
01:45:14,106 --> 01:45:15,274
...nothing.

1107
01:45:17,276 --> 01:45:19,820
If that's all I have left to learn...

1108
01:45:21,446 --> 01:45:23,448
...I can do that on my own.

1109
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:35,169
I will die.

1110
01:45:35,335 --> 01:45:36,086
No.

1111
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:37,629
You are dead.

1112
01:45:37,796 --> 01:45:40,507
And you want me to quicken you
once more.

1113
01:45:42,843 --> 01:45:46,472
And as much as your invitation
might appeal to me...

1114
01:45:47,848 --> 01:45:49,683
...I must regretfully...

1115
01:45:50,017 --> 01:45:51,185
...decline.

1116
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:06,158
For years I wandered:

1117
01:46:06,325 --> 01:46:08,035
Italy, Greece...

1118
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,704
...all the ancient lands.

1119
01:46:11,038 --> 01:46:13,499
But the world was a tomb to me...

1120
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:16,335
...a graveyard full of broken statues.

1121
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:20,631
And each of those statues
resembled her face.

1122
01:46:26,553 --> 01:46:28,305
Then, out of curiosity...

1123
01:46:28,472 --> 01:46:30,432
...boredom, who knows what...

1124
01:46:30,641 --> 01:46:32,226
...I left the Old World...

1125
01:46:32,309 --> 01:46:34,561
...and came back to my America.

1126
01:46:37,731 --> 01:46:41,985
And there a mechanical wonder
allowed me to see the sunrise...

1127
01:46:42,152 --> 01:46:43,987
...for the first time...

1128
01:46:44,154 --> 01:46:45,989
...in 200 years.

1129
01:46:47,241 --> 01:46:48,992
And what sunrises!

1130
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:52,579
Seen as the human eye
could never see them.

1131
01:46:53,413 --> 01:46:55,165
Silver at first...

1132
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:59,086
...then, as the years progressed,
in tones of purple...

1133
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:00,337
...red...

1134
01:47:00,504 --> 01:47:02,923
...and my long-lost blue.

1135
01:47:07,594 --> 01:47:10,931
In the spring of 1988,
I returned to New Orleans.

1136
01:47:11,849 --> 01:47:15,435
And as soon as I smelled the air,
I knew I was home.

1137
01:47:16,603 --> 01:47:17,938
It was rich...

1138
01:47:18,105 --> 01:47:19,773
...almost sweet...

1139
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:24,111
...like the fragrance of jasmine
and roses around our old courtyard.

1140
01:47:25,445 --> 01:47:29,950
I walked the streets savoring
that long-lost perfume.

1141
01:47:35,289 --> 01:47:37,374
And then on Prytania Street...

1142
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:40,627
...only blocks from the
Lafayette cemetery...

1143
01:47:40,794 --> 01:47:42,963
...I caught the scent of death.

1144
01:47:43,547 --> 01:47:46,049
And it wasn't coming from the graves.

1145
01:47:47,634 --> 01:47:50,387
The scent grew stronger as I walked.

1146
01:47:50,554 --> 01:47:52,139
Old death.

1147
01:47:52,473 --> 01:47:55,142
A scent too faint for mortals to detect.

1148
01:49:27,276 --> 01:49:29,528
I'm so glad you are here!

1149
01:49:30,195 --> 01:49:31,780
I've dreamed...

1150
01:49:32,614 --> 01:49:34,449
...of this moment.

1151
01:49:36,034 --> 01:49:38,453
She never should have been one of...

1152
01:49:39,037 --> 01:49:40,456
...us.

1153
01:49:40,789 --> 01:49:42,791
That's all past, Lestat.

1154
01:49:47,379 --> 01:49:48,881
Past.

1155
01:50:12,237 --> 01:50:14,406
Still beautiful, Louis.

1156
01:50:17,075 --> 01:50:19,578
You always were the strong one.

1157
01:50:23,749 --> 01:50:25,417
Don't be frightened.

1158
01:50:29,505 --> 01:50:31,423
I mean you no harm.

1159
01:50:35,093 --> 01:50:37,179
You've come home to me then?

1160
01:50:41,683 --> 01:50:44,102
You remember how I was?

1161
01:50:46,104 --> 01:50:47,773
The vampire...

1162
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,775
...that I was?

1163
01:50:50,859 --> 01:50:52,528
Yes, I remember.

1164
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:00,118
No one...

1165
01:51:00,285 --> 01:51:02,037
...could refuse me...

1166
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:04,957
...not even you.

1167
01:51:06,542 --> 01:51:07,960
I tried.

1168
01:51:08,627 --> 01:51:10,462
Yes, you tried.

1169
01:51:11,797 --> 01:51:13,799
And the more you tried...

1170
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:19,888
...the more I wanted you.

1171
01:51:30,232 --> 01:51:31,984
I can't bear it.

1172
01:51:34,403 --> 01:51:35,821
Such lights...

1173
01:51:37,406 --> 01:51:39,074
...and that noise!

1174
01:51:40,659 --> 01:51:43,662
They make the night brighter than the day.

1175
01:51:52,004 --> 01:51:53,922
It's false light.

1176
01:51:54,173 --> 01:51:55,924
It can't harm you.

1177
01:52:07,186 --> 01:52:09,771
If you stay with me, Louis...

1178
01:52:11,190 --> 01:52:13,150
...I could venture out again.

1179
01:52:16,111 --> 01:52:18,197
Become the old Lestat.

1180
01:52:19,698 --> 01:52:21,533
I must leave now.

1181
01:52:49,645 --> 01:52:52,314
Whatever happened to Lestat,
I do not know.

1182
01:52:53,649 --> 01:52:55,067
I go on...

1183
01:52:55,234 --> 01:52:56,985
...night after night.

1184
01:52:57,152 --> 01:52:59,655
I feed on those who cross my path.

1185
01:53:02,324 --> 01:53:05,577
But all my passion went
with her golden hair.

1186
01:53:08,664 --> 01:53:11,667
I'm a spirit of preternatural flesh.

1187
01:53:12,835 --> 01:53:14,503
Detached.

1188
01:53:15,337 --> 01:53:16,672
Unchangeable.

1189
01:53:19,591 --> 01:53:20,843
Empty.

1190
01:53:21,927 --> 01:53:23,095
Empty?

1191
01:53:23,595 --> 01:53:24,763
That's it?

1192
01:53:27,015 --> 01:53:28,934
No, it can't end like that.

1193
01:53:30,519 --> 01:53:32,020
But it has.

1194
01:53:32,187 --> 01:53:33,939
There's no more to tell.

1195
01:53:34,857 --> 01:53:39,611
There must be more to tell. You don't
understand yourself. You're not empty.

1196
01:53:40,279 --> 01:53:43,532
What I wouldn't give to be like you,
to have your power...

1197
01:53:43,615 --> 01:53:46,034
...to have seen the things you have seen.

1198
01:53:46,118 --> 01:53:47,536
You haven't been listening.

1199
01:53:47,619 --> 01:53:50,456
I have been listening.
Your story is incredible.

1200
01:53:50,539 --> 01:53:52,583
- It's amazing.
- Do what you want with it.

1201
01:53:52,666 --> 01:53:55,085
Give it to others. Learn what you can.

1202
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:59,131
There's only one way I'll truly learn
and you know it.

1203
01:53:59,381 --> 01:54:01,967
You brought me here for a reason.

1204
01:54:02,217 --> 01:54:03,302
Didn't you?

1205
01:54:03,385 --> 01:54:05,137
What reason would that be?

1206
01:54:05,304 --> 01:54:09,308
You want a companion. You want a link
to the outside world. That's me.

1207
01:54:09,475 --> 01:54:11,852
Take me. That's what I want.

1208
01:54:11,935 --> 01:54:15,272
- I refuse to let it end like this.
- God, I've failed again.

1209
01:54:15,731 --> 01:54:18,734
You haven't failed.
God has nothing to do with it.

1210
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:23,238
Do you like this?

1211
01:54:24,072 --> 01:54:26,992
Do you like being food for the immortals?

1212
01:54:27,743 --> 01:54:29,077
Do you like dying?

1213
01:54:29,161 --> 01:54:30,245
Stop!

1214
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:40,566
1791 was the year it happened.

1215
01:55:40,732 --> 01:55:43,986
I was 24. Younger than you are now.

1216
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:47,906
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.

1217
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:51,577
The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.

1218
01:55:52,828 --> 01:55:55,414
I had lost my wife in childbirth.

1219
01:55:55,581 --> 01:55:57,332
Someone change my shorts.

1220
01:55:57,416 --> 01:56:00,502
She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.

1221
01:56:00,586 --> 01:56:01,336
It's good stuff.

1222
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:02,838
I would've been happy to join them.

1223
01:56:02,921 --> 01:56:04,673
Good stuff.

1224
01:56:08,177 --> 01:56:10,429
I assume I need no introduction.

1225
01:56:24,943 --> 01:56:26,945
I feel better already.

1226
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:34,036
Most of all, I longed for death.

1227
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:36,205
I invited it.

1228
01:56:37,289 --> 01:56:39,875
A release from the pain of living.

1229
01:56:43,295 --> 01:56:45,047
Still whining.

1230
01:56:47,716 --> 01:56:49,218
Heard enough?

1231
01:56:49,551 --> 01:56:52,095
I've had to listen to that for centuries.

1232
01:56:54,723 --> 01:56:56,099
Don't be afraid.

1233
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,979
I'm going to give you the choice...

1234
01:57:01,897 --> 01:57:03,649
...I never had.

1235
02:02:10,289 --> 02:02:13,417
