1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,523
Tanya, Fievel?

3
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,279
Will you stop that
twirling, twirling?

4
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,639
Uh, no. No more.

5
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,799
That's it. Time for bed. Come.

6
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,919
But, Mama, it's Hanukkah!

7
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,051
For you, every night is Hanukkah.

8
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,039
Papa, enough already.

9
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,965
They'll never get to sleep.

10
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,087
All right. All right.

11
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,399
Presents.

12
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,079
What about presents?

13
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,403
Presents? What presents?

14
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,679
Oh, Papa.

15
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,171
Just a joke.

16
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,519
For Tanya, a new babushka.

17
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,159
Happy Hanukkah.

18
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,245
Oh, Papa. Thank you.

19
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,639
You have only one parent?

20
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,199
Thank you, Mama.

21
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,479
Hmm.

22
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,769
And for you, Fievel,

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,399
a new hat.

24
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,839
And not just any hat.

25
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,119
A new hat that has
been in the family

26
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,329
for three generations.

27
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,559
It belonged to me, my father,
and my father's father,

28
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,566
and now, it belongs to you.

29
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,285
Happy Hanukkah.

30
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,159
It's too big!

31
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,519
You'll grow.

32
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,439
Ah, did I ever tell you

33
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,799
about the Giant Mouse of Minsk?

34
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,770
No.
No.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,519
Was it anything like
the mouse with the long hair

36
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,524
that the prince climbed up?

37
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,883
No. This mouse, the Mouse of Minsk,

38
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,999
was tall as a tree.

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,246
His tail was a mile long.

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,729
Really?
Really.

41
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,759
He was so big,
he frightened all the cats.

42
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,199
Shh!

43
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,479
Don't say that word.

44
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,479
Talk about something else.

45
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,639
America.

46
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,279
Another fairy tale.

47
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,199
America.

48
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,479
What a place!

49
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,719
What a place!
What a place!

50
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,079
In America, there are mouse
holes in every wall.

51
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,959
Who says?
Everyone!

52
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,119
In America, there are bread
crumbs on every floor!

53
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,599
You're talking nonsense.

54
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,239
In America, you can
say anything you want.

55
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,799
But most important...

56
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,919
And this I know for fact,

57
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,085
in America, there are no cats.

58
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,399
Shh. They'll hear you.

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,086
How could they hear us?

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,686
There, you see?

61
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,763
The Cossacks! The Cossacks!

62
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,160
Don't cry, Yasha.
I'll scare them away.

63
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,079
Fievel, you'll get hurt!

64
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,803
Go away!

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,159
Go away, cats! Go away!

66
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,521
Whoa!

67
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,199
Whoa!

68
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,686
Fievel, angel, are you all right?

69
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,719
Yes, Mama.

70
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,726
Then never do that again!

71
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,645
Mama, look.

72
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,290
In America,

73
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,048
there are no cats.

74
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,399
Look, Papa, water.

75
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,239
Is it the ocean?

76
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,239
Yes. Keep walking.

77
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,359
Look, Papa, smoke!

78
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,524
Is the boat on fire?

79
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,559
No. No. Keep walking!

80
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,359
Look, Papa, birds!

81
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,199
Are they seagulls?

82
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,279
Keep walking!

83
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,359
Keep walking!

84
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,999
Keep walking!

85
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,479
I just wanted to see.

86
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,119
Fievel, this is the last
time I take you to America.

87
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,851
Bye-bye!

88
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,999
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

89
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,159
Ooh, <i>auf Wiedersehen!</i>

90
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,159
You know I got a cousin in America.

91
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,559
Ah!

92
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,079
You and everybody else.
Huh?

93
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,759
Are we there yet?

94
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,079
Not yet. Soon.

95
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,839
How soon?

96
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,401
Soon.

97
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,682
Maybe we should
have stayed in Russia.

98
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,359
We'll be all right.

99
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,764
As long as we're together,
we'll be all right.

100
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,639
Ah, so, Mr. Curious,

101
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,079
you've discovered the herring.

102
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,759
Herring?
I thought they were fish.

103
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,645
But, Fievel, herring are fish.

104
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,679
Really?
Certainly.

105
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,599
In the ocean,
there are all kinds of fish,

106
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,399
and herring is one of them.

107
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,639
All kinds?

108
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,959
Yes. Tiny fishes,
not so tiny fishes,

109
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,559
fishes as big as this boat.

110
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,008
Wow!

111
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,201
Let's go up and see the fish!

112
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,368
Not now.
Your mama's worried.

113
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,527
Come back, Fievel.

114
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,079
Wait!

115
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,279
Oh, what am I going to do with you?

116
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,119
You stay closer to home!
Don't you go running off again!

117
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,279
Mama!

118
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,490
Ah, so we return, hmm?

119
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,519
We saw some fish!

120
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,079
Fish?

121
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,439
Lucky you didn't see some cats.

122
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,919
Cats!

123
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,999
Cats!
Oh!

124
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,528
I didn't see any cats.

125
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,639
Whew.

126
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,519
Won't it be nice to get to America

127
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,083
where we don't have to worry
about cats anymore?

128
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,611
There are no cats in America,

129
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,646
but back home in mother Russia...

130
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,479

All right, all right, Digit.
All right.

338
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,639
Hey, how much money
did we make today?

339
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,121
Oh.

340
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,159
Oh, well. Well, let's see.

341
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,719
Uh, seven, nine, four, six,
carry one, drop two.

342
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,439
Uh, take five,
five down, seven up, 98.6...

343
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,319
And two plus two is 22.

345
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,399
What did we make?
What's the boodle?

346
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,088
Oh, so far,
we have collected $89 and...

347
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,399
And 13 cents. Uh-oh.

348
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,959
And we'll get another 17 from Moe.

349
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,199
Uh, that's 50 cents
less than yesterday.

350
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,840
What?

351
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,439
Fifty cents!

352
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,639
I hate to lose money.

353
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,204
Mmm. Where can I pick up
an extra 50 cents?

354
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,159
Bye!

355
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,639
<i>Au revoir,</i> my little immigrant!
Huh?

356
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,159
Hmm. Hey, boss, a kid.

357
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,559
Hmm. You know, Moe can always use
an extra kid at 50 cents a day.

358
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,961
Yeah.

359
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,811
Very interesting.

360
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,081
Ahem! Well, well, well!

361
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,927
Rat's the name, Warren T. Rat.

362
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,879
What can I do you for, kid?

363
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,839
I'm looking for my family.

364
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,439
Hey, you come to
the right fellow, kid.

365
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,519
I know exactly where they are.
Come with me.

366
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,527
But Henri said I'd find them here!
Have it your way, kid.

367
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,679
But remember what Shakespeare said.

368
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,039
And I quote.

369
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,359
"Opportunity knocks but..."
Uh... But, uh...

370
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,479
Psst! Once!

371
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,881
"But... But once!

372
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,239
"Taken at the tide,
t'will lead to fortune.

373
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,530
"If denied, t'will never return."

374
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,399
Do you really know
where my family is?

375
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,405
Trust me. Hey, trust me.

376
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,439
Mama, I keep having this
feeling that Fievel's alive.

377
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,049
Tanya, it will go away.

378
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,490
After a while, it will go away.

379
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,919
Come with me.

380
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,051
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't break a gut there.

381
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,239
"O! Pardon me,

382
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,927
"thou bleeding piece of earth,

383
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,850
"That I am meek and gentle
with these butchers."

384
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,439
This is where they are.

385
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,759
Papa!

386
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,559
Not bad, huh, Moe?
A new worker.

387
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,079
What about my family?

388
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,439
You don't need a family, kid.
You got a job here!

389
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,959
Just send me his salary, will you?

390
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,964
And where do you
think you're going?

391
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,799
You're mine! Now get to work!

392
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,806
You! What are you looking at?
Back to work!

393
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,999
I want to get out of here.

394
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,959
You and me both.

395
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,479
I have to find my family.

396
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,359
Oh, shut up! Go to sleep.

397
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,479
Pipe down.

398
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,519
Oh, be quiet!

399
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,639
I wish we had that
mouse with the long hair.

400
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,639
She could drop her hair out the
window, and we can all climb down.

401
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,319
Sure. Out the window.

402
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,919
Oh, fairy tales!

403
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,159
Wait a minute!
This kid may have something.

404
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,399
Tony Toponi's the name.

405
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,679
Put it there. Well, uh...

406
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,879
Fievel.

407
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,999
Fievel Mousekewitz.

408
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,319
Fievel!

409
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,166
Ooh, that name's got to go!

410
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,799
Hey, I'll tell you what...
Fillie!

411
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,599
Fillie?
Yeah!

412
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,684
Fits you perfect!

413
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,765
Hey, Fillie.

414
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,279
You got any idea
where your family is?

415
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,727
Fillie!

416
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,921
Fillie Mousekewitz!

417
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,879
Hey, Fillie!

00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,930

426
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,804
Fievel!

427
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,646
Fievel!

428
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,599
What am I going to do with you?

429
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,367
Come on, come little ones, eat.

430
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,319
Don't gobble so.

431
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,370
Back! Back! Mine!

432
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,401
Papa.

433
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,006
Papa.

434
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,526
Papa!

435
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,839
Grand and Hester streets!

436
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,250
Here, Papa. Here I am.

437
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,447
Papa?

438
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,205
Are you there?

439
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,719
Oh, my word! A mouse!

440
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,689
What's going on up there?

441
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,039
Hey! Shut up out there!

442
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,807
What's going on up there?

443
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,689
Hey, Fillie!

444
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,251
I've been looking all over for you.

445
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,959
Pardon the expression,

446
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,967
but you look like something
the cat dragged in, you know?

447
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,639
Hey, you all right?

448
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,159
Yeah, I guess so.

449
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,439
Listen, you go
running off like that

450
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,002
and you're gonna get
yourself seriously lost.

451
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,601
Stick with me, okay?

452
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,599
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

453
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,447
What, we engaged or something?

454
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,599
Why can't we try to
find Fievel, Papa?

455
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,639
Oh.
Just try!

456
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,199
I know, Papa.
Play your violin.

457
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,359
Play Fievel's song.

458
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,159
Oy, Tanya.
Maybe he'll hear it.

459
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,961
You can't find what's not there.

460
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,209
Okay, okay.
I got it all figured out.

461
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,089
We'll start looking for
your family over in...

462
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,439
This is America.
Don't be afraid.

463
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,002
Are you going to let
those cats push you around?

464
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,203
Tony? Hey, Tony, where you going?

465
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,039
I ask you this.

466
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,199
Are we going to stand by

467
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,649
and let cats wreck our homes,
our businesses and our lives?

468
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,889
If we all got together, we could
do something about the cats!

469
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,729
Yeah. We should all get together.

470
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,839
This is America.
We have free speech.

471
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,321
You can say "cat" here.

472
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,167
Cat, cat, cat!
And double cat!

473
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,399
Shh! Not so loud.

474
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,879
Shh.
Please, not that word.

475
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,409
Wait a minute. Come back!
Where are you going?

476
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,727
Oh.

477
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,639
So,

478
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,929
if we all got together,

479
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,080
we could do something about the...

480
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,119
Cats.

481
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,279
Yeah.

482
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,759
Cat...

483
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,279
Ca...

484
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,761
Cat.

485
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,966
Tony?

486
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,842
Tony, what's wrong with you?

487
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,599
But there are no cats in America.

488
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,239
That does it.
I'm getting out of here!

489
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,130
Mmm-hmm, me too.

490
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,202
What are you all afraid of?
Cats, cats, cats, cats.

491
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,359
Papa told me.
Everyone knows it.

492
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,569
There are no cats.

493
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,124
Hey, you all right?

494
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,239
I mean, you ain't
hurt or nothing, are you?

495
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,079
No. No, I'm okay.

496
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,999
Thank you.

497
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,639
No, really, I'm all right.

498
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,883
Really, I am.

499
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,919
How about you?

500
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,999
Nah!

501
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,119
Who do those cats think they are?

502
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,000
I'll show them
a thing or two next time.

503
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,559
Hey, where's Fillie?

504
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,079
Fillie? Who's Fillie?

505
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,404
Oh, I gotta find him.
He's just a kid.

506
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,206
Fillie!

507
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,771
Tony!
Whoa!

508
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,319
Phew! Hmm. Some scrap, huh?

509
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,088
There are cats here.
Wait till I tell Papa!

510
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,359
If I find him.

511
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,079
You see,
he's looking for his family.

512
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,050
Aw, the poor darling.

513
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,199
Wait a minute!

514
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,479
Honest John, at Tammany Hall.

515
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,039
He'll know where your family is.

516
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,559
He will?

517
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,759
Tony, he knows every mouse in the city!
Ha! Told you to stick with me, yeah?

518
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,366
Come on.

519
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,519
Oh!

520
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,679
Well, Mr. There Are
No Whats in America?

521
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,206
Mmm?

522
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,644
Cats.

523
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,409
It's me third wake today,
and I'm not finished.

524
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,839
We've got to do
something about them cats.

525
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,841
Besides paying Warren T. Rat
for no protection.

526
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,239
Oh, oh, poor lad.

527
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,479
So young.

528
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,247
He never had a chance to vote.

529
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,566
Well, he'll vote from now on.

530
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,889
I'll see to that.

531
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,319
Honest John.

532
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,399
It's Gussie Mausheimer!

533
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,801
Oh.

534
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,729
Ooh-whee, the richest and most
powerful mouse in New York.

535
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,329
What's she doing
slumming in this part of town?

536
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,959
There's a dead mouse on that table.

537
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,966
It's an Irish custom, Gussie.

538
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,079
The cats got him today.

539
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,279
Precisely why I am here to see you.

540
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,843
Would you care for a wee
drop of the creature?

541
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,079
Today was the worst ever.

542
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,599
Those cats are killing everyone!

543
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,199
They don't even know the
difference between rich and poor.

544
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,279
The wretches!

545
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,759
Oh, shameful!

546
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,599
As you know,
I have dedicated my life

547
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,482
to helping those less
fortunate than myself.

548
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,439
Uh, that's everyone.

549
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,571
And now I want you to help me.

550
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,639
We must have a wawwy.

551
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,519
A wawwy? What's a wawwy?

552
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,843
You know, a wawwy.

553
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,039
A large gathering
of mice for a reason.

554
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,919
Oh, a rally!

555
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,051
That's what I said, a wawwy.

556
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,399
Tomorrow at Mausheimer Park,
we will all decide what to do.

557
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,279
I'll bring the uptown mice

558
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,239
and you bring
the mice from downtown.

559
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,804
Madam,
you can count on Honest John.

560
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,479
At last, we're all getting
together about the cats.

561
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,719
Bridget.

562
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,239
Oh, Fillie.

563
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,759
Honest John, he's lost his family.

564
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,999
By any chance, do you
know the Mousekewitzes?

565
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,639
Oh, hmm.

566
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,771
Are they registered to vote?

567
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,439
They just got off the boat.

568
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,763
Oh.

569
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,039
Sorry, don't know them yet.

570
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,359
That's my mother and father.

571
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,128
The cats got them
two years ago November.

572
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,399
Now, don't you worry.

573
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,159
Yours are all right.

574
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,164
And they're out there somewhere.

575
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,440
Now.
Get some sleep.

Attention, please!

609
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,286
<i>You all know why we are here.</i>

610
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,559
<i>We have got to do something
about these cats.</i>

611
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,919
Not so loud! They'll hear you!

612
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,719
<i>So?
Let them hear me.</i>

613
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,359
You can talk!
You're rich!

614
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,079
<i>Money is not everything.</i>

615
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,719
I know, because I have money
and I have everything,

616
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,399
<i>but what are they
worth without freedom?</i>

617
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,879
Hear, hear!

618
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,239
Yeah! Right!

619
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,086
<i>Why did we come to America?</i>

620
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,879
For freedom!

621
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,959
Why are they building that statue?

622
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,359
What does it stand for?

623
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,966
Freedom!

624
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,199
So what do we want?

625
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,523
Freedom!

626
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,679
Right!

627
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,959
<i>Freedom from cats.</i>

628
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,879
And because this is America, we
can do something about them!

629
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,119
What do we do?

630
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,239
Papa, I can't see.

631
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,130
They're bigger than we are!

632
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,759
<i>Not if we all work together.</i>

633
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,322
What are you afraid of?

634
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,919
Are we men, or are we mice?

635
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,279
Mice!

636
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,002
Mice, indeed, and proud of it!

637
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,610
So, what are we going to do
about those cats?

638
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,841
Well?

639
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,279
Any ideas?

640
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,319
Ahem.

641
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,799
Oh, yes, well, I...

642
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,804
Oh, dear.

643
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,119
I have an idea.

644
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,599
Yes?

645
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,679
Hmm.

646
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,443
What did he say?

647
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,399
Uh, he, he said, uh...

648
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,564
Uh-huh.

649
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,199
Hmm...

650
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,489
Ohh.

651
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,842
Yes. Cute little fellow.

652
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,799
Wait a minute.

653
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,439
I think this little fellow
has got something here.

654
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,159
We have a plan!

655
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,210
Oh, Papa.
She's in the way again!

656
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,370
Look out below!

657
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,039
Shh!

658
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,810
We have a plan!
<i>E pluribus unum!</i>

659
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,919
Ladies and gentlemen,

660
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,608
I want to thank you so much
for your participation.

661
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,519
And I want to close by saying,
that a vote for Honest John

662
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,599
is a vote for freedom!

663
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,439
Freedom is what it is!

664
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,208
And thank you again, one and all!

665
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,359
Holy spumoni!

666
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,039
We should have been at
the pier an hour ago!

667
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,839
The pier?

668
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,049
That's a scary place!

669
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,079
I promised Bridget we'd be on time.

670
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,323
Wait for me! Wait!

671
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,319
Geez Louise, am I in the doghouse!

672
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,722
Pick 'em up!

673
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,159
Tell me what time it was, huh?

674
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,006
But, Tony, I can't tell time!

675
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,479
Tony, slow down! Wait!

676
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,405
Wait!

677
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,051
Papa?

678
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,199
Tony!

679
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,840
Papa!

680
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,921
I'm coming, Papa!

681
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,851
Papa?

682
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,851
All right, ante up, boys.

683
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,044
Hey, no cheating.

684
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,286
Hmm.

685
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,599
Ooh! I got it! I got it!

686
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,039
I got it!

687
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,727
Rummy!

688
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,524
Tiger, for the hundredth time,
we're playing poker.

689
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,605
I knew that. I knew that.

690
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,679
But who can concentrate with
all that, you know, noise?

691
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,526
Hey, Tiger.

692
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,119
When the boss plays, it's culture.

693
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,119
Sure, culture.

694
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,683
I think it sounds, uh, melodious.

695
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,124
"If music be the food of love,

696
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,843
"play on, McDuff, play on."

697
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,639
Oh, I don't know which is
worse, the music or the Shakespeare.

698
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,319
Rats! This nose, this nose
here keeps getting in the way!

699
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,119
You... You could stop playing.

700
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,799
That's funny.

701
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,879
I've never known a
cockroach with good taste.

702
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,719
But, I've known plenty that taste...

703
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,999
Good.

704
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,890
Play, play, play!

705
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,129
Ahem. Hmm.

706
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,199
Warren T!

707
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,999
You!

708
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,599
You're not a rat!
You're a cat!

709
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,959
How did you get in here?
Come here, you little...

710
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,839
Gentlemen, cat's out of the bag!

711
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,130
Get me that mouse!

712
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,959
Let me at him.

713
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,599
I mean, let me at him.

714
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,439
I'll kill him! Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

715
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,286
You just stepped on my tail!

716
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,605
Come here, you little runt!

717
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,805
Get him!

718
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,445
Get him!

719
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,879
Once more.

720
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,919
There is the boat.

721
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,719
The boat whistle blows
at 6:00 in the morning,

722
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,359
and that is when we must release

723
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,199
the secret weapon!

724
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,319
So, the cats must be here

725
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,199
at 6:00 on the dot,

726
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,279
not a moment before or after.

727
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,479
Now, when you go to get the cats,

728
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,359
what do you do to
make them come here?

729
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,759
Nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah.

730
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,079
Right!

731
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,839
Now get some sleep.

732
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,403
We have a long day ahead.

733
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,399
No, no, no.
Boss, it was not me.

734
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,679
I promise, that wasn't me.

735
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,079
Wake up.

736
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,482
Uh, wake up.

737
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,931
Jake! Wake up.

738
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,519
You're up.
Uh, go get some sleep, Jake.

739
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,480
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Rest, sleep.

740
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,599
On your guard, Tiger!

741
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,999
Don't make any funny moves.

742
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,679
'Cause I'm crafty, and I'm quick.

743
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,279
I have the instinct of a cat.
What am I saying?

744
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,519
I am a cat!

745
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,999
Oh, hey, now don't start that.

746
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,079
I didn't mean to scare
you that much, really.

747
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,199
It's okay, little buddy.
Hey, I'm your friend.

748
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,683
Aw, come on.
Be happy.

749
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,039
Aw.

750
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,519
Oh, come on.
What are you crying for?

751
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,199
I can't get out of
here and I have to,

752
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,959
so I can find my family.

753
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,559
You lost your family?

754
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,039
Mmm-hmm.

755
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,079
Oh, no.

756
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,399
That's terrible.

757
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,959
You know, I lost my family, too.

758
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,959
Years ago, I mean.

759
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,126
Eight brothers...
Ten sisters...

760
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,289
Three fathers...

761
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,639
Don't cry.

762
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,359
You'll find them.

763
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,331
Do you really think so?

764
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,279
Gee, you're nice.

765
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,079
Um, my name is Tiger.
What's yours?

766
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,399
Fievel, Fievel Mousekewitz.

767
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,245
Oh, dear.

768
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,399
Listen. I like mice.

769
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,719
Oh, no, not like that.

770
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,679
I mean, I don't eat
red meat at all.

771
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,759
I'm a vegetarian.
That's right.

772
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,519
Oh, a little fish now and then.

773
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,239
But what I really
like is some nice... Shh...

774
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,759
Broccoli.

775
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,559
You know, I thought all cats
were supposed to be mean.

776
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,123
Mean? Ha!
I am mean!

777
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,884
Then... And...
Aw, what's the use?

778
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,199
I like butterflies
with big golden wings

779
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,921
and blue and green tips.

780
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,279
Me, too!

781
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,199
Yeah? Ha.

782
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,319
I like Swiss cheese ice cream.

783
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,719
Me, too! Me, too!

784
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,639
You too, too? Hmm.

785
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,359
Wait a minute.
What's your favorite book?

786
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,719
Um, <i>The Brothers Karamazov.</i>

787
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,959
<i>The Brothers...</i>
I can't believe it.

788
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,250

Where did that come from? Don't.

836
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,767
Oh, stop it! Uh! Oh!

837
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,999
Tiger, how did he get away?

838
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,119
He overpowered me.

839
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,239
You're fired.

00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,971
Good. I'm glad.

841
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,959
I never liked you,

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,448
Help! Cats!

00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,645
Tony, Bridget, help!

846
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,159
Cats!

847
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,919
It's the cats!

848
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,159
Help!

849
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,559
Oh, they're early!

850
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:29,169
Wake up! Everybody, wake up!

851
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,159
Cats!

852
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,721
Help!

853
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,799
Wake up! The cats are here!

854
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,319
Wake up!

855
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,959
Cats!

856
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,919
The cats!

857
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,359
Release the secret weapon!

858
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,240
What? Release the... Oh, no!

859
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,119
Oh, no! Oh, no!

860
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,679
Oh, no! No, no!

861
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,359
Wait for the boat whistle!

862
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,762
Hold your fire.

863
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,239
It's that rat, Warren T.

864
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,199
He's not a rat.
He's a cat.

865
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,679
He's their boss.

866
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,079
Pay no attention to
that little mouse.

867
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,879
Just throw down all your
money and that kid.

868
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,319
And I will personally convince
these cats to leave you alone.

869
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,688
You're wrecking the plan!

870
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,441
It's not supposed
to happen this way!

871
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,879
Just throw down that kid!

872
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,964
Oh. yeah?

873
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,919
Bull's eye!

874
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,679
Disregard the nose.

875
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,239
What's in a nose?

876
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,999
A nose by any other name
would smell as sweet...

877
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,879
Great whiskers, it's a cat!

878
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,089
He's a cat!

879
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,079
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

880
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,559
Who are you going to believe,
me or your own eyes?

881
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,969
Release the secret...
No, no!

882
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,039
Hey, easy, easy!

883
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,239
All right. Then, I take
it we can't do business.

884
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,999
Warren, you're through.

885
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,759
Washed up, ruined!

886
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,559
You'll never get another cent

887
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,639
from any mouse, anywhere.

888
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,359
Eh? We'll see about that.

889
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,445
Just wait, you little rat.

890
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,039
Just wait.

891
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,884
<i>Adiós!</i>
Fire!

892
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,319
Oh! Tie it Off! Hurry!

01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,844
Oh, saints be praised.

894
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,767
It stopped.

895
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,365
Release the secret weapon!

896
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,319
Release? Oh, no!

897
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,399
Release the secret weapon!

898
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,279
Make up your mind!

899
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,648
Ooh, ooh! My goodness!

900
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,126
Release the secret weapon!

901
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,319
Release the weapon!

902
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:26,486
Release the blasted weapon!

903
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,079
Faster, papa.

904
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,845
We can't do business here, huh?

905
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,051
Release the secret weapon!

906
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,288
Faster!

907
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,599
Get a load of that.

908
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,439
It's the Giant Mouse of Minsk!

909
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,968
Oh, you're right.

910
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,081
Yay!

911
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,484
Head for the pier!

912
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,799
We did it!

913
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,919
Whoa!

914
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,079
They can't swim!

915
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
credit where it's due.

916
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:44,724
We owe it all to Fillie
and his Mouse of Minsk!

<i>♪ Now there are no
cats in America... ♪</i>

918
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,639
Fillie! Who's Fillie?

919
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,639
Someday,

And you, too, Mousekewitz.

921
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,003
All of you! I hate mice!

922
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,086
I'm having a heart attack here.

923
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,359
Oh, don't worry,
gentlemen. Don't worry.

924
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,519
There are plenty of
mice in Hong Kong.

01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,439
Oh, my! I'll have to learn
to calculate in Chinese.

01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,401
Hmm. Let me see, uh.

927
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,970
Hey, I wonder how you
say "trust me" in Chinese.

928
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,199
The pier's on fire!

929
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,999
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Bring that hose over here.

01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,559
You there, come on!

931
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,086
Fillie!

932
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,359
Fillie Mousekewitz!

933
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,999
Where are you?

934
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,879
Tony, look.

935
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,248
Fievel!

936
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,759
Fillie!

937
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,919
Papa, listen.

938
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,799
Fillie Mousekewitz!

939
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,399
Ah, so what? Someone is
calling a Fillie Mousekewitz.

940
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,639
They changed my name to Tilly.

941
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,799
Maybe they changed Fievel's
name to Fillie.

942
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,879
Come on, Papa. Just got to see.
Wait!

943
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,439
Stop! Stop!

944
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,205
Hurry. Hurry!

945
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,119
Fillie Mousekewitz!

946
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,919
Fillie!

947
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,679
Wait!

948
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,162
Stop! om

949
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,359
You are calling for
a Fillie Mousekewitz, right?

950
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:20,130
Here, tell my daughter his
name is Fillie and not Fievel.

951
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,919
His name is Fillie.

952
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,279
You see?

953
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,399
And Fievel.

954
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,279
And Fievel?

955
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,799
Papa.

956
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,839
No, no, no, there are many Fievel
Mousekewitzes in New York.

957
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,639
Maybe thousands.

958
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,329
It could still be
another Fievel Mousekewitz.

959
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,723
No, Papa.

960
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,844
Look.

961
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,199
Get a load of this, huh.

962
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,879
Hey, kid,
you're sleeping in my place.

963
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,079
Huh?

964
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,959
Hey, give me that!
Got any food on you?

965
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,559
Hey, what's your story?

966
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,799
I've been looking for my family.

967
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,441
Hey, fellows, he's
looking for his family.

968
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,039
He's looking for his family!

969
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,079
I stopped that a long time ago.

970
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,879
At least you know who they are.

971
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,959
Yeah!

972
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,079
Why are you looking for them?
They should be looking for you.

973
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,687
They don't care.
Forget them.

974
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,399
You're right, they don't care!

975
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,439
And if they did,
they would have found me.

976
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,159
Well, if they don't care,
I don't care!

977
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,040
I don't care if I
never see them again.

978
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,879
Yeah, you're nothing.
You're junk, you're trash.

979
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,162
Here.
Make yourself a bed.

980
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,679
I'll never find them again anyway.

981
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,608
Never

982
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,891
This is my home now.

983
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,326
Fievel!

984
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,891
Fievel!

985
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,765
Fievel!

986
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,039
Fillie!

987
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,205
Hey, Fillie Mousekewitz!

988
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,719
I never dreamt this morning
I would be riding a feline.

989
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,079
A feline?

990
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,399
A cat!

991
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,519
I knew that. I knew that.

992
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,959
Keep playing. Keep playing.

993
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,771
We will find him.

994
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,647
Fievel!

995
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,919
Fievel!

996
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,641
Fievel, where are you?

997
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,367
Fievel?

998
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,049
Fievel?

999
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,484
Papa?

1000
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,165
Papa?

1001
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,483
Papa.

1002
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,839
Fievel?

1003
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,844
Papa!

1004
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,648
Where are you?

1005
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,399
Papa!

1006
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,724
Fiev... Wait, stop!

1007
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,403
Fievel!

1008
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,048
I'm coming, Papa!

1009
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,119
Fievel!

1010
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,124
Papa!

1011
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,559
Fievel.

1012
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,919
Fievel!

1013
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,926
Mama, look!

1014
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,363
Mama!

1015
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,959
What's come over me?

1016
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,522
I am hugging a cat.

1017
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,319
I've never been so
happy in my life.

1018
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,725
I have friends,
lots of little tiny friends.

1019
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,083
Oh, Tony, isn't it grand?

1020
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,639
Say, I don't hear no
one thanking me here.

1021
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,281
Oh!

1022
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,889
Fievel, I knew
you were alive. I knew it!

1023
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,530
Oh, my little boy
back from the dead.

1024
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,839
America. Hmm.

1025
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,607
What a place.

1026
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,079
My Fievel.

1027
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,519
I thought I would
never see you again.

1028
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,839
Never say never, Papa.

1029
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,999
Oh!

1030
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,399
Oh! I nearly forgot.

1031
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,770
Here, Fievel, your hat.

1032
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,239
Your hat... It fits.

1033
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,359
My son.

1034
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,684
Now, you are a mouse.

1035
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,966
My statue is finished.

1036
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,199
Wait till you see her.

1037
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:26,528
She is beautiful.
<i>Magnifique.</i>

1038
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,329
Mama, look, don't be afraid
to open your eyes.

1039
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,599
Look what you're missing.
You're missing everything.

1040
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,519
Papa, when we land, I'll look.

1041
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,879
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1042
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,399
No, whoa!
This is... Oh, whoa, whoa!

1043
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,559
Oh, oh, this is nice.
Oh, thanks, fellas.

1044
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:49,168
I appreciate you coming back for me.
You in the front, higher, higher!

1045
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,809
Whoa!

1046
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,719
Oh, Henri, she's so beautiful.

1047
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,690
Wow.

1048
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,919
Henri, what's that over there?

1049
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,971
Oh, that is more America.

1050
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,879
Can we go see it?

1051
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,719
You will, my little American.

1052
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,124
Someday, you will.

1053
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,447
Bye, bye.

1054
