3
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,310
Why are you still here?

4
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,970
Go to the village and ask for help.

5
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,450
Don't tell me, all these graves...

6
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,770
Those bandits I killed...

7
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,160
Where did you take their bodies?

8
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:59,310
Why did you even bother to bury them?

9
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,180
Everyone here is the same
as the other. Dead.

10
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,820
Kid, what is your name?

11
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,200
Shinta.

12
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,250
Too soft for a Swordsman.

13
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,090
From now on, your name would be Kenshin.

14
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:58,100
And I will teach you my sword style.

15
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,820
This place...

16
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,019
Kenshin!

17
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Battousai!

18
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:54,090
Don't tell me, that this all what
the legendary Battousai can do?

19
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,710
Kaoru-dono...

20
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,180
So you've finally woken up.

21
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,340
Master...

22
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,290
Long time no see, My stupid apprentice.

23
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,300
Why am I here?

24
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,040
After the storm,
I went out to find some driftwood.

25
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,210
I didn't think I would find you.

26
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,220
Was there someone with me?

27
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,020
Only you and that weird sword.

28
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,020
What's wrong? Are you
expecting someone else?

29
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,019
Where did you find me?
I have to go back there!

30
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,020
Don't even bother.

31
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,240
You were out cold for three days.

32
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,270
Floating on sea for three days,
Nobody could have survived that.

33
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,240
Three days...

34
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,769
What's with that expression? You haven't
changed since the last time we met.

35
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:48,000
You and your habit of bearing
all the burdens of this country.

36
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,510
I had a dream.

37
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,070
I saw you in my dream.

38
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,300
I kept on digging graves.

39
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,250
Burying the dead.

40
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,190
Kept on digging...

41
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,170
Master... I have request.

42
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:12,290
Please teach me the final
techniques of Hiten Mitsurugi.

43
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,150
What did you say?

44
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,040
There is someone I have to stop.

45
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,110
Shishio Makoto followed my trail as an
assassin and planned to rule this country.

46
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:38,120
If he succeeds, people will suffer.

47
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,180
I am the only one who could stop Shishio!

48
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,600
And there is little time left.

49
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,800
I beg of you!

50
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,770
Alright.

51
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:12,120
Let me hear your story then.

52
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:23,080
My stupid apprentice. What have you
been doing these past fifteen years?

53
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,170
Using that weird sword...

54
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,110
Show me what you can do with it.

55
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,619
Today was not bad.

56
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,299
What?

57
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,599
What's wrong?

58
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:01,650
You guys don't hear that?
What is it?

59
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:06,110
That sound, don't you hear it?

60
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,450
What is that?

61
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,200
- We've got trouble!
- What's wrong?

62
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,709
There is a black ship!

63
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,599
What are you talking about?
What black ship?

64
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,420
Are you day-dreaming?

65
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,080
Check it for yourself!
The ship is like a monster!

66
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,770
What is that ship targetting?
Is there further movement?

67
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,970
- Hurry up and send soldiers and watch the surroundings.
- Yes sir!

68
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,050
So Shishio has arrived.

69
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,140
Finally, after twenty-five years,
fear is back to this country.

70
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:44,160
Ruling by fear,
is more effective than ruling by truth.

71
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,230
Hoji!

72
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,649
Start the preparations.

73
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,650
Understood!

74
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,849
We will be attacking soon!

75
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,170
We will be attacking!

76
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,200
Stop it!

77
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,210
Now is not the time to drink.

78
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Kenshin, Kaoru, Aren't
you worried for them?

79
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,170
- You think they're they gone?
- That can't be.

80
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,280
This is unforgivable!

81
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,290
Shinomori Aoshi.

82
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,050
That man.

83
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,100
Has become an enemy we have to kill!

84
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,240
What's wrong, Is that all you've got?

85
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,310
Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu
is an independent style.

86
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,310
Used to protect weak people.

87
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,160
And not for any other reasons.

88
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,620
But you forgot and instead,
used it for the Shogunate.

89
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,110
Was it your ego?
Or ambition?

90
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,140
None of those!

91
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,050
I have to learn it to wipe out
the sorrow in this country!

92
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,940
Who is he?

93
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,230
He said, few days ago he saw man with
scar on his cheek, lying on the beach.

94
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,310
Is that true?

95
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,369
How stubborn he is.

96
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,370
Where is that man?

97
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,620
Tell me!

98
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,310
Enough, Hoji.

99
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,619
That is a good thing.

100
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,140
It is even more interesting
than ruling this country.

101
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,510
Shishio-sama!
, what is? What is it?

102
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,230
Do not show weakness!

103
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,110
- Lets go!
- Yes sir!

104
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,849
We have been waiting for you!

105
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,280
Home Affairs Minister "Ito Hirobumi",
It is an honor.

106
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
Please.

107
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,970
It tastes good.

108
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,400
Have you tried this English food?

109
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,180
Don't worry. It's not poisoned.

110
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,220
You also "served" during the Bakumatsu era,
right?

111
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,000
How many you have killed?

112
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,599
For you to have the position like now,
How many you have murdered?

113
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,510
Dammit!
How dare you!

114
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,270
What are you doing?

115
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,250
It seems there had been
a misunderstanding here.

116
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,540
Sit down!

117
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,850
I said, take your seat!

118
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Abe! Please report that he died
because of disease on the way here!

119
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,880
You act fast.

120
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,220
A cruel crime like that,
surely will be punished by the government.

121
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,449
That is called justice!

122
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,220
Was there justice for me at that time?

123
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,320
This conversation is senseless.

124
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,300
So thats it?

125
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:52,050
Thanks to that "justice",
I am not able to sweat anymore.

126
00:19:53,290 --> 00:20:01,290
My body feels so hot,
I almost feel like dying.

127
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:09,160
It feels like being in hell.

128
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:23,040
Living like this...

129
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,000
Is hell itself.

130
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,140
You understand this, don't you?

131
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,250
It was you who created us.

132
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,260
- "Us"?
- Me and Battousai the Slasher.

133
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,240
If you still value your life,
then go find him.

134
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,080
Then, sentence him to death.

135
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,220
What did you say?

136
00:20:54,221 --> 00:21:00,910
This government has lied to people by
covering all the murders he did back then!

137
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,600
Is that forgivable?

138
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:16,740
Otherwise, I will destroy your government.

139
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:35,770
Citizens! Battousai the assassin has become
the police fugitive, his name is Himura Kenshin!

140
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,309
If you see him,
please contact nearest police!

141
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:44,850
He is often seen wearing red cloth
and there is cross scar in the cheek.

142
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:52,340
He will be punished because
has killed so many people!

143
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,300
If you see him,
please contact nearest police!

144
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,340
- You have returned.
- What is this?

145
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,880
That is Shishio's order.
We cant do anything.

146
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,190
Shishio's order?

147
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,570
He too was an assassin right?

148
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,020
Shishio also killed so many in Meiji era,
he should have been the one persecuted.

149
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,510
But Shishio threatens to
destroy this government!

150
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,180
We can not just refuse it.

151
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,020
About Himura...
the police will not find him easily.

152
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:51,080
Meanwhile, we collect information about
the ship and prepare weapons for defense.

153
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,449
I will not bring in Battousai!

154
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,250
What do you mean?

155
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:09,480
It seems this government
has forgotten the real hero.

156
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,910
What the fuck?

157
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:31,300
Hey, if he is a fugitive,
it means he is not dead yet.

158
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,680
Himura... is still alive?

159
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,650
Right!
They are still alive.

160
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,279
He must went to Kaoru's place.

161
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,510
But why he is charged with
murders in the Bakumatsu era?

162
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,739
- No time to waste, Yahiko lets go!
- Where?

163
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,800
Tokyo!
To Kamiya Dojo of course!

164
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,480
Besides, he's got nowhere to go but there.

165
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,220
Lets go!

166
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,220
- Execuse me!
- Yes!

167
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,569
What is it?

168
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,600
This belongs to this inn right?

169
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,820
Dont move.

170
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,710
Hey!

171
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,540
Kaoru!

172
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,420
Don't make noise in the hospital.

173
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,170
Sorry...

174
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,310
- Kaoru.
- Are you her relatives?

175
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,800
Yes, kinda.

176
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,210
Someone found her, and took her in.

177
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,080
Kaoru.

178
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,320
Kaoru, how are you doing?

179
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,620
Things have gotten worse!

180
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,130
We have promised to protect
each other right?

181
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,160
I told you so many times.

182
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,230
The sword is just a tool.

183
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,160
Sword styles are used for the killing part.

184
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,040
No matter how beautiful the blade is...

185
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,140
That remains the fact.

186
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,090
Stop with your nonsense...

187
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,200
And face the truth.

188
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,480
You said you want to protect people,
but instead you could do nothing.

189
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,480
Kaoru-dono.

190
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:41,650
You are still the same like the
kid who can only dig graves.

191
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:13,080
With your current ability...
how could you manage to finish the style?

192
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:22,740
Prove it to me with your stupid sword!

193
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,290
Be like then when you were a boy.

194
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:18,190
Even if you were beaten to a pulp,
you kept rising up.

195
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,680
Misao.

196
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,340
Grandpa.

197
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,940
Thank god!

198
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:18,150
Aoshi... where is he?

199
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,310
Is Kyoto alright?

200
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:33,130
Yes. But, Himura...

201
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,620
Is that so.

202
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,200
If Himura is still alive...

203
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,170
There's only one place he would come to!

204
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,310
Why don't you take a sip?

205
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,910
I made the sake myself.

206
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,680
Thank you.

207
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,570
Why do pottery?

208
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,050
I don't know...

209
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,770
Speaking of which...

210
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,260
I made it just for myself.

211
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,540
To me drinking sake, is really a fun thing.

212
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,420
That's it.

213
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,570
Is that so.

214
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,000
It reminds me to a saying...

215
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,400
In spring, Sakura flowers blossom.
In Summer, the stars appear.

216
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,050
In Fall, the full moon shows and in Winter,
the snow falls.

217
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,300
Just by seeing it,
the sake tastes really good.

218
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,650
If it doesn't taste good, then...

219
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,370
There must be something wrong in you.

220
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,370
I want to ask you...

221
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,970
About scar on your face.

222
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:42,050
During the Bakumatsu, there was
somebody called Battousai the Slasher.

223
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,280
The scar shows his cruelty.

224
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,200
It didn't sound like "You" how I once knew.

225
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,340
When I was on carrying out an order...

226
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,570
I got this scar.

227
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,740
In my mind, there was only killing.

228
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,650
I will not kill again, ever.

229
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,680
So thats why...

230
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,280
You have that weird sword.

231
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:25,480
Is your opponent right now
really that formidable?

232
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:34,110
Right now I can't even
beat Shishio's underling.

233
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:48,340
The strong lives, the weak dies.
Reality, plain and simple.

234
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:00,970
I will beat him,
even if I have to sacrifice my life.

235
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,880
Fool.

236
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,080
Then you are prepared to die here?

237
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,800
I will give you time.

238
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,710
You have to find out what's wrong with you.

239
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,220
Figure it out with that stupid
head of yours.

240
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,540
If you still don't know...

241
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,970
You'll die here.

242
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:04,280
What is wrong with me...

243
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,740
You didn't sleep last night?

244
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,280
So?

245
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,910
Have you figured
out what is wrong with you?

246
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,680
Not yet.

247
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,250
Now that is your problem.

248
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:19,710
Figure out what is wrong with you,
by fighting me as your enemy.

249
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,680
If you can beat me with that blade...

250
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:40,450
But if you can't,
It means that you are still afraid
of that slasher instinct in your heart.

251
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:52,170
You are afraid that you will live in
suffering, sadness, and loneliness...

252
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,820
If you kill again.

253
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,170
Well then...

254
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:12,340
Will I be able to help the
monster Battousai the Slasher...

255
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,820
To put and end to
Shishio once and for all?

256
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:52,800
I am trembling.
Am I afraid of my master, Hiko Seijuro?

257
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,200
No. Am I afraid of death itself?

258
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,340
No, that's not it.

259
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,880
During the Bakumatsu war,
I was always prepared to die.

260
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,970
Even if it costs my life...

261
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,290
I will finish the technique!

262
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:02,080
Not yet!
I can't die yet!

263
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,400
Finally, you've come to realize it.

264
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:24,740
You took so many lives during
the battle as a slasher...

265
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:33,370
And because of that regret, you think
to yourself that your life is worthless.

266
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:44,850
And to overcome that,
you must learn to control your feelings.

267
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,800
You need the willingness to live on.

268
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,710
Willingness to live...

269
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:07,420
You've become weaker because
you've spent most of
your life protecting helpless people.

270
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,080
To the point where you
don't understand your own.

271
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:27,140
Your life is as worth
as other people's lives.

272
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,940
When you realize that...

273
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,620
You will be able to finish the technique.

274
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,970
My life...

275
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:56,510
Your life doesn't belong to your own.

276
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,280
You understand?

277
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,310
C'mon. Let's continue.

278
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,280
What's for lunch today?

279
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:45,230
- What's wrong with you? Here, drink.
- Shut up! Drink it yourself.

280
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,540
What's wrong?
Piss off!

281
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,540
Kaoru!

282
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,940
Yahiko!

283
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:18,000
- You need to stay alive!
- Kaoru-dono!

284
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,800
Kaoru!
Hey, found you!

285
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,770
- Kaoru!
- Hey.

286
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:05,130
- You made us worried.
- You fool!

287
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,650
I am so worried about you. Are you okay?

288
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,220
I'm waiting for Kenshin.

289
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,599
Is that so?
Kenshin? Where is he?

290
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,000
Kenshin!
Kenshin!

291
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,310
Stupid!
Thats not what she meant.

292
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,680
She is hoping for Kenshin's return.

293
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,050
Lets go!

294
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:40,200
- Where are we going?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

295
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,110
To Tokyo.

296
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,710
Kaoru.

297
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,050
Leaving already?

298
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:56,170
There is no time.
I have to stop Shishio as soon as possible.

299
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,160
Don't just rely on that technique.

300
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:08,400
You alone, bearing all the burden.

301
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,400
Just be careful in this Meiji era.

302
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,710
Understood.

303
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,540
Himura!

304
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,399
Himura!

305
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,710
Misao-dono.

306
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,480
- I was worried about you.
- Why are you here?

307
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,710
Nevermind that. Kaoru is alive!

308
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:43,940
A lot of things had happened.
Shishio is controlling the government...

309
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,219
They will arrest you.

310
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,400
Grandpa instructed me to go look for you.

311
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,600
Hurry up and leave.

312
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,279
Your willingness to live...

313
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,850
Is the most important of all.

314
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,910
Promise me, Kenshin.

315
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:25,820
You won't waste your life.

316
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,250
Yes.

317
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,510
Master.

318
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,340
Thank you for looking after me.

319
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,600
Don't die.

320
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:23,540
The government had made you a fugitive.

321
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,200
If you get caught, you will be executed.

322
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,680
Himura-dono, I have a map to a secret
path which we used during the Edo era.

323
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,880
Please make use of it.

324
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,680
Thank you.

325
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,770
Misao-dono.
I would like to say goodbye to Okina-dono.

326
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,200
I understand.

327
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,310
Grandpa, Himura is back.

328
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,910
But he was just awake...

329
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,880
Is there something you're not telling me?

330
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:54,340
A secret path to the north used by Ninjas.

331
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:02,120
I myself would take this route.

332
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:08,340
Himura will pass this route...

333
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,220
You have thought about that, haven't you?

334
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:25,600
But Himura-kun has very important task,
that is to beat Shishio.

335
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:38,130
I will not let you stand in his way.

336
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,110
What can you do with that body?

337
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:50,400
You are trapped in the past.
I will free you from that!

338
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,450
Grandpa!

339
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,340
Elder!

340
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,650
Grandpa.

341
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:29,200
That cross-shaped scar...
You are indeed Battousai the Slasher.

342
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,110
Grandpa.

343
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,339
I have been waiting for ten
long years for this moment.

344
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,570
Leader of Oniwabanshu Watchers in Edo,
Shinomori Aoshi.

345
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:49,140
I will take the "Strongest" title from you!

346
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,080
C'mon, Battousai!

347
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,770
Right, this will become a fierce battle.

348
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,200
Himura-kun!

349
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,880
Kill Aoshi...

350
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,200
for Misao.

351
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:34,620
And for Aoshi himself.

352
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:38,800
- Grandpa!
- Right, kill me.

353
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:44,050
I'd like to see you try to kill me!

354
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:54,050
Make sure you kill him!

355
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:08,970
Shinomori Aoshi, have you realized
that you've hurt Misao-dono?

356
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,880
Why you are so cruel to her?

357
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:18,170
For the strongest title...

358
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:23,260
I can be even crueler than anybody!

359
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,370
I don't know you anymore!

360
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,260
- Don't interfere!
- Misao-dono!

361
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,170
Stand up, Battousai the Slasher.

362
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,570
You were the strongest
during the Bakumatsu era.

363
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:27,880
I have sacrificed
everything just to beat you.

364
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:59,250
Aoshi,
that deep hatred you got from the past...

365
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:06,280
I may not be able to understand it.

366
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:12,680
But not realizing what is
already in front of you,

367
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,330
Betraying people and even
raising your sword against them.

368
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:22,270
That is the reason why
you'll never beat me.

369
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:56,220
Aoshi-sama!

370
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,000
This isn't over yet!
I can still fight!

371
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:21,820
When you have realized what
is really precious to you...

372
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:27,540
And if you want the
"Strongest" title from me...

373
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,880
I will fight you anytime.

374
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,250
Miss!
The Elder...

375
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:00,219
Grandpa!

376
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:02,220
Okina-dono!

377
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:08,449
You must go now.
Now isn't the time to worry about us!

378
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:13,200
Don't forget the elder's request!

379
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:20,050
The future of Japan rests in your sword!

380
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:26,170
Himura, leave us...

381
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,880
Quickly!

382
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:38,620
GO!

383
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,080
If you want to take revenge, do it quickly.

384
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:22,510
I don't need your pity.

385
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,220
Your life...

386
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,480
Belongs to me now...

387
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:51,820
Belongs to grandpa...

388
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:59,140
And also to the others...

389
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,850
- Megumi-dono.
- Kenshin-San.

390
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,650
I was worried about you.

391
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:48,799
Thanks.

392
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,019
Did you meet Kaoru and Sanosuke?

393
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,339
Yes.

394
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,340
Thank goodness.

395
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,910
Stay and hide here first,
I will make you tea.

396
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,300
I am in a hurry.

397
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,450
I have to stop Shishio now.

398
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,800
I understand.

399
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,370
But, listen.

400
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,600
Even if you are badly hurt,
please return alive.

401
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,800
I am doctor.

402
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,910
If you're dead,
I wont be able to do anything.

403
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:34,060
But if you alive, I will surely treat you.

404
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,220
Before thinking of other people,
please think yourself first.

405
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,020
Just like what my master said.

406
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,020
What?

407
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:53,250
Please wait a moment.

408
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,740
Wear this.

409
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,450
The sword is just a tool for killing.

410
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:14,190
To help the helpless people,
is the motto of Kamiya Kashin-ryu.

411
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,740
It is not to kill.

412
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:22,110
But to help people.

413
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:34,570
I knew it, It fits you well.

414
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:41,600
Please take care Kaoru.

415
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,910
Arrest him!

416
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,000
Himura Battousai, Surrender now!

417
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:02,850
This place has been surrounded,
you cant go anywhere again!

418
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,510
Surrender!
Surrender!

419
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:13,249
You guys... Don't you have any shame?

420
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,289
Megumi-dono.

421
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:19,820
You were attacking Shishio,
now you become his dogs?

422
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:25,200
If you want to get Kenshin,
step over my dead body first!

423
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:28,130
- Arrest him!
- Megumi-dono.

424
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,309
Thank you.

425
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,310
Get him!

426
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:41,710
Please stay there.

427
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,540
Enough.

428
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,740
I don't want violence anymore.

429
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,020
Tie him up!

430
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,850
Kenshin-San!

431
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,219
News!

432
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,400
Battousai the Slasher has been arrested!

433
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:12,450
Battousai the Slasher has
finally been arrested!

434
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:28,340
Finally...

435
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,800
Your body has become hotter than the usual.

436
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,220
Yes.

437
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,940
Can I wish you for something?

438
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,910
What is it?

439
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:45,370
If you keep on fighting,
your body temperature will be so hot.

440
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,650
Shishio-sama, thats because of your burns.

441
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,170
How long?
How much time do I have?

442
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,880
Your fighting limit is fifteen minutes.

443
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:04,170
You better avoid blade fight.

444
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:09,540
Fifteen minutes huh?

445
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,310
That's so short.

446
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:29,600
On your knees!

447
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,000
Follow me.

448
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,740
Come in.

449
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,940
Ito-San?

450
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,680
I am thinking of giving you more time.

451
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,480
I am sorry, Himura...

452
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:50,170
But I have to sacrifice you.

453
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:54,400
If you want it this way,
why did you arrest me?

454
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,879
Shishio doesn't want to negotiate.

455
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,710
He intends to rule this country.

456
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:10,510
If the murders you've done before
on the Meiji era is counted,

457
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:14,850
Obviously, you will be punished
severly by the government.

458
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,800
That is his plan.

459
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:24,110
He has a giant ship near Tokyo coast,
he can attack anytime.

460
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:27,200
We have no other choice.

461
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,110
But, if we fight him now...

462
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,880
There would be great damage.

463
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,370
Ito-San...

464
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,200
Will you let me be killed like this?

465
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:59,940
If I can get near Shishio, I can beat him.

466
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:15,420
Is that so?
Interesting.

467
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:19,250
Then do it.

468
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:31,420
I will hold the legendary
Battousai's execution.

469
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,169
You have got to be kidding me!

470
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:38,910
They will execute him like in Edo era?

471
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,370
What are they doing?

472
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:43,820
We have to go, hurry!

473
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,450
Make way!

474
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,210
Kenshin!

475
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,450
Kenshin!

476
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:50,680
Kenshin!

477
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,140
Kenshin!

478
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:18,400
You monster!
Die, you!

479
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,999
Where is Shishio?

480
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,340
Shishio told me to watch
you being executed.

481
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,020
You fool.

482
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:02,170
You are so stupid upon
helping the government.

483
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:06,799
Yet there was no reward for you.

484
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:13,120
Tell Shishio, I will be
waiting him in hell.

485
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,400
You think you can fight him?

486
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:37,600
- Hey!
- Kenshin!

487
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,880
Step away!

488
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:42,050
Hey! Kenshin!

489
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:46,220
Kenshin! Wait!

490
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:08,110
Hereby is sentenced to death...

491
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:16,400
With accusations of killing so
many people in the Bakumatsu era.

492
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:25,770
With that vicious past, is unforgivable...

493
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,219
What is wrong?

494
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:37,650
- Hurry up!
- Continue!

495
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:42,050
Give it to me!

496
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:54,850
Himura Battousai!
That vicious past...

497
01:23:55,020 --> 01:24:01,770
is unforgivable in this new era!

498
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,540
Listen, Battousai...

499
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,220
No...

500
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:16,800
I will read some names he
killed before the Meiji era!

501
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:30,510
The following are the names;

502
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:34,450
A young Kujo samurai, Hitsui Naoie.

503
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:39,310
First son of Madero Koji family,
Oguri Atsumori.

504
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:44,170
Kujo samurai, Shimamura Tatsumasa.

505
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:48,850
Matsumura Korosuke.

506
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:54,280
Also, Kazuno Katsumasa, Nagano Kusisuke.

507
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:59,420
Two brothers from Hikone...

508
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:03,020
Akizuki Tokuba, Kanbei Taro.

509
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:07,140
A samurai, Toda Goemon.

510
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:13,540
A doctor, Makino Hitoshi.

511
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:20,680
Takigawa Masahiko, and Inoue Kagehiro.

512
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:29,310
And the young samurai leader from Kyoto
who was about to Mary, Kiyosata Akira!

513
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:34,680
At the time like this,
you are going to marry?

514
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:37,480
Yes. I'm sorry, I can't help it.

515
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:44,570
The victims were supposed
to be hopes of this country.

516
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:48,510
That was cruel!

517
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:56,340
As per your sins,
you deserved to be executed!

518
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,800
I cannot die now!

519
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:04,110
I have someone precious to me.

520
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,600
I can not die yet!

521
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:21,170
I don't want to die... don't want to die...

522
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:31,080
The reason you can't win,
is because you heart became
cold after killing so many people.

523
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,820
In that way, you can't win.

524
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:46,910
You will live in suffering, sadness,
and loneliness if you go back to murder.

525
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:58,740
I will not go back to being a murderer!

526
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:09,650
Then the legend, ends!

527
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:15,020
Kenshin!

528
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:22,050
I will not...

529
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:26,680
Your life is as worth
as other people's lives.

530
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:33,020
Before thinking of somebody else,
think about yourself first.

531
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,600
- Wait!
- No!

532
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:04,170
The show is over!

533
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,910
Himura-San!

534
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,420
Tell me you got rid of that useless
blade of yours and have a new one.

535
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:20,000
This blade is new but not useless.

536
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:26,850
A blade that doesn't kill.
The reverse-edged sword.

537
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:32,740
Here we go!

538
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:40,680
Retreat!
Get back to ship!

539
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:57,370
Damn you!

540
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,200
Kenshin!

541
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:24,510
- Sano.
- Don't fight alone!

542
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,340
- Where is Kaoru?
- She's over there, don't worry about her.

543
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,710
Prepare the boat!

544
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,880
Kenshin!

545
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:57,820
- That's where were headed right?
- Yes!

546
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:29,710
Why are you wasting your life?

547
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:35,080
I am doing this...

548
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,540
For the sake...

549
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:42,220
Of the new era!

550
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:47,100
New era my ass!

551
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,710
You've done a great job.

552
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:15,880
Fire!

553
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,140
Kenshin!

554
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:34,170
- Kenshin!
- Kenshin...

555
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,110
Kenshin!

556
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:38,050
Kenshin...

557
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,400
Who are you?

558
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:49,310
Man with bandages, come out!

559
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:46,000
Damn.

560
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:51,600
Hey, you okay?
Hang on!

561
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:57,710
What the hell are you chanting about?

562
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:15,080
I fought with a Christian, but...

563
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:18,970
I never had a fight with a monk before.

564
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,770
Ouch!
I better get serious.

565
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:39,420
- This Shishio's crew is not bad.
- Crew?

566
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:45,020
Fool! We just don't like the Meiji
government has done in this "new era".

567
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:51,210
A man who was desperate and
couldnt do anything, Sadojima Hoji.

568
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,650
Because the Meiji
government took Yoshiwara...

569
01:34:55,820 --> 01:35:01,020
This poor lady was banished, Komagata Yumi.

570
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:10,970
Because of the restoration,
he lost his feelings and is always
laughing while killing, Seta Sojiro.

571
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:17,600
Thats why we gather around Shishio-sama.

572
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:20,620
I don't like new government either, but...

573
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:23,940
It seems that peace has
finally shown in this country...

574
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:27,200
And I won't let you destroy it!

575
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:49,940
Long time no see, Himura-sama. How are you?

576
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:52,340
I have no time to play with you.

577
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,170
How stubborn!

578
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:56,230
Where is Shishio?

579
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,140
You can't beat him...

580
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,940
Because he is a monster.

581
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:42,110
It seems that you are faster than before.

582
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:46,570
But back then, you lost to me.

583
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:51,480
You will lose too, this time.

584
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:20,850
You cant kill me, damn monk!

585
01:37:57,770 --> 01:38:00,170
What?

586
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:18,170
What?

587
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:20,850
This is weird.

588
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:23,940
Life is not just about power.

589
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:35,600
This really sucks!

590
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:44,400
In the end, in this world,
the strong live, the weak die!

591
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,650
The strong will live!

592
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:58,620
The weak will die!

593
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:06,170
The strong live, the weak die!

594
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:14,450
Just like that!

595
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:24,340
The fight is over.

596
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:32,339
I... did I make a mistake?

597
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:36,280
No, the deciding factor of this fight...

598
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,970
Is the one who has a stronger will,
just like Shishio said.

599
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:49,420
If you fight to find the answer from
the truth, it wouldn't be wrong.

600
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:55,650
The answer from the truth...

601
01:39:56,170 --> 01:40:02,050
You will find it,
by looking in your own life.

602
01:40:57,310 --> 01:40:59,370
Take this!

603
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:03,020
See you later!

604
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:17,480
That was fun.

605
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,110
Next time watch your ball...

606
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:29,710
- What the hell?
- Keep firing!

607
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:51,250
Wait a minute! This is too early!
Who told you to fire?

608
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:57,020
Himura and others are still there.

609
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,080
Keep firing!

610
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:07,480
Was it an order from Ito-sama?

611
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:31,080
Hoji.

612
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:35,770
- Don't bother anymore.
- Understood.

613
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:46,850
Finally we meet again, Senior.

614
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:50,170
Pardon me for making you wait.

615
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:56,740
How arrogant you are.
Can you even fight with those wounds?

616
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,140
See for yourself before saying that.

617
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:07,480
I wonder when this fight
will come to an end.

618
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:20,170
In the eyes of this government,
you and I are both the same.

619
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:27,080
Hence, they intend to drown
us together to the sea.

620
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:41,540
Let's finish this.

621
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:04,000
Shishio-sama!
You are strong! Very strong!

622
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:07,310
Is that all you've got, Senior?

623
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:25,820
Magnificent!

624
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:33,600
Hey, hey!

625
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:36,400
This is not over yet, is it?

626
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:58,110
Saito-San, long time no see!

627
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,910
You came here to be
beaten up to a pulp huh?

628
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:04,850
I've come to avenge my men.

629
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:10,000
Really?
Show me what you can do then.

630
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:32,910
C'mon!
That can not kill Shishio sama!

631
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:35,079
I will finish you!

632
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:36,850
Is that so?

633
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:46,740
Too bad, Saito-San!

634
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:58,050
So you're Shishio?!

635
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:00,679
Hey, Hoji, do something!

636
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,600
- Your enemy would be me!
- Fuck off!

637
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,250
You are bothering me!
Who are you?

638
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,540
That doesn't hurt at all!

639
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:30,280
What are you?

640
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:36,220
C'mon stand up!

641
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:45,600
You're no match for me.

642
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:02,850
So boring.

643
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:06,170
Is that all you've got?

644
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:13,770
What are you doing, Senior?

645
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:17,370
I will end this now.

646
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:29,600
Who are you?
Another man to beat?

647
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:32,169
I am the one who will beat Battousai.

648
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:34,099
Aoshi...

649
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:38,230
I will not let anybody else do that.

650
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:59,250
Don't die, Kenshin!

651
01:48:59,420 --> 01:49:03,200
Who are you?
You are blocking! Get lost!

652
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:15,880
You are all bothering!

653
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:44,280
I said, you are really bothering!

654
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:47,600
Get lost!

655
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:14,220
Damn!
Do they want to drown us all?

656
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:50,510
Kenshin, move away!

657
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:09,880
If that's the case!

658
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:33,310
Die!

659
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:45,940
It feels like I'm like burning in hell!

660
01:51:47,310 --> 01:51:50,110
Getting hotter...

661
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:54,800
Getting fun!

662
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:08,450
This is bad!
If this continues...

663
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:12,910
Shishio-sama!

664
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,510
Shishio-sama!

665
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:20,510
Stop this!

666
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:25,419
He can't fight anymore!

667
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,509
Don't torment Shishio-sama.

668
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:30,510
Please!

669
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:39,820
Don't be too careless.

670
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:43,370
The fight has not yet ended.

671
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:54,910
Damn you!
How could you do that?

672
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:59,940
How could you betray someone who loves you.

673
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:02,570
You bastard...

674
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:06,220
Someone like you wouldn't understand!

675
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:16,450
I am happy.

676
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,050
For the first time...

677
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:27,020
I can be useful to you... in a fight.

678
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:31,370
Please wait for me in hell.

679
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,909
Kenshin!

680
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:52,910
Enough of this!

681
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,570
This time I will finish you!

682
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:05,250
Come here then!

683
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:02,910
Stand up!

684
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:06,220
Hey!

685
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:09,310
C'mon stand up!

686
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:56,220
Shishio...

687
01:55:57,820 --> 01:56:02,450
The likes of us are not needed anymore.

688
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:05,420
The era of killing is over.

689
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:08,280
Not yet.

690
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:13,370
Not until I rule this country.

691
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,800
It is over.

692
01:56:33,310 --> 01:56:37,140
I will beat you with this sword!

693
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:39,420
Go ahead!

694
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:43,420
This is the end!

695
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:26,405
"Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryu ougi,
Amakakeru Ryu No Hirameki."

696
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:31,270
Heaven's Sword style ultimate technique:
Heavenly Flash of the Flying Dragon.

697
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:54,339
Don't forget, Himura!

698
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:58,050
The era that made you!

699
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:05,250
I am not done yet!

700
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:25,310
It's been a while. I don't get to
enjoy fighting like this lately.

701
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:30,000
Pleasure like in the Bakumatsu era.

702
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:37,480
I have to rule this country!

703
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:45,710
I have no time to play!

704
01:58:57,820 --> 01:59:01,080
I will see you in hell...

705
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,740
Battousai!

706
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:54,680
Shishio Makoto...

707
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:03,940
It's over.

708
02:01:30,570 --> 02:01:32,509
Let me go!

709
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:34,510
Stop it!

710
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:48,280
Let go!

711
02:02:09,650 --> 02:02:11,020
Kenshin!

712
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:20,799
Kenshin!

713
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,799
I will help.

714
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,169
Yahiko.

715
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,170
You are still alive.

716
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:31,940
Thank goodness you are alive.

717
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:37,820
Aoshi-sama!

718
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:44,510
Good work!
You all managed to survived.

719
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:50,570
- What the hell was that! We fought for you all!
- Sano!

720
02:03:55,080 --> 02:04:00,000
Shishio is dead. Are you satisfied now?

721
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:05,020
I see.

722
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:08,850
So Shishio is dead?

723
02:04:10,110 --> 02:04:14,000
Now we don't have to worry, Kawaji.

724
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:16,740
Yes.

725
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:29,020
Battousai is dead!

726
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:36,510
Dead along with the Bakumatsu era!

727
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:48,570
Himura...

728
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:51,540
Kenshin.

729
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:55,710
Am I right?

730
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:08,510
Give salute to the Samurais!

731
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:06,170
Seasons have changed.

732
02:08:11,770 --> 02:08:15,020
The era where Kenshin was murderer...

733
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:20,510
Has ended.

734
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:55,020
It is a very beautiful leaf.

735
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:05,140
I will keep living like this.

736
02:09:15,650 --> 02:09:17,080
Keep living...

737
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:22,510
In the new era.

738
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:33,880
Kaoru-dono, would you like to
live in this new era with me?

739
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:38,740
What?

740
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:56,740
(♪ ONE OK ROCK - HEARTACHE)

741
02:09:57,305 --> 02:10:57,603
