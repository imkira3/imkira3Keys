2
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:59,587
Ibn Al Abbas, Ibn Rasid, Ibn Hammad.

3
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:02,632
And things were not always thus.

4
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:07,595
At one time, I was a poet ...

5
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,765
in the greatest city in the world.

6
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:14,769
Life was easy,
And I lived without care ...

7
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:18,398
until one fateful day ...

8
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:21,317
I met a beautiful woman ...

9
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:23,611
who belonged to another man.

10
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:29,576
Her jealous husband
Complained to the Caliph ...

11
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:33,997
who made me the ambassador
to the land of the Tossuk Vlad --

12
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:37,917
a country far to the north.

13
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:40,503
I was banished from my home ...

14
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,839
and from all that I knew.

15
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:48,219
So, I journeyed by camelback many months
into the lands of barbarian peoples --

16
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:52,640
accompanied by Melchisidek,
an old friend of my father --

17
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:56,895
through the lands of the Ogus,
the Khazars and the Bulgars,

18
00:01:57,062 --> 00:02:00,690
into the lands of murderous bandits,
called "Tartars,"

19
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:04,402
who attack caravans,
slaughtering everyone.

20
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:06,863
The Tartars are coming!

21
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,199
The Tartars are coming!

22
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:12,035
The Tartars --

23
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:15,663
Run! Run for your life!

24
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:51,866
They have stopped.
They are not following.

25
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:55,245
- A boat! A boat!
- They're Northmen! A boat!

26
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,747
A boat! Over there!

27
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:00,583
Look! They are going!

28
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,920
They are leaving!

29
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:08,383
Move! Move! Keep moving!

30
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,301
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Wait, wait, wait!

31
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:12,637
Those men in the boat, who are they?

32
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:16,182
The Northmen.
Keep moving and keep quiet!

33
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:18,226
Why? Are they dangerous?

34
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:22,564
It depends. Maybe they'll let us go,
Or maybe they'll kill us.

35
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,862
I am an ambassador, damn it!

36
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:31,781
I am supposed to talk to people!

37
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:34,159
You may yet have the opportunity.

38
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:47,964
What do you suppose the potentate
of this encampment calls himself?

39
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,966
Oh, emperor, at the very least.

40
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,968
Hmm. Emperor.

41
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:13,656
We seek your --

42
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:19,204
We seek your headman, your king.

43
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,250
Try Greek.

44
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:35,261
Eh?

45
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:59,536
He says their king
is out there in that tent.

46
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:04,165
He says the king
will not speak to us.

47
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:10,964
Apparently, the king won't
speak to us because he's dead.

48
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,425
This is his funeral.

49
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:23,852
You are being introduced to
one of the heirs apparent --

50
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,813
-Buliwyf.

51
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,908
"Buliwyf wishes a song of glory."

52
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,870
Recite a poem, a tale.

53
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:44,289
Surely you remember something.

54
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,917
Uh --

55
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:53,506
In the beginning,
the Earth was void,

56
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:56,843
and the spirits of God passed --

57
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:15,111
Now that there was a new king,

58
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:18,281
the Northmen prepared
for the funeral of their old king.

59
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:29,709
"We will burn him. In one moment,
he and all he owns can be in paradise.

60
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:36,341
These are our gifts to our lord
to support his kingdom in paradise.

61
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:40,220
To take with him?

62
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:44,724
Lo there do I see my father.

63
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:51,398
'Lo there do I see my mother,
my sisters and my brothers.

64
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:54,818
'Lo there do I see
the line of my people ...

65
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:57,946
back to the beginning.

66
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,824
'Lo they do call to me.

67
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,160
They bid me take my place among them
in the halls of Valhalla,

68
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,996
where the brave may live forever.

69
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:10,667
"She will travel with him.

70
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:14,337
You will not see this again.
It is the old way."

71
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:18,109
Another ship arrived
during the night.

72
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:21,863
There's a boy standing out there
on the bow like he's a statue.

73
00:08:31,498 --> 00:08:33,750
The boy is letting them see him.

74
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,919
He's in plain sight!

75
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:39,172
They do not know
If what they see is real.

76
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,800
Something to do with the mist.

77
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:45,887
Apparently, they find dangerous things,
spirits in the mist.

78
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:51,393
The boy was being polite, giving them
time to decide if he's real.

79
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:47,741
He's a messenger.

80
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:51,244
He comes from their homeland
in the north with a message for Buliwyf.

81
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:57,584
He is Wulfgar,

82
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:02,172
son of King Hrothgar,
a great king from the north.

83
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:05,759
He comes to ask Buliwyf for help.

84
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:09,637
His father's kingdom is under attack.
Their village is destroyed.

85
00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:14,934
They are menaced
By an ancient evil, a terror.

86
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,520
A terror that has no name.

87
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:21,483
A terror that must not be named.

88
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,617
Look at them. What thing
would affect them so?

89
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:38,249
"The name cannot be said."

90
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:46,216
"He calls for the Angel of Death."

91
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:06,486
He calls for the bones.
She's an oracle.

92
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:21,418
She calls for men, a number of them.

93
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:27,340
Thirteen.
The number of months in the year.

94
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,676
"She says 13 men must go."

95
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:17,223
Eight.

96
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:21,311
Nine.

97
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:30,320
Ten.

98
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:38,578
Eleven.

99
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:49,422
Twelve.

100
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:22,247
"She says the 13th man
must be no Northman."

101
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:31,881
What the hell are you saying?

102
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:34,426
The 13th warrior is you.

103
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,866
He thinks Your horse is too small.

104
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:04,998
Something about, "Only an Arab
Would bring a dog to war."

105
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:12,047
"He wishes to know your name."

106
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:17,886
I am Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan,
Ibn Al Abbas, Ibn Rasid --

107
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:20,096
- "Eban."
- No, no.

108
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:24,934
Listen. Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan.
"Ibn" means "son of".

109
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:26,519
Eban.

110
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:29,064
Hyah! Hup!

111
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:36,946
What is he saying?

112
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:40,617
"Hurry to meet death
before your place is taken."

113
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:59,469
I will not forget you.
Go with God.

114
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:01,471
You listening?

115
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,053
... tomorrow.

116
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:31,186
... sneak up to steal
ten or twelve horses.

117
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:49,662
... we can find some geese.

118
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:53,291
So then he says,
"Do not foretell me wife,

119
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,795
for I will get to know so-proven
aye comin home tonight."

120
00:16:56,961 --> 00:17:00,006
I don't sound like that.

121
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:05,303
Roneth slept with her
while we took the horses.

122
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,139
Blowhards, both of you.

123
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:11,768
She probably was
some smoke-colored camp girl.

124
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,770
Looked like that one's mother.

125
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,650
My mother ...

126
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:26,700
was a pure woman ...

127
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,499
from a noble family.

128
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,584
And I,

129
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:39,087
at least,

130
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:41,756
know who my father is,

131
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:45,093
you ...

132
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:49,931
pig-eating son of a whore.

133
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:51,975
No, no, no, no, no! Wait!

134
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:53,977
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Come.

135
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:59,023
- Come on.
- Where did you learn our language?

136
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,944
I listened!

137
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:33,099
You can draw ... sounds?

138
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:37,562
"Draw sounds"?

139
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:43,735
Yes, I can draw sounds,

140
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:48,698
and I can speak them back.

141
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:50,784
Show me.

142
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:05,256
There is only one God ...

143
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,471
and Muhammad is His prophet.

144
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:23,066
Bring me those sacks.

145
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:25,318
- Hey!
- Mind yourself.

146
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:28,071
Be quiet.

147
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:31,700
Only an "Arab" ... would bring --

148
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:34,411
A dog to war?

149
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:36,413
I heard this the first time.

150
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,477
Good going, "Arab."

151
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:28,214
Come on.

152
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:41,269
The dog can jump.

153
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:58,495
Here.

154
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:02,290
- No, no.
- Eat!

155
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:12,217
Shouldn't we stay closer to land?

156
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:16,221
No, boy! This is no day
to be close to land!

157
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:33,446
Odin!

158
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:48,795
Odin!

159
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,140
Odin!

160
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:03,017
Down.

161
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:11,943
- What did you -- What is that --
- Be silent.

162
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:17,198
Odin!

163
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:30,086
Land!

164
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:44,142
"Arab, speak what I draw."

165
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:53,318
There is only one God ...

166
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:56,363
and Muhammad is his ...

167
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:03,912
prophet.

168
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:11,961
Go.

169
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:16,049
Here.

170
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:18,051
You'll need this.

171
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:22,347
I cannot lift this.

172
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:25,225
Grow stronger.

173
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,853
Rider.

174
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:34,901
Well-fed on a light mount.

175
00:23:38,113 --> 00:23:39,948
Perfume.

176
00:23:40,115 --> 00:23:41,991
A woman.

177
00:23:42,158 --> 00:23:44,035
A herald.

178
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,541
It's a silk-swaddled messenger boy.

179
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,710
Tell me your names! Quickly!

180
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:55,672
I am Son to Hygiliak,
called Buliwyf.

181
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,924
We all know your worthy lord.

182
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:00,009
We come on an errand to serve him.

183
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:03,012
My Lord Hrothgar will want
to welcome you himself.

184
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:58,568
No wall, no moat,
not even a presentable fence.

185
00:24:58,735 --> 00:25:00,737
You couldn't keep a cow
out of this place.

186
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:14,417
Women and children.

187
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:17,754
Barely a man between 15 and 50.

188
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,803
My lord, this is Buliwyf, son of
Hygiliak, come from across the sea.

189
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,140
I know the man. I sent for him.

190
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:13,977
Knew him as a boy, Knew his father,

191
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,105
and I know him now.

192
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:19,107
Grown to a man.

193
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:23,486
Grown to a fine, fine man.

194
00:26:32,787 --> 00:26:35,248
What troubles this place, old man?

195
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:41,546
You know he might be mad.

196
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,301
Be in the mist.

197
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:49,554
Has anyone seen one?

198
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:51,973
- Has anyone seen one in a 100 years?
- Hyah!

199
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,186
They say they used to be
all over this countryside ...

200
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:58,480
and worse further north.

201
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:00,899
People say many things.

202
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:04,861
Whatever they are,
unless we can track them,

203
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,863
we need a proper fence
and some sort of moat --

204
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,991
We could fashion a gate
from a wagon.

205
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:12,160
I don't want to build a fence.
I'm not a farmer.

206
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:15,914
- Let's go track the bastards --
- Gentlemen!

207
00:27:46,653 --> 00:27:49,072
- Boy! Speak to me, boy!
- Who did this?

208
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:52,075
- Speak to me!
- Find someone who knows him.
- Wait!

209
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,246
I know him.

210
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:05,046
It's a farmstead, just up the glen.

211
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:07,048
I will take you.

212
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:23,249
Don't step in front of me.

213
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:53,673
So it's true.

214
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:57,761
No horse tracks.

215
00:30:57,927 --> 00:31:00,764
- They were afoot.
- Their heads are missing.

216
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:05,769
The child must have crawled
into a hole to escape.

217
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:09,606
They have been ...

218
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:11,608
gnawed upon.

219
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:16,196
It is said they eat the dead.

220
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:22,535
Wh-What kind of a man ...
could do that?

221
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,122
It was not man.

222
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,124
- It's the Wendol.
- Shh!

223
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,377
They are here.

224
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:39,677
What is it?

225
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:42,639
The mother of the Wendol.

226
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:04,369
- The trail?
- Dies in the rocks, two miles up.

227
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:06,996
So they are clever.

228
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:09,040
And cautious.

229
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,418
And there's more.

230
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:19,467
To the right.
The ridge near the watchtower.

231
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:27,976
And to the south.

232
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:31,187
The edge of the trees
near the first ridgeline.

233
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:37,152
Something drove them out.

234
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:39,320
Put your hand down, little brother.

235
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:41,448
I believe they watch us.

236
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:43,533
Even now.

237
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,869
If we chase?

238
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:48,413
- They melt.
- Will they come to us?

239
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,291
The farmers say
they come with the mist.

240
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:54,294
So, if there's a fog,
they will come.

241
00:32:55,503 --> 00:33:00,633
We are hunted now in our own land.

242
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,386
It wasn't always such.

243
00:33:03,553 --> 00:33:06,765
At first we thought to build,
to leave something,

244
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:09,225
farms as far as the eye could see.

245
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:21,112
What of the settlements
to the north and upcountry?

246
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,032
Estwyck was burned.

247
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:27,577
- Two years.
- Two years ... ago.

248
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:32,582
And the others, we had no word.

249
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:35,251
Not for some months.

250
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:38,630
At night,
with the drink upon them --

251
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,841
You do not drink tonight?

252
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:44,469
No, we don't drink tonight.

253
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:02,445
But let the dawn come,

254
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:04,864
and they see the bodies.

255
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:12,789
This gentleman has the look of a great
warrior. No doubt he's very brave.

256
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:15,542
But to face the Wen ...

257
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:18,628
he'll need some amazing luck.

258
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:21,297
Luck often enough will save a man,

259
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:23,299
if his courage hold.

260
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,301
That's as maybe.

261
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:28,263
- Who is that man?
- King's son.

262
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:31,266
But wait for the Wendol
one night's time ...

263
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,643
and then talk to us of courage.

264
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,064
I thank the lord for his advice,

265
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:41,860
though I don't recall
hearing any exploits of his ...

266
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:44,237
apart from killing his brothers.

267
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:48,366
You sit down And be silent!

268
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:52,495
These are guests
at what is still my table!

269
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,849
There is a man who was at Estwyck.

270
00:35:13,016 --> 00:35:16,311
I saw the thing
that did this clear enough!

271
00:35:16,478 --> 00:35:19,981
Teeth like a lion, head like a bear,

272
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:23,360
claws that could tear
a plank to kindling.

273
00:35:23,526 --> 00:35:26,196
They come in the night,
in the mist.

274
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:29,240
Always in the darkest, like they
could see in the black.

275
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:32,327
Did they go on two legs
or four?

276
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:36,664
It seems they did both, like a thing
that was both man and bear.

277
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:40,085
Though, myself, I cannot tell.

278
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,712
I saw the glow-worm, though.

279
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:45,715
Saw it clear.
We all did on the last night.

280
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:50,470
Saw it come down out of the hills,
through the mist.

281
00:35:50,637 --> 00:35:54,891
Slithering this way and that.
Long as a hundred ships.

282
00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:57,894
Spitting fire at us as it came.

283
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,522
My father's father
always warned of it.

284
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,982
Said it was a hate from old times.

285
00:36:03,191 --> 00:36:05,026
There will be fog.

286
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:12,200
Bring me my armor!

287
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:15,787
I will stand the watch with you.

288
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,084
My lord, the children
will need protection.

289
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:24,379
Should they pass us,
then you and yours must stop them.

290
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,356
Luck in battle, boy.

291
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:55,660
How can you sleep
at a time like this?

292
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:59,956
The Old Father wound the skeane
of your life a long time ago.

293
00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:02,959
Go and hide in a hole if you wish.

294
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:05,795
But you won't live one instant longer.

295
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,797
Your fate is fixed.

296
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:10,759
Fear profits man nothing.

297
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:17,701
When they come,

298
00:38:17,784 --> 00:38:20,620
we form a circle
in the center of the room,

299
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:23,331
backs to one another.

300
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:25,333
I am not a warrior.

301
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:29,838
Very soon you will be.

302
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:02,203
Ow!

303
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:58,343
Well, he didn't run!

304
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:03,723
Hey.

305
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:07,644
You appear none the worse for wear.

306
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:10,647
- Rognar is here.
- His head?

307
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:13,108
No.

308
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:16,820
They take the heads.
They always take the heads.

309
00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:18,863
What about Hyglak?

310
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,826
It's the same.

311
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:25,161
- I see none of them.
- What?

312
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:27,580
None of them.

313
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:29,916
None of the ones we killed.

314
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:34,295
Nor do I.

315
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,465
Not one.

316
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:41,302
I took two at least
that could not have lived.

317
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:44,222
As did I. As did we all.

318
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:48,059
- Even the Arab gutted one.
- There was some life left in him.

319
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:50,020
They carried them off.
They must have.

320
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:52,689
They are demons.

321
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:55,984
Their blood looks real enough.

322
00:40:58,611 --> 00:41:02,699
- Ow!
- You complain much.

323
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:04,325
Ow.

324
00:41:04,534 --> 00:41:07,412
Help me carry Ragnarout.

325
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:15,503
- What is that?

326
00:41:15,628 --> 00:41:18,506
Cow urine.

327
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:20,508
"Cow urine"?

328
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:22,552
- Boiled down.
- No.

329
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,722
No, no, no.
Don't put that filth on me. No, no.

330
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,975
Water. Clean water.

331
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:33,605
As you wish.

332
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,941
Tomorrow the pus will run
and you'll have a fever.

333
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:45,283
Come, friend.

334
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:50,747
Your head has gone
looking for your hands.

335
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:52,916
They will meet you in paradise.

336
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:57,420
No bodies, but here perhaps ...

337
00:41:57,587 --> 00:41:59,798
is one of their claws.

338
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,428
Let's go, little brother.

339
00:42:05,595 --> 00:42:07,680
We have the fences to build.

340
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:13,561
Keep 'em comin' down.

341
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:16,940
Come in here. Line up there.

342
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:20,652
Over here. It'll be a long day.

343
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:23,571
You, in here. You, over here.

344
00:42:34,874 --> 00:42:36,751
- Move!

345
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:48,096
Stand there. I'll cut this pole.

346
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,974
Keep your eye on the pole,
all right?

347
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:52,934
So.

348
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:57,439
Now you do it.

349
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,044
Aah!

350
00:43:30,138 --> 00:43:32,682
Is there a metal worker?

351
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:35,101
A metal worker!

352
00:43:56,373 --> 00:43:58,208
He insisted.

353
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:01,419
Give an Arab a sword,
he makes a knife.

354
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:05,632
It works.

355
00:44:12,013 --> 00:44:14,599
When you die, can I give that
to me daughter?

356
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:22,607
Are you thirsty?

357
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:26,736
- Mead?
- Water.

358
00:44:33,576 --> 00:44:35,412
Thank you.

359
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:40,250
Aah!

360
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:44,045
- Ow!
- That's a woman's sound.

361
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,297
Do that again and you'll make it.

362
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:49,509
You'll heal.

363
00:44:50,677 --> 00:44:53,596
I think my nose is ruined.

364
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:55,807
- A small price.
- Ow!

365
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:04,399
People are very quiet today.

366
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:08,319
- The peasants fear you will
bring the fireworm down on us.
- What?

367
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:11,698
The fireworm. The fire-serpent.

368
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:16,286
"The fire-serpent."

369
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:18,329
A dragon?

370
00:45:19,456 --> 00:45:21,332
I do not believe in dragons.

371
00:45:28,798 --> 00:45:31,468
Beware of Prince Wigliff.

372
00:45:31,551 --> 00:45:33,428
He poisons the king's ear,

373
00:45:33,595 --> 00:45:36,139
says your Buliwyf has plans
to take his kingdom.

374
00:45:36,222 --> 00:45:39,309
Is there truth in this?

375
00:45:39,434 --> 00:45:41,728
No.

376
00:45:46,691 --> 00:45:48,568
You may believe me.

377
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,906
Then be cautious.

378
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,832
She would say no more.

379
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:05,043
She doesn't need to.

380
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,921
Prince, aah!

381
00:46:15,136 --> 00:46:16,971
We'll need an example.

382
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:21,685
The redhead?

383
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:23,478
Mm-hmm.

384
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:26,398
I'll do it.

385
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:28,942
You shouldn't be involved.

386
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:35,573
- What should I do?
- Keep your teeth together
and go back to work.

387
00:46:56,886 --> 00:46:59,264
Watch where you throw that.

388
00:47:07,105 --> 00:47:08,982
You dig like a dog.

389
00:47:11,776 --> 00:47:13,737
Did you call me a dog?

390
00:47:13,903 --> 00:47:17,741
I said you dig like one, flinging
earth carelessly like an animal.

391
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:20,952
So, now I'm an animal?

392
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,912
You're not listening.

393
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,914
I'm deaf?

394
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:26,916
You're a fool, little man.

395
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:30,879
That is because, boy,
your words are feeble ...

396
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:33,381
and twisted as an old woman's!

397
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:36,384
This old woman'll send you
to the next world, old man!

398
00:47:41,097 --> 00:47:42,932
- What happened?

399
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:46,394
An engineering dispute.

400
00:47:53,526 --> 00:47:56,613
- You notice he's bigger than you?
- Yes.

401
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,866
- And younger?
- Yes.

402
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:05,789
- Bet on him, if you like.
- I may!

403
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:19,010
Luck.

404
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:39,364
Aah!

405
00:48:46,663 --> 00:48:48,498
You must stop it.

406
00:48:56,548 --> 00:49:00,301
- He's going to get killed.
- That is possible.

407
00:49:00,468 --> 00:49:02,637
But you can't -- you can't --

408
00:50:12,082 --> 00:50:14,209
You stupid fools!

409
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:40,860
See to your friend.

410
00:50:42,487 --> 00:50:44,447
He was a brave man.

411
00:50:53,248 --> 00:50:56,126
- You -- you could have killed him at will.
- Yes?

412
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:59,796
- Wh-wh-why the deception?
- Deception is the point!

413
00:50:59,963 --> 00:51:02,465
Any fool can calculate strength.

414
00:51:02,632 --> 00:51:05,468
That one has been doing it
from the moment he saw us.

415
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:08,471
Now he has to calculate
what he can't see.

416
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:16,146
And fear what he doesn't know.

417
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:20,108
As you say, foolish and expensive.

418
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:23,653
We'll miss Angus tonight.
We will miss his sword.

419
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,515
Edgtho?

420
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:55,518
Edgtho?

421
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:59,439
Stifle your racket. I hear you.

422
00:51:59,606 --> 00:52:02,734
- I thought to find you in the tower.
- Yeah.

423
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:05,195
- Why I'm not in it.
- Brought your food.

424
00:52:28,385 --> 00:52:30,303
- It's going to rain.
- Surf.

425
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,390
Three miles up there's a cliff.

426
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:36,726
Tide's right, waves make thunder.

427
00:52:36,893 --> 00:52:39,562
Farmers call it the "thundercliffs."

428
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,529
The mist is forming.

429
00:52:47,696 --> 00:52:49,531
I see it.

430
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:13,263
The worm.
They've roused the fireworm.

431
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:40,040
Quickly!

432
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:42,792
No time to waste. Outside! Go!

433
00:53:42,959 --> 00:53:44,836
Quickly! Move!

434
00:53:51,384 --> 00:53:53,720
Come on!

435
00:54:04,814 --> 00:54:07,025
Go get the water.

436
00:54:11,196 --> 00:54:13,656
A serpent of fire.

437
00:54:13,823 --> 00:54:15,658
Breathing fire.

438
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:17,994
What's that in the field
below the tower?

439
00:54:21,706 --> 00:54:24,918
- It's a child.
- Look at her.

440
00:54:31,508 --> 00:54:33,343
Open the gate. Get the gate!

441
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:36,054
- Open the gate!
- Push!

442
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:39,099
No! You need to raise
the spikes first! Help me!

443
00:54:39,265 --> 00:54:41,935
- Come on!
- Down.

444
00:55:22,267 --> 00:55:24,227
Push it now!

445
00:55:24,394 --> 00:55:26,312
Heave!

446
00:55:30,275 --> 00:55:33,028
So you saw the fireworm?

447
00:55:33,194 --> 00:55:35,739
It's cavalry.

448
00:55:35,905 --> 00:55:38,575
- I rather prefer a dragon.
- Hundreds.

449
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:41,286
With torches.

450
00:55:42,454 --> 00:55:44,289
Take the north.

451
00:55:44,456 --> 00:55:47,333
Let's go, little brother.
It's beginning.

452
00:55:50,086 --> 00:55:51,921
"Arab"! Here!

453
00:56:08,104 --> 00:56:09,981
Guard!

454
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:42,013
Allah, be merciful.

455
00:57:53,043 --> 00:57:55,086
Ja! Did you see that? Hold this.

456
00:57:55,253 --> 00:57:58,048
I got you! Ja!

457
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:23,782
Yeah!

458
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,196
It's a man.

459
00:59:06,116 --> 00:59:08,702
It's a man.

460
00:59:08,868 --> 00:59:12,497
It's a man. It's a man.

461
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:15,209
It's a man! It's a man!

462
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:20,630
It's all right, little brother.

463
00:59:20,797 --> 00:59:24,634
There are more.

464
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:26,970
Aah!

465
00:59:28,596 --> 00:59:30,473
Aah!

466
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,476
- Aah!
- Aah!

467
00:59:33,643 --> 00:59:35,478
Aah!

468
00:59:35,645 --> 00:59:38,314
Aah!

469
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:47,198
Get 'em over!

470
00:59:54,122 --> 00:59:55,957
Aah!

471
00:59:57,542 --> 01:00:00,211
They've breached the gate!

472
01:00:06,426 --> 01:00:07,927
Aah!

473
01:00:30,867 --> 01:00:32,619
Aah!

474
01:00:32,786 --> 01:00:34,704
They've breached the gate!

475
01:00:34,871 --> 01:00:38,166
Fight them! Turn and fight them!

476
01:00:40,752 --> 01:00:42,629
Aah!

477
01:00:44,547 --> 01:00:46,966
Come on! Come on!

478
01:00:48,259 --> 01:00:50,136
Ahmed!

479
01:00:51,388 --> 01:00:53,223
What do I do with it?

480
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,102
Put your foot on it and stand!

481
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:17,163
Aah!

482
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:23,628
Aah!

483
01:01:49,946 --> 01:01:52,532
Aah!

484
01:02:04,335 --> 01:02:06,212
Aah!

485
01:02:07,338 --> 01:02:10,717
Don't!

486
01:02:27,317 --> 01:02:29,861
Aah!

487
01:03:12,028 --> 01:03:15,240
Skeld, Halga, Roneth ...

488
01:03:16,908 --> 01:03:19,285
and Rethel will be joining them.

489
01:03:31,297 --> 01:03:33,133
I cannot ...

490
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:36,970
taste neither
the fermentation of grape ...

491
01:03:38,722 --> 01:03:41,016
nor of wheat.

492
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:44,811
- What?

493
01:03:44,978 --> 01:03:47,147
Why do you laugh?

494
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:54,070
Honey.

495
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:56,906
It's made from honey.

496
01:04:29,939 --> 01:04:32,150
We will die here.

497
01:04:34,736 --> 01:04:36,571
It is ...

498
01:04:38,948 --> 01:04:40,825
possible.

499
01:04:59,969 --> 01:05:02,555
Come.

500
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:14,526
Come on.

501
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:20,407
She finish you,
or bring you back to life?

502
01:05:20,573 --> 01:05:23,243
A gentleman doesn't
discuss such things.

503
01:05:27,163 --> 01:05:29,541
Three more on the fence.

504
01:05:38,383 --> 01:05:41,177
Looks like the mating
of a man and some beast.

505
01:05:41,344 --> 01:05:43,596
It's a man.

506
01:05:45,223 --> 01:05:47,517
If it's a man, it must sleep.

507
01:05:47,684 --> 01:05:50,770
If it sleeps, it has a lair
and we have a trail.

508
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:53,231
Attack them?

509
01:05:53,398 --> 01:05:55,692
Is there a choice?

510
01:05:58,528 --> 01:06:02,115
Come with me.
There is a woman who can help.

511
01:06:07,954 --> 01:06:09,789
Bring the Arab.

512
01:06:09,956 --> 01:06:12,792
There's one down here
who was old ...

513
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:15,128
when my grandmother was a girl.

514
01:06:15,295 --> 01:06:17,130
She's quite mad.

515
01:06:17,297 --> 01:06:19,632
The perfect advisor.

516
01:06:22,427 --> 01:06:26,514
Oh, Weilew. Oh.

517
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:29,059
Shame, shame, shame.

518
01:06:29,225 --> 01:06:33,396
It's a Queen Weilew fronts
me now, does she not?

519
01:06:33,563 --> 01:06:35,732
We seek your counsel, Madam.

520
01:06:35,899 --> 01:06:37,817
We or he?

521
01:06:37,984 --> 01:06:40,487
Step closer, Buliwyf.

522
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:44,407
Closer.

523
01:06:44,574 --> 01:06:46,409
You know me?

524
01:06:46,576 --> 01:06:50,330
I have ears.
"Warrior," says the wind.

525
01:06:51,956 --> 01:06:54,125
"Chieftain," says the rain.

526
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:56,961
But why seek you me?

527
01:06:57,128 --> 01:06:59,672
Met you your match?

528
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,634
Met you your match ...

529
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:05,595
with the eaters of the dead?

530
01:07:07,764 --> 01:07:09,683
We seek your wisdom.

531
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:14,104
Wars are won in the will.

532
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:17,273
Perhaps you've been fighting
in the wrong field.

533
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,194
Have you a token? A thing.

534
01:07:21,361 --> 01:07:24,864
- A thing of them.
- Yes.

535
01:07:34,457 --> 01:07:36,668
Ahh.

536
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:42,340
They show you the way
you will not see.

537
01:07:42,507 --> 01:07:45,635
Slaughter them till you rot.

538
01:07:45,802 --> 01:07:47,887
You'll accomplish nothing.

539
01:07:49,472 --> 01:07:51,641
Find the root.

540
01:07:51,808 --> 01:07:53,810
- Strike the will.
- How?

541
01:07:53,977 --> 01:07:56,479
This is the mother of the Wen.

542
01:07:56,646 --> 01:07:59,649
She they revere.

543
01:07:59,816 --> 01:08:01,693
She is the will.

544
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,362
Where do I seek her?

545
01:08:04,529 --> 01:08:08,533
She is the earth.
Seek her in the earth.

546
01:08:15,498 --> 01:08:19,502
And Buliwyf, beware
the leader of their warriors.

547
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:21,671
He wears the horns of power.

548
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:27,552
He, too, you must kill.

549
01:08:29,846 --> 01:08:32,640
Have we anything resembling a plan?

550
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:35,602
Uh-huh. Ride till
we find them, kill them all.

551
01:09:28,363 --> 01:09:30,323
A child could follow this.

552
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:34,953
They have no fear,
no fear of us at all.

553
01:09:56,349 --> 01:09:58,309
The dog does not approve.

554
01:09:58,476 --> 01:10:00,478
Bearskulls.

555
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:03,189
I don't think they like company.

556
01:10:05,775 --> 01:10:08,361
The claws.

557
01:10:08,528 --> 01:10:11,281
The headdresses.

558
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:13,283
Bears.

559
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:16,703
They think they are bears.

560
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,247
They want us
to think they are bears.

561
01:10:19,414 --> 01:10:22,250
Hey, how do you hunt a bear?

562
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,627
Chase it down with dogs. What --

563
01:10:24,794 --> 01:10:27,547
How do you hunt a bear in winter?

564
01:10:27,714 --> 01:10:30,091
Go in his cave with spears.

565
01:10:30,258 --> 01:10:33,011
Where is a cave?

566
01:10:33,178 --> 01:10:35,847
It's in the earth.

567
01:10:39,267 --> 01:10:41,311
The next glen, many fires.

568
01:10:41,478 --> 01:10:43,396
Is there a cave?

569
01:11:00,914 --> 01:11:02,791
But there's no cave.

570
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:07,796
Yes, there is.

571
01:11:11,675 --> 01:11:14,552
- Straight into the rock face.
- Can we get to it?

572
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,222
If they don't keep dogs, maybe.

573
01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:30,670
You'd have to kiss me first, dearie.

574
01:12:30,837 --> 01:12:32,672
Let's go.

575
01:13:30,188 --> 01:13:33,233
Oh, how deep in the Earth are we?

576
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,070
- Deep enough to fall out the bottom.
- Come on!

577
01:14:03,596 --> 01:14:05,932
Look at your feet.

578
01:14:17,068 --> 01:14:18,903
I was wrong.

579
01:14:20,071 --> 01:14:23,575
These are not men.

580
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,062
If we cut our way through them,

581
01:14:52,228 --> 01:14:54,397
we will have the other lot on us.

582
01:14:54,606 --> 01:14:56,441
Down the wall,

583
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:59,277
and we swim.

584
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:13,666
I go.

585
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:10,473
- Let's go, little brother.
- I do not enjoy heights.

586
01:16:44,424 --> 01:16:46,384
Stay.

587
01:18:27,193 --> 01:18:29,029
Aah!

588
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,370
Go! Kill her!

589
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,207
Do it!

590
01:20:04,457 --> 01:20:06,918
- Aah!

591
01:20:30,108 --> 01:20:31,985
Aah!

592
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:40,660
Damn it!

593
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,462
It is done?

594
01:20:50,587 --> 01:20:52,464
It is.

595
01:20:57,385 --> 01:21:00,805
A hard fight to get clear of here?

596
01:21:03,141 --> 01:21:06,853
Hey, there's A passage leading down.

597
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,137
I've run about as far as I care to.

598
01:21:44,557 --> 01:21:47,143
Today was a good day.

599
01:21:47,268 --> 01:21:50,021
A good day.

600
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,275
Get along, lad.

601
01:21:57,237 --> 01:21:59,114
Go.

602
01:22:12,877 --> 01:22:15,630
Helfdane?

603
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:24,139
We'll just keep
following this stream.

604
01:22:24,305 --> 01:22:27,100
It has to come out somewhere.

605
01:22:32,063 --> 01:22:34,941
Stream disappears under the rocks.

606
01:22:44,075 --> 01:22:46,619
- Buliwyf!
- I'm all right.

607
01:22:48,455 --> 01:22:51,458
We fight by twos.
Give the other pair a chance to rest.

608
01:22:54,544 --> 01:22:56,796
Here they come.

609
01:22:56,963 --> 01:22:58,757
Go on, make it worse.

610
01:22:58,923 --> 01:23:01,134
Now it's gonna rain.

611
01:23:01,301 --> 01:23:04,971
- It's gonna rain. It's gonna rain.

612
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:09,642
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

613
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:12,228
- Thunder.
- Waves make thunder.

614
01:23:12,312 --> 01:23:15,899
- The thunder cliffs.
- Surf. Surf.

615
01:23:17,067 --> 01:23:20,278
There's a surf out there.

616
01:23:20,445 --> 01:23:24,699
Can we swim it?
Do we drown trying?

617
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:28,161
Try it.

618
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:35,335
Breathe! Breathe! Deep breath!

619
01:23:35,502 --> 01:23:38,380
Now, one, two, three!

620
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:43,134
The way we'll know is ...

621
01:23:43,301 --> 01:23:46,137
if they don't follow us,

622
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,973
it's too far to swim!

623
01:24:59,669 --> 01:25:01,713
Not through the night.

624
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:04,382
- His fate is sealed.
- You don't know that.

625
01:25:04,591 --> 01:25:07,302
The skeane is tied.

626
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:10,597
The weave was settled long ago.

627
01:25:12,849 --> 01:25:15,226
You're wearing that
long face for me?

628
01:25:17,771 --> 01:25:19,606
I cannot help it.

629
01:25:24,694 --> 01:25:27,864
I have only these hands.

630
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:29,908
I will die a pauper.

631
01:25:34,204 --> 01:25:38,041
You will be buried as a king.

632
01:25:43,963 --> 01:25:46,925
A man might be thought wealthy ...

633
01:25:47,092 --> 01:25:51,221
if someone were to draw ...

634
01:25:51,388 --> 01:25:53,640
the story of his deeds ...

635
01:25:54,974 --> 01:25:58,019
that they may be remembered.

636
01:26:05,068 --> 01:26:08,446
Such a man might be
thought wealthy indeed.

637
01:26:14,077 --> 01:26:16,454
He's traveling to the other side.

638
01:26:18,915 --> 01:26:22,335
He grips his sword
as if afraid he will not wake.

639
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:27,674
Think no more of these things.
You must rest now.

640
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,177
- I'm not tired.
- Rest.

641
01:26:31,344 --> 01:26:33,770
The Wendol want vengeance
for killing their mother.

642
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:36,641
They will come soon.

643
01:26:36,766 --> 01:26:37,943
Again?

644
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:40,146
We killed the mother
but not the leader.

645
01:26:40,312 --> 01:26:44,149
As long as he lives,
they will come back to fight us.

646
01:26:44,315 --> 01:26:46,192
When?

647
01:26:47,736 --> 01:26:49,070
Tonight.

648
01:26:56,453 --> 01:26:59,097
The evening lasts so long here.

649
01:26:59,722 --> 01:27:01,583
Not like home.

650
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,670
I don't think tonight
there will be --

651
01:27:08,637 --> 01:27:09,866
fog.

652
01:27:49,089 --> 01:27:51,299
"Kill the mother," she said.

653
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:53,510
"Kill their leader and they will break."

654
01:27:53,677 --> 01:27:56,388
We'll soon find out if she was right.

655
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,934
At least we don't
have to worry about fire.

656
01:28:09,275 --> 01:28:12,445
They're all terrified,
ready to break and run.

657
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,864
I wish we had Buliwyf with us.

658
01:28:15,031 --> 01:28:16,866
It's a small matter.

659
01:28:30,755 --> 01:28:33,133
Here.

660
01:28:34,467 --> 01:28:36,845
Prepare yourselves.

661
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:14,924
Merciful Father,

662
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,886
I have squandered my days
with plans of many things.

663
01:29:20,972 --> 01:29:24,642
This was not among them.

664
01:29:24,809 --> 01:29:27,312
But at this moment,

665
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:30,148
I beg only ...

666
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:33,693
to live the next few minutes well.

667
01:29:35,487 --> 01:29:39,032
When the time comes.

668
01:29:40,658 --> 01:29:42,952
Don't let them be taken.

669
01:29:50,627 --> 01:29:53,755
For all we ought to have thought ...

670
01:29:53,922 --> 01:29:56,341
and have not thought,

671
01:29:56,549 --> 01:29:59,427
all we ought to have said ...

672
01:29:59,636 --> 01:30:02,806
and have not said,

673
01:30:02,972 --> 01:30:05,975
all we ought to have done ...

674
01:30:06,142 --> 01:30:08,353
and have not done,

675
01:30:11,564 --> 01:30:15,068
I pray Thee, God, for forgiveness.

676
01:30:20,824 --> 01:30:22,659
They're coming!

677
01:31:31,603 --> 01:31:35,732
'Lo there do I see my father.

678
01:31:37,567 --> 01:31:40,236
- 'Lo there do I see
my mother and my sisters ...
- Mother and my sisters ...

679
01:31:40,403 --> 01:31:41,988
- and my brothers.
- and my brothers.

680
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:53,416
'Lo there do I see
the line of my people,

681
01:31:53,583 --> 01:31:56,044
back to the beginning.

682
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:02,425
'Lo they do call to me.

683
01:32:02,592 --> 01:32:04,928
They bid me take my place among them.

684
01:32:09,641 --> 01:32:12,394
In the halls of Valhalla,

685
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,896
where the brave ...

686
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:17,399
may live ...

687
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:19,943
forever.

688
01:32:21,236 --> 01:32:24,114
Aah!

689
01:33:38,063 --> 01:33:41,024
Aah!

690
01:33:47,781 --> 01:33:50,492
Aah!

691
01:33:55,872 --> 01:33:58,792
Aah!

692
01:35:40,226 --> 01:35:42,062
It's over.

693
01:36:40,829 --> 01:36:43,373
We shall make prayers
for your safe passage.

694
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,500
Prayers to who?

695
01:36:45,667 --> 01:36:49,295
In your land one god is perhaps enough,
but we have need of many.

696
01:36:49,462 --> 01:36:53,591
I will pray to all of them for you.
Do not be offended.

697
01:36:53,758 --> 01:36:56,511
I'll be in your debt.

698
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,517
Goodbye, Arab!

699
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:07,731
Goodbye, Northman.

700
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:22,537
Across seas of monsters and
forests of demons we traveled.

701
01:37:22,704 --> 01:37:24,789
Praise be to Allah,

702
01:37:24,956 --> 01:37:27,917
the merciful and compassionate.

703
01:37:28,084 --> 01:37:31,046
May His blessing
be up on pagan men ...

704
01:37:31,212 --> 01:37:33,965
who loved other gods,
who shared their food ...

705
01:37:34,132 --> 01:37:36,426
and shed their blood ...

706
01:37:36,593 --> 01:37:40,680
that his servant, Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan,

707
01:37:40,847 --> 01:37:42,891
might become a man ...

708
01:37:42,947 --> 01:37:45,891
and a useful servant of God.
