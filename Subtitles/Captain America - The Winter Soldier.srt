2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,165
On your left.

3
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,175
On your left.

4
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,248
On my left. Got it.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,415
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

6
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,010
- On your left.
- Come on!

7
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,410
Need a medic?

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,895
I need a new set of lungs.

9
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,242
Dude, you just ran,
like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.

10
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,440
I guess I got a late start.

11
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,046
Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

12
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,766
You should take another lap.

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,008
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,766
What unit you with?

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,325
58th Pararescue.

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,045
But now I'm working down at the VA.

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,364
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,682
I kind of put that together.

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,326
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,886
It takes some getting used to.

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,451
It's good to meet you, Sam.

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,881
It's your bed, right?

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,042
What's that?

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,645
Your bed, it's too soft.

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,450
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,569
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,884
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
Lying on a marshmallow.

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,080
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,695
How long?

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,006
Two tours.

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,520
You must miss the good old days, huh?

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,886
Well, things aren't so bad.

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,535
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,895
No polio is good.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,206
Internet, so helpful.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,320
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,931
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
<i>Trouble Man</i> soundtrack.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,566
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,728
I'll put it on the list.

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,045
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,611
If that's what you want to call running.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,855
That's how it is?

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,440
- That's how it is.
- Okay.

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,921
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,448
in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.

47
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,250
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,765
Hey, fellas.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,935
Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,166
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,601
That's hilarious.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,605
- How you doing?
- Hey.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,415
Can't run everywhere.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,441
No, you can't.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,495
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

56
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,646
the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,440
They were sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,006
93 minutes ago.

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,969
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,280
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,970
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

62
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,650
I'm sure they have a good reason.

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,529
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

64
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,563
Relax. It's not that complicated.

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,935
How many pirates?

66
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,486
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,762
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,849
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,689
Before the French demobilised him,
he had 36 kill missions.

70
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,695
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.

71
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,015
Hostages?

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,930
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,840
They're in the galley.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,520
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

75
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,523
All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.

76
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,165
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,206
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,215
get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.

79
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,840
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.

80
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,615
Secure channel seven.

81
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,855
Seven secure.

82
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,405
Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,048
Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,815
so, no, not really.

85
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,047
<i>Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i>

86
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,244
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,127
That's why I don't ask.

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,644
Too shy, or too scared?

89
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,771
Too busy!

90
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,810
Was he wearing a parachute?

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,047
No.

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,727
No, he wasn't.

93
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,161
Hey!

94
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,041
Don't move.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,241
Thanks.

96
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,482
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

97
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,855
What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?

98
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,015
She seems kind of nice.

99
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,815
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

100
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,495
I'm multi-tasking.

101
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,887
I told Batroc...

102
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,480
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

103
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,802
...start sending them bodies now!

104
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,728
I have a bullet for someone...

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,045
You want a bullet in your head?

106
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Move that foot - you want
a bullet in the head?

107
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,723
I don't like waiting.

108
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,001
Coll Durand.

109
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,375
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

110
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,081
Start the engines.

111
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,481
Okay.

112
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,841
Hey, sailor.

113
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,641
Shut up.

114
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,281
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,967
All right, I've waited long enough...

116
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,615
Hey!

117
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,695
Find Batroc...

118
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,721
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

119
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,081
...I start killing them!

120
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,281
I'll find him.

121
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,242
Two minutes.

122
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,007
Radio silence
from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

123
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,407
Targets acquired.

124
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,167
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

125
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,400
Natasha, what's your status?

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,001
<i>Status, Natasha.</i>

127
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,161
Hang on!

128
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,366
Engine room secure.

129
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,081
Time is up.

130
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,084
Who dies first...?

131
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,521
You!

132
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,641
Get that one.

133
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,201
On my mark.

134
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,011
<i>Three...</i>

135
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,531
<i>Two... One.</i>

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,889
I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

137
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,005
The line just went dead.

138
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,731
I've lost contact with them...

139
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,408
Hostages en route to extraction.

140
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,726
<i>Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.</i>

141
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,248
<i>Hostiles are still in play.</i>

142
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,767
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

143
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,008
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

144
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,046
Natasha.

145
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,360
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

146
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,970
Let's see.

147
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,285
Well, this is awkward.

148
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,926
What are you doing?

149
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,375
Backing up the hard drive.

150
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,811
It's a good habit to get into.

151
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,367
Rumlow needed your help.

152
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,800
What the hell are you doing here?

153
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,566
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

154
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,011
Whatever I can get my hands on.

155
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,525
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

156
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,483
No, that's your mission,

157
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
and you've done it beautifully.

158
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,244
You just jeopardised
this whole operation.

159
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,805
I think that's overstating things.

160
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,926
Okay.

161
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,846
That one's on me.

162
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,245
You're damn right.

163
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,215
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

164
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,335
I didn't lie.

165
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,725
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

166
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,684
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

167
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,450
I'm not obliged to do anything.

168
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,080
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

169
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,801
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,200
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

171
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,924
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

172
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,329
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

173
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,722
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.

174
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,008
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

175
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,361
I can't lead a mission

176
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,289
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

177
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,131
It's called compartmentalisation.

178
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,005
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

179
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,927
Except you.

180
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,165
You're wrong about me.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,240
I do share.

182
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,010
I'm nice like that.

183
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,015
Insight bay.

184
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,160
<i>Captain Rogers does not have</i>

185
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,560
<i>clearance for Project Insight.</i>

186
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,200
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

187
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,890
<i>Confirmed.</i>

188
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,323
You know, they used to play music.

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,001
Yeah.

190
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,721
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

191
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,247
Granddad worked in a nice building.

192
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,646
Got good tips.

193
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,325
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

194
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,851
He'd say, "Hi."

195
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,923
People would say, "Hi" back.

196
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,175
Time went on,
the neighbourhood got rougher.

197
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,201
He'd say, "Hi."

198
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,769
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

199
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,200
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

200
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,001
Did he ever get mugged?

201
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,964
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

202
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,850
What would he do?

203
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,201
He'd show them.

204
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,242
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

205
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,084
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

206
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,327
But he didn't trust them very much.

207
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,849
Yeah, I know.

208
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,361
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

209
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,121
This is Project Insight.

210
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,482
Three next-generation helicarriers

211
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,371
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

212
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,329
Launched from the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

213
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,530
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

214
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,607
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

215
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,135
Stark?

216
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,455
He had a few suggestions

217
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,801
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

218
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,126
These new long-range precision guns

219
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,726
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

220
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,130
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

221
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,410
We're gonna neutralise a lot of threats
before they even happen.

222
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,655
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

223
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,125
We can't afford to wait that long.

224
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,805
Who's "we"?

225
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,241
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

226
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,727
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

227
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,807
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

228
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,484
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

229
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,128
You know, I read those SSR files.

230
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,001
"Greatest Generation"?

231
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,410
You guys did some nasty stuff.

232
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,125
Yeah, we compromised.

233
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,560
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

234
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,247
But we did it
so that people could be free.

235
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,647
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

236
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,202
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.

237
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,371
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that Programme, Cap.

238
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,203
Don't hold your breath.

239
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,848
<i>Welcome to the Smithsonian.</i>

240
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,527
<i>Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.</i>

241
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,688
<i>A symbol to the nation.</i>

242
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,644
<i>A hero to the world.</i>

243

<i>The story of Captain America

244
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,325
<i>Denied enlistment due to poor health,</i>

245
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,767
<i>Steven Rogers was chosen
for a Programme</i>

246
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,089
<i>unique in the annals
of American warfare.</i>

247
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,041
<i>One that would transform him
into the world's first Super-Soldier.</i>

248
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,721
<i>In this rare footage,</i>

249
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,247
<i>everyone's favourite war hero,

<i>Battle tested,</i>

251
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,081
<i>Captain America</i>

252
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,569
<i>and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.</i>

253
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,801
<i>Their mission:</i>

254
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,801
<i>taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.</i>

255
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,122
<i>Best friends since childhood,</i>

256
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,402
<i>Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable</i>

257
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,489
<i>on both schoolyard and battlefield.</i>

258
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,930
<i>Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life</i>

259
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,651
<i>in service of his country.</i>

260
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,495
<i>That was a difficult winter.</i>

261
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,002
<i>A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.</i>

262
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,809
<i>Steve, Captain Rogers,</i>

263
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,646
<i>he fought his way
through a HYDRA blockade</i>

264
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,406
<i>that had pinned our allies
down for months.</i>

265
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,805
<i>He saved over 1,000 men.</i>

266
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,370
<i>Including the man who would...</i>

267
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,650
<i>Who would become my husband,
as it turned out.</i>

268
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,285
<i>Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.</i>

269
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,840
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.

270
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,328
I have lived a life.

271
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,449
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

272
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,687
What is it?

273
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,928
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

274
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,681
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is any more.

275
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,975
And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.

276
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,490
Serve.

277
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,722
It's just not the same.

278
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,724
You're always so dramatic.

279
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,567
Look, you saved the world.

280
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,886
We rather mucked it up.

281
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,526
You didn't.

282
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,801
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

283
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,687
Hey.

284
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,764
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

285
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,122
All we can do is our best.

286
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,564
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

287
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,041
Peggy.

288
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,881
Steve.

289
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,767
Yeah?

290
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,726
You're alive.

291
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,485
You came back.

292
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,761
Yeah, Peggy.

293
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,521
It's been so long.

294
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,570
So long.

295
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,126
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

296
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,448
Not when she owes me a dance.

297

<i>Fury, Nicholas J.</i>

306
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,326
World Security Council.

307

<i>Confirmed.</i>

308
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,640
<i>If Nick Fury thinks
he can get his costumed thugs</i>

309
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,043
<i>and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to
mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.</i>

310
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,401
This failure is unacceptable.

311
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,204
Considering this attack took place

312
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,164
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

313
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,721
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

314
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,849
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

315
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,128
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

316
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,289
A breach like this
raises serious questions.

317
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,164
Like how the hell did a French pirate

318
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,251
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

319
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,522
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

320
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,162
I can draw a map if it'd help.

321
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,164
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

322
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,924
But this Council takes things
like international piracy fairly seriously.

323
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,369
Really? I don't.

324
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,371
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

325
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,335
If this Council is going to fall to rancour

326
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,045
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

327
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,328
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

328
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,046
Mr Secretary,
nobody is suggesting...

329
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,215
Excuse me.

330
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,844
More trouble, Mr Secretary?

331
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,644
Depends on your definition.

332
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,483
I work 40 floors away
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

333
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,762
A nuclear war would do it, too.

334
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,206
You busy in there?

335
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,890
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

336
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,202
I'm here to ask a favour.

337
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,843
I want you to call for a vote.

338
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,162
Project Insight has to be delayed.

339
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,722
Nick, that's not a favour,

340
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,450
that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.

341
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,360
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

342
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,131
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

343
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,367
But if it's something?

344
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,370
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.

345
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,442
Fine.

346
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,727
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

347
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,531
Thank you, sir.

348
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,610
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

349
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,441
<i>The thing is,</i>

350
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,008
I think it's getting worse.

351
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,567
A cop pulled me over last week.

352
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,046
He thought I was drunk.

353
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,682
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

354
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,929
I thought it was an IED.

355
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,089
Some stuff you leave there.

356
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,448
Other stuff you bring back.

357
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,530
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

358
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,924
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

359
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,127
It's up to you.

360
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,840
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.

361
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,007
Look who it is, the running man.

362
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,326
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

363
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,490
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.

364
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,406
Guilt,

365
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,080
regret.

366
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,210
You lose someone?

367
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,241
My wingman, Riley.

368
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,321
Flying a night mission.

369
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,847
Standard PJ rescue Op.

370
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,088
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

371
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,887
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

372
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,331
Nothing I could do.

373
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,922
It's like I was up there just to watch.

374
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,008
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

375
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,801
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?

376
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,001
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

377
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,481
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

378
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,681
So, hell yeah.

379
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
Are you thinking about getting out?

380
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,841
No.

381
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,041
I don't know.

382
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,131
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.

383
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,840
Ultimate fighting?

384
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,881
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

385
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,441
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

386
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,487
What makes you happy?

387
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,084
I don't know.

You have three. Over.

396
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,124

Hi.

434
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,841
I got to go, though.

435
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,846
Okay. Bye.

436
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,644
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

437
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,401
Yeah.

438
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,087
Hey, if you want...

439
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,442
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

440
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,480
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.

Yeah? What's it cost?

442
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,209
A cup of coffee?

443
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,651
Thank you, but

444
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,884
I already have a load in downstairs,

445
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,924
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

446
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,124
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...

447
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,328
Well, I'll keep my distance.

448
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,646
Hopefully, not too far.

449
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,360
And I think you left your stereo on.

450
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,290
Right. Thank you.

451
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,481
Yeah.

452
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,044
I don't remember giving you a key.

453
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,042
You really think I'd need one?

454
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,690
My wife kicked me out.

455
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,526
I didn't know you were married.

456
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,202
A lot of things you don't know about me.

457
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,883
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

458
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,042
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

459
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,691
Who else knows about your wife?

460
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,526

461
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,884
My friends.

470
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,566
On whose order?

471
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,801
His.

472
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,565
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

473
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,761

<i>Do we have a 20 on the shooter?</i>

475
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,491
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

476
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,175
Is he gonna make it?

477
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,645
I don't know.

478
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,725
Tell me about the shooter.

479
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,048
He's fast. Strong.

480
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,240
Had a metal arm.

481
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,840
Ballistics?

482
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,927
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.

483
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,406
Soviet-made.

484
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,401
Yeah.

485
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,615
He's in V-tach.

Nurse, help me with the drape.

488
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,680
- BP's dropping.
- Defibrillator!

489
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,165
I want you to charge him at 100.

490
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,725
Don't do this to me, Nick.

491
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,200
Stand back.

492
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,566
Three, two,

493
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,490
one. Clear.

494
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,575
- Pulse?
- No pulse.

495
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,761
Okay, 200, please.

496
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,961
Stand back!

497
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,401
Three, two, one. Clear!

498
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,607
Get me epinephrine!

499
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,895
Pulse?

500
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,921
Negative.

501
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,608
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

502
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,975
What's the time?

503
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,081
1:03, Doctor.

504
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,965
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

505
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,044
I need to take him.

506
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,081
Natasha.

507
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,967
Natasha!

508
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,880
Why was Fury in your apartment?

509
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,051
I don't know.

510
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,800
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

511
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,367
Yeah, give me a second.

512
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,481
They want you now.

513
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,171
Okay.

514
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,402
You're a terrible liar.

515
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,130
<i>S.T.R.I.K.E.
team, escort Captain Rogers</i>

516
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,721
<i>back to S. H. I.E. L.D.
immediately for questioning.</i>

517
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,370
I told him.

518
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,845
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

519
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,681
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

520
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,567
Captain Rogers.

521
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,080
Neighbour.

522
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,844
Captain.

523
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,281
I'm Alexander Pierce.

524
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,331
Sir, it's an Honour.

525
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,640
The honour's mine, Captain.

526
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,246
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

527
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,040
That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

528
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,647
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.

529
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,320
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

530
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,764
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

531
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,449
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

532
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,931
and he comes to me with a plan.

533
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,135
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

534
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,925
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

535
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,487
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

536
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,848
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

537
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,451
They find it empty.

538
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,563
Nick had ignored my direct order,

539
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,082
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

540
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,882
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,

541
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,326
including my daughter.

542
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,050
So you gave him a promotion.

543
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,805
I've never had any cause to regret it.

544
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,122
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

545
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,281
I don't know.

546
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,851
Did you know it was bugged?

547
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,081
I did, because Nick told me.

548
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?

549
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,006
I want you to see something.

550
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,400
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

551
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,442
Is that live?

552
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,208
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

553
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,855
Are you saying he's a suspect?

554
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,530
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

555
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,526
No, no.
It's more complicated than that.

556
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,286
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

557
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,962
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

558
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,571
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

559
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,043
The last one going to
a holding company

560
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,407
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

561
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,960
Am I supposed to know who that is?

562
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,122
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

563
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,251
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

564
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,288
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

565
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,248
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

566
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,444
The prevailing theory

567
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,330
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

568
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,887
and sale of classified intelligence.

569
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,530
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

570
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,445
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

571
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,762
Why do you think we're talking?

572
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,971
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

573
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,926
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

574
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,724
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

575
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,927
to build a really better world

576
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,803
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

577
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,485
And that makes enemies.

578
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,650
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

579
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,605
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

580
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,685
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

581
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,606
makes me really, really angry.

582
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,935
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

583
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,962
I don't think that's an accident.

584
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,124
And I don't think you do, either.

585
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,169
So, I'm gonna ask again.

586
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,369
Why was he there?

587
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,601
He told me not to trust anyone.

588
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,047
I wonder if that included him.

589
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,166
I'm sorry.

590
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,606
Those were his last words.

591
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,446
Excuse me.

592
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,325
Captain,

593
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,524
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

594
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,006
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

595
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,771
Anyone.

596
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,125
Understood.

597
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,051
Operations Control.

598
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,645
<i>Confirmed.</i>

Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site.

600
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,691
- Understood.

<i>- Confirmed.</i>

602
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,481

Rumlow.

604
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,205
Evidence Response found some fibres
on the roof they want us to see.

605
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,964
You want me to get the Tac team ready?

606
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,760
No, let's wait and see what it is first.

607
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,961
Right.

608
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,529
What's the status so far?

609
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,600
- Administrations level.
<i>- Confirmed.</i>

610
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,365
Excuse me.

611
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,887
I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.

612
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,048
It's messed up, what happened to him.

613
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,571
Thank you.

614
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,567
Records.

615
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,886
Confirmed.

616
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,563
Before we get started,

617
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,282
does anyone want to get out?

618
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,204
Mobilise S.T.R.I.K.E. units, 25th floor.

619
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,845
Whoa, big guy.

620
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,645
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!

621
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,526
It kind of feels personal.

622
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,522
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!

623
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,720
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

624
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,565
You have nowhere to go!

625
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,535
Are you kidding me?

626
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,722
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.

627
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,283
<i>Stand down, Captain Rogers.
Stand down.</i>

628
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,922
<i>Repeat, stand down.</i>

629
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,970
Eyes here.

630
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,243
Whatever your Op is, bury it.

631
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,481
This is Level One.

632
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,729
Contact DOT.

633
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,600
All traffic lights in the district go red.

634
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,122
Shut all runways at BWI,

635
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,164
IAD and Reagan.

636
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,040
All security cameras in the city
go through this monitor right here.

637
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,281
Scan all open sources,

638
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,205
phones, computers,

639
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,806
PDAs. Whatever.

640
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,015
If someone tweets about this guy,

641
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,087
I want to know about it.

642
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,325
With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

643
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,291
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

644
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,205
Because he lied to us.

645
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,322
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

646
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,484
He refused to share it.

647
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,648
As difficult as this is to accept,

648
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,008
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

649
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,647
- Where is it?
- Safe.

650
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,404
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

651
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,880
Why would I tell you?

652
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,128
Fury gave it to you. Why?

653
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,731
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

654
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,921
Stop lying.

655
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,760
I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.

656
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,000
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

657
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,964
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

658
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,406
I'm not gonna ask you again.

659
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,486
I know who killed Fury.

660
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,920
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

661
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,964
The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.

662
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,162
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

663
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,249
in the last 50 years.

664
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,245
So he's a ghost story.

665
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,683
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

666
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,167
Somebody shot out
my tyres near Odessa.

667
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,647
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

668
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,126
I pulled us out.

669
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,209
But the Winter Soldier was there.

670
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,247
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him

671
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,601
straight through me.

672
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,521
Soviet slug.

673
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,726
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

674
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,129
Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.

675
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,366
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

676
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,768
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

677
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,529
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

678
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,888
<i>Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.</i>

679
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,855
To any reasonable person,

680
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,486
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.

681
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,965
You know what makes him a traitor?

682
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,487
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

683
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,961
Nick Fury used your friendship

684
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,169
to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.

685
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,681
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

686
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,890
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

687
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,401
Are you calling for my resignation?

688
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,040
I've got a pen and paper right here.

689
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,726
That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.

690
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,490
But you do want to have a discussion?

691
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,563
We've already had it, Mr Secretary.

692
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,043
This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.

693
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,688
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

694
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,088
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

695
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,161
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

696
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,815
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

697
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,775
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

698
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,880
How much time will we have?

699
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,527
About nine minutes from

700
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,207
now.

701
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,170
Fury was right about that ship.

702
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,442
Somebody's trying to hide something.

703
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,608
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

704
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,207
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

705
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,050
Can you override it?

706
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,081
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

707
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,561
Slightly.

708
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,640
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

709
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,495
This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

710
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,885
to track hostile malware,

711
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,850
so if we can't read the file,

712
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,680
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

713
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,600
Can I help you guys with anything?

714
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,601
No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

715
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,723
Right. We're getting married.

716
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,200
Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?

717
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,250
New Jersey.

718
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,850
I have the exact same glasses.

719
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,410
Wow, you two are practically twins.

720
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,091
Yeah, I wish.

721
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,601
Specimen.

722
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,415
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

723
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,441
Thank you.

724
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,287
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

725
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,601
Got it.

726
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,895
You know it?

727
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,490
I used to. Let's go.

728
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,880
Standard Tac team.

729
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,411
Two behind, two across,

730
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,204
and two coming straight at us.

731
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,255
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

732
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,248
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

733
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,680
- What?
- Do it.

734
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,961
Negative at the source.

735
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,121
Give me a floor rundown.

736
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,880
<i>Negative on three.</i>

737
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,360
<i>Negative on two.</i>

738
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,801
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

739
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,807
- Kiss me.
- What?

740
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,042
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

741
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,366
Yes, they do.

742
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,410
You still uncomfortable?

743
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,845
It's not exactly the word I would use.

744
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,088
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

745
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,610
Nazi Germany.

746
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,048
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

747
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,847
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

748
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,495
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

749
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,851
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

750
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,560
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

751
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,525
- That bad?
- I didn't say that.

752
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,284
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

753
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,535
No, I didn't.

754
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,483
I just wondered
how much practice you've had.

755
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,330
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

756
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,761
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

757
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,889
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

758
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,015
Nobody special, though?

759
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,335
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

760
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,735
to find someone with
shared life experience.

761
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,775
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

762
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,723
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

763
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,046
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

764
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,567
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.

765
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,881
Neither am I.

766
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,880
That's a tough way to live.

767
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,202
It's a good way not to die, though.

768
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,525
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,

769
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,560
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

770
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,361
Yeah.

771
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,641
Who do you want me to be?

772
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,601
How about a friend?

773
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,165
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

774
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,331
This is it.

775
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,483
The file came from these coordinates.

776
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,966
So did I.

777
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,605
This camp is where I was trained.

778
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,801
Change much?

779
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,680
A little.

780
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,008
Pick up the pace, ladies!

781
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,804
Let's go! Let's go!

782
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,880
Double time!

783
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,162
Come on, Rogers, move it!

784
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,531
Come on, fall in!

785
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,641
Rogers!

786
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,320
I said fall in!

787
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,801
This is a dead end.

788
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,770
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

789
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,044
Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.

790
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,001
What is it?

791
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,175
Army regulations
forbid storing munitions

792
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,123
within 500 yards of the barracks.

793
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,968
This building is in the wrong place.

794
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,169
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

795
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,963
Maybe where it started.

796
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,769
And there's Stark's father.

797
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,725
Howard.

798
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,280
Who's the girl?

799
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,001
If you're already working
in a secret office,

800
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,215
why do you need to hide the elevator?

801
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,646
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

802
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,602
Y-E-S spells yes.

803
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,603
Shall we play a game?

804
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,601
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

805
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,808
<i>Rogers, Steven,</i>

806
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,524
<i>born 1918.</i>

807
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,411
<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,</i>

808
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,443
<i>born 1984.</i>

809
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,005
It's some kind of recording.

810
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,521
<i>I am not a recording, Fräulein.</i>

811
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,929
<i>I may not be the man I was</i>

812
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,363
<i>when the Captain took me
prisoner in 1945.</i>

813
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,484
<i>But I am.</i>

814
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,765
You know this thing?

815
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,164
Arnim Zola was a German
scientist who worked for the Red Skull.

816
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,607
He's been dead for years.

817
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,087
<i>First correction, I am Swiss.</i>

818
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,887
<i>Second, look around you.</i>

819
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,691
<i>I have never been more alive.</i>

820
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,524
<i>In 1972,
I received a terminal diagnosis.</i>

821
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,485
<i>Science could not save my body.</i>

822
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,890
<i>My mind, however,
that was worth saving,</i>

823
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,886
<i>on 200,000 feet of databanks.</i>

824
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,641
<i>You are standing in my brain.</i>

825
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,087
- How did you get here?
<i>- Invited.</i>

826
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,927
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

827
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,761
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited
German scientists with strategic value.

828
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,082
<i>They thought I could help their cause.</i>

829
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,129
<i>I also helped my own.</i>

830
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,845
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

831
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,931
<i>Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.</i>

832
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,771
Prove it.

833
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,043
<i>Accessing archive.</i>

834
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,922
<i>HYDRA was founded on
the belief that humanity</i>

835
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,283
<i>could not be trusted
with its own freedom.</i>

836
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:20,165
<i>What we did not realise was
that if you try</i>

837
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,170
<i>to take that freedom, they resist.</i>

838
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,565
<i>The war taught us much.</i>

839
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,448
<i>Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.</i>

840
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,331
<i>After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,</i>

841
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,648
<i>and I was recruited.</i>

842
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,082
<i>The new HYDRA grew.</i>

843
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,569
<i>A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

844
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,644
<i>For 70 years,</i>

845
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:50,443
<i>HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,</i>

846
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,325
<i>and when history did not cooperate,</i>

847
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,810
<i>history was changed.</i>

848
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,322
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

849
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,841
<i>Accidents will happen.</i>

850
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,650
<i>HYDRA created a world so chaotic</i>

851
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,680
<i>that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom</i>

852
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,042
<i>to gain its security.</i>

853
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,083
<i>Once a purification process
is complete,</i>

854
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,008
<i>HYDRA'S new world order will arise.</i>

855
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,843
<i>We won, Captain.</i>

856
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,527
<i>Your death amounts to
the same as your life.</i>

857
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,047
<i>A zero sum.</i>

858
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,569
<i>As I was saying...</i>

859
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,447
What's on this drive?

860
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,923
<i>Project Insight requires insight.</i>

861
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,926
<i>So, I wrote an algorithm.</i>

862
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,655
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

863
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,206
<i>The answer to your question
is fascinating.</i>

864
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,690
<i>Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.</i>

865
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,965
Steve, we got a bogey.

866
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,970
Short range ballistic.

867
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,015
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

868
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,041
S.H.I.E.L.D.

869
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,966
<i>I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.</i>

870
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,561
<i>Admit it.</i>

871
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,961
<i>It's better this way.</i>

872
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,571
<i>We are, both of us,</i>

873
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,120
<i>out of time.</i>

874
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,085
Call in the asset.

875
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,720
I'm going to go, Mr Pierce.

876
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,049
You need anything before I leave?

877
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,128
No... It's fine, Renata,
you can go home.

878
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,444
Okay. Night-night.

879
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,330
Good night.

880
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,845
Want some milk?

881
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,323
The timetable has moved.

882
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,209
Our window is limited.

883
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,368
Two targets, Level Six.

884
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,047
They already cost me Zola.

885
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,447
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

886
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,528
Sorry, Mr Pierce, I...

887
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,326
I forgot my

888
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,686
phone.

889
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,849
Renata,
I wish you would have knocked.

890
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,535
Hey, man.

891
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,087
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

892
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,930
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

893
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,370
Not everyone.

894
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,044
- You okay?
- Yeah.

895
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,450
What's going on?

896
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,122
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

897
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,884
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

898
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,842
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,

899
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,405
but I guess I can't tell
the difference any more.

900
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,480
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.

901
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,721
I owe you.

902
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,327
It's okay.

903
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,087
If it was the other way around,

904
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,975
and it was down to me to save your life,

905
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,490
now you be honest with me,

906
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,569
would you trust me to do it?

907
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,721
I would now.

908
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,524
And I'm always honest.

909
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,000
Well, you seem pretty chipper

910
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,240
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.

911
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,446
Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.

912
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,321
I made breakfast.

913
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,884
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

914
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,845
So, the question is,

915
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,360
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

916
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,121
Pierce.

917
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,051
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.

918
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,361
But he's not working alone.

919
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,881
Zola's algorithm
was on the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

920
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,530
So was Jasper Sitwell.

921
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,521
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

922
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,644
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

923
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,369
The answer is, you don't.

924
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,049
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

925
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,290
Is this Bakhmala?

926
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,080
The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?

927
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,051
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

928
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,928
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

929
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,640
I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.

930
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,855
What did you use? A stealth chute?

931
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,927
No.

932
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,085
These.

933
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,440
I thought you said you were a pilot.

934
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,931
I never said pilot.

935
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,684
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

936
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,725
You got out for a good reason.

937
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,445
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

938
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,240
There's no better reason to get back in.

939
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,604
Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?

940
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,000
The last one is at Fort Meade.

941
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,486
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

942
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,646
Shouldn't be a problem.

943
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,964
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

944
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,970
because I got
some constituency problem

945
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,043
and I got to press the flesh.

946
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,527
Any constituent in particular,
Mr Senator?

947
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,491
No, not really.

948
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,329
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

949
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,126
Real hot, you know?

950
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,482
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.

951
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,720
Who listens at that point?

952
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,560
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.

953
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,802
Really? Because she's killing my back.

954
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,524
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

955
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,767
This is a nice pin.

956
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,168
- Thank you.
- Come here.

957
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,325
Hail HYDRA.

958
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,480
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

959
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,120
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

960
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,681
I need a minute.

961
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,530
Bring the car around.

962
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,375
Yes, sir?

963
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,084
<i>Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?</i>

964
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,886
<i>I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.</i>

965
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,047
Who is this?

966
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,885
<i>The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.</i>

967
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,126
<i>Your other 10 o'clock.</i>

968
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,001
<i>There you go.</i>

969
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,365
What do you want?

970
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,440
<i>You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.</i>

971
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,086
There's a grey car two spaces down.

972
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,123
You and I are gonna take a ride.

973
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,049
And why would I do that?

974
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,806
Because that tie looks really expensive,

975
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,208
<i>and I'd hate to mess it up.</i>

976
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,040
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

977
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,175
Never heard of it.

978
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,295
What were you doing
on the <i>Lemurian Star?</i>

979
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,049
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

980
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:38,480
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

981
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,240
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

982
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,241
You're right.

983
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,167
It's not.

984
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,681
It's hers.

985
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,206
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

986
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,615
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

987
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,895
Yeah, she's cute.

988
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,410
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

989
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,362
Zola's algorithm is a program

990
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,121
for choosing

991
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,885
- insight's targets.
- What targets?

992
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,361
You!

993
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,727
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defence,

994
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,366
a high school Valedictorian in Iowa City,

995
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,640
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

996
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,524
to HYDRA.

997
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,449
Now, or in the future.

998
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,524
In the future? How could it know?

999
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,167
How could it not?

1000
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,648
The 21st century is a digital book.

1001
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,803
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

1002
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,846
Your bank records,

1003
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,691
medical histories, voting patterns,

1004
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,326
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

1005
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,208
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

1006
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,320
to predict their future.

1007
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,687
And what then?

1008
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,884
My God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

1009
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,525
What then?

1010
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,203
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

1011
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,283
A few million at a time.

1012
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,001
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1013
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,920
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

1014
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,326
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1015
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,567
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

1016
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,683
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

1017
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,320
and access the helicarriers directly.

1018
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,527
What? Are you crazy?

1019
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,160
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1020
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,006
Shit!

1021
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,765
Hang on!

1022
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,130
I have her. Find him.

1023
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,401
Go! I got this!

1024
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,124
<i>Taking fire above
and below expressway.</i>

1025
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,760
<i>Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.</i>

1026
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,651
<i>I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.</i>

1027
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,881
<i>Rendezvous, two minutes.</i>

1028
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,321
Get out of the way!

1029
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,484
Stay out of the way!

1030
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,607
Bucky?

1031
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,605
Who the hell is Bucky?

1032
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,840
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

1033
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,450
Get on your knees!

1034
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,255
Get down, get down! Get on your knees!

1035
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,441
Down!

1036
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,961
Don't move.

1037
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,246
Put the gun down.

1038
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,363
Not here. Not here!

1039
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,927
<i>It was him.</i>

1040
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,687
He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.

1041
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,931
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

1042
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,326
Zola.

1043
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,124
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

1044
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,169
Zola experimented on him.

1045
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,687
Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.

1046
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,735
They must have found him and...

1047
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,683
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1048
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,049
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1049
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,089
We need to get a doctor here.

1050
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,281
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

1051
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,080
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1052
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,523
That thing was squeezing my brain.

1053
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,681
Who is this guy?

1054
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,448
Three holes. Start digging.

1055
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,523
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1056
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,926
Maybe two.

1057
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,082
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

1058
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,241
About damn time.

1059
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,804
Lacerated spinal column,

1060
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,815
cracked sternum,

1061
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,444
shattered collarbone,

1062
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,284
perforated liver,

1063
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,204
and one hell of a headache.

1064
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,805
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1065
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,286
Let's not forget that.

1066
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,130
Otherwise, I'm good.

1067
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,642
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

1068
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,888
Tetrodotoxin B.

1069
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,048
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1070
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,049
Banner developed it for stress.

1071
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,846
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

1072
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,929
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1073
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,407
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

1074
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,087
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1075
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,521
Besides,

1076
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,325
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1077
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,171
Sergeant Barnes.

1078
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,321
Bucky, no!

1079
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,123
<i>The procedure has already started.</i>

1080
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,686
<i>You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.</i>

1081
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,081
<i>Put him on ice.</i>

1082
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,481
Sir.

1083
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,690
He's unstable.

1084
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,611
Erratic.

1085
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,961
Mission report.

1086
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,811
Mission report now.

1087
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,011
The man on the bridge.

1088
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,400
Who was he?

1089
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,087
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

1090
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,491
I knew him.

1091
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,765
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1092
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,451
You shaped the century.

1093
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,600
And I need you to do it one more time.

1094
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:11,566
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1095
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,445
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

1096
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:18,769
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.

1097
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,284
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1098
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,924
But I knew him.

1099
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,965
Prep him.

1100
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,766
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

1101
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,962
Then wipe him and start over.

1102
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:26,241
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1103
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,243
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

1104
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,802
it was a responsibility.

1105
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,043
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1106
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,040
We have to stop the launch.

1107
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,765
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls any more.

1108
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,361
What's that?

1109
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,455
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

1110
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,848
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponised.

1111
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,204
We need to breach those carriers

1112
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,015
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

1113
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,041
One or two won't cut it.

1114
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,766
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

1115
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:05,282
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

1116
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,284
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1117
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,683
We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.

1118
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,082
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

1119
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,403
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...

1120
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,760
We're not salvaging anything.

1121
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,040
We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.

1122
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,375
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1123
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,686
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

1124
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:24,087
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

1125
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,320
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

1126
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,249
HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.

1127
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,563
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1128
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,604
How many paid the price
before you did?

1129
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,404
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1130
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,480
Even if you had,
would you have told me?

1131
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,405
Or would you have
compartmentalised that, too?

1132
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,405
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1133
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,926
it all goes.

1134
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,646
He's right.

1135
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,487
Don't look at me.

1136
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,569
I do what he does, just slower.

1137
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,930
Well...

1138
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,601
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1139
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,775
<i>We looked for you, after.</i>

1140
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,002
<i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i>

1141
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:32,807
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1142
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,331
How was it?

1143
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,290
It was okay.

1144
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,643
She's next to Dad.

1145
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,406
I was gonna ask...

1146
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,560
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...

1147
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,080
We can put the
couch cushions on the floor

1148
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,650
like when we were kids.

1149
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,800
It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,

1150
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,924
maybe take out the trash.

1151
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,371
Come on.

1152
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,847
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

1153
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:11,406
The thing is, you don't have to.

1154
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,400
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

1155
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,055
He's gonna be there, you know.

1156
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,127
I know.

1157
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,368
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,

1158
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,207
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1159
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,845
He's the kind you stop.

1160
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,124
I don't know if I can do that.

1161
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,408
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1162
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,090
He doesn't know you.

1163
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,847
He will.

1164
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,886
Gear up. It's time.

1165
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,646
You gonna wear that?

1166
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,248
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.

1167
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,605
Man.

1168
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,482
I am so fired.

1169
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,601
<i>We are in final launch sequence.</i>

1170
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,163
We are go on guidance.

1171
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,208
<i>All personnel to launch stations.</i>

1172
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,240
And how was your flight?

1173
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,455
Lovely.

1174
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,960
The ride from the airport, less so.

1175
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,606
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

1176
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,683
Including Captain America.

1177
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,691
This facility is biometrically controlled.

1178
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,770
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

1179
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:03,926
I've been parking there for two months.

1180
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,760
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?

1181
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,215
I think Afghanistan.

1182
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,242
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

1183
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,815
Well, he could've said something.

1184
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,731
Must be the dish.

1185
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,124
I'll check it out.

1186
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,964
<i>Triskelion command
request we clear the area for launch.</i>

1187
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,655
Excuse us.

1188
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:28,126
<i>I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,</i>

1189
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,962
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

1190
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,207
Finally, we're here.

1191
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,843
And the world should be grateful.

1192
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,529
<i>Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,</i>

1193
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,484
<i>this is Steve Rogers.</i>

1194
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,487
<i>You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.</i>

1195
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,807
<i>Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.</i>

1196
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,370
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1197
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,682
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1198
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,609
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1199
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,404
<i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i>

1200
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,841
<i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.</i>

1201
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,120
<i>I don't know how many more,</i>

1202
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,800
but I know they're in the building.

1203
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,089
<i>They could be standing
right next to you.</i>

1204
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,324
<i>They almost have what they want.</i>

1205
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,202
<i>Absolute control.</i>

1206
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,045
They shot Nick Fury.

1207
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,286
<i>And it won't end there.</i>

1208
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,047
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1209
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,520
<i>HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.</i>

1210
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,891
<i>Unless we stop them.</i>

1211
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,006
<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

1212
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,083
<i>But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.</i>

1213
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,729
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1214
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,890
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1215
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,324
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1216
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,368
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

1217
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,484
You smug son of a bitch.

1218
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,641
Arrest him.

1219
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,130
I guess I've got the floor.

1220
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,924
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1221
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,855
Is there a problem?

1222
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:34,881
Um...

1223
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,921
Is there a problem?

1224
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,201
I'm sorry, sir.

1225
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,127
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1226
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,126
Captain's orders.

1227
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,606
Move away from your station.

1228
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,007
Like he said...

1229
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,255
Hold it right there.

1230
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,645
Put the gun down!

1231
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,801
Captain's orders.

1232
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,645
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1233
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,084
Depends on where you're standing.

1234
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,040
Close the bay door!

1235
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,360
Close the bay door now!

1236
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,807
Close the bay door!

1237
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:19,886
They're initiating launch.

1238
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,686
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

1239
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,480
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1240
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,721
Hey, Cap,

1241
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,975
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1242
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,001
You okay?

1243
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:25,685
I'm not dead yet.

1244
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,404
Let me ask you a question.

1245
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,049
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

1246
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,520
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

1247
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:46,445
into a soccer stadium for execution,

1248
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,202
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

1249
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:53,601
Wouldn't you?

1250
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,450
Wouldn't you all?

1251
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,810
Not if it was your switch.

1252
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,526
I'm sorry.

1253
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,530
Did I step on your moment?

1254
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,367
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1255
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:38,481
Falcon, status?

1256
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:39,881
Engaging.

1257
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,286
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1258
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,727
Shit.

1259
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:40,685
<i>Eight minutes, Cap.</i>

1260
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,565
Working on it.

1261
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,015
What are you doing?

1262
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,695
She's disabling security protocols

1263
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:55,520
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

1264
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,360
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1265
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,681
If you do this,

1266
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,604
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

1267
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,206
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

1268
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,925
as you really are?

1269
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,125
Are you?

1270
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,407
Alpha lock.

1271
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,851
Falcon, where are you now?

1272
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:32,922
I had to take a detour.

1273
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,841
Whoo!

1274
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,124
Yeah!

1275
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,167
I'm in.

1276
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,643
Bravo lock.

1277
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,726
Two down, one to go.

1278
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,840
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1279
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:30,006
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1280
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,165
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1281
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,010
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1282
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,255
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1283
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,926
Did you get my flowers?

1284
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,480
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

1285
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:52,123
Because I thought you had me killed.

1286
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:53,805
You know how the game works.

1287
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,655
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1288
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:57,966
Because you were the best,

1289
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,720
and the most ruthless person
I ever met.

1290
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,161
I did what I did to protect people.

1291
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,048
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1292
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,281
Disorder. War.

1293
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,601
It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1294
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,962
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1295
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,965
Diplomacy?

1296
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,441
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1297
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:23,284
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.

1298
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,771
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.

1299
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:33,284
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1300
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,610
by sacrificing 20 million.

1301
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,128
It's the next step, Nick.

1302
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:40,446
If you have the courage to take it.

1303
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,722
No. I have the courage not to.

1304
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,175
<i>Retinal scanner active.</i>

1305
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:53,001
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

1306
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:55,128
I know you erased my password.

1307
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,243
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1308
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:00,644
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr Secretary,

1309
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:07,610
you need to keep both eyes open.

1310
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,525
<i>Alpha level confirmed.</i>

1311
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,843
<i>Encryption code accepted.</i>

1312
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,206
<i>Safeguards removed.</i>

1313
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:20,564
Charlie carrier is
45 degrees off the port bow.

1314
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,361
Six minutes.

1315
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,000
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1316
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,530
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

1317
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,366
I just did!

1318
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:56,043
You know, you're a lot heavier
than you look.

1319
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:57,366
I had a big breakfast.

1320
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:01,291
Steve!

1321
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,320
<i>Cap! Cap, come in.
Are you okay?</i>

1322
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,006
Yeah, I'm here.

1323
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:36,720
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1324
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,290
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm grounded.</i>

1325
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:42,247
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1326
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,929
Don't worry. I got it.

1327
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,615
<i>Emergency evacuation alert.</i>

1328
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,610
<i>All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.</i>

1329
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:55,280
All S.H.I.E.L.D.
agents regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1330
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,928
<i>Sir, the Council's been breached.</i>

1331
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:05,641
- Repeat, Dispatch.
<i>- Black Widow's up there.</i>

1332
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,171
Headed up.

1333
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,646
- Falcon?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1334
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,775
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1335
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,801
I'm on it.

1336
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,480
People are gonna die, Buck.

1337
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,050
I can't let that happen.

1338
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:38,845
Please don't make me do this.

1339
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,087
Done.

1340
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:52,081
And it's trending.

1341
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,615
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

1342
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,766
I'd put that gun down.

1343
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,408
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.

1344
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,321
Drop it!

1345
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:43,961
Drop it!

1346
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:07,723
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

1347
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:16,044
This is gonna hurt.

1348
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:20,403
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.

1349
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,841
And order only comes through pain.

1350
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,607
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

1351
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,815
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1352
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,975
<i>65 seconds to satellite link.</i>

1353
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,004
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1354
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,081
One minute.

1355
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,525
<i>30 seconds, Cap.</i>

1356
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:04,685
Stand by.

1357
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,010
Charlie...

1358
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:20,575
<i>We've reached 3,000 feet.</i>

1359
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:21,680
Sat link coming online now.

1360
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:25,201
Deploy algorithm.

1361
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,520
Algorithm deployed.

1362
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:30,800
<i>We are go to target.</i>

1363
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,165
<i>Target saturation reached.</i>

1364
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,615
All targets assigned.

1365
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,687
Fire when ready.

1366
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,366
Firing in...

1367
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,601
<i>Three,</i>

1368
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,935
two...

1369
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:02,411
One.

1370
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,127
Charlie lock.

1371
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:07,601
Where are the targets?

1372
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,081
Where are the targets?

1373
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:11,926
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1374
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,361
Fire now.

1375
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,680
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

1376
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,601
<i>Do it now!</i>

1377
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:06,161
What a waste.

1378
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,529
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

1379
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:12,803
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way.
Come on.

1380
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,805
You're going to fly me out of here.

1381
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,163
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

1382
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:19,691
You already did.

1383
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:21,808
You will again, when it's useful.

1384
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:36,281
Romanoff.

1385
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,081
Natasha.

1386
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,924
Natasha! Come on!

1387
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,525
Those really do sting.

1388
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,971
Hail HYDRA.

1389
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:21,930
You're out of your depth, kid.

1390
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,130
Son of a bitch!

1391
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,120
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1392
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:43,200
<i>Sam, where are you?</i>

1393
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,483
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1394
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:47,250
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1395
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:48,521
Not an option!

1396
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:05,482
41st floor! 41st!

1397
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:09,162
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

1398
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:13,040
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

1399
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,601
You know me.

1400
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:33,691
No, I don't!

1401
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,531
Bucky.

1402
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,485
You've known me your whole life.

1403
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:58,965
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1404
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:00,400
Shut up!

1405
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:10,565
I'm not gonna fight you.

1406
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:15,891
You're my friend.

1407
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,285
You're my mission.

1408
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,562
You're my mission!

1409
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:32,921
Then finish it.

1410
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,607
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

1411
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:51,611
On your left.

1412
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,001
<i>Do you solemnly
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,</i>

1413
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:46,281
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

1414
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,925
<i>I do.</i>

1415
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,680
<i>Why haven't
we yet heard from Captain Rogers?</i>

1416
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,243
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.

1417
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:58,283
I think the wreck in
the middle of the Potomac

1418
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,855
made his point fairly eloquently.

1419
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:00,920
Well, he could explain how

1420
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,646
this country is expected to maintain
its national security

1421
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:07,930
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1422
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:10,322
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

1423
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:13,370
Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.

1424
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:14,800
Agent, you should know

1425
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,644
that there are some on this committee

1426
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:18,968
who feel, given your service record,

1427
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:20,889
both for this country and against it,

1428
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,404
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1429
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,568
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1430
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,084
You're not going to put me in a prison.

1431
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:34,005
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

1432
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,851
Do enlighten us.

1433
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,451
Because you need us.

1434
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:41,847
<i>Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,</i>

1435
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,202
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

1436
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,525
<i>But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.</i>

1437
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:51,128
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1438
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:53,844
You'll know where to find me.

1439
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:32,164
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1440
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:34,205
You get used to it.

1441
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,082
We've been data mining HYDRA'S files.

1442
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,448
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1443
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,365
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1444
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,560
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1445
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,370
There's something I got to do first.

1446
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,806
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

1447
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,564
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1448
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,444
All right, then.

1449
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:07,290
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

1450
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,684
You should be honoured.
That's about as close as he gets

1451
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,530
to saying thank you.

1452
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:14,761
Not going with him?

1453
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,526
No.

1454
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:18,722
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1455
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,720
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

1456
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:22,921
That might take a while.

1457
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,044
I'm counting on it.

1458
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,406
That thing you asked for,

1459
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:31,081
I called in a few favours from Kiev.

1460
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:36,771
Will you do me a favour? Call that nurse.

1461
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,406
She's not a nurse.

1462
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:40,443
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1463
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,442
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1464
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,201
She's nice.

1465
02:05:57,680 --> 02:05:59,444
Be careful, Steve.

1466
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,009
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1467
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,324
You're going after him.

1468
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,006
You don't have to come with me.

1469
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,241
I know.

1470
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,361
When do we start?

1471
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:24,401
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1472
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,451
Everything he knows about.

1473
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,960
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1474
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:30,889
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1475
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,809
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1476
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:36,644
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1477
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:41,970
What we have

1478
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,651
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1479
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:52,966
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1480
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:59,606
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1481
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:04,207
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

1482
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,243
and keep them off our scent.

1483
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:08,681
What about the volunteers?

1484
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:10,445
The dead will be buried so deep

1485
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:12,808
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1486
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,120
And the survivors?

1487
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:19,765
The twins.

1488
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,449
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1489
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,563
It's not a world of spies any more.

1490
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:32,728
Not even a world of heroes.

1491
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:36,451
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1492
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,607
There's nothing more horrifying

1493
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,566
than a miracle.

1493
02:09:43,305 --> 02:10:43,388
