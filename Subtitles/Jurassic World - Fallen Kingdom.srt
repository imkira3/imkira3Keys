3
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:18,040
Relax.

4
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:20,146
Anything in here
would be dead by now.

5
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:43,500
There she is...

6
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:46,269
the <i>Indominus rex.</i>

7
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,577
<i>Specimen collected.</i>

8
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,245
<i>Sent to the surface.</i>

9
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:30,312
Roger that.

10
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:31,680
Air One, clear for takeoff.

11
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:33,415
- Begin tracking.
- Copy that.

12
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,521
- Go, go!
- Tracking on.

13
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:48,264
<i>Land One, the asset is secure.</i>

14
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,133
<i>We got what we came for.</i>

15
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:51,835
We're coming back for you.
Close the doors.

16
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,635
Marine One,
I got to close the gates.

17
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:54,770
Get out of there.

18
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:57,208
Understood. We're heading out.

19
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:18,327
Marine One,
I need to close the gates.

20
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,495
Confirm position.

21
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:21,331
Can you hear me?
Are you out?

22
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,166
Marine One?

23
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,235
- Guys?
- What is that?

24
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:32,175
Marine One,
I'm closing the gates.

25
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,815
Seriously, guys,
I'm kind of exposed out here.

26
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,817
Marine One,
confirm you're out.

27
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,286
Marine One, confirm position.

28
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:45,288
Can you hear me?
Marine One, where are you?

29
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,790
- He's over there! - Now! Run!
- Look behind you!

30
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,528
I can't reach them!

31
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,428
- Come on!
- What?!

32
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,300
What is going on?

33
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,403
I can't hear you!

34
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,620
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't go!

35
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,826
Throw him the ladder!

36
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,764
Don't go!

37
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:30,399
Oh! Oh, no!

38
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,704
Aah...!

39
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:37,473
No! Wait! Don't go!

40
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:39,209
Oh!

41
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:40,709
No, no! Aah!

42
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:43,680
Oh-ho, ye...

43
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:44,680
Oh! Oh!

44
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:45,815
Oh, God!

45
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:48,218
No! No! Aah! Aah!

46
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,155
God, no!

47
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,257
We're gonna stall!
Cut it now!

48
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,327
- Give him a chance!
- We're gonna die here!

49
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,627
Come on!

50
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,363
- Come on!
- No! No! No!

51
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:04,300
I said cut it!

52
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:05,435
Don't do it! Aah!

53
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:06,538
It's horrible!

54
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,242
Yeah!

55
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,971
DNA sample secure.

56
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,909
Tell the boss
we're coming back home.

57
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:17,540
<i>Three years after
the fall of Jurassic World,</i>

58
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:20,043
<i>the debate over
Isla Nublar rages on.</i>

59
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:22,444
<i>The island's
long-dormant volcano,</i>

60
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:24,413
<i>reclassified as active,</i>

61
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,382
<i>has shown considerable unrest
in recent months.</i>

62
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:30,420
Geologists now predict
an extinction-level event

63
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:33,656
will kill off the last
living dinosaurs on the planet.

64
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:36,858
<i>Since the disaster
that shocked the world in 2015,</i>

65
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,661
<i>the Masrani Corporation
has paid out</i>

66
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:40,697
<i>more than over 800 million
in damages</i>

67
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,832
<i>to settle class-action lawsuits
brought by survivors.</i>

68
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,802
<i>Activist groups have mobilized</i>

69
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:48,370
<i>around the globe
in what has become</i>

70
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,074
<i>the flashpoint animal rights
issue of our time.</i>

71
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:53,543
With an eruption expected
at any moment,

72
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:56,012
<i>the U.S. Senate has convened
a special committee</i>

73
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:58,413
<i>to answer
a grave moral question:</i>

74
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,750
<i>Do dinosaurs deserve
the same protections</i>

75
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,918
<i>given to other
endangered species,</i>

76
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,555
<i>or should they be left to die?</i>

77
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:09,057
I think that we should allow

78
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,694
our, uh, magnificent
and glorious dinosaurs...

79
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:15,531
to be taken out by the volcano.

80
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:18,367
Murderer.

81
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:20,636
- Silence, please.
- As... as deeply sad

82
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:22,637
as that would be...

83
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,774
we altered the course
of natural history.

84
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:27,776
This is a correction.

85
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:30,379
Are you suggesting
the Almighty is...

86
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,980
taking matters
in his own hands?

87
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:34,484
Senator, with all due respect,
God's not part

88
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:35,884
of the equation, no.

89
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,519
What I mean is that,

90
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:39,989
in the last century,
we amassed, uh,

91
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:41,990
landmark technological power,

92
00:08:41,992 --> 00:08:44,827
and we've consistently
proven ourselves incapable

93
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,428
of handling that power.

94
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,398
80 years ago,
who could have predicted

95
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,799
nuclear proliferation?
But then there it was.

96
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,033
And now we've got
genetic power.

97
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:53,668
So, how long is it gonna take

98
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,705
for that to spread
around the globe,

99
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:58,441
and what's
gonna be done with it?

100
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:01,510
It ain't gonna stop with the
de-extinction of the dinosaurs.

101
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,446
Uh, I'm not sure I know

102
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:05,114
what you're talking about.

103
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:06,849
I'm talking about...

104
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:09,452
man-made cataclysmic...

105
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,120
change.

106
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:13,088
What kind of change?

107
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,991
Change is like death.

108
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:18,160
You don't know
what it looks like

109
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:21,596
until you're standing
at the gates.

110
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:35,977
Your vocal support

111
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:37,980
would give Congress
a clear message

112
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:40,450
that dinosaurs are
sentient beings that deserve

113
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,952
to be treated with dignity.
As a matter of fact,

114
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:44,953
I do have the dinosaurs'
best interests in mind.

115
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:47,155
- I'm a paleo-veterinarian.
- Is that a real thing?

116
00:09:47,157 --> 00:09:48,825
- That's a real thing.
- You've seen one?

117
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:50,726
No, I haven't seen one
with my own eyes.

118
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,495
You know, not everyone
can afford to spend

119
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:54,097
their life savings...
Claire.

120
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,202
Oh, uh, hello, hello, um...

121
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:01,671
- Congresswoman Delgado.
- Congresswoman Delgado.

122
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:03,773
I'm-I'm Claire.
I'm the lead organizer here.

123
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:07,809
Uh, of course. But if I could
just get a moment of your time?

124
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,144
Great.

125
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,614
Thank you.
Um, so, our mission here

126
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:14,484
at the Dinosaur Protection
Group is to secure

127
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,052
federal funding for a...

128
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,053
That was, like, 40 seconds.
You're getting better.

129
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:20,056
You got to stop letting
your mom shop for you.

130
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:22,124
You don't need
to insult me every time

131
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,125
- someone pisses you off.
- Dude, I'm a doctor,

132
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,495
not a telemarketer.

133
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:26,761
What is your job again?

134
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:28,764
You plug in cords, right?

135
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,899
It's actually more important
than it sounds.

136
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,768
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go on.

137
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,537
- Do you have kids?
- Two girls.

138
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:36,905
Okay. So, your kids,
an entire generation,

139
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:38,673
has grown up in a world

140
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:40,976
where dinosaurs
are living and breathing.

141
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:44,514
But soon they're gonna have
to watch them go extinct...

142
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:47,917
or not, if people like you
make a difference.

143
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,019
Set up a meeting with my office

144
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,223
- after the hearing.
- Great.

145
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,923
Yes!

146
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,826
We now go live
to the Capitol...

147
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:59,662
- Claire. It's on.
- Hey, hey, turn it up.

148
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:02,631
- Turn it up.
- ...take preventative action

149
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:05,801
to protect the dinosaurs
on Isla Nublar.

150
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,903
After a thorough deliberations,
the committee has resolved

151
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:10,673
not to recommend
any legislative action

152
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:14,210
regarding the de-extinct
creatures on Isla Nublar.

153
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:16,077
This is an act of God.

154
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,614
And while, of course,
we feel great sympathy

155
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:19,948
for these animals,

156
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,851
we cannot condone
government involvement

157
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:25,254
on what amounts
to a privately owned venture.

158
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:31,729
They're all gonna die,
and no one cares.

159
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,199
We do.

160
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:42,270
Give me one second.
Let's get back to work.

161
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:44,175
Okay, everyone, come on.

162
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:48,711
Hello?

163
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,712
May I speak with Ms. Dearing?

164
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:52,715
- Yes, this is Claire Dearing.
- Good morning.

165
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:54,783
I'm calling from
Mr. Benjamin Lockwood's estate.

166
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:56,851
Would you mind holding
for a second?

167
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:59,123
Yes, of c...
of course, I'll hold.

168
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,283
Ms. Dearing, you're early.

169
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:30,285
Would you like to step in?

170
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:32,754
Thank you.

171
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:35,761
I will inform Mr. Mills
that you've arrived.

172
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,948
John Alfred Hammond,

173
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,951
the father of Jurassic Park.

174
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,653
But of course, you know that.

175
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:05,754
Hello, Claire.
I'm, uh, I'm Eli Mills.

176
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,288
I work for Ben Lockwood.

177
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,058
We actually met once,
seven, eight years ago,

178
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,961
- and you don't remember...
- Of course I remember.

179
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:13,162
Haven't you run
his foundation since...

180
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:14,764
Since college, yeah.
Y-You remember?

181
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:17,099
- Yes.
- Wow. Cool. He, uh...

182
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:19,101
he wanted someone young
and, uh, idealistic

183
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:22,772
to spend his fortune...
and I used to be both.

184
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:25,975
Follow me.

185
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:28,778
Let me give you
a bit of history.

186
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,346
This is where it all began.

187
00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:33,682
Before the island, Sorna,
Jurassic Park, all of it.

188
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:36,052
Hammond and Lockwood
built a custom lab

189
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:38,888
in the subbasement,
extracted the first DNA

190
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,057
from amber
right beneath our feet.

191
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,058
Oh, my goodness.

192
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,794
What they did here
was a miracle.

193
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:47,263
I still believe that.

194
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:49,999
So do I, Claire. So do I.

195
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:53,803
And I still believe it matters
what happens to those animals.

196
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,270
There is something

197
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:58,073
Mr. Lockwood would very much
like you to do, Claire.

198
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:01,009
You can call it a favor
for an old friend.

199
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:04,046
We have a piece of land.

200
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:07,149
A sanctuary protected
by natural barriers,

201
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:09,018
fully self-sustaining.

202
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,221
A new home where the dinosaurs
will be secure and free.

203
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,255
You're gonna get them out?

204
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:16,057
You're gonna save them?

205
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,827
No, Ms. Dearing.

206
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:20,428
I'm going to save us.

207
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,331
We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?

208
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,333
Lovely to see you again.

209
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:27,503
- And you, Mr. Lockwood.
- Hmm.

210
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:31,173
This was all
John Hammond's dream,

211
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:33,875
to let these creatures
live in peace.

212
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:37,112
So we have created sanctuary.

213
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:39,514
No fences, no cages,

214
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:41,484
no tourists...

215
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:44,120
just as Mother Nature intended.

216
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:46,889
John said it best:

217
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:50,125
"These creatures don't need
our protection.

218
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:52,930
They need our absence."

219
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:58,933
When we were young,
we both shared this passion,

220
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,035
John and I.

221
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:03,007
What fools we were.

222
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:07,509
Trying to run
before we'd learned to walk.

223
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:10,449
As all young men do, I suppose.

224
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:14,383
But... we learned.

225
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:18,356
Unfortunately, in the end,
it drove us apart.

226
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:24,527
Life teaches us
some very hard lessons,

227
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,398
doesn't it, Claire?

228
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,999
Yes.

229
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:32,101
- Sir Benjamin.
- Hmm?

230
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:34,570
Ah. My bloody medicines.

231
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:36,572
Will you excuse me, Claire?

232
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:38,139
Of course.

233
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:40,942
Eli here will help you
with the details.

234
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:43,047
We will save them.

235
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:47,950
What a gift...

236
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:49,918
for our children.

237
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,522
Thank you.

238
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:54,126
Iris.

239
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,562
Does he have children?
I-I thought I saw...

240
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:02,564
- Was there a little girl...
- Uh, he has a grandchild.

241
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,868
He's, uh, his daughter died
in a car accident.

242
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,602
- That's awful.
- Yeah, I know.

243
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:10,538
But they're very close.
Really close.

244
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,241
So what do you need from me?

245
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:16,178
There was a tracking system
in place at your park...

246
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,413
radio-frequency ID chips
in each dinosaur.

247
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:20,216
- I remember.
- Right. So if we could access

248
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,283
that system,
our ability to locate

249
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:24,285
and capture
those animals safely

250
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,921
would increase tenfold.

251
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:28,224
We need your handprint
to access the system.

252
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:31,427
But what I really need,
Claire...

253
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,128
is you.

254
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,563
Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal,

255
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,600
but it's the right thing to do.

256
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:39,534
No one knows this park
as well as you do,

257
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:41,537
and we need that expertise.

258
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,340
- How many can you save?
- 11 species, for sure.

259
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:47,308
I mean, more if we can...
but time is against us.

260
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,312
I'm afraid there is one animal
in particular

261
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:54,616
that poses
a real challenge for us.

262
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,952
- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name,

263
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:58,586
but Blue is potentially

264
00:16:58,588 --> 00:17:01,123
the second most intelligent
piece of life on this planet,

265
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,626
and she's the last of her kind.
She must be preserved.

266
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,660
She can pick up your scent
a mile off...

267
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:07,029
you'll never capture her.

268
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:09,031
Well...

269
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:12,066
we thought you might know
someone who could help.

270
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:15,172
Maybe you could convince him.

271
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:56,445
Hey, Owen.

272
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:01,952
Owen!

273
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,555
Oh, boy.

274
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:13,195
Hi.

275
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:16,165
Back for more, huh?

276
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,132
Can I buy you a beer?

277
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:22,236
Did you bring 'em, or do we
gotta, like, go somewhere?

278
00:18:28,312 --> 00:18:31,379
I'm sorry. Seriously?

279
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,681
I can't believe you think
that you left me.

280
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:35,417
Replay the conversation
in your head, all right?

281
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,152
You said, "You wanna go live
in your van like a bum?

282
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:40,155
Go ahead, Owen."

283
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:42,157
And I said, "Okay."

284
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,561
- So how is that you leaving me?
- Because I left. I left you.

285
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:48,429
You left because I told you to.

286
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:51,766
And then I left. Because you
didn't wanna live in a van

287
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,235
- on the side of the road, remember?
- No. No, no, no, no.

288
00:18:54,237 --> 00:18:56,437
Because you wouldn't let me
drive the damn van

289
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,006
- for five minutes.
- I'm chivalrous.

290
00:18:58,008 --> 00:19:00,242
- What can I do?
- You are so stubborn.

291
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:02,076
Well, look at you now.
You're saving the world, so...

292
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:04,079
Well, I'm trying at least.
You can't just run away

293
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:05,481
from everything, Owen.

294
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,081
So you're what...

295
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,550
dating an accountant now?

296
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:10,718
An insurance actuary?

297
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,121
Your skin looks nice.

298
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:17,726
- Dermatologist?
- Owen...

299
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,660
- Does he check you for moles?
- Stop.

300
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:22,630
- Ventriloquist?
- This is not why we're here, okay?

301
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:24,600
Yeah, I know why we're here.

302
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:26,601
Lockwood's little flunky
called me.

303
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,536
Rescue Op.
Save the dinosaurs

304
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:32,140
from an island that's about to
explode... what could go wrong?

305
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:34,075
- I'm going.
- Don't.

306
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:36,645
- I don't have a choice.
- What? Of course you have a choice.

307
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:39,814
So what, I should just...
build my own cabin, play pool,

308
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:42,083
and drink beer all day while
these dinosaurs go extinct?

309
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:43,385
Yeah.

310
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:45,053
I like pool.

311
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:47,191
Blue is alive.

312
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,258
Jesus, Claire.

313
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,428
You raised her, Owen.
You... you spent years

314
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,429
of your life working with her.

315
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:56,700
You're just gonna let her die?

316
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:00,168
Well, yeah.

317
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:06,511
Come on, you're a better man
than... you think you are.

318
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:10,448
You should write
fortune cookies.

319
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:13,247
Forget it, I...

320
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:16,485
There's a charter flight
leaving tomorrow morning.

321
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:17,619
You're on the manifest.

322
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,290
I just wanted to let you know.

323
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:36,737
<i>All right, chow time,</i>

324
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:38,306
<i>chow time.</i>

325
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:39,608
<i>Whoa, whoa.</i>

326
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,275
Back up. Back off.

327
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:43,611
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Geesh!

328
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:46,482
Take it easy. Echo.

329
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:48,684
Geez. There's plenty of food.

330
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,886
God, you guys been eating
sugar or something?

331
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:52,821
You're hyper today.

332
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,756
Okay, okay.

333
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:58,526
Back up. Thank you, Blue.

334
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:02,898
Whoa, whoa.

335
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:09,237
Did you get that?

336
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:20,282
Relax.
You're more likely to die

337
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:21,883
riding on a horse
than in a plane.

338
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:23,851
No, I'm not,
'cause I won't get on a horse.

339
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:26,522
- My chances are zero.
- Planes are the safest way to travel.

340
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:28,322
You call this
a plane? My cousin has

341
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:30,324
a drone bigger than this.

342
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,833
Owen!

343
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:40,369
Franklin, you wiener,
get on the plane.

344
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:42,670
Didn't think you
were gonna ever show up.

345
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:45,474
Oh, um, this is Zia Rodriguez.

346
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,809
- Zia.
- Hey. How you doing?

347
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:49,277
- Yeah. Real good. How are you?
- Good.

348
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,548
Franklin Webb.
Systems analyst.

349
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:55,650
- Nervous flyer?
- Would you ride

350
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:57,852
a thousand-pound horse that's
been abused all its life?

351
00:21:57,854 --> 00:21:59,487
I rode my motorcycle
through the jungle

352
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:01,523
with a pack of raptors.

353
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,728
We're not compatible.

354
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,274
<i>Maisie?</i>

355
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:20,943
You're always hiding from me.

356
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:23,214
This is not my job,
looking for you.

357
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:25,847
Maisie!

358
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:30,688
Maisie?

359
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:33,757
Come out!

360
00:22:47,004 --> 00:22:49,937
- Boo!
- Oh! You silly sausage.

361
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:51,773
You'll be the death of me.
You know, one day

362
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,341
my heart might really stop.

363
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:54,642
Then what would you do?

364
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:56,410
Go and live in the forest
with the lions?

365
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:57,812
There are no lions
in the forest.

366
00:22:57,814 --> 00:22:59,648
Your grandfather's
been asking for you.

367
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,283
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. So you go see your grandfather, and then

368
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:03,951
- you go straight to your bath.
- I don't want a bath.

369
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:06,787
A what?! Queen's English,
girl. "Bath"!

370
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,456
- Bath. Bath.
- Bath.

371
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,658
Bath, not "bath."
You're not a wild animal.

372
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,828
Stop it.

373
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,835
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Ah, there you are.

374
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:22,670
Come over and sit by me.

375
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:25,340
- I've missed you.
- I was on safari all the way

376
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:27,575
through the Cretaceous
to the Jurassic in one day.

377
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:30,611
- Oh, my. What'd you see?
- Mostly herbivores.

378
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:32,414
There was one T. rex, though.

379
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,015
Casualties, of course.

380
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:35,950
Iris included.

381
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:38,352
She jumped out of her skin.

382
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:40,357
You have your mother's
wicked sense of humor.

383
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:44,862
Do I look like her?

384
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,433
Oh, yes.

385
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:53,368
You could be her mirror image.

386
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,603
Did my mother
ever visit the park?

387
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,938
Once...

388
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,341
a long time ago.

389
00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:02,878
She would have saved them,
too, you know.

390
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,746
<i>She would have saved them all.</i>

391
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:04,542
Claire.

392
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,145
Ken Wheatley. Welcome back.

393
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:11,812
Quite an operation
you've got going on here.

394
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,982
Mr. Lockwood takes
his humanitarian efforts

395
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,516
very seriously.

396
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:17,918
Where's the, uh,
raptor wrangler?

397
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Animal behaviorist.

398
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:22,890
- Owen Grady.
- Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley.

399
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,092
And you are...
Great White Hunter?

400
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:26,660
I guess.

401
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:29,731
I'm the expedition facilitator.

402
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:30,931
Oh, God!

403
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,868
It's hot!

404
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,473
It's about to get
a whole lot hotter.

405
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:43,544
Keep it moving!
You're all clear!

406
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:46,680
Go! Go, you've got
the green light!

407
00:25:46,682 --> 00:25:48,749
This way, let's go!

408
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:51,652
Let's go! Keep it moving!

409
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:54,054
Hold it! Hold up!

410
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,167
Need some bug spray?

411
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:09,036
Bug spray?

412
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:10,938
The T. rex would be dead
by now, right?

413
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,608
No. It's impossible
to know the max lifespan

414
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,677
of a clone in a completely
different environment.

415
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,813
Take a caveman that would
have lived 20 years, feed him

416
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:20,614
prime meals,
give him health care,

417
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:22,486
he's gonna live...
five times as long.

418
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:27,121
So she'd be dead by now.

419
00:26:27,123 --> 00:26:29,524
Right?

420
00:27:13,937 --> 00:27:15,907
Bad memories?

421
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,645
Some were good.

422
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:32,489
What was that?

423
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:41,064
Is it the T. rex?

424
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:50,938
I have to see this.

425
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,207
Hey. Miss?

426
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:54,876
Miss!

427
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:56,814
This area's not secured.

428
00:28:27,978 --> 00:28:29,945
Look at that.

429
00:28:29,947 --> 00:28:32,883
Never thought I'd see one
in real life.

430
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:35,920
She's beautiful.

431
00:28:47,898 --> 00:28:50,031
Can we...?

432
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,814
Okay, let's go.

433
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,685
Okay, okay.

434
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:13,053
Okay, main system.

435
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,357
Turn on control.

436
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,195
It should be working.

437
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:26,935
Come on, tiger.

438
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:28,773
You know what you're doing?

439
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,313
After you, tiger.

440
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:39,380
Are we sure
these biometric chips

441
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:40,649
are still transmitting?

442
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:42,183
Battery would be dead by now.

443
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:44,686
- All right.
- The dinosaur is the battery.

444
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:46,687
They're powered
by body heat and movement.

445
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:47,924
Hand.

446
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:53,328
How much longer until...

447
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:57,701
I'm in.

448
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:03,071
There's a large
concentration on the east dock.

449
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:05,305
That's our boat... we've already
captured a bunch of 'em.

450
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:08,443
- Without the tracking system?
- The big herbivores

451
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:09,744
are easy to find.

452
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:11,146
Can you isolate that raptor?

453
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:12,617
- I need a species code.
- D-nine.

454
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:20,287
There she is. I'm gonna need
to borrow your truck.

455
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:21,856
I'm coming with you...
we don't know

456
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:23,323
what kind of condition
she might be in.

457
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:26,130
Miss, things could get hairy
out there.

458
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:30,165
These are powerful sedatives.

459
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,700
One too many, and she
could have respiratory failure.

460
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:34,703
Also, I'm not
as soft and witless

461
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:37,104
as your comment implies.

462
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:39,174
Let's go, beefcake.

463
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:40,410
Oh, Owen?

464
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,149
Be careful, okay?

465
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:50,318
If I don't make it back...

466
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,887
remember...

467
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:55,126
you're the one
who made me come.

468
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:59,295
I'll be all right.

469
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:11,939
We're not gonna get any closer
to her in this thing.

470
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:14,911
- We should stop here.
- Hold up!

471
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,880
Load out, look alive,
stay alive.

472
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:22,417
- We got your back, brother.
- Yeah.

473
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:24,886
Claire, I'm
gonna have to track her alone.

474
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:27,354
I'll need you to be my eyes
if she runs. Copy?

475
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:28,822
Copy that.

476
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,426
Wheatley, I'm on fresh sign.

477
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:07,262
Wait for my signal.

478
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:34,824
There you are.

479
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:50,908
Hey, girl. You miss me?

480
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:54,876
Easy. Hey!

481
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:56,878
Hey.

482
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,014
I brought you something.

483
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:06,356
Here you go.

484
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:09,059
That's right.

485
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:13,293
Okay.

486
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,062
Hey.

487
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:21,870
You know me.

488
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,937
Eyes on me.

489
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:25,907
Yeah.

490
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:28,408
Yeah.

491
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,210
Yeah.

492
00:33:30,212 --> 00:33:32,981
You know me.

493
00:33:32,983 --> 00:33:34,948
That's right.

494
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,886
That's right.

495
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:40,321
Hold your...

496
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:43,891
I told you to wait
for my signal!

497
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:51,399
Back your men up right now.

498
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,113
No, hey, no, no,
don't shoot her!

499
00:34:10,386 --> 00:34:14,324
Wheatley, you son of a bitch!

500
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:25,565
Owen! What are you doing?!

501
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,237
Owen.

502
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,645
You shoot me...

503
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:39,547
and that animal dies.

504
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:42,016
I think we have the drop
on you, sweetheart.

505
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:45,185
She's losing blood,
and if I don't treat her...

506
00:34:45,187 --> 00:34:47,457
she'll never make it
back to camp.

507
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:58,299
How about this?

508
00:34:58,301 --> 00:35:01,034
That animal dies, I shoot you.

509
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,036
You're gonna take care of her.

510
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:04,538
Let's move out!

511
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:19,453
Cut the cord and let's go!

512
00:35:19,455 --> 00:35:21,321
Let's get out of here!

513
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:27,362
No! No! No!

514
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:28,696
No, wait!

515
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:34,237
Wait, a-are they protecting us?
What's going on?

516
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:37,571
I don't think so.

517
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:41,712
Why am I here?!

518
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,748
<i>Hey, Mills, we got her done!</i>

519
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,219
<i>Mission accomplished!</i>

520
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:54,288
Just in the nick of time.

521
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,723
Wheatley, what the hell
is going on there?

522
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:57,257
We're a day
behind schedule already.

523
00:35:57,259 --> 00:35:58,692
I want that money in the bank

524
00:35:58,694 --> 00:36:00,627
- by the time I get back, all right?
- Okay, good.

525
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:02,330
Listen to me,
no more delays, okay?

526
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:04,065
- Mr. Mills?
- If we don't get those animal...

527
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,067
Not now, Maisie, thank you.
If we don't get those...

528
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:09,006
- Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs safe...
- I said not now!

529
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,639
Mills?! Mills?!

530
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:15,208
I'm sorry, honey.
This is an important call.

531
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,777
If you go up to the library,

532
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:19,279
- I'll meet you up there in a few minutes.
- Okay.

533
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:20,781
Okay, I'll tell you
all about it, I promise.

534
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:23,417
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

535
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:24,752
Wheatley...

536
00:36:24,754 --> 00:36:28,623
you get those animals here now.

537
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,257
I want that bonus.
We got the blue one.

538
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,793
Bring her to me first!

539
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:35,196
<i>All right.</i>

540
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:50,670
No.

541
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:11,592
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

542
00:38:11,594 --> 00:38:13,261
Hello?

543
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:14,629
Hello? Is anybody there?

544
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:16,496
Can anybody copy?

545
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,433
I'm-I'm trying everything.

546
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:20,835
It's jammed.

547
00:38:20,837 --> 00:38:22,770
"Just take the job, son,
build your people skills."

548
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:24,638
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

549
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,540
That's it.

550
00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:30,480
Proximity alert.

551
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:35,415
- Something's coming.
- Where does that tunnel lead?

552
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:37,384
Well, it connects
to the rest of the...

553
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:40,721
...park.

554
00:38:44,393 --> 00:38:45,759
It's the T. rex.
It's the T. rex.

555
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:46,960
It's the T. rex.
Claire, it's the T. rex.

556
00:38:46,962 --> 00:38:48,228
It's the T. rex.
It's the T. rex.

557
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,364
Will you stop?
It's not the T. rex.

558
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:54,368
- Probably.
- "Probably"?

559
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,571
Lava! Lava!

560
00:38:57,573 --> 00:38:59,574
Lava. Lava.

561
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:01,641
Deep breaths, Franklin.

562
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:20,694
- See?! Not a T. rex!
- How is this better?!

563
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:34,708
Claire, what do we do?!
What do we do?!

564
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:38,411
It's stuck!

565
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:39,649
Chair!

566
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:57,431
Come on! Let's go!

567
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:59,703
Come on, Franklin!

568
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:04,407
We made it! Yeah!

569
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:25,759
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

570
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:27,460
Come on, come on, come on!

571
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:32,468
Yes, yes, go, go! Go, go!

572
00:40:44,314 --> 00:40:46,846
Claire.

573
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,317
Holy sh...

574
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:01,464
Run!

575
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:04,567
Run!

576
00:41:05,968 --> 00:41:08,335
Run!

577
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:19,080
Run!

578
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:21,442
Go, go!

579
00:42:21,444 --> 00:42:23,676
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Buckle up, Franklin.

580
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:25,746
Get in!

581
00:43:45,895 --> 00:43:47,027
Owen!

582
00:44:39,714 --> 00:44:42,181
- We got to get out.
- We just fell from the cliff.

583
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:44,984
We're alive. We're alive.

584
00:44:44,986 --> 00:44:46,987
Franklin, move.

585
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:50,723
No. No, no, no!

586
00:44:50,725 --> 00:44:54,694
No. Claire, we're gonna sink!
Water's leaking!

587
00:44:54,696 --> 00:44:56,730
Oh. Oh, God!

588
00:44:56,732 --> 00:44:59,299
We need to get out!

589
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:02,939
Franklin, watch out!

590
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,308
I want to go home!

591
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,248
- Owen! Owen!
- Owen?

592
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,018
Owen. Okay.

593
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:19,021
Move! Move!

594
00:45:23,326 --> 00:45:25,893
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

595
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:26,895
Push!

596
00:45:29,698 --> 00:45:31,634
Owen! No, no.

597
00:45:34,102 --> 00:45:35,703
Where's he going?

598
00:45:35,705 --> 00:45:37,170
Okay. Okay, don't panic.

599
00:45:37,172 --> 00:45:39,272
- Don't panic.
- We're running out of air.

600
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:41,975
- We're not gonna make it.
- We are. We are.

601
00:45:41,977 --> 00:45:43,612
Take a deep breath.

602
00:46:53,382 --> 00:46:55,748
- Where is Zia?
- It was a double-cross.

603
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,317
They took her.
She must be with Blue.

604
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:59,322
Hey, can you still track 'em?

605
00:47:01,424 --> 00:47:04,091
Not anymore.

606
00:47:04,093 --> 00:47:07,027
It was a lie.
It was a lie.

607
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:09,362
Bastards! It was all a lie!

608
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:25,080
Not all of it.

609
00:47:34,823 --> 00:47:38,058
Move it! Move! Move!

610
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,893
Anything of value,
I want on that boat!

611
00:47:40,895 --> 00:47:42,895
- How you doing?!
- The bolt won't give!

612
00:47:42,897 --> 00:47:46,400
Well, just button it up,
and we'll tow it on! Let's go!

613
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,776
Come on, now.

614
00:48:06,388 --> 00:48:09,223
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

615
00:48:09,225 --> 00:48:11,225
Hang on! Wait up!

616
00:48:11,227 --> 00:48:14,261
Stop that truck! Stop it!

617
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:19,435
Hey, sweetheart.
Hello, hello.

618
00:48:28,277 --> 00:48:29,877
Beautiful.

619
00:48:29,879 --> 00:48:31,714
You're gonna feel that
when you wake up.

620
00:48:33,448 --> 00:48:35,214
Hey, put your weapon down!

621
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:37,152
You got the barrel pointed
right at her head!

622
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:40,120
- Hey, Wheatley!
- They have Zia.

623
00:48:40,122 --> 00:48:41,487
They're loading out.

624
00:48:41,489 --> 00:48:44,525
If they already had the
dinosaurs, why do they need us?

625
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:47,960
They needed the tracking system
to capture Blue.

626
00:48:47,962 --> 00:48:50,096
There she is.
She don't look good.

627
00:48:54,102 --> 00:48:55,902
We need to get on that boat.

628
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:57,504
The rock's good.
We're safe on the rock.

629
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:59,806
It's the boat or the lava,
Franklin.

630
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:01,648
All right, boat's good.
I'm all about the boat.

631
00:49:03,913 --> 00:49:06,246
Go, go, get on the boat!

632
00:49:06,248 --> 00:49:09,052
Get on the boat now! Go, go!

633
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:12,219
Move it, move it!

634
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:16,926
Get that truck!

635
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:35,141
Franklin!

636
00:49:35,143 --> 00:49:38,145
- Hey, get that truck going!
- Okay.

637
00:49:38,147 --> 00:49:40,179
- You okay?
- Am I dead?

638
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:41,384
Not yet, kid.

639
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,926
Come on!

640
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:55,194
Come on!

641
00:49:55,196 --> 00:49:57,431
Give me your hand! Reach!

642
00:49:57,433 --> 00:49:59,035
Come on, reach!

643
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:11,881
Hold on!

644
00:52:15,169 --> 00:52:18,071
Mr. Mills?

645
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:20,009
Your visitor's waiting.

646
00:52:23,277 --> 00:52:25,277
Mr. Eversoll.

647
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:27,279
It's a pleasure
to meet you in person

648
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:29,016
after all this time.
How are ya?

649
00:52:29,018 --> 00:52:30,083
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

650
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:31,585
- Where are the dinosaurs?
- The dinosaurs are, uh,

651
00:52:31,587 --> 00:52:32,520
are en route.

652
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:35,188
Oh, so am I supposed
to sell these ones?

653
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,556
Look, you don't need
to worry, okay?

654
00:52:36,558 --> 00:52:37,656
They will be here soon.

655
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,259
I-I don't really
work with amateurs,

656
00:52:40,261 --> 00:52:42,596
so I'm gonna contact my buyers
and call this off.

657
00:52:42,598 --> 00:52:44,096
They will be here tomorrow,

658
00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:45,565
and your buyers
won't be disappointed.

659
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:46,533
Trust me,
whatever their interest...

660
00:52:46,535 --> 00:52:49,101
agricultural,
industrial, sport hunting...

661
00:52:49,103 --> 00:52:51,071
we will have something
to suit them.

662
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:55,275
11 species, each with unique
biopharmaceutical properties.

663
00:52:55,277 --> 00:52:59,078
I estimate
four million per species.

664
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,516
Four million is a slow Tuesday
where I'm from.

665
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:04,384
You're wasting my time.

666
00:53:04,386 --> 00:53:06,118
You ever made a hundred million
on a Tuesday?

667
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,755
Huh?

668
00:53:08,757 --> 00:53:11,290
All this is in the past.

669
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:13,627
I want to talk to you
about the future.

670
00:53:13,629 --> 00:53:17,132
I'll give you ten minutes.

671
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:21,634
The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs

672
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:24,404
is to finance
our future operations here.

673
00:53:24,406 --> 00:53:26,572
It's, uh, seed money.

674
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:29,676
Call it a-an overture to
something much more ambitious.

675
00:53:29,678 --> 00:53:32,478
Yeah,
and more lucrative, I guess.

676
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,614
Right. We've reactivated
the old facilities,

677
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:37,183
updated the technology,
and imported

678
00:53:37,185 --> 00:53:39,652
the best geneticists
from around the world.

679
00:53:39,654 --> 00:53:41,821
This operation has been
many years in the planning.

680
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:44,324
Genetic power is
an uncharted frontier.

681
00:53:44,326 --> 00:53:48,264
<i>The potential for growth
is more than you can fathom.</i>

682
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:52,264
This way, please.

683
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:54,534
If the entire run
of our sorry history

684
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:57,170
has taught us
one irrevocable lesson,

685
00:53:57,172 --> 00:54:00,272
it's that man is
inevitably drawn to war

686
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:03,810
and is willing to use
any means necessary to win it.

687
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:06,346
- You're gonna weaponize them?
- We've been using animals

688
00:54:06,348 --> 00:54:08,214
in combat for centuries.

689
00:54:08,216 --> 00:54:10,183
Horses, elephants.

690
00:54:10,185 --> 00:54:12,185
The Soviets used
disease-bearing rats

691
00:54:12,187 --> 00:54:14,621
- against the Germans at Stalingrad.
- Yes, yes.

692
00:54:14,623 --> 00:54:16,489
Our geneticists have created

693
00:54:16,491 --> 00:54:19,159
a direct descendant
of Henry Wu's masterpiece,

694
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:21,364
the animal that took down
Jurassic World.

695
00:54:22,464 --> 00:54:24,364
<i>Indominus rex.</i>

696
00:54:24,366 --> 00:54:26,232
Her DNA,
retrieved from the island

697
00:54:26,234 --> 00:54:29,301
way before its destruction,
forms the architecture

698
00:54:29,303 --> 00:54:31,571
of a completely new creature.

699
00:54:31,573 --> 00:54:35,509
Every bone and muscle designed
for hunting and killing.

700
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:37,676
And thanks
to Owen Grady's research,

701
00:54:37,678 --> 00:54:40,279
it follows human command.

702
00:54:40,281 --> 00:54:41,915
We call it...

703
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:43,719
the <i>Indoraptor.</i>

704
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,359
Grandpa?

705
00:54:53,361 --> 00:54:54,529
Grandpa?

706
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:14,714
Grandpa.

707
00:55:14,716 --> 00:55:16,750
Maisie?
What are you doing up?

708
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:20,453
There was a man here today
with Mr. Mills.

709
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:21,855
It was probably
just some business

710
00:55:21,857 --> 00:55:23,422
about the sanctuary,
that's all.

711
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:25,391
I heard them talking...
they're going

712
00:55:25,393 --> 00:55:26,458
to sell the dinosaurs.

713
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,726
They're bringing them here.

714
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:28,828
Well...

715
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,797
I'm sure you misunderstood.

716
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,831
- I know what I heard, Grandpa.
- Maisie,

717
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,500
it's way past your bedtime.

718
00:55:34,502 --> 00:55:36,703
Let's talk about this
in the morning.

719
00:55:36,705 --> 00:55:39,739
- But...
- Maisie, I'll find out tomorrow.

720
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:41,310
Go to bed.

721
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:43,944
Good night.

722
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:45,879
Good night, my heart.

723
00:56:15,243 --> 00:56:16,942
Oh! Jesus.

724
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:27,554
It's okay, Blue.
Just a little longer.

725
00:56:27,556 --> 00:56:29,036
Oh, my God!
You guys are alive! You...

726
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:34,893
Oh, look what
they've done to her.

727
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:37,696
- Who are these assholes?
- Animal traffickers.

728
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:39,565
Look how they're treating them.
They're not gonna take 'em

729
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:40,900
to a sanctuary,
they're gonna sell them.

730
00:56:40,902 --> 00:56:42,935
Not Blue. They need her
for something else.

731
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:45,505
- Like what?
- I don't know, but she's...

732
00:56:45,507 --> 00:56:47,507
she's hemorrhaging,
and I don't have instruments,

733
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:49,009
and they want to keep her alive.

734
00:56:49,011 --> 00:56:50,976
Hey. Shh...

735
00:56:50,978 --> 00:56:52,679
You're all right. You're all right.

736
00:56:52,681 --> 00:56:53,813
Claire, come here.

737
00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:55,348
Come on.
Put your hand here.

738
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,549
Steady pressure.

739
00:56:56,551 --> 00:56:57,953
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

740
00:56:59,721 --> 00:57:00,953
Watch out.

741
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:02,656
I can't take the bullet out

742
00:57:02,658 --> 00:57:04,357
without a transfusion
from another animal.

743
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:06,759
- Which one of you knows how to find a vein?
- Oh.

744
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:09,029
- I-I did a blood drive for the Red Cross.
- Great.

745
00:57:09,031 --> 00:57:12,699
Okay. Franklin,
take over for Claire.

746
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:13,967
No, no, no, no, no, no...

747
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:16,372
Franklin. Now.

748
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:19,505
Steady pressure.

749
00:57:20,542 --> 00:57:22,775
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

750
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:25,545
- Is it in my mouth? Did it get in my mouth?
- Mm-mm.

751
00:57:25,547 --> 00:57:26,813
- You sure?
- You're good.

752
00:57:26,815 --> 00:57:28,480
All of the animals
should be sedated.

753
00:57:28,482 --> 00:57:29,915
Look for any kind of tetanuran.

754
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:32,319
Their blood type
should be close enough.

755
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:34,654
Look for carnivores
with two or three fingers.

756
00:57:34,656 --> 00:57:36,989
No more than three.

757
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:39,629
I think there's one on board.

758
00:57:53,542 --> 00:57:55,844
You got to be kidding me.

759
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,963
She's tranqued.

760
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:19,966
Okay, okay.

761
00:58:19,968 --> 00:58:21,134
Okay, I got it.

762
00:58:21,136 --> 00:58:22,134
Come on.

763
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:24,673
Okay.

764
00:58:28,877 --> 00:58:31,110
Are you okay?

765
00:58:31,112 --> 00:58:33,513
I'm okay.

766
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:35,417
Come on.

767
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:41,420
You're gonna have to do it.

768
00:58:41,422 --> 00:58:43,623
I can't, I...
the skin is too thick.

769
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:45,625
I have to use both my hands
to put pressure on the vein.

770
00:58:45,627 --> 00:58:46,692
You got to do it.

771
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:48,460
I-I can't. I can't reach.

772
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:50,730
You're gonna have to
climb up there.

773
00:58:50,732 --> 00:58:52,598
Oh, I'm not...

774
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,134
No, no.
I'm not gonna climb up there.

775
00:58:54,136 --> 00:58:55,868
You'll be okay.
It's like riding a bull.

776
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,071
"Riding a bull"?
I didn't grow up in a rodeo

777
00:58:58,073 --> 00:58:59,839
- or wherever you came from.
- She's asleep now.

778
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:02,141
I can't say that she's gonna
be asleep a minute from now,

779
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:03,176
so get up.

780
00:59:03,178 --> 00:59:04,143
Okay, fine.

781
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:05,812
Oh, my God, she stinks.

782
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:06,846
Jesus.

783
00:59:06,848 --> 00:59:07,946
Gently. Gently!

784
00:59:19,594 --> 00:59:21,694
Good job.

785
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:24,130
You're making this look
totally normal.

786
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:28,701
You're gonna have to
jam it in there.

787
00:59:28,703 --> 00:59:29,803
It's really thick skin.

788
00:59:29,805 --> 00:59:31,737
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Ready?

789
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:32,839
- Okay. One...
- One...

790
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:34,040
- Two...
- Two...

791
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:34,908
Stab!

792
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,509
Oh, shoot.

793
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:37,810
- Hey!
- Owen!

794
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:43,016
Oh...

795
00:59:43,018 --> 00:59:44,653
Oh.

796
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:47,487
It's working.

797
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:52,692
The pee is silent.

798
00:59:52,694 --> 00:59:53,859
That door is open.

799
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:55,497
I got it.

800
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:09,712
Shit!

801
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:14,513
The bars!

802
01:00:14,515 --> 01:00:15,882
The bars, Owen. Owen,

803
01:00:15,884 --> 01:00:17,683
I can get through there.
Come on.

804
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:32,935
Jump, Owen!

805
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:40,138
Owen, jump.

806
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,743
Now!

807
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:52,518
Did you see that?

808
01:00:54,256 --> 01:00:56,788
Please tell me
you got the blood.

809
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:21,373
This is Delta.

810
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:22,975
She's one of
the holdover theropods,

811
01:02:22,977 --> 01:02:24,310
one of the survivors
from the second group.

812
01:02:24,312 --> 01:02:26,846
Now, watch this.

813
01:02:26,848 --> 01:02:29,785
I show any sign of weakness
whatsoever...

814
01:02:35,323 --> 01:02:36,989
See that?

815
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:38,790
Day 176.
Blue is showing

816
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:40,826
unprecedented levels
of compliance.

817
01:02:40,828 --> 01:02:43,763
Here I am with Blue.

818
01:02:43,765 --> 01:02:45,964
She's a theropod
from the new group.

819
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:49,735
I show signs of weakness...

820
01:03:02,984 --> 01:03:05,417
Hey.

821
01:03:05,419 --> 01:03:07,819
I'm okay.

822
01:03:07,821 --> 01:03:09,221
She...

823
01:03:09,223 --> 01:03:10,359
she's pretty extraordinary.

824
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:24,404
<i>Blue, displaying levels</i>

825
01:03:24,406 --> 01:03:27,373
<i>of interest, concern,</i>

826
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:31,043
<i>hyper-intelligence, uh,
cognitive bonding.</i>

827
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:33,880
See that?

828
01:03:33,882 --> 01:03:35,013
She's tilting her head.

829
01:03:35,015 --> 01:03:36,248
She's craning forward. Sh...

830
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:39,951
Increased eye movement...
she's curious.

831
01:03:39,953 --> 01:03:42,255
She's showing empathy.

832
01:03:42,257 --> 01:03:44,022
Okay,
I'm gonna make an incision

833
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:46,192
in her leg
to remove the bullet.

834
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:53,167
It's a lot of muscle tissue.

835
01:04:24,966 --> 01:04:26,264
She's gonna be okay.

836
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,139
<i>Blue is the key.</i>

837
01:04:35,477 --> 01:04:36,609
Bless you.

838
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:40,346
You have Blue, you get
these raptors to do anything.

839
01:04:40,348 --> 01:04:42,348
You're sure she'll live?

840
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,482
If it dies,
we have blood samples.

841
01:04:43,484 --> 01:04:45,217
No, no, no.
That's not good enough.

842
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:47,120
The raptor is
a behavioral specimen.

843
01:04:47,122 --> 01:04:48,321
We need her in good health.

844
01:04:48,323 --> 01:04:50,355
I didn't shoot the damn thing.

845
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:52,859
What do you want me to do, huh?

846
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:56,027
You don't have
the faintest comprehension

847
01:04:56,029 --> 01:04:57,797
of what I'm doing here.

848
01:04:57,799 --> 01:04:59,098
Do you understand

849
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,534
the complexity of creating
an entirely new

850
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:03,469
- life-form?
- Uh, no, but I understand

851
01:05:03,471 --> 01:05:05,404
the complexity
of paying for it, okay?!

852
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:07,339
All your money
will have been wasted

853
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:09,241
if I don't get Blue here
in good health.

854
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:12,178
To get the next iteration
under control,

855
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,112
it needs to form
a familial bond

856
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:15,313
with a closely-related
genetic link.

857
01:05:15,315 --> 01:05:18,116
- English, Henry.
- It needs a mother!

858
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:24,056
Blue's DNA will be part of
the next <i>Indoraptor's</i> makeup.

859
01:05:24,058 --> 01:05:25,525
So it will be genetically coded

860
01:05:25,527 --> 01:05:29,495
to recognize her authority
and assume her traits.

861
01:05:29,497 --> 01:05:30,496
Empathy, obedience...

862
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:32,964
everything the prototype
you have now is missing.

863
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:35,000
Okay, so how long
is this gonna take?

864
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:36,268
It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills.

865
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,303
It's a marathon.

866
01:05:37,305 --> 01:05:39,005
A marathon sounds expensive.

867
01:05:39,007 --> 01:05:42,542
Besides, time is running out
and so is my patience, Henry.

868
01:05:42,544 --> 01:05:43,942
You have to understand,

869
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:45,143
this is all
uncharted territory.

870
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:47,212
A wolf, genetically,

871
01:05:47,214 --> 01:05:49,415
is barely distinguishable
from a bulldog,

872
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:53,118
but within that gray area...

873
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,254
is art.

874
01:05:55,256 --> 01:05:57,223
Spare me the poetry, Henry.

875
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:59,257
Can you do it?
Can you do it?

876
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,893
Yes, I can do it.

877
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:03,196
Well, then do it.

878
01:06:03,198 --> 01:06:04,996
Thank you.

879
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:06,801
God, you're a pain in the ass.

880
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:21,047
Hey! Hey!

881
01:06:21,049 --> 01:06:23,583
Maisie!

882
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:26,252
What is that?

883
01:06:26,254 --> 01:06:27,355
What is it?!

884
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:37,630
Keep her in there
and keep the door locked.

885
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:39,197
You want to keep her locked in?

886
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:40,565
That's exactly what I want.

887
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:43,037
Sir Benjamin needs
to see you now.

888
01:06:46,107 --> 01:06:47,576
I believe it's important.

889
01:07:07,594 --> 01:07:10,563
Put it on line!

890
01:07:18,406 --> 01:07:19,605
All crew prepare for docking.

891
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:21,440
Look alive, soldiers!

892
01:07:21,442 --> 01:07:23,375
- All crew prepare for docking.
- Let's go, let's go!

893
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:24,911
Let's move it, boys.

894
01:07:26,915 --> 01:07:28,313
We're here.

895
01:07:28,315 --> 01:07:29,248
Where?

896
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,982
Get in your truck and let's go.

897
01:07:30,984 --> 01:07:33,485
- Move, move.
- Move, move, move.

898
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:35,487
You got a heartbeat?

899
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:36,688
Yeah. Do you?

900
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,357
I need blood samples.

901
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:41,127
I'm not here to help you
reset the food chain, so...

902
01:07:41,129 --> 01:07:42,631
take your own damn samples.

903
01:07:46,234 --> 01:07:48,100
What a nasty woman.

904
01:07:48,102 --> 01:07:50,036
Go, go, now, now. Go.

905
01:07:50,038 --> 01:07:53,105
Attention,
all crew. Attention, all crew.

906
01:07:53,107 --> 01:07:56,542
Drivers, get to your vehicles.

907
01:07:56,544 --> 01:08:00,346
Hey! What the hell's going on?

908
01:08:00,348 --> 01:08:04,116
- I was, um...
- I need an extra pair of hands.

909
01:08:04,118 --> 01:08:05,250
- He volunteered.
- You deck crew?

910
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:06,252
Aye, aye.

911
01:08:06,254 --> 01:08:07,987
We're loading out.
Follow me.

912
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:09,522
Uh, does that mean we're
leaving the ship right now?

913
01:08:09,524 --> 01:08:10,589
That is what
"loading out" means.

914
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:12,091
Now get moving.
Come on, follow me.

915
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:13,960
Come on, kid.

916
01:08:13,962 --> 01:08:15,193
- Shit.
- There's lots to do.

917
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:16,429
- Get a move on, come on.
- Oh, no.

918
01:08:16,431 --> 01:08:17,564
He's not gonna make it.

919
01:08:17,566 --> 01:08:19,631
- Move it! Come on, move!
- We have to help him.

920
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:21,333
Stay here. I'll get him.

921
01:08:21,335 --> 01:08:23,501
There's no time.

922
01:08:23,503 --> 01:08:25,004
Let's go.

923
01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:40,685
Good to go!

924
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:42,755
Roll out.

925
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:44,256
Where are they taking them?

926
01:08:44,258 --> 01:08:46,591
We're about to find out.

927
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,697
Let's go!

928
01:08:58,338 --> 01:08:59,640
Come on, girl.

929
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:04,579
Whoa!

930
01:09:06,646 --> 01:09:08,216
Yes!

931
01:09:15,556 --> 01:09:17,960
This is Lockwood's estate.

932
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:22,297
He must have
one big-ass garage.

933
01:09:35,575 --> 01:09:36,708
Come on!

934
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:38,411
We want this offloaded
in ten mikes.

935
01:09:43,383 --> 01:09:45,252
Hit him!

936
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,741
<i>Did you really think</i>

937
01:10:08,743 --> 01:10:10,512
<i>you could get away with it?</i>

938
01:10:11,779 --> 01:10:13,511
In my own house.

939
01:10:13,513 --> 01:10:17,449
You entrusted me
to guide your fortune

940
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:19,085
into the future.

941
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:20,251
I have done that.

942
01:10:20,253 --> 01:10:22,123
Damn you!

943
01:10:25,192 --> 01:10:26,724
Pick up that phone.

944
01:10:26,726 --> 01:10:30,662
I want you to call the police.

945
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:33,301
It'll be easier if the story
comes from you.

946
01:10:35,436 --> 01:10:37,372
As you say, sir.

947
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:47,379
You know, I've been thinking,
John Hammond was right.

948
01:10:48,249 --> 01:10:53,088
It was an unholy thing
that you did.

949
01:10:56,156 --> 01:10:59,226
I'm not the only
guilty one here, am I, sir?

950
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:19,513
Hey.

951
01:11:20,882 --> 01:11:22,881
We hit that town,
we call the cavalry,

952
01:11:22,883 --> 01:11:24,250
shut this down.

953
01:11:27,821 --> 01:11:30,421
Hello.

954
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:33,425
You should have stayed
on the island.

955
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:34,559
Better odds.

956
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,939
Hi, Claire.

957
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:51,242
I just wanted to come
and apologize.

958
01:11:51,244 --> 01:11:53,511
I didn't want to bring you
into any of this,

959
01:11:53,513 --> 01:11:55,581
but it was the only way that
we could get the raptor.

960
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:58,317
We needed it.

961
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:00,286
Come on.

962
01:12:00,288 --> 01:12:02,220
So, what?

963
01:12:02,222 --> 01:12:03,389
This is it?

964
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:05,323
I mean, you're a smart guy.

965
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:07,358
You could have
started a foundation,

966
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,964
cured cancer,
but instead you... what?

967
01:12:11,966 --> 01:12:13,599
Sell endangered species?

968
01:12:13,601 --> 01:12:14,966
I saved these animals.

969
01:12:14,968 --> 01:12:16,734
You betrayed a dying man
for money.

970
01:12:16,736 --> 01:12:19,205
Claire, I admire your idealism,

971
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:21,207
but we both exploited
these animals.

972
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:23,375
At least I have the integrity
to admit it.

973
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:24,976
I never, ever did anything
remotely illegal.

974
01:12:24,978 --> 01:12:28,447
You authorized the creation
of the <i>Indominus rex.</i>

975
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:32,451
You exploited a living thing
in a cage for money.

976
01:12:32,453 --> 01:12:33,618
How is that different?

977
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,621
Huh? And you.

978
01:12:35,623 --> 01:12:37,555
The man who proved raptors
can follow orders.

979
01:12:37,557 --> 01:12:38,756
You never thought about

980
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,960
the applications
of your research, Owen?

981
01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:43,798
How many millions a trained
predator might be worth?

982
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:50,839
You two, you're the parents
of the new world.

983
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:54,607
Hey!

984
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:56,474
- Let him go.
- Owen.

985
01:12:56,476 --> 01:12:57,842
I think I'll break it.

986
01:12:57,844 --> 01:12:59,411
Let him go.

987
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:05,350
Claire, I just want... aah!

988
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:14,659
Say, how we gonna end this?

989
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:16,961
Well, as far as everybody else
is concerned,

990
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:19,200
they burned up on the island.

991
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:36,748
Buyers on approach.

992
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,483
Looks like a full house.

993
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:40,622
Roger that.

994
01:14:06,579 --> 01:14:07,845
Good evening.

995
01:14:07,847 --> 01:14:09,448
Good evening. Good evening.

996
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:11,386
- Welcome, gentlemen. Welcome.
- Good evening.

997
01:14:13,087 --> 01:14:15,321
Ah, and these guys
are development rep

998
01:14:15,323 --> 01:14:16,889
for Aldaris Pharmaceuticals.

999
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:18,890
- Great.
- And the guy in the beard

1000
01:14:18,892 --> 01:14:20,893
is a proxy for Gregor Adlrich,

1001
01:14:20,895 --> 01:14:22,797
the Slovenian arms dealer.

1002
01:14:24,397 --> 01:14:27,666
Uh, equine buyers
for Rand Magnus,

1003
01:14:27,668 --> 01:14:28,966
an oil magnate from Houston.

1004
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:30,469
Well, what-what's
their interest?

1005
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:32,571
Strictly personal.

1006
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:35,741
His kid wants
a baby triceratops.

1007
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:37,742
Glenn, how's Janet?

1008
01:14:37,744 --> 01:14:39,745
She's doing fine, thanks.

1009
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:41,747
Straight ahead, Glenn.

1010
01:14:57,798 --> 01:15:00,965
Well, he only wants carnivores.
Two of them.

1011
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:03,969
Looks like Lockwood's
gonna have a very good night.

1012
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:05,738
Will he be joining us?

1013
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,939
Um, that's very unlikely.

1014
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:22,524
Grandpa?

1015
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:30,965
Grandpa.

1016
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:33,868
Grandpa, wake up.

1017
01:15:35,535 --> 01:15:37,536
Grandpa?

1018
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:40,542
Grandpa, wake up. Wake up.

1019
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:43,944
Iris!

1020
01:15:56,123 --> 01:15:57,922
Iris!

1021
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,896
It's over.

1022
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:05,967
What a tragedy.

1023
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,738
I suppose now he's gone,

1024
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,840
you'll be looking
for another situation.

1025
01:16:14,842 --> 01:16:16,774
No.

1026
01:16:16,776 --> 01:16:18,712
Maisie needs me.

1027
01:16:20,748 --> 01:16:24,015
I'm her guardian now.

1028
01:16:24,017 --> 01:16:26,585
What she needs is
no longer your concern.

1029
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:29,121
You don't understand her

1030
01:16:29,123 --> 01:16:31,723
the way I do.

1031
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:34,428
I understand her value.

1032
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:37,563
But I raised her.

1033
01:16:37,565 --> 01:16:38,863
I raised...

1034
01:16:38,865 --> 01:16:40,801
both of them.

1035
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:47,072
- Please, Mr. Mills...
- Good-bye, Iris.

1036
01:17:26,045 --> 01:17:28,680
Do you remember the first time

1037
01:17:28,682 --> 01:17:30,952
you saw a dinosaur?

1038
01:17:32,919 --> 01:17:35,554
First time you see them,
it's like...

1039
01:17:35,556 --> 01:17:37,555
a miracle.

1040
01:17:37,557 --> 01:17:40,692
You read about them in books,
you see the bones in museums,

1041
01:17:40,694 --> 01:17:42,728
but you don't
really believe it.

1042
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,499
They're like myths.

1043
01:17:45,932 --> 01:17:47,866
And then you see...

1044
01:17:47,868 --> 01:17:50,301
the first one alive.

1045
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:57,842
This is not your fault.

1046
01:17:57,844 --> 01:17:59,778
But it is.

1047
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,147
No.

1048
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:04,619
This one's on me.

1049
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:08,890
I showed 'em the way.

1050
01:18:10,124 --> 01:18:13,058
Well, listen, you and I

1051
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,725
are gonna have plenty of time

1052
01:18:14,727 --> 01:18:16,862
- to talk about this later.
- If there is a later.

1053
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:18,830
Yes, there is.

1054
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:22,604
I got a cabin to finish.

1055
01:18:30,244 --> 01:18:32,146
What is that?

1056
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:39,617
Well, look who just woke up.

1057
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:42,988
Boo.

1058
01:18:48,795 --> 01:18:51,164
We're getting out of here.

1059
01:18:53,366 --> 01:18:55,067
Welcome...

1060
01:18:55,069 --> 01:18:57,301
ladies, gentlemen,

1061
01:18:57,303 --> 01:19:00,605
to this extraordinary evening.

1062
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:03,241
Let's dive right in

1063
01:19:03,243 --> 01:19:05,143
with lot number one...

1064
01:19:05,145 --> 01:19:07,746
the ankylosaurus.

1065
01:19:10,284 --> 01:19:12,250
She's a herbivorous quadruped,

1066
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:15,053
I'll be damned!
- late Cretaceous.

1067
01:19:15,055 --> 01:19:18,957
This is one of
the largest armored dinosaurs,

1068
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:21,025
known by paleontologists

1069
01:19:21,027 --> 01:19:23,662
as a living tank.

1070
01:19:29,003 --> 01:19:30,935
What are you doing?

1071
01:19:30,937 --> 01:19:32,638
Escaping.

1072
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,340
- You sure about this?
- Nope.

1073
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:39,411
I have $4 million.
Anyone with five?

1074
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:42,113
- $5 million.
- $5 million.

1075
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:43,782
$5 million.
Do I hear six?

1076
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:45,650
- $6 million!
- $6 million. Thank you.

1077
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:46,917
Any increase on six... Seven.

1078
01:19:46,919 --> 01:19:48,220
- $7 million.
- $8 million, now!

1079
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:50,122
$8 million.
$9 million on the phones.

1080
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:52,090
Do I hear $10 million?

1081
01:19:52,092 --> 01:19:53,891
- $10 million? $10 million?
- Ten!

1082
01:19:53,893 --> 01:19:55,862
$10 million!
Once, twice...

1083
01:19:56,963 --> 01:19:58,830
Sold... to the gentleman

1084
01:19:58,832 --> 01:20:00,131
from Indonesia.

1085
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:01,134
Congratulations, sir.

1086
01:20:06,106 --> 01:20:08,172
Lot number two,
ladies and gentlemen.

1087
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:11,242
A juvenile...

1088
01:20:11,244 --> 01:20:13,045
allosaurus.

1089
01:20:13,047 --> 01:20:15,913
A fierce...

1090
01:20:15,915 --> 01:20:18,050
and an aggressive predator.

1091
01:20:22,088 --> 01:20:23,088
Sold!

1092
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:24,891
Sold!

1093
01:20:26,092 --> 01:20:27,227
Sold!

1094
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:31,162
Wonderful.

1095
01:20:31,164 --> 01:20:32,363
Wonderful bidding.

1096
01:20:47,013 --> 01:20:49,948
- You're good. Let's go.
- Move it out.

1097
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,153
- Here we go.
- Bring it on back. Let's go.

1098
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:00,858
Hey. Hey.

1099
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,961
Okay.

1100
01:21:02,963 --> 01:21:04,830
Hey. Hey, you.

1101
01:21:04,832 --> 01:21:07,131
Look at me. Look at me.

1102
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:08,366
Hey!

1103
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:10,335
Come with me. Come with me.

1104
01:21:10,337 --> 01:21:12,774
Okay. There you go.

1105
01:21:30,124 --> 01:21:32,224
You're welcome.

1106
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:41,065
Hey!

1107
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:43,771
Wait! Please! Please wait.

1108
01:21:48,342 --> 01:21:51,076
That's
Lockwood's granddaughter.

1109
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:52,778
Hey.

1110
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,216
Hey, kid. You want
to come down out of there?

1111
01:21:57,351 --> 01:22:00,318
- Uh...
- Uh...

1112
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,854
do you remember me?

1113
01:22:02,856 --> 01:22:04,488
Yeah?

1114
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:08,225
My name is Claire.
What's yours?

1115
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:10,428
Maisie.

1116
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:13,297
- Maisie Lockwood.
- Oh, Maisie.

1117
01:22:13,299 --> 01:22:16,268
Well, this is my friend, Owen.

1118
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,804
I saw you

1119
01:22:18,806 --> 01:22:21,406
with the velociraptors.
Uh, Blue.

1120
01:22:21,408 --> 01:22:24,141
Oh. Oh, yeah?

1121
01:22:24,143 --> 01:22:27,848
Uh... y-you like dinosaurs?

1122
01:22:29,216 --> 01:22:31,248
Hey, so do I.

1123
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:33,150
Tell you what,
you come on down from there,

1124
01:22:33,152 --> 01:22:36,153
I'll tell you everything you
need to know about Blue, huh?

1125
01:22:36,155 --> 01:22:38,223
That sound all right?

1126
01:22:38,225 --> 01:22:39,925
All right, yeah.

1127
01:22:39,927 --> 01:22:41,996
Come on down.

1128
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:52,069
Sweetie...

1129
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:54,171
we need some help
finding your grandfather.

1130
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:55,607
Can you take us to him?

1131
01:22:55,609 --> 01:22:58,242
No.

1132
01:22:58,244 --> 01:23:00,245
You made it down here
all by yourself, huh?

1133
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:03,614
Brave kid. Looks like
you could use a friend.

1134
01:23:03,616 --> 01:23:05,485
He's gone.

1135
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:10,488
Uh...

1136
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,023
so, listen, I'll tell you what,

1137
01:23:12,025 --> 01:23:14,291
we were just about to go
and find our friends

1138
01:23:14,293 --> 01:23:16,161
and then get
the heck out of here.

1139
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:17,397
You want to come with us?

1140
01:23:18,865 --> 01:23:21,265
We could use a friend, too.

1141
01:23:21,267 --> 01:23:23,201
<i>Nineteen-five!</i>

1142
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:24,870
19.5 right here.

1143
01:23:24,872 --> 01:23:26,304
Do I hear 20? Do I hear 20?

1144
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:27,505
20? Thank you.

1145
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:28,640
Thank you. 20.

1146
01:23:28,642 --> 01:23:30,074
- Do I hear...
- 21!

1147
01:23:30,076 --> 01:23:32,309
$21 million!

1148
01:23:32,311 --> 01:23:34,613
$21 million...

1149
01:23:34,615 --> 01:23:36,982
Sold!

1150
01:23:36,984 --> 01:23:38,582
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1151
01:23:38,584 --> 01:23:41,553
that we are halfway
through the evening...

1152
01:23:43,323 --> 01:23:45,924
...we'd like to offer
a special treat

1153
01:23:45,926 --> 01:23:47,925
to our...

1154
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:49,928
discriminating buyers.

1155
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:52,529
This evening we will preview

1156
01:23:52,531 --> 01:23:54,431
a new asset

1157
01:23:54,433 --> 01:23:57,234
that we've been developing.

1158
01:23:57,236 --> 01:23:59,270
A creature of the future

1159
01:23:59,272 --> 01:24:01,973
made from pieces of the past.

1160
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:06,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be warned,

1161
01:24:06,112 --> 01:24:08,246
this is the perfect blend

1162
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:10,381
of the two
most dangerous creatures

1163
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:12,483
that have ever walked
the Earth.

1164
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,353
We call it...

1165
01:24:15,355 --> 01:24:17,656
the <i>Indoraptor.</i>

1166
01:24:40,146 --> 01:24:42,680
The perfect weapon
for the modern age.

1167
01:24:42,682 --> 01:24:47,618
Built for combat, with
tactical responses more acute

1168
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,488
- than any human soldier.
- What is that thing?

1169
01:25:07,207 --> 01:25:09,174
They made it.

1170
01:25:09,176 --> 01:25:12,146
- Mr. Mills and the other man.
- What man?

1171
01:25:13,612 --> 01:25:15,080
Him.

1172
01:25:15,082 --> 01:25:18,148
Designed by Mr. Henry Wu,

1173
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:21,019
with an intelligence quotient
comparable to the velociraptor,

1174
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:23,455
biospecs include
a heightened sense of smell,

1175
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:26,690
and trained to respond
to a pulse-coded

1176
01:25:26,692 --> 01:25:29,226
laser targeting system,

1177
01:25:29,228 --> 01:25:31,629
enabling it
to isolate and track prey

1178
01:25:31,631 --> 01:25:33,497
in complex environments.

1179
01:25:33,499 --> 01:25:34,601
Voilà!

1180
01:25:41,341 --> 01:25:43,608
Now, first the laser sets

1181
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:45,242
the target.

1182
01:25:47,114 --> 01:25:49,581
And then once locked on,

1183
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:52,149
the acoustic signal
triggers the attack.

1184
01:25:59,025 --> 01:26:02,092
This animal is relentless.

1185
01:26:02,094 --> 01:26:05,563
Now, modifications
are still being made...

1186
01:26:05,565 --> 01:26:06,765
$20 millions!

1187
01:26:10,404 --> 01:26:12,537
No, th-this is a-a prototype.

1188
01:26:12,539 --> 01:26:13,805
Uh, not for sale.

1189
01:26:13,807 --> 01:26:15,707
- 21!
- Well...

1190
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:17,641
it is still a...

1191
01:26:17,643 --> 01:26:20,045
- a prototype, but...
- 22!

1192
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:22,516
23!

1193
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:25,052
24!

1194
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,586
$24 million.

1195
01:26:29,588 --> 01:26:31,555
$25 millions!

1196
01:26:31,557 --> 01:26:33,524
Do I hear 26?

1197
01:26:33,526 --> 01:26:35,659
That thing
can't leave this building.

1198
01:26:35,661 --> 01:26:38,363
- 26!
- Any advance on 26?

1199
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:40,497
- 27. - $27 million dollars.
- What are you doing?

1200
01:26:40,499 --> 01:26:41,698
This animal is not for sale.

1201
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,201
If you want
to create an addict,

1202
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:44,501
you have to give them a taste.

1203
01:26:44,503 --> 01:26:45,636
He's a prototype.

1204
01:26:45,638 --> 01:26:46,738
Look, this prototype

1205
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:51,108
is worth $28 million right now.

1206
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:53,510
Relax. We'll make some more.

1207
01:26:53,512 --> 01:26:55,348
So will they.

1208
01:27:17,204 --> 01:27:18,603
Hey, buddy.

1209
01:27:18,605 --> 01:27:20,638
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1210
01:27:22,842 --> 01:27:24,708
<i>Once, twice...</i>

1211
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:27,745
Sold to the Russian friend.

1212
01:27:29,316 --> 01:27:31,748
A congratulations

1213
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,617
for this magnificent animal.

1214
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:32,577
Get out of the way!

1215
01:28:42,222 --> 01:28:44,391
- Go, go!
- Get this thing out of here!

1216
01:29:36,243 --> 01:29:38,775
Mills!

1217
01:29:38,777 --> 01:29:41,511
Mills, where are you?!

1218
01:29:41,513 --> 01:29:43,583
I want my bonus!

1219
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:51,889
Holy cow.

1220
01:29:51,891 --> 01:29:53,690
What are you?

1221
01:29:53,692 --> 01:29:55,993
I didn't see you on the island.

1222
01:30:14,347 --> 01:30:16,750
Oh, you're a tough guy.

1223
01:30:49,481 --> 01:30:52,050
Look at you.

1224
01:30:52,052 --> 01:30:54,719
You're some kind of hot rod

1225
01:30:54,721 --> 01:30:57,822
with really pretty teeth.

1226
01:30:57,824 --> 01:31:01,428
This will make a perfect
centerpiece for my necklace.

1227
01:31:20,413 --> 01:31:22,149
Oh, boy.

1228
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:37,627
Aah!

1229
01:31:48,007 --> 01:31:49,476
Oh...

1230
01:31:58,517 --> 01:32:00,050
No!

1231
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,701
Shh.

1232
01:32:16,703 --> 01:32:18,769
Move! Move! Out of the way!

1233
01:33:03,048 --> 01:33:04,685
Don't!

1234
01:33:08,687 --> 01:33:10,720
You two,
you... deserve each other.

1235
01:33:10,722 --> 01:33:12,556
Maisie, come with me.

1236
01:33:12,558 --> 01:33:14,090
You got your money.

1237
01:33:14,092 --> 01:33:15,559
Now, walk away.

1238
01:33:15,561 --> 01:33:17,662
Oh, what are you gonna do, huh?

1239
01:33:17,664 --> 01:33:19,663
We're gonna stop this.
All of it.

1240
01:33:19,665 --> 01:33:21,698
How?! What, are you
gonna go back in time

1241
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,667
before Hammond decided
to play God?

1242
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:24,868
You can't put it
back in the box!

1243
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:26,671
- We have to try.
- It's too late.

1244
01:33:26,673 --> 01:33:28,442
Maisie, come.

1245
01:33:30,509 --> 01:33:32,943
Oh...

1246
01:33:32,945 --> 01:33:35,813
so you're gonna take care
of her now, huh?

1247
01:33:35,815 --> 01:33:38,715
You have no idea what she is.

1248
01:33:38,717 --> 01:33:42,653
What do you think drove Hammond
and Lockwood apart? Huh?

1249
01:33:42,655 --> 01:33:46,724
Lockwood never had
a grandchild.

1250
01:33:46,726 --> 01:33:49,196
He just wanted
his daughter back.

1251
01:33:51,631 --> 01:33:55,500
And he had the technology.

1252
01:33:55,502 --> 01:33:58,202
He created another.

1253
01:33:58,204 --> 01:34:00,705
He made her again.

1254
01:34:03,676 --> 01:34:05,510
- Go.
- Go, go, go.

1255
01:34:10,216 --> 01:34:11,983
Come on!

1256
01:34:11,985 --> 01:34:14,952
Come on.

1257
01:34:26,932 --> 01:34:28,733
Get this to Mills.

1258
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:30,734
Be very careful...
it's extremely valuable.

1259
01:34:30,736 --> 01:34:33,037
You... I need blood samples
from the raptor.

1260
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:35,238
Don't just stand there
like an idiot!

1261
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,974
Get me 50cc's carfentanil
and a phlebotomy kit!

1262
01:34:37,976 --> 01:34:40,545
It's right there! Now!

1263
01:34:40,547 --> 01:34:42,979
Come on, come on.

1264
01:34:42,981 --> 01:34:44,849
I need this raptor's blood.

1265
01:34:44,851 --> 01:34:46,583
Oh! For God...

1266
01:34:46,585 --> 01:34:48,719
Sure, go ahead.

1267
01:34:48,721 --> 01:34:50,787
Where is that kit?!

1268
01:34:50,789 --> 01:34:52,156
Okay, now, listen to me.

1269
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:53,991
It is better for you
to cooperate.

1270
01:34:53,993 --> 01:34:57,260
I'm gonna get this blood,
with or without your help.

1271
01:34:57,262 --> 01:34:58,763
This blood's contaminated.

1272
01:34:58,765 --> 01:35:00,931
I designed this animal myself.

1273
01:35:00,933 --> 01:35:02,699
It's pure.

1274
01:35:02,701 --> 01:35:04,034
Every cell of her body

1275
01:35:04,036 --> 01:35:05,836
was created in the most
controlled environment,

1276
01:35:05,838 --> 01:35:09,073
under the most demanding of conditions.

1277
01:35:09,075 --> 01:35:11,074
Yeah, but I did an intravenous
blood transfusion

1278
01:35:11,076 --> 01:35:13,978
with a T. rex, so...
it's a sock drawer in there.

1279
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:16,212
You what?

1280
01:35:16,214 --> 01:35:18,148
Whoa! Frank! What are you doing?!

1281
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:20,520
Saving your life.

1282
01:35:25,057 --> 01:35:27,123
Yes...!

1283
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:28,529
Stop!

1284
01:35:29,928 --> 01:35:32,263
Don't move.

1285
01:35:36,168 --> 01:35:38,735
Now, step away from that cage.

1286
01:35:38,737 --> 01:35:39,906
Now.

1287
01:35:48,247 --> 01:35:50,180
Easy, now.

1288
01:35:53,953 --> 01:35:56,690
Oh!

1289
01:36:16,174 --> 01:36:17,878
Run. Run!

1290
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:20,064
Dave, you copy?

1291
01:38:20,066 --> 01:38:22,032
Dave, you there?

1292
01:38:22,034 --> 01:38:23,199
Run!

1293
01:39:47,419 --> 01:39:49,153
You see that?

1294
01:39:49,155 --> 01:39:50,921
That's hydrogen cyanide.

1295
01:39:50,923 --> 01:39:52,622
If it reaches
the containment level,

1296
01:39:52,624 --> 01:39:55,492
it'll kill them all.

1297
01:39:55,494 --> 01:39:57,193
The ventilation system is down.

1298
01:39:57,195 --> 01:39:58,962
Can you bring it back up?

1299
01:40:30,896 --> 01:40:32,962
The server's unresponsive.

1300
01:40:32,964 --> 01:40:35,064
I have to reboot
the whole system.

1301
01:40:35,066 --> 01:40:36,302
- So reboot it.
- I'm trying.

1302
01:40:54,219 --> 01:40:55,321
What?

1303
01:40:56,923 --> 01:40:58,354
Franklin, we don't have time.

1304
01:40:58,356 --> 01:40:59,390
I know, I know, I know.

1305
01:40:59,392 --> 01:41:01,361
Okay.

1306
01:41:41,167 --> 01:41:44,167
Come on. Go! Go, run, run!

1307
01:42:37,722 --> 01:42:39,723
Hey.

1308
01:42:39,725 --> 01:42:41,457
You're okay.

1309
01:42:41,459 --> 01:42:43,327
Put pressure on it.
Don't look at it.

1310
01:42:43,329 --> 01:42:44,627
Look at me. Look at me.

1311
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:46,063
You have to go find her.

1312
01:42:46,065 --> 01:42:47,133
I can't leave you here.

1313
01:42:51,637 --> 01:42:53,504
Go. I'll be fine.

1314
01:42:53,506 --> 01:42:54,673
Run!

1315
01:45:23,222 --> 01:45:25,622
Maisie! Stay down!

1316
01:46:10,369 --> 01:46:11,571
Shh.

1317
01:46:29,821 --> 01:46:31,321
Follow me.

1318
01:46:31,323 --> 01:46:33,459
I know a way on the other side.

1319
01:46:34,726 --> 01:46:37,362
Come on.

1320
01:46:40,332 --> 01:46:41,767
Come on!

1321
01:46:58,484 --> 01:46:59,983
This way!

1322
01:47:31,984 --> 01:47:33,884
I got ya!

1323
01:47:46,798 --> 01:47:48,301
Hey!

1324
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,948
What the hell?

1325
01:49:47,585 --> 01:49:49,019
Hey!

1326
01:49:49,021 --> 01:49:52,456
Hey!

1327
01:49:52,458 --> 01:49:53,458
You good?

1328
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:57,159
Yeah. You?

1329
01:49:57,161 --> 01:49:59,696
- Nope.
- Hey, we got a problem downstairs.

1330
01:49:59,698 --> 01:50:01,700
I need you to come see this.

1331
01:50:31,997 --> 01:50:33,529
They're all dying.

1332
01:50:33,531 --> 01:50:35,965
The blast damaged
the ventilation system.

1333
01:50:35,967 --> 01:50:38,603
We did everything we could.

1334
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:43,172
I can open the gates from here.

1335
01:50:43,174 --> 01:50:44,875
Claire.

1336
01:50:44,877 --> 01:50:46,809
Be careful.

1337
01:50:46,811 --> 01:50:49,582
We're not on an island anymore.

1338
01:51:44,302 --> 01:51:45,902
Claire.

1339
01:51:45,904 --> 01:51:49,839
You press that button,
there is no going back.

1340
01:51:53,911 --> 01:51:56,779
We can't let them die.

1341
01:52:46,397 --> 01:52:48,931
I had to.

1342
01:52:48,933 --> 01:52:52,904
They're alive, like me.

1343
01:53:24,402 --> 01:53:27,373
No! No!

1344
01:54:01,306 --> 01:54:03,308
Aah!

1345
01:55:05,203 --> 01:55:07,504
Hey, girl.

1346
01:55:07,506 --> 01:55:09,305
Owen.

1347
01:55:10,842 --> 01:55:12,945
It's okay.
She won't hurt us.

1348
01:55:35,167 --> 01:55:36,866
Hey.

1349
01:55:44,042 --> 01:55:46,145
Blue, come with me.

1350
01:55:51,149 --> 01:55:54,152
We'll take you
to a safe place, okay?

1351
01:56:34,525 --> 01:56:36,225
<i>How many times</i>

1352
01:56:36,227 --> 01:56:38,260
<i>do you have to
see the evidence?</i>

1353
01:56:38,262 --> 01:56:41,096
<i>How many times
must the point be made?</i>

1354
01:56:42,467 --> 01:56:44,567
<i>We're causing
our own extinction.</i>

1355
01:56:44,569 --> 01:56:48,971
<i>Too many red lines
have been crossed.</i>

1356
01:56:48,973 --> 01:56:50,473
<i>And our home has,</i>

1357
01:56:50,475 --> 01:56:53,076
<i>in fundamental ways,
been polluted by</i>

1358
01:56:53,078 --> 01:56:57,546
avarice and political
megalomania.

1359
01:56:57,548 --> 01:57:01,149
<i>Genetic power has now
been unleashed,</i>

1360
01:57:01,151 --> 01:57:03,620
<i>and of course,
that's gonna be catastrophic.</i>

1361
01:57:03,622 --> 01:57:04,821
<i>This change was inevitable</i>

1362
01:57:04,823 --> 01:57:07,223
<i>from the moment we brought
the first dinosaur</i>

1363
01:57:07,225 --> 01:57:08,558
<i>back from extinction.</i>

1364
01:57:10,227 --> 01:57:11,627
We convince ourselves
that sudden change

1365
01:57:11,629 --> 01:57:13,062
is something that happens

1366
01:57:13,064 --> 01:57:14,330
outside the normal order
of things,

1367
01:57:14,332 --> 01:57:16,165
like a... car crash,

1368
01:57:16,167 --> 01:57:18,300
or that it's beyond
our control,

1369
01:57:18,302 --> 01:57:19,534
like a fatal illness.

1370
01:57:19,536 --> 01:57:20,636
We don't conceive of sudden,

1371
01:57:20,638 --> 01:57:23,439
<i>radical, irrational change</i>

1372
01:57:23,441 --> 01:57:25,942
<i>as woven into the very fabric
of existence.</i>

1373
01:57:25,944 --> 01:57:30,446
<i>Yet, I can assure you,
it most assuredly is.</i>

1374
01:57:30,448 --> 01:57:32,852
<i>And it's happening now.</i>

1375
01:57:35,286 --> 01:57:40,122
<i>Humans and dinosaurs are now
gonna be forced to coexist.</i>

1376
01:57:43,227 --> 01:57:46,261
<i>These creatures were here
before us.</i>

1377
01:57:46,263 --> 01:57:49,332
<i>And if we're not careful,
they're gonna be here after.</i>

1378
01:57:54,705 --> 01:57:56,372
<i>We're gonna have to adjust</i>

1379
01:57:56,374 --> 01:57:58,878
<i>to new threats
that we can't imagine.</i>

1380
01:58:05,182 --> 01:58:08,518
We've entered a new era.

1381
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,653
Welcome to Jurassic World.
