That is what senor Douglas
told me.

the Baja race too...

Doesn't have his hand out.

He doesn't have his hand out
because it's in your pocket.

00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,640
- spread-eagled on the rigging.
- My dear Captain Blythe.

153
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,200
[Hisses]

154
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,339
They didn't last long
in those latitudes, I can tell you.

155
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:00,819
In no time at all, they were bloated
carrion for the birds of prey.

156
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,050
Yah!

157
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:07,287
Oh, do have some
of the green turtle soup, Mrs. Purkiss.

158
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,760
It's the chef's specialty.

159
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,764
- [Pop]
- [Gasps]

160
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:18,663
Well, they'd no sooner
broken out the grog...

161
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:22,003
- then the entire Spanish armada
was closing on them.
- Everything looks so tempting.

162
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,509
Yes. [Sighs]
Doesn't it?

163
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:28,775
They were met with stiff resistance
as they clambered aboard.

164
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:32,682
- It was parry and thrust,
thrust and parry.
- [Screams]

165
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,723
- Uh, permit me.
- Thank you.

166
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,897
- Anyone else?
- Oh. No, thanks.

167
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:53,098
Where was I?
Well, the deck was awash with blood!

168
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,801
What are you gonna have?

169
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,311
I think I'll have
that captain...

170
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,939
on a bed of roses.

171
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,348
Blast of grape
might sweep the deck clean.

172
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:09,878
- Aunt Louise, you're incorrigible.
- I know! [Giggling]

173
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:14,916
I've never regretted
a moment of it.

174
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,797
Right this way,
gentlemen.

175
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,739
My goodness,
what a pleasant surprise.

176
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:31,800
Two handsome young gentlemen as our
dining companions. I'm Louise Trends.

177
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,312
- DavyJohns.
- Pete Staniczek.

178
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,247
Pete, this is
my niece Melissa.

179
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,218
Well, sit down,
sit down.

180
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,585
Oh, just lucky,
I guess.

181
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,489
- You gentlemen going to Rio?
- Not exactly, ma'am.

182
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,084
Oh, I was telling Melissa...

183
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,494
Rio is a city
of romance.

184
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:56,797
You really, to get the most out of it,
have to share it with someone.

185
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,931
- Wasn't I, Melissa?
- Aunt Louise.

186
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:04,443
Well, personally, I won't have much time
for that sort of thing.

187
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:09,175
I'll be utilizing every moment
I have copying down material
for my doctorate.

188
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,240
You're gonna be a doctor?

189
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:15,481
Yes, of Latin American
cultures.

190
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,490
Celery? [Giggles]
Cool it with the doctor bit.

191
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,488
Well, so what does take
you gentlemen to Rio?

192
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:27,363
Actually, we're headed further
south. We're entering a car
in the Brazil Grand Primeo.

193
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:31,233
Pete here handles the wheel.
The rest is my lookout.

194
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,501
- You're a race driver.
- Yeah.

195
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,372
Oh, isn't that fascinating!

196
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:41,709
- Oh, I love race cars,
don't you, Melissa?
- Not really.

197
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,712
Well... hungry?

198
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,827
(music) [Humming]

199
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,827
Ah! [Muttering]
Ahh.

200
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,199
[Muttering In Italian]
Ah! Here we go.

201
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,330
[Singing In Italian]

202
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:18,577
[Speaking Italian]

203
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,318
Buon appetito, eh?
[Chuckling]

204
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:30,023
- Ah! [Speaking Italian]
- [Phone Ringing]

205
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,557
[Continues Speaking Italian]

206
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:39,198
[Sighs]

207
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:45,006
[Phone Ringing Continues]

208
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:49,105
But I checked the pressure
five minutes ago. Everything is fine.!

209
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:54,347
Number one, okay.!
Yes, I know how Capt. Blythe is...

210
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,187
but I tell you, the dial is right
on the nose. I see it for myself.

211
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,218
[Muttering In Italian]

212
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:06,356
[Muttering Continues]

213
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,606
[Muttering Continues]

214
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:29,310
Who take-a my chicken?

215
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,492
[Faint Chewing Sounds]

216
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:51,106
Aha! So you think you can steal
Armando's dinner and get away with it?

217
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,407
We're gonna see about that.
Oh, yes.

218
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,438
Okay. Open up.
Open up, little car.

219
00:21:57,517 --> 00:22:00,509
No car's gonna eat my dinner.
Open up. I tell you!

220
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:04,283
Open up!
[Yelling, Muttering]

221
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,658
[Muttering In Italian]

222
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,596
Aha! Heh-heh-heh!
Open up.

223
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,606
Open up.
[Grunting]

224
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,441
[Man] You can't drive
that car down here.

225
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:42,351
This is the number one hold.
Some of your cargo, it's-a broke loose!

226
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:47,661
Send your officer watch down here fast,
no, but I mean real fast! Si.

227
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:58,010
- Hey, what's going on?
- That car has no driver!

228
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:01,137
Better notify
Captain Blythe!

229
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:16,155
[Officer Whispering]
Shh.! All right, men.
Spread out and be careful.

230
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,935
Psst!

231
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,507
[Whistling Quietly]

232
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,617
Now.!

233
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,281
[Grunting]

234
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:49,226
And I am to believe
that this... car...

235
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,458
ate your chicken dinner?

236
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:56,593
Eh, and then he spit out the bones!
[Spitting]

237
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:01,697
- Who is this?
- Wiper, third class,
Armando Moccia, sir.

238
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,574
Do you know the penalty
for drinking on duty...

239
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,670
wiper, third class?

240
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:11,239
[Muttering In Italian]
Armando not touch one drop. No, please!

241
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,753
The car ate my apple.
I know because I hear with my own ears!

242
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:17,312
Eh! Muncha-muncha-munch!

243
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,188
Muncha-muncha-munch, eh?

244
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:25,196
- Do you know what I'm going
to do with your ears?
- [Chuckles Nervously]

245
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:31,663
- Uh, where is the car now?
- Went for a drive after dinner.

246
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:36,538
Oh. And was it smoking a cigar
and drinking a brandy?

247
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:42,313
The perpetrator of this little jest
will receive 50 lashes...

248
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,976
- before ship's company
and set adrift in a...
- [Gasps]

249
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:56,284
Perhaps you'll be good enough
to tell me about your grandson
Snooky another time.

250
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,904
- [Gasps]
- Wiper, third class, Armando Moccia?

251
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,535
- Aye-aye, sir.
- [Crashing]

252
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:15,570
[Men Yelling]

253
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,847
[Car Accelerating]

254
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,914
[Car Braking]

255
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:32,059
Ah!
[Grunting]

256
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,901
Okay, men, secure it.
Get the blocks and make it good.

257
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:42,202
Capitane.
Muncha-muncha-muncha! Si.!

258
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,433
See? Hah!

259
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,115
[Grunts, Snorts]

260
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,454
Now.

261
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:10,127
- How did you want to handle that?
- You mean pay for it?

262
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:15,799
Or did you plan to, uh,
reassemble the stemware yourself?

263
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,311
- It's not our responsibility.
- [Whip Cracks]

264
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:23,815
I'm your captain, judge and jury.
I'll decide what's your responsibility!

265
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:26,443
Captain!

266
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:35,552
The, uh, the cargo manifest
states unequivocally...

267
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:39,928
that you, Peter Staniczek,
are the sole owner of the car.

268
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:44,299
You are the consignor
and the consignee.

269
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,770
Your car did damage, ergo...

270
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,433
- Yeah, but Pete wasn't driving...
- Stow it!

271
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:55,807
I, uh, I have been advised
by our public relations department...

272
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:59,681
to waive all charges
of kidnapping...

273
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:03,586
and smuggling illegal aliens
into a foreign country.

274
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:06,250
- Where is that kid, anyway?
- In the storeroom...

275
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,953
where he'll remain until
the ship reaches Panama...

276
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,588
at which time he will be turned
over to the port authorities...

277
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,963
and returned
to his native country.

278
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:18,367
In the meantime,
your automobile will be impounded...

279
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:21,429
until your obligations
are met.

280
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,438
Captain.

281
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,315
Uh, gentlemen...

282
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:34,512
I do hope you've been
enjoying the cruise so far.

283
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:38,216
Remember, we have
a shuffleboard tournament
on main deck at four bells...

284
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,726
and, uh, disco lessons
in the lounge at six bells.

285
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,865
Thanks, anyway.

286
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:55,631
We can write the captain an
I.O.U. And pay him out of our
winning at the Grand Primeo.

287
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,142
There's no way we can raise
that kind of money.

288
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,236
Maybe we should chalk it up
to experience and work our way home.

289
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:05,215
- Maybe Aunt Louise will bail us.
- You are a dreamer, D.J.

290
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:10,881
Wait a minute.
She likes cars and she's trying
to get her niece hooked up.

291
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:14,756
Yeah?

292
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,421
- No!
- Wait a minute.

293
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:21,398
All you gotta do is keep the doc
enthralled with tales of derring-do...

294
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:25,198
while I initiate Aunt Louise
into the delights of Formula One racing.

295
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:30,106
- I don't like it.
- Come on, man! Nothing good comes easy.

296
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,942
Lots of charm,
lots of charm.

297
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:48,426
You may not believe this,
this is an exact replica,
down to the last button...

298
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:52,726
of the uniform worn by Lord Nelson
when he defeated the Spanish armada.

299
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,165
- Seems like it belongs
on me, doesn't it?
- I love a uniform.

300
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:00,535
It gives a man a certain...
[Blows]

301
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:04,133
- At ease, madam!
- Captain!

302
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,078
Excuse me, I must circulate
among the cargo... uh, passengers.

303
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:14,146
Anyway, like I was saying,
it's the thrill of a lifetime...

304
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,953
when you see that car that
belongs to you streak across
that finish line a winner.

305
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:24,826
Not only that, you're part
of the technological advancement
of the automotive world.

306
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,627
- Oh, really.
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,931
I wonder...
where the kids are.

308
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,267
Now isn't that...

309
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:37,002
(music)In my heart and my hand

310
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,840
(music)I've never seen

311
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:45,043
- They seem to be enjoying themselves.
- Yeah, they're hitting it off.

312
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:49,986
Pete's a great guy.
He's what I call a beautiful person.

313
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:53,718
(music) With your head up in a cloud

314
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,091
(music) Where you belong

315
00:29:56,162 --> 00:30:01,532
(music)Please look at me

316
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:06,526
(music)lf I stay around

317
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:10,769
(music)Maybe something good
will happen

318
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:14,244
(music)Like you'll
look into my eyes

319
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,679
(music)And realize

320
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:19,513
- My kind of racin'.
- [Chuckling]

321
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,554
Oh, pardon me.
That's the third time I've done that.

322
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,818
Who's counting?
I'm having a great time.

323
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:30,555
- Are you really?
- Yeah.

324
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,255
(music)And so

325
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,895
Usually when we race,
a good time means towing
the crew across Texas...

326
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:42,566
in the middle of August,
looking for a Denny's...

327
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:46,236
then bedding down
in some fleabag motel.

328
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,873
Now here I am...

329
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:54,215
soft lights, sweet music...

330
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,345
pretty girl.

331
00:30:56,422 --> 00:31:00,188
Uh, Mr. Staniczek, you don't
really have to say those things.

332
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:04,491
Oh, I know that. It's just that you're
different than other girls I've known.

333
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:11,068
- I can well imagine.
- No, no, it's a compliment.

334
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:15,232
For one thing, you don't giggle
when there's nothing funny.

335
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:19,403
And you listen when I talk.
A man looks a long way
for a girl like that.

336
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,379
And, uh...

337
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:32,087
(music)And maybe then

338
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,593
- Our fingers touch
- You are pretty, Melissa.

339
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:40,155
(music)And you'll thrill me
oh, so much

340
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,724
(music)A lovely dream

341
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:47,670
(music) That's meant to be

342
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:53,144
(music)lf you would give

343
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,578
(music) One look

344
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:00,381
(music)At me

345
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,788
Ah, this is it.

346
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,354
I just want to thank you
for this evening.

347
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,994
- L-I really enjoyed myself.
- Me too.

348
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,974
Well, good night.

349
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,477
Melissa?

350
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:53,396
- This is the pits.
- Did something go wrong?

351
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,963
We went wrong
when we got into this.

352
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,033
I don't like playing games
with people.

353
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:02,046
Come on, just a couple more days.
I already got the money.

354
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:05,379
Aunt Louise gave me a check.
We got the car out of hock.

355
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,545
And get this, kiddo.
She's gonna sponsor us all the way.

356
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,489
We name it, she buys it.!
All you gotta do is keep making
like Burt Reynolds.

357
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,086
- So, that's the deal.
- Well, I sorta read it
between the lines.

358
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,620
Anyway, the important thing
is we're back in the running.

359
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:25,068
Ahh! Nothing's gonna
stop us now.

- [Weak Honking]
- Hi!

362
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:13,608
- That captain sure was mad, wasn't he?
- Honk!

363
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,381
- What is he gonna do with you?
- Honk-honk-honk.

364
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:22,018
They will send me back where I live...
with the orphans.

365
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:26,793
But it's okay.
They put me back, I run away again.

366
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,459
- Can we be friends?
- Honk.

00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,799
- What's your name?
- Honk-honk.

368

- Que?
- [Slower] Honk-honk.

- I just call you "Ocho," okay?
- Honk-honk.

Atta boy, Ocho!

372
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:47,145
Thanks, Ocho.
I'll pay you back.

373
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:51,148
But you better go back where you were,
so you won't get in trouble.

Don't let it get out of this hold, men!

[Running Footsteps]

379
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:50,701
In those days,
a captain was a captain.

380
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:55,975
And a ship was a ship,
not a floating carnival.

381
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,882
And the only women aboard
were dragged there by
the scruff of their neck!

382
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,978
Whoo, gives me goose bumps
just thinking about it.

383
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:06,047
The captain is having
a little jest with you ladies.

384
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:09,389
I'm only telling it
like it was.

385
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,895
[Quietly]
Or should be.

386
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:15,229
Yes, when you talked about
liberation in those days...

387
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,734
you were talking
about battles...

388
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:21,364
nations, empires.

[Louise] Oh, Captain.
Oh, my word.!

392
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:36,213
Sorry!

[Groans, Spits]

394
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:47,490
But, Captain, how can a car
release a boy with a key? Explain that!

395
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:51,195
I can't explain that
any more than I can explain
the Bermuda Triangle, madam.

396
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,967
- Nor do I intend to try.
- Captain, I am the sponsor
of that little car.

397
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,237
It's going to win
the Brazil Grand Primeo.

398
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,871
If you can bring that off,
I will not only part the Red Sea...

399
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,006
I will tint it magenta.

400
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:08,041
Oh, oh, Captain.
I appeal to you as a woman...

401
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,850
a desperate, helpless...

00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:14,153
single woman.

403
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:19,892
- Spare that car.
- Lorelei and her sirens could
not make me veer one degree!

404
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:24,425
- My course is set!
- Oh!

Stand to to witness punishment!

Sir, the passengers
might not understand.

407
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:39,573
I am simply abiding
by the traditions of the sea...

Chief Steward.

409
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:47,555
By the powers vested in me
as the captain of this ship...

410
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:50,356
I hereby deem this vehicle
a menace...

411
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:54,889
to life and limb and the very
safety of the vessel itself.

412
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:58,129
I herewith commit it
to the sea...

413
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:01,070
a fate well-deserved.

- Oh, bag and baggage.

419
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:27,922
Anyone remotely associated with
that little car is being put ashore.

420
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,723
If it hadn't been for that steward,
we'd have been keelhauled.

- If I decided to get out
of needlepoint...

and into racing,
it was my choice.

to it than that.

You mean you knew that?

Well, I was hoping that...

00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,567
something might happen
between you and Melissa.

431

She's really
a wonderful girl.

432
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:19,938
- She's terrific but...
- A little klutzy for someone
like yourself.

433
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,673
Not everybody's
made for each other.

434
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,944
I really like her and I
don't want her to get hurt.

435
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,282
I plan to tell her but maybe
you can smooth things over.

- Thank you.

Why are you all
staring at me?

767
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,428
It's a conspiracy!
What?

768
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,862
Si, sesenta centavos.

769
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,230
Siesta centavos.

770
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,565
Don't go away.
I'll get it for you.

771
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,697
- Siesta centavos.
- Sesenta centavos, senor.

772
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:40,640
- Three minutes more
cost you more money.!
- Siesta centavos.

773

Oh, here.

774
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,880
Yes, we're getting it for you.
I beg you, don't hang up.

775
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,940
Yes, I'll be
right with you.

776
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,385
I love your country.
It's very colorful.

777
01:09:52,455 --> 01:09:55,891
Your children have
such expressive faces.

778
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,256
Look alive with
that change, woman!

779
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,091
Please don't go away.
I'll get it for you.

780
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,960
Are you still there?
Hello?

781
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,504
Hello?

782
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,597
Hello!

783
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:15,936
She's gone.

784
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,446
It took me two hours
just to get the operator...

785
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,914
and she's gone,
just like that.

786
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:24,146
- Oh.
- Hello?

787

Oh, yes, de nada.

788
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,987
How will I explain this
to the company?

789
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,527
You just tell Aunt Louise
all about it.

790
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,257
- They'll take away my command.
- Yes, oh.

791
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:39,131
- They'll take away my sheep.
- Oh, your sheep.

792
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:49,305
[Paco] I think we lost 'em,
but one thing I still can't figure out

793
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:53,371
Why would those men want
a picture like this, Ocho?

794
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:58,985
It's kinda lonely
around here, huh, Ocho?

795
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:01,046
Honk-honk.

796
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:03,455
When we're safe
from those men...

797
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:08,293
- we'll go back where there's
lots of people, huh, Ocho?
- Honk!

798
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,559
[Quinn]
We've got him.!

799
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,863
Why don't we
force him off the road?

800
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,802
Because we just might
come off second best.

801
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,533
Well, what's a bug
and a kid gonna do?

802
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:22,065
Something quite unexpected,
I assure you.

803
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,305
We'll wait 'til it stops.

Chiclayo?

Not a prayer.

808
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,917
- How long do you give it?
- About a minute.

809
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:44,262
We should alert the captain.
He'd want to know about this.

810
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:48,531
[Pete] He'll be alerted,
any second now.

- It's every man for himself!

Have you put out
distress signals?

814
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,560
Oh, we will.
Five of them.

815
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:25,802
Maybe we can go to Santiago
and work there, Ocho.

816

Those men'll
never find us there.

Don't worry, Ocho.
I'll take care of ya.

Oye, nino. El senor

- Andale, pronto. Apurate.
- Si.!

Wake up, Ocho!
A man in the cantina needs a taxi.

821

We can siesta later.

I'm telling them not to hold
the ship at Port au Spain...

01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:31,161
but go directly to Tobago,
where I'll join them there.

I hate to think of what's happened
to that ship in my absence.

837
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:38,500
Get this off immediately.
It goes to the Communication
Center of the Sun Princess.

838
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:41,202
Are you certain that
the pigeon understands that?

Si, senor capitan.

He certainly knows
his pigeons.

There's an airport in Chiclayo,
about 12 miles further on.
