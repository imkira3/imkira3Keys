36
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,712
<i>Get your fluffy on
But watch yourself.</i>

37
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,797
<i>Get your ﬂuffy on.</i>

00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,503
<i>Make my body sing.</i>

<i>Do your thing.</i>

52
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,716
Come on, Erik, give it a shot.

53
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,222
<i>Do your thing</i>

54
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,306
Hey.

55
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,016
Aw, my little munkin.

56
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,646
I'll go talk to him.

57
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,557
Oh, let me try.

58
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,732
Hey, little guy.

59
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,689
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

60
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,825
- You're not joining the party?
- Mm-mm.

61
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,200
Can you say why?

62
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,281
Why?

63
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,287
No. What I mean is,
why are you...?

64
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,039
Uncle Mumble.

65
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,745
I think he's asking,
"Why dance?“."

66
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,411
Like, he needs a solid reason.
Don't you, Erik?

67
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,624
Yeah.

68
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,292
Plenty of reasons to dance.

69
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,124
What's mine, Pa?

70
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,962
Well, the only way to
find out is to try it.

71
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,129
Come on, son.

72
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,342
It's just one big old
foot after the other.

73
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,179
No one'll laugh at
you, I promise.

74
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,225
Come on. On my feet.

75
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,536
<i>I don't care what
the people say.</i>

76
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:20,782
Yeah.

77
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,832
You'll get the hang of it.
All you gotta do...

78
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,913
is feel the beat.

79
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,374
<i>I'm gonna let it all
out, do my thing.</i>

80
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,461
<i>We are a part of
the rhythm nation.</i>

81
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,376
Come on, son.
Let's shake this world!

82
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,011
<i>Show me what you're
workin' with.</i>

83
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,170
<i>Do your thing.</i>

84
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,634
<i>Let's dance,
let's shout.</i>

85
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,014
<i>We're
bringing ﬂuffy back.</i>

86
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,595
<i>Do your thing.</i>

87
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,884
<i>Make my body sing.</i>

88
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,928
That's it. Get stupid.

89
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,024
<i>We are a part
of the rhythm...</i>

90
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,864
It's not funny!

91
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,285
Can you whiz on cue and finish with a headstand?
I don't think so.

92
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,703
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

93
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,540
Oh, gosh. That was... Wow.

94
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,254
Oh. Uh...

95
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,797
Erik. Erik.

96
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,976
Erik, I'm really sorry.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,223
Come on, champ.
It wasn't that bad.

98
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,482
When I was your age...

99
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,144
I got laughed at a lot.
They thought I was weird too.

100
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,608
Mumble!

101
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,564
I mean, different,
in a cool way.

102
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,903
Like, you're cool.

103
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,358
I was uncool.

104
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,243
- Easy, easy. Whoa.
- Really uncool.

105
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,616
Okay. You know, Erik...

106
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,701
when your daddy's
in a deep hole...

107
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,707
he's gotta learn
to stop digging.

108
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,537
Yeah.

109
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,418
Mumble!
A little help here.

110
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,045
We'd never
have an egg with you.

111
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,204
- No way.
- No way.

112
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,089
Give me one good reason.
- Too short.

113
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,376
- And you're gross.
- Is that guy bothering you?

114
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,839
No, he's nobody.

115
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,678
<i>I wanna
know what love is.</i>

116
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,013
- Hey, Mumble.
- Amigo.

117
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,428
Hey. Hey!

118
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,562
<i>I want you to show me</i>

119
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,396
- Ramon, get out of there.
- That's Erik's hole.

120
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,650
- Ramon!
- What?

121
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,945
We're having a private
conversation with Erik.

122
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,275
So you, too, are mocked
and misunderstood?

123
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,693
Amigo, please.

124
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,611
Don't worry, I can fix it.

125
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,449
No, no, no.

126
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,989
Let me tell something to you.

127
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,705
What's a best friend for if he cannot
bring a daddy and his boy together?

128
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,586
Hello? Where are you?

129
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,464
Hello? Hello? Hello?

130
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,129
There you are.

131
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,461
You know, ﬂuffito,
the truth is...

132
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,257
for wild maverick outcasts
like us who cannot be tamed...

133
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,346
this place sucks!

134
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,011
Ramon, you're being ridiculous.

135
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,224
Not any more.

136
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,890
I am going home to Adelie Land.

137
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,145
<i>Adelie
Land, Adelie Land.</i>

138
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,278
<i>Be who you want to be
A haven for heroes.</i>

139
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,483
Erik?

140
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,648
Knock knock? Hello?

141
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,739
Honey, I think he needs
to be alone right now.

142
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,744
We can't leave him by
himself in a hole.

143
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,280
We've got his back, sir.

144
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,948
Yeah. True that.

145
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,659
There you go.

146
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,874
- Let the hoppers work it out.
- Quite right.

147
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:15,753
Okay, come on.

148
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,879
All right. Step away.

149
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,757
Nothing to see here.
Shufflely off-ely.

150
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,510
So much for my daddy skills.

151
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,342
Adiós, Emperor Land!

152
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,805
This is one fabulous penguin
you will never laugh at again.

153
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,264
Never!

154
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,175
Hey, Atticus. Snack time.

155
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,294
Erik?

156
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,304
Shh.
I think they're snuggled up.

157
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,469
All snoozy.

158
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,725
They're not here.

159
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,894
Bobo!

160
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,806
Oh! Boadicea!

161
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,645
Come on, Atticus.
Why you fooling around?

162
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,900
Where are you?

163
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,437
I know you hear me, Atticus.

164
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,653
Gloria? Do you think they could
have, you know, run off?

165
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,408
Outside? By themselves?

166
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,819
Maybe they followed Ramon.

167
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,157
- Baby...
- I know, I know.

168
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,789
But I really ought to check it out.
I won't be long.

169
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,870
Mumble, relax.

170
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,913
We will find them and when we do,
you'll find a way to put things right.

171
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,296
You're a good dad.

172
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,711
Yeah.

173
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,337
I'll be back as soon
as I can, okay?

174
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,943
Whoa, that was a big one.

175
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,453
I hate it when that happens.

176
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,988
Hey, Will? Is that you?

177
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,997
Of course it's me.
Can't you tell?

178
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,658
No. Not if we all look the same.

179
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,747
I don't.

180
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,879
Will, we are krill.
We are meant to look the same.

181
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,166
Not me, Bill. There's only
one of me in all the world.

182
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,960
I am one in a krillion. Hm.

183
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,300
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.

184
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,679
I wanna be free, Bill!

185
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,309
There's no such thing as free, Will.
Come on, less thinking, more swarming.

186
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,061
I'm sick of swarming.
We've been swarming all our lives.

187
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,188
It's like you've got
a mind of your own.

188
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,566
Tell me, Bill, what
lies beyond the swarm?

189
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,771
- More swarm.
- And then?

190
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,231
- Some more swarm.
- And then?

191
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,238
Will, there's nothing but swarm.
We are a swarm without end.

192
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,695
Everything's got an end.
See? I end here.

193
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,201
That is not a happy ending.

194
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,736
It stands to reason, Bill...

195
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,658
if I swim against the swarm, I must
eventually reach the end of the world.

196
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,825
Yeah.

197
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,586
Okay.
On the count of three.

198
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,422
One, two, three!

199
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,429
No.

200
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,098
I can do this. I can do this.

201
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,258
No, you can't.

202
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,268
Yes, I can do this.
No, you can't.

203
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,644
Who's talking to me? You.

204
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,430
Who are you? Me. Who said that?

205
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:28,905
Now <i>walk it</i> out.

206
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,406
<i>Now walk it out.</i>

207
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,782
<i>West side, walk it out.</i>

208
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,193
<i>South side, walk it out.</i>

209
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,827
<i>East side, walk it out.</i>

210
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:35,828
<i>Hey!</i>

211
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,331
Hey! What's up?
What's this? What's up?

212
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,911
We're coming to Adelie Land.

213
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,953
You aren't. You are without your
parents, this is chicknapping.

214
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,416
Now go. Shoo, shoo!

215
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,752
- But we can't. We're fugitives.
- Huh?

216
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,542
- Fugi wha..?
- Fugitives.

217
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,585
- Fleeing Emperor Land.
- No.

218
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,470
- No happy feets.
- What?

219
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,347
No happy feets.

220
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,133
We're rebels seeking
thrills and adventure.

221
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,677
And tasty snacks.

222
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,140
Oh, thank you.

223
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,024
This guy. All right.
I want a big fish, three little ones...

224
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,776
Oh, oh! Some of those tiny crustaceans.
The little ones that go:

225
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,357
Oh, yeah!

226
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,194
- Now go.
- But we can't swim. We're way too fluffy.

227
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,237
- What?
- Fluffy don't float.

228
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,656
But it's too high.
I'm a leap..ophobic.

229
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,371
Oh, dude! The water's right there.
Like, right there.

230
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,956
I don't care.
It's too cold for a hot blood like me.

231
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:29,545
Atticus, stop!
He's chewing on his flipper!

232
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,755
Okay, okay.
Here's what we are going to do.

233
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,673
We count to three. Push me on two.
But you don't tell me, okay?

234
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,636
One, two!

235
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,891
Aah!

236
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,427
What'd you do that for?

237
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,648
Baby penguins.
Cute, but ruthless.

238
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,108
Will! Will!
What are we even looking for?

239
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,366
That's the beauty of it, my friend.
I don't know.

240
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,448
Will, please, come back.
I fear the worst.

241
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,078
I fear the worst too, Bill...

242
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,707
because fearing the best is
a complete waste of time.

243
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,410
Oh, yeah. There!

244
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,544
Maybe it's a black hole.

245
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,426
They're just myths.
Scary talk, to keep us in the swarm.

246
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,554
Coming out of nowhere, swallowing
everything in its path!

247
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,387
For something that doesn't
exist, it's very impressive.

248
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,222
- Swim! Aah!
- Whoa!

249
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,699
Oh, yes.

250
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,293
It's beautiful.

251
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,596
Uncle Ramon?

252
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,233
No. No, no, no. Kids...

253
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,227
take me home.

254
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,281
So this...

255
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,284
is all we are. Lunch.

256
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,073
To think we spent our whole
lives not knowing the truth.

257
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,950
Goodbye, Krill World.

258
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,337
Erik.

259
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,089
Bo.

260
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,468
Atticus.

261
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,353
Ramon. Hmm.

262
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,487
Listen.

263
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,782
Do you hear that?

264
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,492
That's the mating call
of the Adelie female.

265
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,584
I'm about to be thrown to the ground and
crushed by a thousand <i>chicas.</i>

266
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,968
It's okay, ladies!
The love god, he's back!

267
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,177
Whoa!
Ignored by thousands.

268
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,010
I said, "The
love god is back!"

269
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:34,313
Come on. I got so much love,
I'm going to explode!

270
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,978
Ramon! Amigos!

271
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,523
- I can't believe it!
- I'm back in the band. Yeah!

272
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,487
It's like you never
left, but you did.

273
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,028
Ramon, triplets?

274
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,662
No, there's only three.

275
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,789
<i>Kids, amigos. Amigos, kids.</i>

276
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,949
Oh, look at how cute.

277
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,369
Where are the chicas?
The Ramon-starved <i>chicas?</i>

278
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,584
- You been away too long.
- There's a lot more competition now, bro.

279
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,713
Mm-hm.

280
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,999
Impossible.

281
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,508
Lovelace.

282
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,889
<i>Guru.</i>

283
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,392
<i>We love you.</i>

284
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:08,809
Wow.

285
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,187
- Same old Lovelace.
- Only completely different.

286
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,063
He looks like a rainbow.

287
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,144
Like a rainbow...

288
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,980
- with man-chichis.
- Ramon.

289
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,644
All right!

290
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,190
Brothers and sisters!

291
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,074
Penguins all!

292
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,745
No matter how big!

293
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,615
No matter how small!

294
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,747
We are here today...

295
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,673
for one extraordinary penguin!

296
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,591
Yes, indeed!

297
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,508
It's Sven time!

298
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,263
Sven! Sven!

299
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,891
<i>Sven! Sven! Sven!</i>

300
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,265
A penguin who's not afraid of heights.
So what?

301
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,781
- Whoa!
- Golly gosh!

302
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,833
A penguin who can fly.

303
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,588
UP-uppity-up!

304
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,299
Okay, this Mr. Up is going down.

305
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,061
<i>Share the
mystery of your history.</i>

306
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,972
Tell it, brother! Testify.

307
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:36,980
Oh, but friends...

308
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,107
it's such a long story.

309
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,439
Then tell the short one!

310
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,318
Ramon.

311
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,647
It begins with the loss of...

312
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,236
Hey, Goldilocks.
That beak looks way too big on you!

313
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,117
- It begins...
- The end.

314
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,903
- Security!
- I can't believe this.

315
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,446
Get your filthy flippers off me!

316
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,330
Let him go.
He's fragile right now.

317
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,116
Yeah!
You tell them, amigos!

318
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,830
And they're still talking.

319
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,584
We're still here for you, brother.
Go ahead.

320
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,498
Okey-dokey. Ahem.

321
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,469
It begin with the loss of my...

322
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,928
No. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
The moment is gone. I've lost my mojo.

323
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,841
Maybe tomorrow.

324
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,513
No, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling it.
Show's over.

325
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,727
- Please, sir.
- What?

326
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,144
Does your story
have flying in it?

327
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,187
Avvw.

328
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,946
And where are you
from, little squirt?

329
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,527
We're from the Emperor-hood.

330
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,283
And what your name is?

331
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,318
Erik.

332
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,326
Ear-rik.

333
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:36,036
Hm. In Svenland, we have many
brave warriors called Ear-rik.

334
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,199
You do?

335
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,868
Oh, ja.

336
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,540
<i>Ja.</i>

337
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,956
Everybody!

338
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,131
Everybody!
Your attention, please.

339

I dedicate my much-applauded...

to my brave friend Ear-rik.

342
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,766
Ear-rik.

343
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,098
<i>Ear-rik.</i>

344
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,691

<i>Ear-rik</i>

So...

351
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,951
it begin with the
loss of my home!

352
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,086
<i>He was the last of a
noble penguin race.</i>

353
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,588
<i>Whose world collapsed
at a rapid pace.</i>

354
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,216
<i>The power to ﬂy
was my saving grace.</i>

355
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,673
The mighty Sven

356
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,555
<i>From his pretty lips.</i>

357
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,341
<i>With his stylish swoops
And his triple ﬂips.</i>

358
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,727
<i>I alone escaped the apocalypse.</i>

359
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,855
The mighty Sven.

360
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,391
<i>He journeyed
far without a rest.</i>

361
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,104
Ooh. Hello there.

362
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,438
<i>Those fightin' titans
Were a heck of a test.</i>

363
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,944
<i>But even they couldn't
take him down</i>

364
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,907
<i>'Cause none could match The
guts and grit of Sven.</i>

365
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,654
<i>Sven.</i>

366
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,743
<i>Guts and grit.</i>

367
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,079
<i>Guts and grit.</i>

368
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,121
<i>He met the aliens
who ruled the seas.</i>

369
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,584
<i>They took one look at him
And fell to their knees.</i>

370
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,924
<i>They restored him.</i>

371
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,460
<i>They adorned him.</i>

372
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:17,764
<i>And they adored him.</i>

373
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,935
<i>Then destiny showed its...</i>

374
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,147
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

375
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,149
Oh, it's okey-dokey.
Don't keep it inside.

376
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,652
Yeah, it's okey-dokey.

377
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,779
<i>Sing it out.</i>

378
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:35,694
<i>Then destiny showed
its kindest face.</i>

379
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:41,249
<i>When I was lost in
the darkest place.</i>

380
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,585
<i>Before I drew my final breath.</i>

381
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,167
<i>He delivered me.</i>

382
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:52,335
<i>From the thick black death.</i>

383
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,346
<i>Bathed and fluffed All
pleasures bestowed.</i>

384
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,806
<i>I didn't want to end it.</i>

385
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,265
<i>They covered me in a
protective robe.</i>

386
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,348
<i>There I stood before him.</i>

387
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,939
<i>Resplendent.</i>

388
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,196
<i>Sven!</i> Sven!

389
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,486
Erik!

390
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,294
<i>As I was
learning the alien speak.</i>

391
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,796
What smells so gosh darn good-y?

392
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,806
<i>Sven had a higher truth to seek.</i>

393
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,395
<i>Who knows what he saw.</i>

394
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,057
<i>In that mystic light?</i>

395
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,077
Svensei!

396
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,913
- I've seen our future.
- What?

397
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,043
- Ja, it's calling to me.
- Yeah?

398
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,251
It says "Sven.
Sven, go that way! Quickly!"

399
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,756
I'm with you!

400
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,838
The mighty Sven.

401
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,252
Oh, my sweet eyes.

00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,170
He ﬂies.

403
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,092
The mighty Sven.

404
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,850
<i>And so he came
to this far, far shore.</i>

405
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,773
<i>To shine his gifts upon us all.</i>

406
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,025
What...?

407
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,113
- What is it?
- It's incredible.

408
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,115
- Really? You've never seen this?
- No.

409
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,409
Green.

410
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,787
Brothers and sisters,
behold the power...

411
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:43,787
of Sven.

412

<i>Let it out, let it out.</i>

413
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,955
<i>Let it out Let it out.</i>

414

<i>On that day, I took</i> a <i>vow.</i>

415
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:56,964
<i>I, Sven, promises to use my
powers Only for good-y.</i>

416
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,594
<i>Good-y, good-y.</i>

417
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,754
And I dedicate full-time...

00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:05,267
to the "createment"
of a new Adelie Land!

419
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:29,667
ls there no end to
the power of Sven?

420
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,996

Sven!
Marry me! Marry me!

422
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,669

00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,968
Ah, my beauties.

427
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:48,602
But if I love the few,
who will love the many?

428
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,139
But if they love
you, who will love Ramon?

429
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,519
Ramon!

430
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,975
Somebody? Anybody?

431
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,694
Nobody?

432

Body?

433
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,818
Aw, bitter,
twisted, lonely guy.

434
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,359
You must learn to
think like Sven.

435
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,276
Why?

436
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,319

What about the folks back home and
how worried your mother must be?

485
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,597
Ear-rik, it's best to do
what your father's saying.

486
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,474
But I don't belong there.

487
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:55,308
Oh, ﬂuffy one, I want to
tell to you a secret. Okay?

488
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,016
Sometimes, when you are
a little different...

489
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,810
the world laugh at you, ja?

490
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:01,644
Yeah.

491
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,982
Think you're funny.

492
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,647
- Pointing flippers.
- Mm-hm.

493
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,817
Ja, well, we have a
saying back in Svenland.

494
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,285
Believe in yourself, Ear-rik...

495
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,701
because Sven believe in you.

496
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,912
- Mighty Sven?
<i>- Ja?</i>

497
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,298
Will I ever fly?

498
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:26,086
- Erik, please.
- Mumble, the boy seeks a higher truth.

499
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,675
If you want it,
you must will it.

500
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,963
If you will it...

501
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,178
it will be yours.

502
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,637
Now, go.

503
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,523
Avvw.

504
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,526
Ciao.

505
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,159
Ciao.

506
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,419
Uh, son?

507
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,924
Erik...

508
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,552
you know, when
things go wrong...

509
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,884
running away is not the answer.
Okay?

510
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,893
You have to find within yourself
a way to handle it. Okay?

511
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,722
Yeah.

512
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,887
Yeah. And we're all different.

513
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,807
It's part of the job of life
to find out who you are...

514
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,191
and what you got.

515
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,227
It may not be dancing
or flying...

516
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,862
but when you find it...

517
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,148
it'll be all yours.

518
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,157
You know what I'm saying?

519
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,029
Yeah.

520
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,660
Okey-dokey.

521
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,830
Right.

522
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,369
<i>Sven</i>

523
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,427
Will! Will! Will!
What is this?!

524
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,254
It's the wave of change!

525
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:56,016
The world is changing, Bill.
We've got to get on the ride!

526
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,448
By the mother of Guin.
This cannot be.

527
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,809
Whoa. Something somewhere
just took a big bump.

528
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,938
Yeah.

529
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,147
Sounded awfully close
to Emperor Land.

530
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,153
Come on, guys.
Let's pick up the pace.

531
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,070
- This is our moment, Bill.
- Okay.

532
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,156
Adapt or die, my friend.

533
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,162
Adapt? There's no telling
what we might become.

534
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,289
Fine. Be a plankton
muncher all your life.

535
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,327
But that's what we are.
We're herbivores. We eat veggies.

536
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,837
Right.
So everyone else can eat us.

537
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,669
Well, I am not prepared to
be on the menu any longer.

538
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,084
- Where you going?
- I'm moving up the food chain.

539
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,218
The food chain?

540
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,471
I'm gonna go chew on
something that has a face!

541
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,179
- I don't remember this.
- Yeah.

542
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,940
Well, things always
look different on the way back.

543
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,067
Guess we'll have to go
all the way around.

544
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,194
- But Emperor Land is straight ahead.
- Yeah.

545
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,775
So why not go over that?

546
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,281
No, no.
This way is better.

547
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,941
But shortcuts are shorter.

548
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,611
Not always. Now, come on.
It's not that far.

549
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,830
Guys, stop!

550
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,959
Erik. I said stop!

551
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,626
All right.

552
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,131
All right.

553
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:56,387
We'll keep going, but
take it nice and slow.

554
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,728
And what's say we don't
look down, okay?

555
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,556
Atticus, what did I just say?

556
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,558
- Whoa!
- Wow.

557
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,692
G'day, sport.

558
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,693
Hi.

559
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,399
- Where you heading?
- Home.

560
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,111
Oh, yeah? So am I.

561
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,201
If you don't mind backing
up a little bit...

562
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,612
we'll just squeeze past.

563
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,032
That's the one thing I
Back up.

564
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,041
The Beachmaster backs
up for nobody.

565
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,826
Then maybe...

566
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,165
you can move sideways.

567
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,375
Don't do sideways.

568
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,005
We've come all the way across.

569
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,791
You'll have to go
all the way back.

570
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,925
I've got the kids.
It's kind of dangerous.

571
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:36,926
Of course.

572
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,508
- And we're anxious to get home.
- I see. Fair enough.

573
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,764
But see it my way, sport.

574
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,051
One day, I'll be
protecting my beach...

575
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,766
and some pumped-up mongrel
wants to take it from me.

576
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,939
We're nose-to-nose.
The whole world's watching.

577
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,772
And in the back of me mind,
there's this niggling doubt:

578
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,436
I once backed up for a penguin.

579
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,188
He'll see it in me eyes...

580
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,574
and I'm gone. Goodbye, ladies.

581
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,700
Hello, lonely beach.

582
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,031
- You with me?
- Yeah, but...

583
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,912
Then get out of my way.

584
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:08,451
"My mother says, “Every
obstacle is an opportunity."

585
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,460
What? Bo. Bo!

586
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,579
Whoa! Unh!

587
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,874
Hey! Yo, dog!
You be apologizing...

588
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,093
or I'm gonna tear
you a new nostril.

589
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,554
He didn't mean that.

590
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,090
That's okay.

591
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,054
I didn't mean that.

592
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,974
SvenTHINK, SvenTHINK.
- Erik, no!

593
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,721
Golly gosh!

594
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,639
You fat...

595
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,978
mother of all bullies!

596
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,392
Get out of my way!

597
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,987
Oh, no.

598
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:38,655
Erik.

599
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:39,861
Daddy. Daddy.

600
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,114
- Where are you, Daddy?
- Where's he gone?

601
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,324
Uh-oh.

602
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,784
That's not healthy.

603
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,290
Are you okay?

604
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,995
Not exactly.

605
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,495
Daddy, what
are you doing...

606
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,335
- ...down there?
- Get back up here.

607
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,124
Not sure I can.

608
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,416
There is a way...

609
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,926
but you won't like it.

610
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,176
You want me to back
up, don't you?

611
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,176
Come on, Dad.

612
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,306
You can do it.

613
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,968
We won't think less
of you, Daddy.

614
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:13,107
Well, I suppose technically
it's just reversing.

615
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,189
I guess I could, you
know, just a smidge.

616
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,270
That's it, Dad.

617
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,689
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah.

618
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,448
Back. That's it.

619
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,359
In no way does
this feel natural.

620
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,496
- Now see if you can turn yourself around.
- All right.

621
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,201
Use your flippers.

622
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,662
Whoa! Stop!

623
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:32,496
Dad!

624
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,870
- Come on, Daddy.
- You can do it.

625
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,162
Oh, jeez!

626
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,172
Daddy! Daddy!

627
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,838
Daddy!

628
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:45,847
Can you hear me...

629
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,553
Daddy?!

630
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,221
Shane? Darren?

631
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,479
Daddy!

632
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,897
I need youse...

633
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,228
to stay strong.

634
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,653
I know you will, because
you've never let me down.

635
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,030
Penguin, you still there?

636
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,066
Yeah. Right here.

637
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:08,032
Would you see that me boys get
home safe to their mother?

638
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,034
Daddy.
What are you saying?

639
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,666
Sorry, boys.

640
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,707
They're calling full time
on your old man's career.

641
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,371
- No, Dad! No!
- No, Dad!

642
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,590
Come on. Take a look around.

643
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,092
Can you see any way out?

644
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,216
Yeah. I could grow...

645
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,425
a pair of wings.

646
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,885
Can you move at all?

647
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,925
I'm stuck, mate.

648
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,182
Okay. Everyone...

649
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,767
back from the edge.

650
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,398
Come on, get back from the edge.

651
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,934
All right.
Now don't move till I get back.

652
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,101
Where are you going?

653
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,855
To see what I can
do for their daddy.

654
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,607
What can he do?

655
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,777
He's just an ordinary penguin.

656
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,006
That's one small
step for a krill...

657
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,800
one giant leap for
spineless invertebrates.

658
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,061
Holy mother of krill.

659
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,314
How's your appetite, Bill?
He's a big 'un.

660
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,027
What on earth are you doing?

661
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,740
- I'm stalking.
- You can't...!

662
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,530
- Shh! Shh.
- You can't...

663
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,620
You can't stalk. You're a krill.

664
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,250
We've got to evolve, Bill.

665
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,585
Evolve? Just like that? It's taken us
millions of years just to get this far.

666
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,796
Watch and learn, Billy-boy.
I'm about to naturally select.

667
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,176
No! No, no, no...

668
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,181
<i>Hmm.</i>

669
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,634
A little chewy.

670
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,018
Keenly aromatic.

671
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,851
You just nibbled on its butt.
Don't let it go to your head.

672
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,187
<i>Au contraire, I will
go to its head.</i>

673
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,191
Oh, goodness.

674
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,105
Onward and upward, my friend.
Fresh delicacies await.

675
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,097
Uh, penguin? Is that you?

676
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,516
Streuth.

677
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,202
Oh, penguin.

678
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,583
We're going where no
krill has ever gone before!

679
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,245
Uh-huh.
- We're the stuff of legends, Bill!

680
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,754
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay.

681
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:05,960
How far to the face?

682
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,749
Just ahead!

683
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,216
Hey, you!

684
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,753
Doofus!

685
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,552
Yeah, you. Kelp-sucker.

686
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,602
My mistake.

687
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:31,524
I thought you were a
ruthless killing machine.

688
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,197
Don't you want a little
taste of penguin?

689
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,454
Stand back, Bill.
This could get messy.

690
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,434
Ha, ha!

691
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,891
He's a fighter!
But he'll drop soon.

692
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,273
It's just the death throes!

693
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,739
Yoo-hoo!

694
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,244
Whoa!

695
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,155
Whoa!

696
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,496
G'day, gorgeous.

697
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,831
I'm sorry.

698
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,246
My mistake.

699
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,009
Dad?

700
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,218
Boys.

701
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,103
Pa. It worked.

702
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,061
SvenTHINK.

703
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,695
Oh, yeah! Did you see the look in his eyes?
Mortal terror!

704
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,074
You said he was finished.

705
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,361
- I spared his despicable life!
- What?

706
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,404
He'll tell his friends.
Spread the fear.

707
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,199
There's a new predator in town!
Sching!

708
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,366
You're insane.

709
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,878
Someone's gotta keep their numbers
down, Bill, and we are that someone.

710
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:09,913
Oh, boy.

711
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,423
<i>We are the
champions, my friend.</i>

712
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,880
<i>And we'll keep on
fighting till the end.</i>

713
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:15,919
Listen to yourself.

714
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,508
<i>Me are the champion
Me are the champion.</i>

715
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,345
Delusional singing!
Will, it's the first sign of madness.

716
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,055
<i>Me are the champion.</i>

717
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,978
- How's that shoulder?
- Yeah, it's okay.

718
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,060
Yeah, get some ice on it.
You'll be right.

719
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,691
- Thanks.
- No.

720
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,725
Thank you.

721
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,738
Thanks to you, chief, Beachmaster
Bryan gets to play another season.

722
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,365
I reckon that makes you an
honorary elephant seal.

723
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,696
What do you reckon, boys?

724
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:42,032
Thank you, Your Honor, for
giving us our daddy back.

725
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,744
- Yeah. Cheers, Bryan.
- I owe you one, my friend.

726
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,998
No.

727
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,535
I mean it.
All you have to do is ask.

728
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,621
Any time, any place.

729
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,711
No worries. Okay?

730
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,341
No worries.

731
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,922
Okay.

732
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,589
Come on, nippers.
Let's get youse home.

733
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:02,925
- All right.
- Both of youse.

734
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,809
- On you hop, Shane-0.
- Come on, guys.

735
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,266
Go on, Daggy, up you get.

736
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,195
We lost, ain't we?

737
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,156
Atticus, we're not lost.

738
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,537
- Emperor Land should be right here.
- Yeah.

739
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,414
My instincts are never wrong.

740
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:31,830
You all are crazy. I know for a fact
the Emperor-hood is one day that way.

741
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,872
No, that way.

742
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,461
Oh, my goodness!

743
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,045
Oh, no.

744
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,766
Hey, look!
Somebody got out!

745
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,060
Aye, you see!
I knew there was a way!

746
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,978
Hey, buddy,
how do we get out?!

747
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,146
I don't know!

748
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,656
I'm trying to get in!

749
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,440
Mumble!

750
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,449
Mumble!

751
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:02,450
Yo! Dad!

752
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,738
Atticus, my man!
Good to see y'all still kicking!

753
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,121
What happened?

754
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,251
That big old iceberg you on came
thumping and bumping, and here we are!

755
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,501
That's messed up!

756
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,287
Nothing
we can't fix, dear!

757
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,296
Mommy!

758
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,253
I told
them all to chillax!

759
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,837
I knew you'd be fine!

760
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,001
Where's Mommy?

761
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,795
Has anyone seen Gloria?

762
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,015
Mumble! Erik!

763
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,175
- Mom!
- Gloria!

764
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,677
My beautiful boys.

765
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,345
Thought I'd never see you again.

766
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,979
Gotta be a way to get you out.

767
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,561
Honey, there are search
parties everywhere.

768
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,102
If there's a way
out, we're gonna find it.

769
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,269
Don't worry, Daddy!

770
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,940
Today Uncle Mumble got a big
old elephant seal out of...

771
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,403
a big black hole!

772
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,490
Yeah. But that was a
whole lot different!

773
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:47,700
But you did.

774
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,615
Mumble!
Can you get us a couple of fish for my kids?

775
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,035
- Mine too!
- Over here!

776
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,124
Okay. I'll do what I can.

777
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,005
- What about my family?
- Hey, don't forget us!

778
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,801
Hey, hey! Hey, listen.

779
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,308
There is a way to feed
a whole lot of you.

780
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,312
I'm going to Adelie Land.
Bring back some friends.

781
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,847
You'll have to be patient...

782
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,640
okay?

783
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,229
Bo, where are you going?

784
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,144
I'm taking the shortcut.

785
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,984
- No, you're not. You're staying here.
- But I'm very fast.

786
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,695
- Erik?
- Be cool. She's a freerunner.

787
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,204
Sorry, Erik.
One's faster than two.

788
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,364
Boadicea, do
you have a tail feather?

789
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,828
Yes, I have a tail feather.

790
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,038
Then you...

791
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,247
shake it, my dear!

792
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,037
- Booya!
- But, Miss Viola...

793
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,501
there are all kinds
of dangers out there.

794
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,541
Not dangers, challenges!

795
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,176
Now that's the spirit!

796
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,714
Okay. Okay. Find Uncle Ramon.

797
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,601
<i>Tell him to bring the amigos and
as many Adelies as he can. And...</i>

798
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,057
And always remember
the family motto:

799
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,598
Just let rip!

800
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,950
Come on, Uncle Mumble.
We got some fishing to do.

801
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,476
So, what news have you?

802
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,818
Every nook and cranny, every
which way, completely blocked.

803
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,823
There's a lot of talk out there.

804
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,076
- Thinking the unthinkable.
- Yeah.

805
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,362
Noah, they're calling
this the 'Berg of Doom.

806
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,700
How will we answer that?

807
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,615
- We look again.
- We can't just keep...

808
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,750
We go back and we
search a hundred times.

809
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,001
There is no way out!

810
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,788
A thousand times if we have to.
There's always a way!

811
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,882
Yeah, that's it, right there.

812
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,088
The <i>ice</i>

813
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,716
<i>The ice sounds nice Check one.</i>

814
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,719
<i>The ice Ice sounds nice.</i>

815
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,847
Here. Let me help you.

816
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,273
Okay. Now let it go.

817
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:21,979
Wait... Erik!

818
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,518
No! Slow down!

819
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,695
Jump! Jump off!

820
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,987
Whoa!

821
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,206
Did you see me? Did you?

822
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,333
Don't ever do that again!

823
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,540
Daddy, I was flying!

824
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,454
- Aw, Erik.
- Really flying!

825
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,046
I flapped my wings super
fast and I went uppity-up!

826
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,551
Son, we're penguins.

827
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,426
We can't fly.

828
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,553
But Sven is a penguin.

829
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:55,558
I don't know what kind of penguin Sven is,
but we are Emperor penguins. We can't...

830
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,219
But if everyone could learn
to fly, Mommy can...

831
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,683
get out of there!

832
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,474
- Hey.
- I don't know if there's a way out!

833
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,641
Know... way out!

834
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,559
Hey!

835
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,853
But if there is, it sure
as eggs ain't flying.

836
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,109
If you want it,
you must will it!

837
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,821
And if you will it,
it will be yours!

838
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,236
Aw, Erik, get real.
They're trapped.

839
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,080
They're hungry, afraid.

840
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,199
The last thing anyone...

841
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,494
needs is false hope!

842
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,245
Boys?

843
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,790
Then they'll die.

844
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,166
Boys...

845
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,130
what's going on with you two?

846
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,963
Just working things out.

847
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,130
Erik?

848
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,220
We need some mother love, Ms. G.

849
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,468
He's about to explode!

850
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,102
Mumble, why
don't you go...

851
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,558
catch some fish?

852
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,605
He ain't hungry...

853
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,107
Ms. G.

854
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,275
It's okay, Atticus.

855
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,310
I got it.

856
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,978
I got it!

857
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,856
Okay, fishing.

858
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,776
Erik, just let it go.

859
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,240
Erik, calm down!

860
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,623
Sweetie, take a step back.

861
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,955
Close your eyes.

862
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,788
Deep breath.

863
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,457
Come on, it's easy.

864
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,470
<i>Just when you think.</i>

865
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,924
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

866
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,435
<i>And giving UP</i>

867
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,768
<i>ls all you got.</i>

868
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,776
<i>Blue turns black.</i>

869
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,150
<i>Your confidence is cracked.</i>

870
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:36,868
<i>There seems no turnin'
back from here.</i>

871
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,366
<i>When your feet.</i>

872
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,876
<i>Are made of stone.</i>

873
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,998
<i>And you're convinced.</i>

874
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,508
<i>That you're all alone.</i>

875
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,341
<i>Look at the stars.</i>

876
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,515
<i>Instead of the dark.</i>

877
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,806
<i>You'll find your heart.</i>

878
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:06,519
<i>Shines like the sun.</i>

879
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:12,733
<i>Let's not let our
anger get us lost.</i>

880
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,198
<i>And the need to be right.</i>

881
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:20,237
<i>Comes with way too high a cost.</i>

882
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,040
<i>That's when you can build.</i>

883
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,700
<i>A bridge of light.</i>

884
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,086
<i>That's what turns the
wrongs all right.</i>

885
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,918
<i>That's when you know.</i>

886
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,627
<i>It's worth the fight.</i>

887
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,714
<i>That's when love
Turns nighttime.</i>

888
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,721
<i>Into day.</i>

889
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,929
<i>That's when loneliness
goes away.</i>

890
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:48,144
<i>That's why you gotta
be strong This night</i>

891
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,893
<i>'Cause only love can build us.</i>

892
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:52,901
<i>A bridge</i>

893
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,904
<i>or light</i>

894
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,655
<i>Deep breath, take it.</i>

895
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,539
<i>On the chin.</i>

896
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,369
<i>But don't forget.</i>

897
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,248
<i>To let love back in.</i>

898
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,213
<i>That's when love can build.</i>

899
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,968
<i>A bridge of light.</i>

900
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,427
<i>That's what turns the
wrongs all right.</i>

901
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,091
<i>That's when you can't.</i>

902
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:27,103
<i>Give up the fight.</i>

903
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,770
<i>And that's when love Turns
nighttime into day.</i>

904
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,527
<i>That's when loneliness
goes away.</i>

905
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,108
<i>That's why you gotta.</i>

906
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,242
<i>Be strong tonight</i>

907
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,115
<i>'Cause only love can build us.</i>

908
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:48,624
<i>A bridge of light.</i>

909
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,036
<i>Only love can build us.</i>

910
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:55,048
<i>A bridge of light.</i>

911
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,093
<i>Only love can build us.</i>

912
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,181
<i>A bridge of light</i>

913
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,468
Will? Will?

914
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:07,430
Hm?

915
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,766
- You asleep yet?
- Mm-hm. Deeply.

916
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,852
Well,
then wake up and tell me:

917
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,561
Is that the swarm
or am I dreaming?

918
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,476
You're dreaming.

919
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,614
Wow, how wonderful.

920
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,249
I wonder if they're edible.

921
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,083
Aww.

922
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,463
Will, don't you long for the patter
of a thousand tiny little feet?

923
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,299
I, for one, don't have the means
to bring up so many kids.

924
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,929
The birthday presents alone...

925
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,894
I've already

926
00:48:45,895 --> 00:48:48,184
Phil, Jill, Lill, Gill, Hil,
Billy, Lilly, Willy...

927
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,640
- All right.
- Wilma, Willis, Wilbur, Wilhelmina...

928
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:51,725
I get the picture.

929
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,230
And there's even a Will.

930
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,390
Good for you.

931
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,184
We could start a little swarm.

932
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,693
We're both males.

933
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:58,444
We'll adopt.

934
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,401
You adopt, I'll adapt.
I've got slaughtering to do.

935
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,989
Fine, that's just fine! Off you go then.
Quench your blood lust.

936
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,529
There's plenty more
krill in the sea.

937
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:13,076
Plenty of krill would count themselves
lucky to have me as a partner.

938
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,290
I'm a heck of a wingman!

939
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,008
Will.

940
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:30,510
Will?

941
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,187
- Hey.
- Hey.

942
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,064
You're all the
swarm I've got.

943
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,193
Suit yourself.
But no hanky-panky.

944
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,157
Are you hurt?

945
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,290
No, I'm good. I'm okay.
It's okay.

946
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,121
Aw, come on, Seymour,
take a break.

947
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:40,663
No. No, no, thanks, brother.
My boy is out there.

948
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,627
Oh, no.

949
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:55,974
Erik! Atticus!

950
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,137
Take cover!

951
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,306
Come on, Erik. Over here.

952
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,812
Waddle,
waddle, waddle.

953
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,981
Oh, if only I could fly!

954
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,149
Boo-hoo-hoo!

955
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,701
Oh, look at this.

956
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,988
My all-time favorite.
Doomed penguin packed in ice.

957
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,201
All you can eat.

958
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,832
Forever.

959
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,502
I've never seen so many
skuas in one place.

960
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,287
Stand together. Hold fast.

961
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,206
- They know. They sense it!
- We're never getting out of here!

962
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,670
They're scavengers.
Cowards!

963
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,210
They prey only on the weak.

964
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,378
Admit it, Noah!
We're all dead meat!

965
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,339
No! We are Emperor penguins!

966
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,506
Quite right!

967
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:36,519
Though we stare famine in the
face, we will not yield!

968
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,179
- Ha, ha!
- Though imprisoned...

969
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,689
on every side by
colossal walls of ice...

970
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,850
we will not be broken!

971
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,690
Yes, sir. Speak on it, Noah!

972
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,695
We are fortitude!

973
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,198
We are bold defiance!

974
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:53,156
We are one glorious
Emperor nation!

975
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,223
No!

976
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,069
Erik, stay down!

977
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,033
Mumble?

978
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,405
They're okay.

979
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,078
Gloria, behind you!

980
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,082
Hey!

981
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,623
Pick on someone your
own size, creep!

982
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,208
Oh, I will, princess.

983
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,248
I'll peck on you first.

984
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,167
While you're still fresh.
Before you're stiff and stinky!

985
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,672
Bo!

986
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,600
Bo!

987
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,750
- That's my girl.
- Oh, yeah.

988
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,255
Well done, you.

989
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,087
Ah, the gathering of nations.

990
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,922
Now that's solidarity!

991
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,465
Okay, so...

992
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:38,383
So they got
themselves a temporary stay...

993
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,641
of execution. Ow!

994
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,017
- What are you?
- An idiot.

995
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,177
Thank you.

996
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,846
Bo! Oh, you did it.

997
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:44,763
Whoo!

998
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,648
- She is fast.
- Hola, amigos!

999
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,312
- Mumble!
- Mumble!

1000
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,318
- You came!
- Of course we came.

1001
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,070
- We heard the news.
- Where's Ramon?

1002
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,323
- No longer with us.
- He's in a better place.

1003
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,983
Carmen!

1004
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,402
We got you, man.

1005
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,655
Carmen. Carmen, no. No, wait!

1006
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,993
I wouldn't want you to get
cold feet, my darling.

1007
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,457
I am not your darling.

1008
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,836
See? What did I tell you?

1009
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,964
No backbone. All squishy.

1010
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:14,172
Hey, back off!
I'm a Carmen-only facility.

1011
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,506
Ramon, it's incredible.

1012
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,841
Everybody came.

1013
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,847
Except for that guy who
stayed, he had the sniffles.

1014
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,015
Oh, no, he's here.

1015
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,677
You're a true friend. Thank you.

1016
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,265
I had nothing to do with it.

1017
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,851
Well, then, Lovelace,
thank you so much.

1018
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,525
You got the wrong penguin.

1019
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,027
Hello! Hidy-do-dee-doody there.

1020
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,405
- I knew it.
- Ah, little Ear-rik.

1021
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,398
Excusing me.

1022
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:40,365
Okay. Friends of Sven, and
fans, and chums and Svenatics!

1023
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,373
We're not going to rest
until everybody fatty!

1024
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,995
Okay.

1025
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,283
Yeah!

1026
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,583
Hello!

1027
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,295
Heh, hey! You huddled masses.

1028
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:44,092
I bring you fish aplenty
courtesy of me!

1029
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,602
Yeah!
Give them the real, brother!

1030
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,600
Who is this guy?

1031
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,270
They call him Sven.
He's Sventastic.

1032
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,280
Let me revert back to what
I previously said before.

1033
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,907
- Ow!
- You're an idiot.

1034
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,780
- And guess what.
- What?

1035
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,617
He can carry more fish
than any penguin that ever...

1036
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,371
existed.

1037
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,281
Wow.

1038
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,291
And it's all due to his
amazingly large red beak.

1039
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,576
Impressive.

1040
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,996
Sven? Sven?

1041
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:14,955
<i>Ja? Ja?</i>

1042
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,420
There's someone down there
who's very special.

1043
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,927
And knowing Gloria,
she won't eat...

1044
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,962
- ...until everyone else has been fed.
- Aww.

1045
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,473
Do you think you could
take this down to her?

1046
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,429
Yeah, don't be silly.
Where is he?

1047
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,139
- No, she.
- Oh.

1048
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,179
There, surrounded
by the children.

1049
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,014
- That is your spouse?
- Yes.

1050
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,148
- Your spouse? Wow.
- Here. The fish.

1051
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:38,313
Oh, no, no, Mumbley.
She deserves the very best.

1052
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,104
A la carte.

1053
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,199
A la me!

1054
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,701
So you want some music?

1055
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:45,528
Nope.

1056
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:46,991
Let's have some music.

1057
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,493
<i>A-wake me
up before you go-go.</i>

1058
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,159
<i>Cause I'm not plannin'
on going solo.</i>

1059
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,328
<i>A-wake me up before you go-go.</i>

1060
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,495
Can you keep it down?

1061
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,663
<i>I wanna hit that high.</i>

1062
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,628
Just be quiet!

1063
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,589
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1064
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,679
<i>I'm never gonna give you up.</i>

1065
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,715
<i>Never gonna let you down.</i>

1066
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,010
- Whoa!
- A predator convention?

1067
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:09,847
Oh, no.

1068
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,512
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Will.

1069
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,772
- Guys? Guys.
- Will, don't go.

1070
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,686
- Get off.
- You'll never survive.

1071
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,851
- Please.
- Will? Stop!

1072
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,522
I think we should split up.

1073
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,067
Oh, well, I mean, if it's personal
space you want, how's that?

1074
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,954
No, no. I mean, really split up.

1075
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,365
But why?

1076
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,370
Ah, Bill, this is my life now.

1077
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,874
I can change.

1078
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,710
Be smaller, invisible.

1079
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:42,922
See? You're gonna be just fine.
I'll see you around, kiddo.

1080
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:51,723
Will? Please. Don't leave me.

1081
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,441
- Aah!
- Will! Will!

1082
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,523
Okay, let's take
you, you, not you, you.

1083
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:01,903
Oh. you!

1084
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,737
Please! Somebody! Anybody!

1085
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,242
I've lost my Will!

1086
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,277
I beg you!

1087
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,698
Bring back my Will!

1088
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:27,592
Mumbley!

1089
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,347
- Ah, Sven.
- Mumbley.

1090
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:33,886
- I feed your wife good-y, ja?
- Yeah, thanks.

1091
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,434
Okay, Sven, here we go.

1092
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,065
Okay, single file with a smile.

1093
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,936
So you must be Glorious.

1094
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,150
Heh, heh. And you must be Sven.

1095
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,064
So pleased to meet me. Really...

1096
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,904
I am delightful.

1097
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:54,581
I bring to you premium
seafood, yeah, from Mumbley.

1098
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,037
- There he is.
- Hey.

1099
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,493
Via Sven.

1100
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,911
Wow.

1101
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,050
Careful.

1102
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,131
That's my tongue.

1103
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,798
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right. Whoo!

1104
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:11,806
Oh, yeah.

1105
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,684
You know, if you are not
feeling a full Svensation...

1106
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,979
I can get you more.

1107
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:22,310
No, no, Sven. I'm sure there are
many others hungrier than me.

1108
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,484
Ah. Such a noble.
See you for supper?

1109
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,319
Um, I'm kind of busy.

1110
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,826
Heh. "Kind of busy."

1111
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,869
Oh, you're funny!

1112
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,327
Whoo!

1113
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,878
She is a hottie!

1114
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,002
Honey, are you okay?

1115
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:47,084
Are you sure he's not
related to Ramon'?

1116
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,503
Oh, you're funny!

1117
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,008
You shouldn't make fun of someone
just because they're different.

1118
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,302
Especially someone who's
come all this way...

1119
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,970
- ...to save us.
- You're right.

1120
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:02,061
- And when Sven teaches everyone to fly...
- It'll be up-uppity-up.

1121
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,397
- And out of there.
- You'll see.

1122
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,478
Hey, who turned off the fish?

1123
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:09,148
Hey, guys!
What's happening to the fish?

1124
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,776
Yoo-hoo!

1125
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,035
Fish-y friends!

1126
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,071
What is problem?

1127
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,705
The bird-eaters!

1128
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,379
Svensei! You must fly
on the wings of hope...

1129
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,257
and summon them to the aid
of our Emperor brothers!

1130
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,964
You know, I would love to,
but I just hurt my tongue.

1131
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,629
No.

1132
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,428
What?

1133
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,388
Ciao. Hmm.
Interesting.

1134
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,895
Someone better do something.
They're not stopping.

1135
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,182
Don't worry. I know exactly
how to get the attention...

1136
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,066
of our alien benefactors.

1137
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:00,248
Calm down. Deep breath.
Deep breath.

1138
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,322
Lovelace!

1139
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:22,831
Mumble, my man! I'm the mayor
me!

1140
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,162
This is great.

1141
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,338
Ah. Can you believe this?

1142
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,851
Where's there a
Will, there's a way out!

1143
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,277
Hm?

1144
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:08,915
Huh?

1145
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,813
Bill? Is that you?

1146
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:41,402
I don't know, Uncle Mumble.
They're noisy and they're messing with our ice.

1147
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,821
Atticus, they're building
us a way out of here.

1148
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,239
ATTICUS Oh.

1149
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:49,619
Everybody who said we'd never
get out of here, take a look!

1150
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,579
That's our ice road to freedom.

1151
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,965
It won't be long now, boys.

1152
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,963
I'll miss this place.

1153
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,629
So where will we live
when everybody gets out?

1154
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,764
We'll find somewhere new, sweetheart.
It's a big world.

1155
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,767
As long as we're together,
we already home.

1156
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:07,973
Yeah.

1157
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,095
Come on, everyone. Huddle up.

1158
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,991
Oh, no, no, no!

1159
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,339
Carmen, can't you see?

1160
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:21,923
Even nature decrees that
we be close together.

1161
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,575
Mm. Yeah.

1162
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,628
No, no, no.

1163
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,764
Oh, you are still here.

1164
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,807
And you're still here.

1165
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,226
- They're gone.
- What?

1166
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,144
A little bad
weather, they're gone!

1167
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,733
- What's going on?
- Who's gone?

1168
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,239
- The aliens!
- What?

1169
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,321
All of this flipperizing
for nothing!

1170
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,177
Our alien
benefactors...

1171
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,758
have abandoned us!

1172
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,140
They have abandoned us!

1173
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:52,767
Everybody! Everybody!

1174
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,930
The sea is frozen over, ja?

1175
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,939
Impossible for aliens to return!

1176
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,142
Too much ice-y. Too much ice-y.

1177
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:04,313
If the sea so far
away, how we gonna catch food?

1178
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,732
Yeah, what's the
point of us starving too?

1179
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,447
- I guess we should be going.
- We can't just leave them.

1180
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,486
- I think they're leaving.
- Who's leaving?

1181
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,997
- It appears that we...
- What is he saying?

1182
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,748
I regret to inform...

1183
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:19,207
we are no longer in the
catering businesses.

1184
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,294
Then who will
bring us fish?

1185
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,630
Some good questions
have no good answers.

1186
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,264
Sven, they can't leave!

1187
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,844
Not now!

1188
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,635
I so sorry, fluffy one.
If they stay...

1189
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,264
then they, too,
become not alive.

1190
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,309
Ah! I can't take it!
I can't take it any more!

1191
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,398
Out of my way!
I'm getting out of here!

1192
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,780
Whoa, that guy was crazy.

1193
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,415
Yeah. So am I.

1194
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,664
Come on, girls. Let's do it.

1195
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:00,372
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1196
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:03,505
Go, go, go!

1197
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,340
Sven. Teach them.
Teach them how to fly!

1198
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,254
Ear-rik, it's not that easy.

1199
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,177
Help them, Sven. Help them!

1200
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,763
But not all penguins
created equal, Ear-rik.

1201
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,678
- But you're a penguin.
- I a..

1202
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,851
I a little more than penguin.

1203
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,311
I a... I is a...

1204
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:24,396
Look! They're halfway there!

1205
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:25,355
Come on, Sven.

1206
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,986
Take them high to the sky!

1207
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,856
Do it, Sven!

1208
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,399
- Do it, brother!
- No, I can't!

1209
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:32,067
- Do it!
- They're penguins!

1210
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,155
You're a penguin!

1211
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,570
I'm a bird!

1212
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,778
You're a what?

1213
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,288
A bir... den.

1214
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,575
- What?
- Den. A burden.

1215
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,835
If <i>I</i> don't try. Ia?

1216
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,413
Ja, ja, after all...

1217
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,752
- it's just technique, right?
- Yes!

1218
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,382
Okay.

1219
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,177
Everybody! Head up!
Back straight!

1220
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:57,217
Okay. Feel the wind
beneath your wings!

1221
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,305
UP-uppity-up!

1222
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,144
Oh, boy.
Rotate flippers and sing, sing!

1223
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,620
This time...

1224
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,999
you going down, gravity!

1225
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,289
Ja, ja, okay. ja...

1226
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,163
Atticus, my man, I'm coming!

1227
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,251
Fly, Daddy...

1228
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,385
- ...fly!
- Fly!

1229
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,963
<i>Ja! Ja!</i>

1230
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:37,841
Come on, guys. Come on.

1231
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,136
If you want it, you must will it!
If you will it, it will be yours!

1232
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,397
on, Daddy.

1233
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,577
Today is a victory...

1234
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,372
for defeat.

1235
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,331
Oh, mighty Sven, you did
everything penguinly possible.

1236
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:08,042
I is not a penguin.
- What?

1237
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,002
I is a puffin.

1238
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:11,799
- Wow.
- Really?

1239
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,508
Ja, just a little puffin
bird run out of poof.

1240
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,671
No.

1241
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,261
Bravo, Lovelace.
You brought us a weird bird...

1242
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:22,644
and sold him as a penguin.
Ha, ha. Bravo, bravo.

1243
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,305
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you. I deserved it.

1244
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,105
I'm sorry, everybody.
I'm so sorry.

1245
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:37,033
But when I lose my homelands...

1246
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:41,321
I was very lonely
and very afraid-y.

1247
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:44,620
And then I meet you
and you believe...

1248
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:46,076
in me, Sven.

1249
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,456
Oh.
It was nice to have a family.

1250
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:53,299
Thank you.

1251
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:58,964
Eh, up-up-uppity

1252
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,459
Hey, guys, we should try this.

1253
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:33,714
Huh?

1254
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:35,458
Ah.

1255
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,047
Okay.

1256
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,179
Now, come on. Everyone together.

1257
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,476
- You know.
- Tippity-tap!

1258
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,057
- Boomedy-boom!
- Let's do it!

1259
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,939
Come on! Everybody!

1260
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,525
We're doomed and
they're dancing?

1261
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,060
Unbelievable.

1262
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,277
That's it.

1263
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:43,943
Huh?

1264
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,057
Atticus!

1265
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,691
- Mommy!
- Oh, Boadicea!

1266
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,397
Are you all right'?

1267
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:20,654
Help me!

1268
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:22,030
Erik!

1269
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,988
Help me now!
Help me now! He... Ah!

1270
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,839
I missed you like crazy.
- My baby.

1271
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,090
I missed you even more.

1272
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,628
Ear-rik.

1273
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,223
Hold on, Ear-rik. I'm on my way!

1274
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:53,896
Erik?

1275
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,274
Bite, Erik! Bite down hard!

1276
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,608
- Grab it, grab it!
- Use the hips.

1277
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,489
Now spin
around, spin around!

1278
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,116
Almost, almost.

1279
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,537
- There you go.
- Almost got it!

1280
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:13,957
Papa.

1281
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,789
It's okay, Erik.

1282
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:18,837
It's okay. I've got you.

1283
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,796
- They're tougher than we think, you know.
- Come on, Erik.

1284
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,470
Let's go get off this thing.

1285
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:28,006
Carmen! Carmen!

1286
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,594
Where is Carmen?

1287
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,010
Carmen!

1288
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:37,141
It's okay, Ramon!
I'm fine. I guess.

1289
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,059
I hate these long-distance
relationships!

1290
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:42,941
Yes?

1291
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:45,448
You must do me a favor.
I count to three.

1292
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,483
- You push me on two.
- He's gonna jump!

1293
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,493
- But don't tell me, okay?
- Hey, hey.

1294
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,279
- One. Two.
- Ramon, you're crazy!

1295
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:54,699
Carmen! I'm coming!

1296
01:14:56,826 --> 01:15:00,581
My name is Ramon. Ramon Carlos Garcia
Santa Maria La Niña Pinta Pacifico...

1297
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,007
Ramon.
I can't believe you did this.

1298
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:07,920
How could I not?

1299
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,055
But down here, we're doomed.

1300
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:14,890
A thousand lifetimes up there is nothing
to this one exquisite moment by your side.

1301
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,814
You are my world entire.

1302
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,943
You're beautiful.

1303
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:23,478
Only on the outside.

1304
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:24,896
No!

1305
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,281
Why didn't I see this before?

1306
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,737
You're really beautiful.

1307
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,025
You really think so?

1308
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,364
Absolutely.

1309
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:35,828
Ramon, my fallen angel.
You chased me until I caught you.

1310
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,251
Ay, Ramon, the earth is moving.

1311
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:47,589
I know. It's amazing.

1312
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:49,800
No, it's moving for real.
Move! Move!

1313
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,386
Keep going. Don't look back.

1314
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:08,982
Mumble, that thing's
on the edge!

1315
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,024
Keep trying!

1316
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:11,738
All it
needs is a nudge!

1317
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,278
We can do this!

1318
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:14,286
Okay.

1319
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,599
- It's just not enough.
- Not enough.

1320
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:36,759
Uh, Mumbley.

1321
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:39,145
- We're not big enough.
- Yeah. My feet hurt.

1322
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,431
- Excuse me. Mumbley. Mumbley.
- Yeah?

1323
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:43,774
There's a guy named
Lars Gavunsterson.

1324
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,482
I used to dance with his
sister Girta, and I...

1325
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,404
Well, anyway, we were
two-time national champion.

1326
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,611
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- Amateur division, so...

1327
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:54,072
Um...
Look, could I give it a shot?

1328
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,533
Sure, sure. Of course.

1329
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,789
Attentions! Attentions...

1330
01:16:58,948 --> 01:16:59,870
everybody!

1331
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,205
Mumbley's foot is
very, very hurt-y.

1332
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,415
Yeah,
like your brain.

1333
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,705
But I have
song and dance...

1334
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,214
from my homelands.

1335
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:10,001
It's in Svenish, so join
in as best you can.

1336
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:13,839
Okay! And a-nooney, and
a-dooney and a-vooney!

1337
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,096
Get off!

1338
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:28,610
Come on!

1339
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:38,655
Help!

1340
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,586
Come on, son. Come on.

1341
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:47,746
Where are we going?

1342
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,382
To find us a lot more oomph.

1343
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,788
Where am I?

1344
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,956
Who turned out the lights?

1345
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,744
Is this the end?

1346
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,620
I should make out my will.

1347
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:30,630
I, Willy Williams, leave
everything to my imagination...

1348
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:34,384
Oh, no. Imagination, it's
the second sign of madness.

1349
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,386
If only I'd listened to Bill.

1350
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,469
Oh, Bill. I'm so sorry!

1351
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:40,804
That's okay, Will.

1352
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,640
You were right.
I should have stayed with the swarm.

1353
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,054
No. You were right.

1354
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,139
Oh, great!
I'm talking to myself.

1355
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,353
You're not mad, Will.

1356
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:51,644
Now I'm seeing things.
What's going on inside my head?!

1357
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,733
- Will?
- Please, make it stop!

1358
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:54,772
Will!

1359
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:57,529
Ow!

1360
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,494
Bill? Is it really you?

1361
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:03,748
Well, there's only one of me in all the world.
You taught me that.

1362
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,658
Aw, Bill! What are the chances?

1363
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,826
About one in a krillion, Will.

1364
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,711
Quiet, you two.
I'm trying to sleep.

1365
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,668
Hey, everyone! It's Will!

1366
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,047
Wow, it's him!

1367
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,800
It's wee Willy Williams!

1368
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,256
I thought
he'd be taller.

1369
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,046
He's back! Will's back!

1370
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:22,846
Welcome home, Will.

1371
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,601
But how did you find them?

1372
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,019
They found me.

1373
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,430
I was on my last nine legs.

1374
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,189
I was such a fool, Bill.

1375
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,941
Will, you're a legend.

1376
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,274
Those days are gone, my friend.
The carnivore is over.

1377
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,030
No. It's because of
you we're all here.

1378
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:37,906
It is?

1379
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:42,070
I told them how the world really works.
How there were predators, how we had to adapt.

1380
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:45,365
I led them here, under the great ice.
No one can find us here.

1381
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:49,377
But we're still at the bottom of the
food chain with no significant purpose.

1382
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:51,082
Well, we all have a purpose.

1383
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:53,043
Yours is to change the world.

1384
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,707
What possible difference...

1385
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:55,965
could one krill make?

1386
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,470
Wait and see, Will.
You wait and see.

1387
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,769
- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?

1388
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,562
Don't know, but it sure is ugly.

1389
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,823
Notice, boys, the witty
riposte as weapon?

1390
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:20,733
Right. Outside, now!

1391
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,242
We are outside.

1392
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,027
- Come on, then.
- No...

1393
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,162
- you come on.
- Excuse me. Bryan?

1394
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,949
Down here.

1395
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:31,244
Ah, g'day, chief.
What are you doing here?

1396
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,583
Bryan, I need a favor.
A big one.

1397
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:35,123
For you, champ, anything.

1398
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,916
I need you to come
to Emperor Land.

1399
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,255
Bring as many of your
kind as you can.

1400
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,795
- Why?
- To dance.

1401
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,467
You know...

1402
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,262
Now, why would I wanna do that?

1403
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,301
- To free the penguin nation.
- Oh, yeah?

1404
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:49,095
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.

1405
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,933
The entire population
is trapped.

1406
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,440
Uh-huh.
- By huge walls of ice and snow.

1407
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:54,600
Hey! Bryan!

1408
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:58,613
Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but
you've come at the worst possible time.

1409
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,523
Maybe after winter
or something, okay?

1410
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,487
No, that's too late.
Way too late.

1411
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,276
Bryan! You gonna fight or what?

1412
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,161
You said you owe me one.

1413
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,288
But right now, I got
problems of me own.

1414
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:12,202
Everyone's cranky, looking for biff.
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.

1415
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,457
If you don't come now,
multitudes will die.

1416
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:18,420
Here we go. You saying it's my fault now?
Whatever's happening to you penguins...

1417
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:19,708
don't blame it on me.

1418
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,635
I'm not.
But you can help save them.

1419
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:25,139
Listen, fella, you look after your
kind, and I'll look after mine.

1420
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:28,016
If I thought like that, I would
have left you in that hole.

1421
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:30,598
That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit.
Get off my beach!

1422
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:32,479
Wayne, now I'm really
gonna hurt you.

1423
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:33,685
I saved your life!

1424
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,726
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off...

1425
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,769
or I'm gonna turn carnivore...

1426
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,483
with a craving for penguin.

1427
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,899
- But...
- The only "butt" I wanna see is yours...

1428
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,033
walking away.

1429
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,493
Come on, son.
We're wasting precious time.

1430
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,329
There's nothing for us here.

1431
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:05,671
Now, where was I?

1432
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,135
- Right here.
- Oh, yeah.

1433
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,174
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?

1434
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,685
I don't know,
but it sure is ugly.

1435
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:19,359
No, Pa. This is so unfair.

1436
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,615
<i>After all
you have done.</i>

1437
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:29,988
<i>You really deserve better.</i>

1438
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,039
<i>Nothing makes sense
in this world.</i>

1439
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:42,212
<i>It's all a big pile of crazy.</i>

1440
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:54,262
<i>And the kings are all fools.</i>

1441
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:55,972
Hm.

1442
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:59,058
<i>Where is.</i>

1443
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:03,229
<i>The honor When</i> a.

1444
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:07,400
<i>Solemn promise.</i>

1445
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:10,570
<i>Is just</i> a <i>pretty lie?</i>

1446
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,451
<i>And the mighty mock.</i>

1447
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,584
The courage.

1448
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:22,044
<i>Of the humble?</i>

1449
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,926
<i>Although he's just.</i>

1450
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:30,180
<i>An ordinary penguin.</i>

1451
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:35,974
<i>My daddy taught me.</i>

1452
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:37,725
<i>You don't need.</i>

1453
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:42,109
<i>To be colossal.</i>

1454
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,062
<i>To be a great.</i>

1455
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,778
<i>Heart.</i>

1456
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,072
<i>You don't need.</i>

1457
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:55,536
<i>To fly.</i>

1458
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:59,622
<i>To be awesome.</i>

1459
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:04,290
<i>My hero.</i>

1460
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:09,302
<i>My father</i>

1461
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,989
<i>Rolling, rolling, rolling.</i>

1462
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,578
<i>Keep moving, moving, moving.</i>

1463
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,664
<i>Keep them doggies moving.</i>

1464
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:44,171
<i>Rawhide.</i>

1465
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:49,005
<i>Rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather.</i>

1466
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:53,513
<i>Wishin' me girl was by me side.</i>

1467
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,262
Oh, my goodness.

1468
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,677
Mumble.

1469
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:00,847
Hey, I know that guy.
That's Bryan.

1470
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,310
<i>Ride 'em in.</i>

1471
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:07,478
<i>Rawhide.</i>

1472
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:09,404
Okay.
This 'berg needs to topple.

1473
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:13,075
Find yourself an elephant
seal and show them the moves.

1474
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:16,282
Penguin, how's a bit of fancy
dancing gonna move that?

1475
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,539
With enough oomph, we
can shove enough snow.

1476
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,199
Pack it in behind. It'll go.

1477
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,959
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!

1478
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,630
Just try it. Hit the beat hard!
And together!

1479
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,586
I know how to hit
things hard, okay?

1480
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:30,251
- And I'm telling you...
- Come on.

1481
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:33,591
The impact force of compact ice
under pressure is equiv...

1482
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:36,052
Just give it a go, you big wuss!

1483
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,466
Wayne!

1484
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,243
- Hello.
- Yeah.

1485
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,618
Here we go.

1486
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,406
Now you're talking, Bryan!

1487
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,081
You with me, boys?

1488
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,090
Oh, yeah!

1489
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,459
Pressure.

1490
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:14,761
<i>Pushing down on me.</i>

1491
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,680
<i>Pressing down on you.</i>

1492
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,511
<i>No man asks for.</i>

1493
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,596
<i>Under pressure.</i>

1494
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,182
<i>That tears a nation down.</i>

1495
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,347
<i>Splits</i> a <i>family in two.</i>

1496
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,774
<i>Puts people on streets.</i>

1497
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:29,609
<i>People on streets.</i>

1498
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:33,898
<i>People on streets.</i>

1499
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:40,454
<i>It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about.</i>

1500
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,040
<i>Watching some good
friends scream.</i>

1501
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,241
<i>Let me out.</i>

1502
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,168
<i>Pray tomorrow.</i>

1503
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,626
<i>Take me higher.</i>

1504
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,339
<i>Pray tomorrow.</i>

1505
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:55,510
<i>Take me higher</i>

1506
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,055
You hear that?
They're doing it again.

1507
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:04,136
- Doing what?
- This.

1508
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,232
Fascinating. What is it?

1509
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,142
I have no idea.

1510
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:11,855
Wow! What's it for?

1511
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,443
Perhaps it's a momentary relief from
the existential terrors of existence.

1512
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:18,905
- Oh. What?
- It brings out my happy.

1513
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,497
Oh, yes, indeed!

1514
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,001
Hey, Bryan, what are you doing?

1515
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:35,839
Sometimes you gotta
back up to go forward.

1516
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:39,756
<i>Tell me why, tell me why.</i>

1517
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:43,016
<i>Give ourselves one more chance.</i>

1518
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,179
<i>Why can't we give ourselves
One more chance?</i>

1519
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:51,395
<i>Why can't we give love
Give love, give love.</i>

1520
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:52,684
<i>Give love.</i>

1521
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,523
<i>Every day.</i>

1522
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,438
<i>Every night, every hour.</i>

1523
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:58,528
Yeah, come on! Take it higher!

1524
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,819
Come on, come on! Give love, y'all!
Give love, y'all!

1525
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,864
Hey, get down here.

1526
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,532
Yeah.

1527
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,700
- Come on!
- Every step counts.

1528
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,869
<i>To care for.</i>

1529
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:16,418
<i>The people on The
edge of the night.</i>

1530
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:19,553
<i>And love dares you.</i>

1531
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,805
<i>To change our way.</i>

1532
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,715
<i>Of caring.</i>

1533
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,805
<i>About ourselves.</i>

1534
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:28,057
<i>This is.</i>

1535
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,268
<i>Our last dance.</i>

1536
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:34,568
<i>This is our last dance.</i>

1537
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:39,232
<i>This is ourselves.</i>

1538
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:42,868
<i>Creatures of the world unite Strength
in numbers, we can get it right.</i>

1539
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,031
<i>One time.</i>

1540
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:44,740
Yeah!

1541
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:33,498
- Be careful, Ramon.
- I'm coming. I'm right behind you.

1542
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,459
Ramon! Amigos!

1543
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,298
I'm getting "emotioable" again.

1544
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,551
- Come on, Ramon.
- Coming, baby!

1545
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,212
- Hi, Erik.
- Hello, Bo.

1546
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,388
Good job, Erik.
You too, Uncle Mumble.

1547
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,049
You really something
special, brother.

1548
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,809
One nation, Mumble.
One nation.

1549
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,847
Irie, walking out now, Mumble.
One nation.

1550
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:54,014
So, boys...

1551
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,308
- Mommy!
- Gloria.

1552
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,234
Where's my hug?

1553
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:02,238
Oh, my babies.

1554
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:04,240
Come on, nippers.
Let's get youse home.

1555
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,821
Hey, Bryan.

1556
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:07,068
Cheers.

1557
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:10,489
No worries, penguin. No worries.

1558
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,669
Yeah.

1559
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,497
No worries.

1560
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,545
Ja, the Svend.
