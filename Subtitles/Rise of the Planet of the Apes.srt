1
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:09,270
Hey, okay ...
now...

2
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:12,873
let's go again.

3
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:19,207
Which one's this, number9?
- Yeah, number 9.  Bright eyes.

4
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:22,157
Are you watching this?

5
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,023
This, this is unbelieveable.

6
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:32,498
Oh, my God.

7
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:35,242
Oh, my God.

8
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,843
How many moves was that?
- 20.

9
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,259
The perfect score is 15.
God, what, what are you giving her?

10
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:45,605
Hey, give me that video!

11
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,839
Chimp number 9, just one dose.

12
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,495
Couldn't I see you later?
- We're good to go.

13
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,876
I'm going to call you back. Yeah,
all right.  Thanks, Bye.

14
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,701
112, it works.

15
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,461
On just the one primate?
- One is all we need.

16
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:06,264
Full cognitive recovery.

17
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,182
We're ready.

18
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,858
Look, are you sure you're
not rushing this?

19
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,250
I've been working on this for
five and a half years.

20
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:16,663
The data is clear.
We're ready, Steven.

21
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,036
All I need is your approval
for human trials.

22
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,265
Oh, for this, you're going to need
the Board's approval.

23
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,790
There's a lot of money riding
on this, Will.

24
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:26,831
You only get one shot.
- One shot is all I need.

25
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:30,016
[sighs]

26
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:33,714
All right. I'll need to see
all the research.

27
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,773
You got it!

28
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:36,582
Oh, and Will ...
- Yeah?

29
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,236
Keep your personal emotions
out of it.

30
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,834
These people invest in results,
not dreams.

31
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,365
Okay!

32
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:50,964
Meet chimp 9. Here she's tasking at
what is called the Lucas Tower.

33
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:54,133
The object of which is to move the tower
from peg to peg

34
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:57,813
without placing a larger block
on top of a smaller block.

35
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:02,005
As expected, she was unable
to complete the puzzle at all.

36
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:08,157
Then, we gave her what we call,
ALZ-112, a gene therapy

37
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:13,102
that allows the brain to create its
own cells in order to repair itself.

38
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:16,116
In biology, this is
called neurogenesis.

39
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,072
Here, at GEN-SYS,

40
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:21,745
we call it a cure to Alzheimer's.

41
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,068
Donnie, you get her ready?
- She's got stage fright.

42
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,534
Is that what it is?

43
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:35,897
Hey, ape.

44
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:41,591
She's gonna break my arm!

45
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:44,008
Bright Eyes!
Let go!

46
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:49,019
Are you all right?

47
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,083
We're ready to move
on to the next phase.

48
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,376
Human trials.

49
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:05,129
Here you go, Bright Eyes.
It's your favorite fizzy soda.

50
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:06,239
Come on, let's go, Donnie.

51
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:07,767
We should have her downstairs already.

52
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:10,664
Okay. Good girl!

53
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:14,022
Come on out, girl, that's right.

54
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,874
That's for you.

55
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,972
Got her!

56
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,236
Jesus!

57
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:28,669
Donnie, open the cage!
Open up! Open up!

58
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:32,473
Going to sedate her!

59
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,109
No, no!
- Get the door!

60
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:43,388
No, no! Hold it! Now!

61
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,635
Call help! Donnie, Donnie!

62
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,770
There have been absolutely no side
effects associated

63
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,204
with 112, with one exception.

64
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,151
For some reason,

65
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,369
the chimps irises exhibit
flecks of green.

66
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:58,204
Actually, we first noticed it in chimp 9,

67
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:00,378
hence her nickname, Bright Eyes.

68
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:02,122
You'll see when we bring her in.

69
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,438
Move!

70
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:11,236
In theory, this therapy
can be used

71
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:14,320
to treat a wide range
of brain disorders.

72
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:20,950
It's virtually limitless.

73
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:23,433
As are the potential profits.

74
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:26,313
which is why we are confident that

75
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,467
you will vote to approve human trials.

76
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,202
No, no, no!

77
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,922
Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Jacobs I am begging you,

78
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:00,846
I am begging you, not to do this.

79
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:02,048
Look, it costs a small fortune to

80
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,360
run lab workups on all of those chimps

81
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,153
only to tell me what I already know,

82
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,199
that they are contaminated.

83
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,397
There are lives at stake here.

84
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,542
These, these are animals
with personalities,

85
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,533
with attachments.

86
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,113
Attachments?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:19,216
I run a a business,
not a petting zoo.

88
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:22,722
Find the most cost effective way
to put those apes down.

89
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,575
I can't do that.

90
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:25,202
You're the chimp handler.

91
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:26,351
Handle it.

92
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:28,456
Steven!

93
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:30,194
Well, that was fun!

94
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,575
They've taken the 112.

95
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,165
Board has rejected your proposal.

96
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:34,960
They've chosen to advance other programs.

97
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,780
Well, there must be something
that you can do.

98
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,252
Yes. There is, I could fire you.

99
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:41,448
Believe me, we talked about it.

100
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:43,806
We have five years of conclusive data.

101
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:45,275
Parade all the data you want,

102
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:48,421
you will never convince anyone
to invest another dime.

103
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,882
This drug has the potential
to save lives!

104
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,939
Bankrupt this company, more like.

105
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:56,858
I swear, you know everything
about the human brain

106
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:59,578
except the way it works.

107
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,571
Go back to the drawing board
on the 112.

108
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:07,990
Start again in
molecular development.

109
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,359
Find a way to get there
before someone else does.

110
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:14,343
And, clean up this mess.

111
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:33,088
Franklin!

112
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,502
It's very small. She must have been

113
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,352
pregnant when we brought her in.

114
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,672
So that's why ...

115
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:51,205
She wasn't being aggressive.
She was just being protective.

116
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,328
She thought we were going to
hurt her baby.

117
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:58,024
I would take it myself,

118
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:02,123
but my brother-in-law works for security.
He'd rat me out in a seceond.

119
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:04,770
What, you want me to take it home?

120
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,617
I can't take care of a monkey.

121
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:09,380
He's not a monkey! He's an ape.
- Franklin ...

122
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,862
You know, it's just for a couple days until

123
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,177
I find a sanctuary.  That's all I need.

124
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:14,124
Franklin, no!

125
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,406
Look, this isn't my responsibility.

126
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:18,380
This, this is company property.

127
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:22,416
Okay ...

128
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:24,185
I tell you what, Doc.

129
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,975
Jacobs made me put down the other 12.

130
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:28,712
I'm done.

131
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,676
Be my guest.

132
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,477
Hey!
- Oh, hi.

133
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:02,435
You look beat.
- Yeah. How's he doing?

134
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:05,169
Well, he has good days and bad days.

135
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:07,619
Today, not so good, although he

136
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:09,816
has been quoting Shakespeare.

137
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:13,075
Oh, you got a pet?

138
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,337
Uh, it's just a temporary house guest.

139
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,257
Well, maybe that'll be good for him.

140
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,257
Good night!

141
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:26,921
[discordant piano playing]

142
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,462
Hi, Dad!

143
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:39,756
Dad?

144
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,870
Will! I didn't hear
you come in.

145
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,942
Today's the day, right?

146
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:48,558
You thought I'd forget?

147
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,750
You have a big test today, right?

148
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,747
Chemistry?

149
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:56,553
Hey, Dad ...

150
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:59,080
You want to see something?
- What?

151
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,306
What is that? Is he injured?

152
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,477
No, I think that's a birthmark.

153
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:23,601
"As for Caesar, kneel down,
kneel down and wonder!"

154
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,602
Yeah, don't get too attached.

155
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,390
He's a cute little guy, isn't he?

156
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:18,672
Where's my car keys?

157
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:22,341
My car keys, where'd you put 'em?

158
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:27,179
Dad, ... you a, you don't drive anymore.

159
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,419
I know that.

160
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:34,694
Here ...

161
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:39,529
Why don't you feed him.
Can you do that?

162
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:40,995
Of course, I can..

163
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:52,025
Will! ... Look at this!

164
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:59,511
How old is he?
Like, a day old? Two days old?

165
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:00,624
Yeah ...

166
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:04,176
He's a smart one, isn't he?

167
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:07,002
What are you going to name him?

168
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,457
I do not know ...

169
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:21,599
Three years later

170
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:24,445
Right away, Caesar displayed signs
of intelligence heightened intelligence,

171
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:27,988
so I kept him.   And, brought
my work home.

172
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:43,855
By 18 months,
Caesar was signing up to 24 words.

173
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:53,051
By age two,
Caesar completing puzzles and models

174
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:56,277
designed for children
eight years and up.

175
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,217
At age three,

176
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,587
Caesar continues to show cognative skills

177
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,051
that far exceed
that of his human counterpart.

178
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,241
Home ... home.

179
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,098
He completed the Lucas Tower in
15 moves, a perfect score.

180
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:21,793
I maintain my hypothesis that:
A. The green in his eyes indicate

181
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:26,063
that the ALZ-112 was passed
genetically from mother to son

182
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:30,344
and, B. That in the absence of damaged
cells that need to be replacing

183
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:36,536
the drug in his system has radically
boosted healthy brain functioning.

184
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:40,601
And, ...

185
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:44,300
he plays chess pretty well.

186
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:48,137
[shouting]

187
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:51,385
Dad!

188
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:55,333
I'm sorry.
- I can't do this, anymore.

189
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,962
He belongs in a home.

190
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:59,245
This is no way for him to live.

191
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:07,620
No way to live?

192
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:11,898
I broke my lamp ...

193
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:08,184
It'll make you better, Dad.

194
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,666
[Shhh...]

195
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:49,400
Dad!

196
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:51,818
Dad!

197
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,589
[exuberant piano playing]

198
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,352
Todd, come inside for breakfast.

199
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,632
I'll need to keep track of
what I take from the lab,

200
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:41,539
although I don't see you needing
more than one treatment a month.

201
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,201
Something amazing has happened!

202
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:47,293
I'll need a blood test,
a scan and the dosage ...

203
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,035
carefully monitored.

204
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,954
Now, if I can sneak ...

205
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,059
Will!  I'm not sick, anymore!

206
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,067
It was nothing, Dad.

207
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:59,507
Ceasar.  Where's Caesar?
I want to see him.

208
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,340
Caesar!

209
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:15,543
Caesar!

210
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:17,223
He can't have gone far.

211
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:19,289
Caesar!

212
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,081
Daddy!

213
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:23,614
Caesar!

214
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,717
Get out of here! Get out!

215
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:29,678
Get out!

216
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:35,008
Hey, hey, hey ...
Enough! Enough!

217
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,675
It doesn't matter what you do.

218
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:38,910
If I catch that animal anywhere
near my house or my kids, again ...

219
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:40,343
He's not dangerous.

220
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,076
It won't happen again.

221
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,665
Damn right, it won't!

222
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:47,722
Come on, Dad.
- He, he just wanted to play.

223
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,856
Stay in the house!
Daddy's got you.

224
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,573
I told you not to go out without us.

225
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:58,034
It's okay ...

226
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:01,747
How bad is it?

227
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:03,931
I do not know.

228
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,750
He likes you.
- Uh, huh.

229
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:28,703
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.

230
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:30,327
Then, we can go get a treat.

231
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:33,024
I'm thinking, ice cream.

232
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:39,612
Good idea!

233
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,841
You taught him to sign?

234
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:46,100
Just, handful of things, basic stuff.

235
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:50,063
What's he saying?

236
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:50,895
Nothing.

237
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:55,159
So, when do you think we should come back?

238
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:55,680
Well, you won't need to come back.

239
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:59,166
because, um,
the stiches are dissolveable.

240
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,544
I would just say, watch for
signs of infection.

241
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:03,610
Fever ... redness ...

242
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:08,557
Okay, what's he saying, now?

243
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:09,898
Um,

244
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:11,341
well, ...

245
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,398
he thinks that you and I should
have dinner together.

246
00:21:19,898 --> 00:21:20,898
(chuckling) I ... know ...

247
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,226
Caesar! Come on!

248
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:29,531
Good to see you, again, Caroline.

249
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,669
You coming, Caesar?

250
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:33,479
So, what's your secret?

251
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:37,224
Oh, I can't take any credit.
It's in his genes.

252
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:39,217
I think you're being very modest.

253
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:40,207
He's pretty amazing.

254
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:46,146
I think you've built a pretty good
home for Caesar, here.

255
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:50,339
You know he won't stay this way for long.

256
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:52,937
He's going to soon grow into

257
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:54,705
a large, powerful, animal.

258
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,329
Come here!

259
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,463
How's he been doing?

260
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:00,857
Okay, I think.

261
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,892
I love chimpanzees.

262
00:22:03,942 --> 00:22:06,538
I'm also afraid of them.

263
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:10,006
And, it's appropriate to
be afraid of them.

264
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,965
Caesar will never hurt anyone.

265
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:16,728
He's happy here.

266
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:18,584
Yeah, I see that.

267
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,864
We can at least give him some open space?

268
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:25,132
- Yeah. That would prpbably be a good idea.

269
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,610
I know a place right across the bridge,

270
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,774
the Redwoods.  It's a paradise.

271
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:50,805
Come on!

272
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,161
Come here.

273
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:55,410
Doesn't need a leash!
He'll be fine. Come on!

274
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:58,703
Just to be safe.
- Come on, Caesar!

275
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,099
It's the redwoods.

276
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,148
Caesar!

277
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:16,178
All right.

278
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:21,383
If I take this off you can
not leave my sight.

279
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:23,551
I'll never find you again.

280
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:25,482
Okay.

281
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,493
What's this?
- What's he doing?

282
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,366
I don't believe that!
- What?

283
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:34,720
He's asking your permission.

284
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,026
It's a supplicating gesture.

285
00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:39,555
It's okay.

286
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,593
Come on, Caesar!
Off you go!

287
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:56,390
Look at him go!

288
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:58,588

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,301
There you are ...

293
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,536
Caesar!

294
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,014
Come on, Caesar, climb!

295
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,874
Go higher!

296
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,849
Climb!

297
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:42,288
Be careful!

298
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:46,567
Caesar, be careful!

301

What's going on, buddy?

302
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,475
Give some love.

303
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:47,890
Come on, honey.

304
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,735
Is that a chimpanzee?

Come on!

312
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:15,099
It's all right. Come on.

313
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:20,643
Come on!

314
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:26,055
Let's go.

315
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:30,690
Are you getting in?

316
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,395
Caesar ...

317
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:52,281
You okay, pal?

318
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:57,541
Are you pet? ... No.

319
00:26:57,592 --> 00:27:00,852
You're not a pet.

320
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,124
I am your father.

321
00:27:14,512 --> 00:27:16,196
What is Caesar?

322
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:20,656
Okay ...

323
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,932
Caesar, this is where I work.

324
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,750
This is were you were born.

325
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:37,758
Your mother was here
with other chimpanzees.

326
00:27:40,485 --> 00:27:44,345
But she's not here, anymore ...

327
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:45,122
so ...

328
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:49,938
... that's why I took home
to live with me.

329
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,301
Yeah.

330
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:02,106
Your mother's dead.

331
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,692
The thing is, she was given medicine,

332
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,142
like the medicine I give to Charles.

333
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,870
She passed it on to you.

334
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,557
That's why you're so smart.

335
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,409
Let's take him home.

336
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:40,446
Come on, explain it to me.

337
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:41,173
All right.

338
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:45,166
I snuck him out of the lab
to save his life.

339
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,157
I had no idea that the effects had
been transfered vertically from his mother.

340
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:53,134
But, since then, he's been displaying
incredible signs intelligence.

341
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:57,696
I designed the 112 to repair,
but Caesar's gone way beyond that.

342
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:00,656
Here's his IQ from last year.

343
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:03,470
Since then, it's doubled.

344
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,710
This is all wrong.

345
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:09,900
My father was on gone
this drug brought him back.

346
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,856
You never saw how bad he was.

347
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:13,308
He has his life again.

348
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,571
And, what about Caesar?
- What about him?

349
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,359
How does he fit in?

350
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:21,801
With me, ... with us ...

351
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:23,108
Listen, ...

352
00:29:23,158 --> 00:29:25,708
I know it has been hard for you,

353
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,222
but you are trying to control things
that were never meant to be controlled.

354
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:30,526
The 112 works.

355
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:33,076
Do you realize how you sound?

356
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:35,411
All I'm saying is
this is a good thing.

357
00:29:35,604 --> 00:29:37,748
Caesar's proof of that.

358
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:39,188
So's my father.

359
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,103
Caesar, eat your food.

360
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,732
Dad, are you okay?

361
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:15,551
Yeah, I'm fine.

362
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:25,800
Antibodies.

363
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,182
His system has found a way
to fight the 112 virus

364
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:31,723
so that it can't deliver
its therapy.

365
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:35,951
My father's disease is going
to return with a vengence.

366
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,434
Stop!

367
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,316
Stop, right now!

368
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:36,392
Hey! Get out there!
Get out of that car!

369
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:40,356
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my car!

370
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:42,587
I said, get out of my car!

371
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:45,384
I'm a pilot! I've got to get
to the airport!

372
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:47,611
How am I gonna get there now, huh?

373
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:50,099
Answer the God-damn question!
What were you doing?

374
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:52,331
I have a car just exactly ...

375
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:54,887
I'm done ...
the police can handle it.

376
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:58,676
Stay right there!
You aren't going nowhere, mister!

377
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,639
You will pay!

378
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,610
This is your problem,
you make it happen!

379
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,764
... not through with you!
Stay right there!

380
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:55,846
Caesar, stop!

381
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:57,934
Daddy!

382
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:09,043
Caesar!

383
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:21,275
It's okay.

384
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:23,886
It's okay.

385
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,803
He didn't mean it.

386
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:28,318
It's okay ...

387
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:54,433
Hey, hey, take that thing off of him!

388
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:57,442
Take that thing off of him!

389
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,772
Look, I'll take him in, okay?

390
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,784
No, he's under court orders.
We can't do that.

391
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,310
It's fine! Let him.

392
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,668
Bring him in when you're ready.

393
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:07,324
Take it off.

394
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:08,878
Thank you!

395
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:12,348
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar,
... Caesar, Caesar.

396
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,976
Not right now.
It's going to be okay.

397
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:18,465
Let's just see what it's like
inside, okay.

398
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,471
Come on, Caesar.

399
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:22,248
Let's go.

400
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:29,267
Come on, ... trust me.

401
00:34:44,154 --> 00:34:45,794
It's okay.

402
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:49,954
Go.

403
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:00,778
He hasn't spent any time with other chimps.

404
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:02,592
Oh, we're used to that.

405
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:05,667
He'll be a little skittish at first,
but we'll integrate him.

406
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,384
You'd be surprised
how quick they adapt.

407
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,287
We provide a stimulating environment.

408
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:17,217
He's going to thrive here.

409
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:19,677
Come, let's do some paperwork.

410
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:22,554
Make sure you lock that door
when you come in.

411
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:48,174
Caesar!

412
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,884
You'll be okay!

413
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:55,021
Everything's going to be okay!

414
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:56,726
Don't be scared.

415
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:59,029
You're going to stay here, now.

416
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:06,135
No ... Not going home right now.

417
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:07,250
It's OK.

418
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,572
The longer you drag out the good-byes,

419
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:13,193
the harder it is.

420
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,911
Can I sign that later?

421
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:20,557
You'll probably miss him more than
he'll miss you.

422
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:22,813
You'd best give him a couple of weeks
to get used too the place.

423
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,176
Will, we have to go.

424
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:26,889
We have to go home.

425
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:30,303
Coming back soon, okay?

426
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:37,968
Just call ahead, before you do.

427
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:43,788
Hey, over here!

428
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:47,525
Hey, I can get you out!

429
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:54,145
Come on!  Over here!

430
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:09,608
Hey, down here.

431
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:24,025
Stupid monkey ...

432
00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:51,423
So you? Come on, make it!

433
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,307
Court order hasn't been filed,
so it's not in the system.

434
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,336
Once it comes through,

435
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,770
it will take about 90 days before
you receive an appeal date.

436
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,423
90 days?
- Yes, sir, 90 days.

437
00:38:06,547 --> 00:38:08,189
You'll be notified by mail.

438
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:10,958
Here's what's going to happen.

439
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,984
You're going to go back to your computer,
you know, shift things around

440
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:16,747
and you're going to get me a date for
my appeal, this week, you got it?

441
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,749
I can't help you.

442
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,447
All right, then we have a problem.

443
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,184
Because, I'm not moving until you do.

444
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:26,391
90 days, sir. Be thankful
you're talking about court dates.

445
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:29,059
You're lucky they
didn't put that animal down.

446
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,327
I promised to get him back
soon, Dad.

447
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:38,969
Dad?

448
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:48,153
My father's immune system
continues to reject the 112 virus,

449
00:38:48,288 --> 00:38:51,127
rendering the gene therapy obsolete.

450
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:56,607
his health is deteriorating,
and the disease is progressing rapidly.

451
00:38:57,512 --> 00:38:59,848
I need a more aggressive virus strain,

452
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:02,415
a faster delivery method,

453
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:05,028
because at this rate ...

454
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,484
I can't lose them both.

455
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,970
I won't lose them both.

456
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:26,507
Hi .... Can we talk?

457
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:29,095
Make it fast.  I've got a meeting.

458
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,606
The ten years you have been
running GEN-SYS,

459
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:36,783
how many drugs have come down the pipeline
that could save millions of lives?

460
00:39:36,897 --> 00:39:39,062
That could change everything?

461
00:39:39,154 --> 00:39:40,677
What are you talking about?

462
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:42,679
The ALZ-112.

463
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,674
What happened to you, Will?

464
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,455
You used to be the star of this lab.
Now, you hardly ever show

465
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:52,551
and when you do, you waste your time
and that of your team's

466
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,494
fixating on a drug

467
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:57,580
that, after what happened,
is never ever going to get approved.

468
00:39:57,704 --> 00:39:59,590
The 112 is dangerous, Will,

469
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,031
and it doesn't work.

470
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,495
I treated my father with it.

471
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:04,620
It does work.

472
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:07,978
You did, what?

473
00:40:08,028 --> 00:40:09,301
You did, what!?

474
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:11,606
Beat the disease, like we predicted.

475
00:40:11,734 --> 00:40:12,267
Brilliant.

476
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:13,856
There's been a complication.

477
00:40:13,984 --> 00:40:15,449
Well, does it work or doesn't it?

478
00:40:15,486 --> 00:40:18,039
My father's disease eventually
outran the cure.

479
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:19,585
Oh, for goodness sake.

480
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,959
The immune system produced antibodies
to beat the viral component,

481
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:24,518
but it will work.

482
00:40:24,624 --> 00:40:26,857
I've have already developed a virus strain

483
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:28,872
that I think will be more aggressive.

484
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,147
You think?

485
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:32,675
Just, let me test it.

486
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:35,491
You're wasting my time.

487
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,839
There's more!

488
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:41,206
The applications go beyond the disease.

489
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:45,341
There are indications that show the
therapy can improve cognitive functioning,

490
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:46,731
memory quality ...

491
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,104
What, what are you saying?

492
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:51,770
My father didn't just recover.

493
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:52,970
He improved.

494
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,939
You mean, increased intelligence?

495
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,384
It's not conclusive, but yes.

496
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,820
I want you, to start testing the
revised 112 on chimps, A-S-A-P.

497
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:06,372
Okay.

498
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,464
I'll give you whatever you need,
but get started.

499
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,844
Dinner time!

500
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:28,732
Great Ape, primate!

501
00:41:30,942 --> 00:41:34,749
Go on, don't you know food
when you see it?

502
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:48,279
You think that's funny, huh?

503
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,962
I show you something funny!

504
00:42:05,546 --> 00:42:07,899
You'll learn who's boss, soon enough.

505
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:11,189
What about his clothes?

506
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,095
What about 'em?

507
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:16,807
I don't know ... May cause problems
with the other apes.

508
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:20,238
Good!

509
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,355
I counted ten apes, correct?

510
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:25,076
Yep.

511
00:43:26,073 --> 00:43:28,336
Good.  All the way to the back.

512
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,806
You guys are moving really quick on this.
What's the big rush?

513
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:36,250
First day back,
you're still complaining.

514
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,000
Koba. Hi, I'm Will.

515
00:44:04,323 --> 00:44:06,582
This one.

516
00:44:06,484 --> 00:44:07,888
He's very calm.

517
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:08,389
Yeah.

518
00:44:08,528 --> 00:44:12,086
He's been through a whole lot of labs.
He knows the drill.

519
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:17,356
Could I join you,
what's our progress.

520
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,864
Get him prepped.

521
00:44:24,793 --> 00:44:26,691
Tighten your masks.

522
00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:28,335
Pass me the 113.

523
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,688
Pulse-ox is good,
blood pressure is steady.

524
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:39,148
Perisol delivery, in place.

525
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:46,607
Releasing the 113.

526
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:05,003
We have a break!

527
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:07,098
Franklin, get your mask on!

528
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:10,955
Got it?

529
00:45:11,005 --> 00:45:11,995
Yeah.

530
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,072
You okay?

531
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:15,695
Yeah, okay.

532
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:23,848
Move it!  Let's go!

533
00:45:24,897 --> 00:45:27,514
Get up and do some exercises
you lazy baboons!

534
00:48:10,883 --> 00:48:13,126
Intelligence results are remarkable.

535
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:14,377
There are no adverse effects.

536
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:16,545
Apes have amazingly strong
immune systems.

537
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,774
All right, keep an eye on him.

538
00:48:19,824 --> 00:48:21,367
Okay. [Franklin sneezes]

539
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:22,630
Sorry about that.

540
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,612
These guys are more resiliant than I am.

541
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:30,459
Excuse me a second.

542
00:49:24,986 --> 00:49:26,296
He's good.

543
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:42,456
You're working late tonight.

544
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:44,639
GEN-SYS needs three more.

545
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,033
Hey, Caesar!

546
00:50:13,521 --> 00:50:17,026
Are you hurt?

547
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:19,775
Show me.

548
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:26,902
Caesar, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

549
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:29,090
Sometimes, the new kid on the
block gets picked on.

550
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:32,504
Stay calm. What did they do?

551
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,083
That's bullshit!

552
00:50:36,132 --> 00:50:38,030
What's the problem here?

553
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:42,039
I'm taking him out of here, right now.

554
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:44,209
Not without a court order, you're not.

555
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,530
He's not yours, anymore.

556
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,795
I promise, if I find out he's been
mistreated in any way,

557
00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:51,850
I'll have this place shut down.

558
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:54,875
Go on ...

559
00:51:03,596 --> 00:51:07,599
No.  No, we're not going home,
right now.

560
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:12,288
I'm going to get you out of here,
I promise.

561
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,372
You have to trust me.

562
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:18,959
Caesar, you have to trust me, okay?

563
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,902
I think this visit's over.

564
00:51:21,176 --> 00:51:22,334
Trust me.

565
00:51:22,384 --> 00:51:24,331
You'll be okay.

566
00:52:07,746 --> 00:52:09,775
Come on, move it!
Let's go!

567
00:52:57,881 --> 00:53:00,938
There are hundreds of them!
Looks like you're own private zoo!

568
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,324
Rather like a prison
for hairy dudes.

569
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:05,055
They watch TV?

570
00:53:05,105 --> 00:53:07,536
We call it enrichment.

571
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:12,708
Aw, this one's so cute!

572
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:15,057
What's his name?

573
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:17,821
Uh, name's Cornelia. It's a she.

574
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:18,531
[shreek]

575
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:20,440
Oh, my God!

576
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,280
Don't get too close!

577
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:23,312
This one scared me half to death.

578
00:53:23,362 --> 00:53:25,218
That big guy is called, Maurice.

579
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:27,435
It's no fun.

580
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:30,351
Here, I'll show you something fun.

581
00:53:34,084 --> 00:53:35,610
Check this out!

582
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,757
It's crazy!

583
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:43,183
You shouldn't be in here.

584
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:44,768
Hey, you're next!

585
00:53:51,442 --> 00:53:52,708
Come on, let's go.

586
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:55,672
We spent too much time in here,
as it is.

587
00:53:57,807 --> 00:53:58,979
Come on!

588
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:00,726
Check out this guy.

589
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:04,641
Hey, Alan, he's a pain in the ass.
He thinks he's special, or something

590
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:07,888
Freaky!

591
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:10,574
Hey, come here.

592
00:54:11,068 --> 00:54:13,117
I think he's thinking or something.

593
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:16,784
Oh, my God, he's got him by the throat!

594
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:17,480
Let him go!

595
00:54:17,575 --> 00:54:19,010
Let go!

596
00:54:20,836 --> 00:54:22,600
Are you okay?

597
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,175
Yes.

598
00:54:23,725 --> 00:54:25,905
I told you not
to get too close, man.

599
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:28,200
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.

600
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:20,564
Some things aren't meant
be changed.

601
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:23,092
You need to accept that.

602
00:59:27,055 --> 00:59:28,230
Hey!

603
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,455
Hey!

604
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,510
What's going on here?

605
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,162
More 113 trials.
We're just prepping ...

606
00:59:33,276 --> 00:59:35,847
Oh, no, we have to analyze
Koba's blood work first!

607
00:59:35,955 --> 00:59:37,886
Franklin knows this.
Where is he?

608
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:39,512
He's out sick for two days.

609
00:59:39,605 --> 00:59:42,086
Well, I didn't authorized this.

610
00:59:42,136 --> 00:59:43,054
No!

611
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,603
I did.

612
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:47,031
We agreed to test sparingly
on one subject.

613
00:59:47,146 --> 00:59:49,714
And, that one subject is stunning!

614
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:52,498
It's a virus. We don't know the human
related effects.

615
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:54,282
The drug works, Will.

616
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,583
Tell him, Linda.

617
00:59:55,751 --> 00:59:58,597
For starters, Koba scored
a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower.

618
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:01,719
Every test result verifies
its effectiveness.

619
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,442
No more tests.
- What are you ...?

620
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:05,454
Not until we have a better understanding
of what we're dealing with.

621
01:00:05,565 --> 01:00:07,542
Look, I'll tell you exactly
what we do. Look ...

622
01:00:07,592 --> 01:00:08,359
Give us a minute.

623
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:11,086
Excuse me!   Put the ape
back in the cage. Be gentle.

624
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:14,273
Will, I'll tell you exactly what
we're dealing with, here.

625
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,586
We're dealing with a drug
that is worth more

626
01:00:16,689 --> 01:00:19,747
than everything else
we are developing, combined.

627
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,815
You make history,

628
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:23,229
I make money.

629
01:00:23,338 --> 01:00:25,751
Isn't that our arrangement?
- No! There are risks.

630
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:27,626
Don't you tell me about risks.

631
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:30,793
You give your own father
an experimental drug.

632
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,435
I could finish your career
with one phone call.

633
01:00:33,554 --> 01:00:35,936
I'll save you the trouble. I quit.

634
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:40,169
We will proceed without you.

635
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:43,726
Look ... You do not know what you're doing.

636
01:00:43,776 --> 01:00:45,664
These tests need to be contained.

637
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:48,016
You have no idea if the 113 is stable,

638
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:50,609
what kind of damage it can
do to people ...

639
01:00:50,703 --> 01:00:55,671
Well, that is why we test it
on chimps, ... isn't it?

640
01:00:57,212 --> 01:00:59,890
Dr. Rodman, it's, me, Franklin!
I need to talk to you!

641
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,016
Can you come to the door?

642
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:16,458
Doc!
[coughing]

643
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:18,987
Who the hell are you?
[Franklin sneezes on neighbor]

644
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:23,839
Get out of here!

645
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:26,149
I'm sorry, ... I'm sorry.

646
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:44,906
You wouldn't be trying to entrap me,
would you?

647
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:51,253
Well, ... I can't say that I approve.

648
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:53,977
They're not people, you know.

649
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,911
You gonna to let him go or not?

650
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:12,169
Caesar, ... hey, come on.

651
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,302
Come on, we're go home.

652
01:02:17,082 --> 01:02:18,894
Home.

653
01:02:19,513 --> 01:02:21,467
Come on, we're really going.

654
01:02:23,433 --> 01:02:25,209
Let's get out of here.

655
01:02:33,402 --> 01:02:37,039
Yeah ... Come on.
