1
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:24,941
Get him!

2
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:28,444
Come on... hit him!
Hit him!

3
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,400
You're waltzing.
Give this sucker some action.

4
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:56,936
You're fighting like a bum.

5
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:58,345
You want some advice?

6
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,576
Water.

7
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,584
Cold beer here.
Get your beer.

8
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:02,710
Come on!

9
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:05,085
Rocky, should I bet the fight
don't go three rounds?

10
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:07,317
- You feel strong?
- Absolutely.

11
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:10,654
You want some good advice?

12
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:12,389
- Mouthpiece.
- Move into your...

13
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:20,628
Come on, let's go!

14
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:02,012
Give him room!

15
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:15,318
Hold your hands up!

16
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:35,709
All right. All right.

17
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,443
Next, a six-rounder
between local lightweights

18
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:42,008
Kid Brooks
and Sugar Johnson.

19
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,552
Good going, champ!

20
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:55,792
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

21
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:58,801
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, you could have this one.

22
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:01,461
You're a bum.

23
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:04,565
You're a bum... you know that?
You're a bum!

24
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:32,126
Hey.

25
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:35,100
You really got lucky tonight.

26
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:39,836
Spider, here's your share. $40.00,
less $15 locker and corner man,

27
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,572
$5 shower and towel, 7% tax.

28
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:44,638
Comes to $17.20

29
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:46,808
You fought a good fight, Spider.

30
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:48,613
Balboa, you get winner's share.

31
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:51,246
$65 less $15
locker and corner end,

32
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:54,587
$5 shower and towel
and 7% tax,

33
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,924
comes to $40.55

34
00:04:57,995 --> 00:04:59,485
When do I fight again?

35
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:02,327
Maybe two weeks.
Give me a call.

36
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,994
The doctor should be in
in about 20 minutes.

37
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:42,330
Hey, boy.

38
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:40,896
You guys are gettin' better
every year, you know that?

39
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,935
Hey, your old man
did pretty good tonight.

40
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,602
Why weren't you there, huh?
You should've seen me.

41
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:02,942
You guys hungry? Huh?

42
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:06,275
Here you go.

43
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:08,946
Here you go.

44
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:14,022
You wanna see
your friend Moby Dick, huh?

45
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:21,562
How're you doin', Moby Dick?
You missed me today or what? Huh?

46
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,522
Huh?

47
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:25,699
Here you go. Say hi.

48
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:27,828
You know, if you guys
could sing or dance,

49
00:08:27,905 --> 00:08:29,896
I wouldn't be doin' this,
you know.

50
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,957
And, uh, last turtle food
I got here.

51
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:52,223
That's, uh...
last turtle food I got here.

52
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:55,026
It had more flies in it...
more moths and flies.

53
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:58,694
More flies... more moths...
who the hell cares?

54
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:21,683
How you feelin' this morning, huh?
Full of life?

55
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:22,912
Fine.

56
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:27,079
Hey, how you doin', killer?
How's the turtle food this week?

57
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,317
Fine.

58
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:30,954
Me, I'm kind of aggravated,
you know?

59
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:32,188
Oh, I'm sorry.

60
00:10:32,262 --> 00:10:35,254
Not your fault. I'm just kind
of aggravated. Wanna hear about it?

61
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:37,323
I'll tell you somebody who don't
wanna hear about it.

62
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:38,993
- How you doin', Gloria?
- Yeah.

63
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:43,165
The last turtle food I got had more
moths in it than flies, you know, Adrian?

64
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,902
And these moths get caught
in the turtle's throat, right about here,

65
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:48,444
and they cough, and I gotta
smack 'em on the back of the shell.

66
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:51,538
And what do you think they get,
huh? And they get what?

67
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:53,207
Huh?

68
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:55,009
Come on.

69
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,575
Shell shock.

70
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,310
Shell shock.

71
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,289
You're startin'
with bad jokes early, huh?

72
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:03,349
Well, no, it's just inventin' jokes
ain't so easy sometimes.

73
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,088
No joke, huh?

74
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:07,653
Hey, how's my buddy doin' today?
Yo, Butkus!

75
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:10,199
- I ain't had time to check on him.
- Yo, Butkus!

76
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:16,962
Hey, gimme a kiss.

77
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,599
Gimme a kiss, Butkus.

78
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:21,338
Adrian, I want you to go downstairs
and clean all the cat cages.

79
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,674
They're a mess.

80
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:40,063
You gotta pay
for that turtle food, rockhead.

81
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,122
Hey, crime don't pay...
you know that, Gloria. You know that.

82
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,216
- Yo, Rock, how's your boxin'?
- Real good.

83
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,353
- Hey, Rock, you fightin' again?
- Yeah, yeah.

84
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,260
Hey, we'll make some money
real soon, huh?

85
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:15,662
Yeah, a million dollars.

86
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,258
Hey, you.
Where you goin'?

87
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:27,166
Where you goin', huh?
Where you runnin'?

88
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,609
- Where you runnin'?
- Hey! Hey!

89
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,672
- Hey! Don't hit the face!
- Shut up!

90
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,014
- Not the face!
- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now.

91
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:36,245
I'm broke... honest to God!

92
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,483
Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb, you understand?

93
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:42,548
- Please! Please...
- What's your name again?

94
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:46,196
- Bob.
- Bob. Listen, Bob. Listen, Bob!

95
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,964
You wanna dance,
you gotta pay the band, understand?

96
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:52,297
You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

97
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:55,532
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved,
Bob, you understand?

98
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,096
Give me some money.

99
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,768
Give me some money.
Come on.

100
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,444
There's 130 here.

101
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:06,642
That's it. That's it.
I'm broke.

102
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:10,380
Hey, Bob. Hey, hey.
You're still $70 light.

103
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:13,446
You don't have to break nothing.
Here, take my coat.

104
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:16,049
It's worth 50, $60.

105
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,026
Here. Take the coat.
Take the coat!

106
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,860
- Just...
- No, you should've planned ahead.

107
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:22,762
You know that?
You should've planned ahead.

108
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,358
We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand
like you broke the thumb.

109
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:26,766
You should've planned ahead.

110
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:29,965
Gazzo don't have to know!
He won't be wise to nothin'!

111
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,440
Gazzo won't be wise to nothin'.
Keep the coat!

112
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,572
Keep the...

113
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,301
He only had 130, but I think he's good
for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.

114
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:09,538
Sure, Rocky.
Bob's good for it.

115
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:12,845
That's it for today. Here.

116
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,411
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.

117
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,214
He's late three weeks
and I don't like it.

118
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,778
Tomorrow,
three weeks, Del Rio?

119
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:22,348
All right, I got it. Del Rio...
how do you spell Del Rio?

120
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,758
- How'd you do last night?
- I did real good.

121
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,659
- Hey!
- What?

122
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,891
- Did you get the license number?
- Of what?

123
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,934
The truck
that run over your face.

124
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,060
Relax, Buddy.
All right, pull it over here.

125
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:36,299
I wanna let Rocky out, then I'm
gonna talk to him for a few seconds.

126
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,562
How come you didn't break
this guy's thumb like I told you?

127
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:03,896
- How do you know I didn't...
- You don't think I hear things?

128
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,162
Did I give you a job
this morning or I didn't, huh?

129
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:08,727
So, why didn't you break
his thumb like I told you to?

130
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:12,400
When you don't do what I tell you
to do, you make me look bad, Rock.

131
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:15,639
I figured... look, I figured
if I break the guy's thumb,

132
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:17,646
he gets laid off, right?
Then he can't make...

133
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:19,875
Don't figure... let me do
the figurin', okay, Rock?

134
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,441
From here on in, just let me do
the figurin', you know?

135
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,113
These guys think that we're runnin'
some kind of charity or somethin'.

136
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:26,678
That they can get off light.

137
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:29,157
From here on in,
do what I tell you to do

138
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,956
because it's bad
for my reputation, you understand?

139
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,860
You got... You got it, Rock?

140
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:35,858
I got it.

141
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:40,636
Hey, how do you spell Del Rio?

142
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:43,696
- Open a dictionary, Rock!
- Come on!

143
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:46,607
Hey, I won't let that happen no more...
about the thumb.

144
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,839
You know?

145
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,942
So long, meatbag.

146
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:57,950
I should've broke <i>your</i> thumbs!

147
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:29,881
Hey, Rock, heard you did
real good last night.

148
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,443
Absolutely.
You should've seen me.

149
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,250
Don't you think
you oughta take a rest?

150
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:34,984
- No, my back is hurtin'.
- Your back?

151
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,958
My back is hurtin'.
You deaf?

152
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,494
No, I'm short.

153
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,156
Hey, yo, Mike,

154
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:47,719
where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

155
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,029
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

156
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,098
What you talkin' 'bout,
it ain't my locker?

157
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:57,766
It's been my locker for six years.
Where's my gear?

158
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:00,173
Mickey told me to bag it
and hang it.

159
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,913
You put my stuff
on skid row.

160
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,314
I been in that locker for six years

161
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,445
and you put my stuff
in a bag on skid row?

162
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:14,115
Mickey tells me what to do,
I gotta do it, right, Rock?

163
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,590
Where is he?

164
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,388
He's outside
working with Dipper.

165
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,886
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

166
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:34,808
Get your hands up there.
Keep your hands up. That's right.

167
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,076
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

168
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:39,547
To the body. To the body.
Attaboy.

169
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,613
Time.
Time!

170
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:48,380
The hell.
What do you want?

171
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,789
How're you feelin' today?

172
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,521
- What?
- I said, how're you feelin'?

173
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:53,756
- What are you... a doctor?
- You got problems today?

174
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,764
Never mind my problem...
what's your problem?

175
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:57,823
My problem is I've been talking
to your man Michael.

176
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,062
I wanna know how come I've
been put out of my locker.

177
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:03,129
Because Dipper needed it.
Dipper's a contender.

178
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:05,037
He's a climber.
You know what you are?

179
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:06,473
- What?
- You're a tomato.

180
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:07,874
- A tomato?
- Yeah, let's face it.

181
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:10,777
I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

182
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:13,179
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

183
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,344
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won. Kayo in the second.

184
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:17,613
Yeah? Who'd you fight?

185
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:19,416
Spider Rico.

186
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,819
He's a bum.

187
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:24,053
You think
everybody I fight is a bum.

188
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:25,253
Well, ain't they?

189
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:29,094
You got heart, but you fight
like a goddamn ape.

190
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,158
Nothing special about you.
You never got your nose busted.

191
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:35,568
Well, leave it that way... nice and pretty,
and what's left of your mind.

192
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:38,130
You know, Mick, I think
I'm gonna go take a steam.

193
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,473
You know why? 'Cause I did real good
last night, and you should've seen me.

194
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:44,013
- Big deal.
- You should've seen me, too.

195
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,481
Hey, kid.
You ever think about retiring?

196
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:49,485
- No.
- You think about it.

197
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,487
- Yeah.
- All right. Time.

198
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:53,614
- Hey, man.
- What?

199
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,487
I dig your locker, man.

200
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,922
I dig your locker.

201
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,198
Attaboy.

202
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,428
Cold night.

203
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:39,128
Good night to catch pneumonia,
you know?

204
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:44,704
You need some help
with that cage?

205
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:48,643
There's a good game down
at the Spectrum tonight.

206
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,512
Wanna go to a basketball game?

207
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,580
Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.

208
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:04,483
Tough day today, you know.
They took my locker away.

209
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:07,394
I had that locker for about
six years, but it don't bother me none.

210
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:08,795
Lockers are bad, anyway.

211
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,594
After a while,
people get the combination.

212
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:14,364
I must've had 20 bucks taken
out of there in the past six years.

213
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:17,065
It don't sound like much,
but it adds up, you know.

214
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,267
Doesn't matter. Who cares.

215
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:22,976
Wow. Cold night.

216
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:25,378
Hey, birds!
Hey, look who's here.

217
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:28,042
Look who's here.
The giant worm.

218
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:30,817
Look at these birds.

219
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:33,879
Don't these birds look like candy,
you know? Like flying candy.

220
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:35,788
Hey, bird,
you wanna fly me home?

221
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,690
You need somebody
to walk you home?

222
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:41,160
- No.
- No? It's a cold night.

223
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:44,291
If I was you and you got the money,
I would take a cab or something.

224
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,198
Too many creeps
around here, you know.

225
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,868
Every other block,
there's a creep.

226
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,530
You can always tell a creep.

227
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:56,111
All right. Listen,
I'm gonna go now, okay?

228
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,771
I'll see yous later, all right?

229
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,508
Don't any of you guys get up.

230
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:01,413
I know you had
a hard day in the cage.

231
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:04,817
So, uh... I'm gonna go home,
make up a joke.

232
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:07,948
I'm gonna tell you a new joke
tomorrow, okay? Good night, Adrian.

233
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,355
Good night, Rocky.

234
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:31,614
I don't know
what happens to me.

235
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,171
Hey there, Lefty.

236
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,841
- I got a friend for you.
- Hello, Rock.

237
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,251
How you doin'?
You seen Paulie?

238
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:40,312
- Yeah, he's in the steam room.
- Yeah?

239
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,381
Hey, Rocky,
what's with the eye?

240
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,450
- Been fightin'.
- Hope you won it, at least.

241
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:46,427
Yeah, I did real good.
You should've seen me.

242
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:48,327
<i>Heavyweight champion</i>
<i>of the world Apollo Creed</i>

244
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,630
Hey, Rocky,
who'd you fight?

245
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:52,861
Spider Rico.

246
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:55,597
Is he still around?

247
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:58,835
Yeah, he's doing real good. He's doing
better than you... that's for sure.

248
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:01,274
Hey, Paulie, what,
did you lock the door?

249
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:02,834
Yo, Paulie!

250
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,745
I'd like to kill the freakin' moron
who broke the mirror.

251
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:07,908
Hey, yo, Paulie,

252
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:09,975
every day,
every night I pass by

253
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:12,385
your sister's giving me the shoulder,
you know what I mean?

254
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:14,286
- Forget her.
- What do you mean, forget her?

255
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:16,188
- You can do better than her.
- Forget nothin'.

256
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,420
Every night I pass by the place,
I tell a joke.

257
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:21,157
Every morning I pass by the place,
I tell a joke. Nothing.

258
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,165
She just looks at me,
you know what I mean?

259
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:25,565
- Looks, huh?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

260
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:28,126
What... I need a Cadillac
to connect with your sister?

261
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:31,196
Something wrong with my face?
You know what I mean?

262
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:33,105
- She's a freakin' loser.
- Hey.

263
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:36,509
Sometimes she gets me so crazy,
I could split her head with a razor.

264
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,240
Don't get mental, man, you know.

265
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:41,215
- Well, you caught me in a bad mood.
- You're always in a bad mood.

266
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:44,048
Adrian ain't sharp.
Adrian is a loser.

267
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,611
- Hey.
- She's pushin' 30 freakin' years old.

268
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:49,283
And if she don't watch out,
she's gonna end up dying alone.

269
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,850
- I'm 30 myself.
- Then you're gonna end up dying alone.

270
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:54,089
Hey, I don't need see
no crowd around you, neither.

271
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,291
I'd like to kill the freakin' moron
who broke the mirror.

272
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:59,028
Come on, let's get out
of this stink, would you? Come on.

273
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:02,804
- I wanna talk to you anyway.
- About what?

274
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:05,204
- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

275
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,937
Why don't you talk
to him about me?

276
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:12,607
Well, I just don't think Gazzo's hirin'
right now, you know? You know?

277
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:13,842
Come on.

278
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:19,948
- The girl's dryin' up.
- Who?

279
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:23,686
My sister. If she don't start livin',
her body's gonna dry up.

280
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,990
You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving,
you know that?

281
00:24:26,062 --> 00:24:27,893
Why don't you come over
and talk to her?

282
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:29,363
Sure. Beer.

283
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:31,423
Tomorrow you come
for some bird, right?

284
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:34,265
Absolutely. You got it.

285
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:37,306
I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,
she calls the hospital.

286
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:39,068
- Paulie!
- I got it. I got it.

00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:26,285
<i>Forget about sports</i>
<i>as a profession.</i>

306
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:28,017
<i>Sports make you grunt and smell.</i>

307
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:31,549
<i>- See, be a thinker, not a stinker.</i>
<i>- Okay, thanks a lot, Champ.</i>

308
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:34,222
Hey, are you crazy?
This man is champion of the world.

309
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:37,357
He took his best shot
and became champ. Huh?

310
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,264
What shot did you ever take?

311
00:25:39,335 --> 00:25:42,827
Hey, Rocky, you're not happy
with your life, it's nice.

312
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:46,000
But me, I got a business going.
I don't have to take no shots.

313
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:47,804
<i>No one having gone more than...</i>

314
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:49,037
That's right.

315
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:52,678
Stick that up your business.

316
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:54,614
What are you so insulted about?

317
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:59,846
Want me to take a shot?
All right... I'll take a shot.

318
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,332
Rocky, how's it been going?

319
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:14,893
Hey, Rocky,
how 'bout a bottle?

320
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:17,303
- No wine.
- Come on. Just a little.

321
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,503
Rory, does your brother
know you're hanging out so late?

322
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:24,774
- Screw you, Go-go.
- Her brother knows.

323
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:27,008
Hey, these guys teach you
to talk like that?

324
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,517
- Stuff it, man!
- Never say that! Come here!

325
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:32,146
You stink up the neighborhood!

326
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:36,585
- You know, you can...
- Hey!

327
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:37,921
When I was your age,

328
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:41,327
there was only one girl in the
whole neighborhood talked like that.

329
00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:44,423
That was it. Just one.
What are you doing?

330
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,468
It'll make your teeth yellow.
Don't do that.

331
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:49,369
- I like yellow teeth.
- It'll make your breath like garbage.

332
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:52,431
- Maybe I like garbage.
- Come on, nobody likes garbage.

333
00:26:52,508 --> 00:26:54,999
Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth...
she wasn't bad-lookin',

334
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,569
but, you see, none of the guys
ever took her seriously, see.

335
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,581
They never took her out
for any serious datin'.

336
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:01,139
- Why?
- 'Cause that's the way guys are.

337
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:03,276
They laugh when you talk dirty,
they think you're cute,

338
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:05,344
but after a while, you get
a reputation, that's it.

339
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:06,911
You get no respect,
you understand?

340
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,653
You get no respect.
And I gotta use a bad word.

341
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:13,218
Whore.
You understand? Whore.

342
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:14,957
See, you use dirty words

343
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,556
and maybe you end up becoming
a whore, you understand?

344
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,295
Come on, Rocky.
I'm just 12.

345
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:21,860
Hey, that don't matter
that you're 12. It don't matter.

346
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:25,999
You don't really have to be one.
You just act like one... that's it. Boom.

347
00:27:26,075 --> 00:27:29,010
Hey, if you get a bad rap,
you understand?

348
00:27:29,078 --> 00:27:31,239
Twenty years from now,
people are gonna say,

349
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:33,145
"Hey, you remember Marie?"

350
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:34,615
"No, who's she?"

351
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:37,244
"She's the little whore that hung out
at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

352
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,982
"Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,
now I remember her."

353
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:43,321
You see, they don't remember you,
they remember the rep.

354
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:44,724
You understand?

355
00:27:45,962 --> 00:27:47,793
Hey, you got a boyfriend?

356
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:49,695
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.

357
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:52,428
You know why? Why don't you
think you have a boyfriend?

358
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:55,300
'Cause you're hangin' out with them
coconuts in the corner, understand?

359
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:57,100
You hang around coconuts,
you get nowhere.

360
00:27:57,173 --> 00:27:59,004
They're lemons.
Lemons.

361
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:02,238
You hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends, you understand?

362
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,802
You hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

363
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:07,281
You hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

364
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,511
You see?
It's simple mathematics.

365
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,118
- I hope you ain't...
- I won't.

366
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:13,348
What was I gonna say?

367
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:16,586
You hope I don't keep acting like
a whore, or I'll turn into one, right?

368
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:18,718
- Yeah, something like that.
- Good night, Rocky.

369
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:20,262
Good night, Marie.
Take care, you know?

370
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,126
- Hey, Rocky?
- Yo.

371
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:24,132
Screw you, creep-o!

372
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:34,607
Yeah, who are you
to give advice, creep-o? Huh?

373
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:35,837
Who are you?

374
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:57,832
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

375
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,731
It says here Mac Lee Green

376
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:04,136
has suffered a severely cracked
third metacarpal in his left hand.

377
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:05,868
Damn.

378
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:08,206
Of course, we can
cancel the fight indefinitely

379
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:09,869
if you're set on fighting Green.

380
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:12,278
Hey, it ain't just Green!

381
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:14,509
What about all the time
Apollo has invested?

382
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:16,552
I believe
we can find a solution.

383
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:18,985
Solution nothin'. You better find me
another ranked contender.

384
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:20,545
And I mean in a flash, Jergens.

385
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,284
Don't play games with my client.

386
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:24,826
Apollo's already done
a million dollars worth of publicity,

387
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:27,886
has made contractual obligations
with 20 different organizations...

388
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:29,454
he's not going
to be embarrassed!

389
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:32,296
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

390
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:34,359
Ernie's fighting in France
that same week.

391
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:36,735
Then get me Buddy Shaw!
Hell, he's ranked fifth!

392
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:39,832
Went to California
and gained 50 pounds.

393
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:41,740
I get a hold of every
worthwhile contender

394
00:29:41,811 --> 00:29:43,403
and they all say the same thing...

395
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:46,141
five weeks just isn't enough time
to get into shape.

396
00:29:46,215 --> 00:29:48,547
Shape nothin', man!
They're afraid.

397
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:50,609
They know everybody in the world's
gonna see this fight,

398
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:52,517
and none of them's
got a prayer of whippin' me.

399
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:54,681
They're makin' excuses
so they don't have to be the chump

400
00:29:54,757 --> 00:29:56,691
to get whipped in front
of the whole civilized world.

401
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:59,751
All I can say
is I'm a good promoter.

402
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,855
I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world,

403
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:05,332
and I've broken my ass over this one.

404
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:07,733
But I don't know
what the hell else to do!

405
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:14,235
I do.

406
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:17,772
Without a ranked contender,

407
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:20,509
what this fight is gonna need
is a novelty.

408
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,175
This is the land
of opportunity, right?

409
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:26,177
So Apollo Creed,
on January 1st,

410
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:29,986
gives a local underdog fighter
an opportunity.

411
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,390
A snow-white underdog,

412
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,293
and I'm gonna put his face
on this poster with me.

413
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:36,194
And I'll tell you why.

414
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:37,926
Because I'm sentimental.

415
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:41,331
And a lot of other people
in this country are just as sentimental,

416
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:44,237
and there's nothing they'd like better
than to see Apollo Creed

417
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:45,797
give a local Philadelphia boy

418
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:49,936
a shot at the greatest title in the world
on this country's biggest birthday.

419
00:30:50,012 --> 00:30:51,843
Now, that's the way I see it.

420
00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:54,506
And that's the way it's gonna be.

421
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,745
Apollo, I like it.

422
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:59,344
It's very American.

423
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:01,083
No, Jergens.

424
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:02,818
It's very smart.

425
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:18,435
Okay, I'll see you later, man.

426
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:29,148
- What? What is it?
- I just wanna check this thing out.

427
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:31,686
Now, you said pick up
two yards from Snyder

428
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:33,244
and a grand from Cappoli, right?

429
00:31:33,322 --> 00:31:37,156
No, no. No, no. Two yards
from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.

430
00:31:37,226 --> 00:31:39,057
- Two yards. Two yards.
- Write it down, okay?

431
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:40,618
Yeah, I got it. Got it.

432
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:43,096
Who's this girl you're going
out with tomorrow night?

433
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:45,593
How'd you know?

434
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:47,659
You know.
Don't you think I hear things?

435
00:31:47,737 --> 00:31:49,671
A lot of canaries
flying around the docks.

436
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,207
- I'm going out with Paulie's sister.
- Hey, Rocky.

437
00:31:52,275 --> 00:31:54,470
- What?
- I hear she's retarded.

438
00:31:54,543 --> 00:31:56,534
She ain't retarded.
She's shy, you know?

439
00:31:56,612 --> 00:31:58,102
I'll tell you what to do.

440
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,377
Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.

441
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,782
- This bum gotta say that?
- Who're you calling a bum?

442
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,117
- I'm calling you a bum!
- Okay, relax. Relax.

443
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:08,179
Buddy's in a bad mood.
It's his prostate.

444
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:09,747
He's always in a bad mood.

445
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:11,656
You know, you oughta count
your blessings, Buddy.

446
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:13,524
You're still a healthy person,
you know that?

447
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:15,587
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours, either!

448
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:17,496
- Kiss my ass!
- Move your shoulders down!

449
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:20,399
- Get out of the car!
- Relax, relax! Relax. My ears.

450
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:22,801
What, are you driving me crazy?
Both of yous.

451
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,501
- Buddy doesn't like you.
- Yeah.

452
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:29,305
Some guys, they just hate
for no reason, <i>capisce?</i>

453
00:32:29,378 --> 00:32:30,868
- Yeah.
- Come here.

454
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:35,914
There's 50 bucks. You and your girl
Adrian have a nice time, you hear?

455
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:37,043
Thanks.

456
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,050
Hey, how'd you know her name?

457
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:41,987
You don't think I hear things?

458
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:44,653
- Hey, Rock.
- What?

459
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,558
- Remember what I told you.
- What'd you tell me?

460
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:47,789
Take her to the zoo.

461
00:32:55,838 --> 00:32:58,534
- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?
- No, thanks, Shirley.

462
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:01,740
What do you think
about Billy Snow?

463
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:02,971
Fouls.

464
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,770
How 'bout Big Chuck Smith?

465
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:08,009
- Yeah.
- Nah. He's too old and dull.

466
00:33:08,718 --> 00:33:10,379
Hey, Bobby Judd.
He's a good boy.

467
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:12,421
No, I don't feel any heat
from that name.

468
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:14,479
Joe Zach's a good prospect.

469
00:33:15,658 --> 00:33:18,320
Exactly what are
you looking for, Apollo?

470
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:21,990
This is what I'm looking for.

471
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:23,998
The Italian Stallion.

472
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,397
Rocky Balboa?
Never heard of him.

473
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,631
Look, it's the name, man.

474
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:34,369
The Italian Stallion.
The media will eat it up.

475
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:37,276
Now, who discovered America?
An Italian, right?

476
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:40,679
What would be better than to get it on
with one of his descendents?

477
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,581
He's a southpaw.

478
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:44,312
I don't want you messing around
with southpaws.

479
00:33:44,387 --> 00:33:46,446
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothin'.

480
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:47,921
I'll drop him in three.

481
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:53,928
Apollo Creed
meets the Italian Stallion.

482
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:57,364
Sounds like a damn monster movie.

483
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,691
Hey, what are you doing
with that bat, huh?

484
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:03,034
I used to be deadly at stickball.
You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?

485
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:04,265
She's very excited.

486
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,604
- Look at my swollen hands.
- Yeah.

487
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:09,838
The joints from walkin' and
carryin' meat in and out of freezers.

488
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:11,243
It plays hell on the joints.

489
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:13,474
Maybe you oughta see a doctor.
What do you think?

490
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:15,642
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

491
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:18,118
Different job. What kind of turkey?
Big turkey or small turkey?

492
00:34:18,187 --> 00:34:23,181
Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him
I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me.

493
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:26,422
I'd make a great collector.
Bustin' bones don't bother me.

494
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:28,929
Don't bother you.
A big turkey, right? Huh?

495
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:32,331
Gazzo's gotta come... forget Gazzo.
It's a bad job, you know what I mean?

496
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:35,802
- You got a match?
- Go to him for me. As a favor.

497
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,499
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
the last time I had a turkey

498
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,235
was when they
were having a $2 special

499
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:42,243
at Horn and Hardog's
about three years ago.

500
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:44,973
Last year me and the turtles
had spam. What do you think?

501
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:47,140
Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

502
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:54,786
Your sister knows
I'm coming for sure, right?

503
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:57,087
Yeah, yeah.
She's very excited.

504
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:00,290
I'm all alone

505
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:02,523
Hey, will you forget
about Gazzo, huh?

506
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:06,924
- I don't ask nobody twice.
- I don't ask nobody twice.

507
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:10,062
Stay away, baby

508
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:14,401
Hey, your sister... you sure
your sister knows I'm comin'?

509
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:16,308
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's very excited.

510
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:17,402
Yeah?

511
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:22,307
Paulie? You're late.

512
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:26,385
Called the hospital? She calls
the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.

513
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,880
How you doin'?

514
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,894
I told you she's very excited.

515
00:35:35,831 --> 00:35:38,664
Paulie, why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him here?

516
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:40,224
Look at me.
I'm not ready for this.

517
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:42,031
Would it make a difference
if you were?

518
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:44,095
He's a friend,
and now he's taking you out.

519
00:35:44,173 --> 00:35:45,504
No, I can't.

520
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:48,769
You're in the kitchen,
and I want you out right now.

521
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:53,537
Hey.

522
00:35:54,216 --> 00:35:55,649
Hey!

523
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:58,551
Hey, I want you
outta here instamatically!

524
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:01,454
I'm sick of seein' you hanging around
like a freakin' spider!

525
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:03,685
Go out! Live!
Enjoy life!

526
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:05,249
Paulie, I can't go!

527
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:07,318
Don't get wise with me,
now, huh?

528
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:10,888
- I'm tired of you being a loser.
- Don't call me that, Paulie!

529
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:14,299
<i>Apollo Creed says he'll</i>
<i>be shopping for another victim</i>

530
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,067
<i>to fill Green's vacancy for</i>
<i>the bicentennial championship fight.</i>

531
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,971
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him home?

532
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:23,409
- How do you know I didn't?
- I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go!

533
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,208
- I won't go!
- Why?!

534
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:29,880
Paulie, it's Thanksgivin'.
I got a turkey in the oven.

535
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:33,053
Oh. A turkey in the oven?

536
00:36:39,428 --> 00:36:40,918
A turkey in the oven.

537
00:36:47,903 --> 00:36:49,564
You want the bird?

538
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:52,297
Go in the alley
and eat the bird.

539
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:54,342
Oh, Paulie.

540
00:36:55,144 --> 00:36:58,272
I want you outta here!
Get outta the house!

541
00:36:58,347 --> 00:37:00,941
Go out and enjoy
your freakin' life!

542
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:06,783
You hungry, Rock?

543
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,992
Yo, Paulie, listen. Maybe we just
better forget all this, you know?

544
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:19,057
- Just forget it.
- Forget nothin'.

545
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:20,624
Go ahead.
Tell her somethin' funny.

546
00:37:20,703 --> 00:37:24,104
Ain't nothin' to talk about. She's in
a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood.

547
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:26,835
You know how to do funny.
You wanna go out with my sister?

548
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:29,969
- Yeah.
- Well... come on.

549
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:34,071
I don't know what to say.

550
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:49,620
Yo, Adrian,
it's me, Rocky.

551
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:51,097
Rocky, you know?

552
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:53,432
Listen, uh...

553
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:56,602
I don't know what to say,

554
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:59,402
'cause I ain't never talked
to no door before, you know?

555
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,077
I mean, what do I say
to a door... hey, listen...

556
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:05,875
Come on.
You're doin' fine.

557
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:08,348
I ain't doin' fine.
I look like an idiot.

558
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,408
Keep doin' what you're doin'.
You're funny.

559
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:12,477
I know all about these things.

560
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:13,953
I feel like a jerk.

561
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:23,020
Yo, Adrian,
it's Rocky again, you know?

562
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:24,429
Listen, uh...

563
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:28,096
I know you ain't too happy
at this moment, you know,

564
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,762
but could you do me a favor?

565
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:32,830
I ain't got nobody to spend
Thanksgiving with, you know?

566
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:34,569
So, uh...

567
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:38,238
how 'bout maybe you and I maybe
go out together, get something to eat.

568
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:41,044
I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit.
Who knows, you know?

569
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:42,606
Would you like to, uh...

570
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,480
I don't know. Would you like to maybe,
you know, you and me go out together?

571
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:49,387
What do you think?
Would you like to?

572
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:56,587
We're gonna have a good time.

573
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,531
We'll have a real good time.

574
00:39:04,473 --> 00:39:05,804
Thanks for the bird.

575
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:12,372
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

576
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,651
- What does your sister like to do?
- Ice skate.

577
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,721
Adrian, come on.
You're lettin' the heat out.

578
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:31,527
Who pays the bills around here?

579
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:40,169
Listen, I don't want
no turkey anyway, you know?

580
00:39:42,277 --> 00:39:43,938
But it was Thanksgiving.

581
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,344
- It was what?
- It was Thanksgiving.

582
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:50,078
Yeah, to you.
But to me it's Thursday.

583
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:17,773
- It looks kinda quiet, you know?
- I think it's closed.

584
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:20,508
No, I think maybe we're just early
or something like that.

585
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,243
- Yo!
- Yo!

586
00:40:22,317 --> 00:40:24,478
- We're closed.
- What?

587
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:25,884
I said we're closed.

588
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:28,445
Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna
smooth this guy out here.

589
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:31,015
So just wait here for a few minutes.
I'll be right back, okay?

590
00:40:31,093 --> 00:40:32,924
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's okay.

591
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,929
Hey, listen, are you closed
to the general public,

592
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:37,158
or are you closed to everybody...
you know what I mean?

593
00:40:37,232 --> 00:40:41,396
Look, it's after 6:00, it's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

594
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,529
And besides, you ain't
supposed to be in here.

595
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:45,937
So do me a favor
and not stay here, huh?

596
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:50,001
- Would you do me a favor?
- Hey, come on. We're not operatin'.

597
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:52,740
Look... this girl here
ain't feelin' well, you know.

598
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:55,375
The doctors say she should go out
and exercise once in a while,

599
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:57,612
and ice skating's probably
the best thing, know what I mean?

600
00:40:57,686 --> 00:40:59,176
So what do you want from me?

601
00:40:59,254 --> 00:41:02,382
I want you to do me a favor.
You could see she ain't feelin' too good.

602
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:05,586
If you could let her on the ice,
I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.

603
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:07,492
Ten minutes, ten bucks.

604
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:09,827
Ten bucks? How 'bout eight...
eight bucks?

605
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:12,230
Come on. It's Thanksgiving.

606
00:41:12,301 --> 00:41:14,292
All right, nine bucks,
you got a deal.

607
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:16,667
You have the ice to yourself.
Ten bucks.

608
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,539
Give her the blades.

609
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:22,902
Aren't you skating?

610
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:24,969
Nah. I ain't skated since I was 15.

611
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:27,379
That's when I started fightin'...
when I was 15.

612
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:29,781
Skating's kinda bad
for the ankles, you know?

613
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:31,251
Yeah.

614
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,981
You're a pretty good skater,
are you?

615
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:37,556
You know, like I was saying before
on the way over here.

616
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:40,561
Fightin' used to be tops
with me, but no more, you know?

617
00:41:40,629 --> 00:41:43,291
All I wanted to do at a fight
was prove I was no bum...

618
00:41:43,365 --> 00:41:45,731
that I had the stuff
to make a good pro, you know?

619
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,132
You never got the chance?

620
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:51,036
Hey, I ain't cryin' about it, 'cause I
still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby.

621
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:53,370
I tell you what the trouble is...
I'm a southpaw.

622
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:56,104
- What's a southpaw?
- A southpaw means you're left-handed.

623
00:41:56,178 --> 00:41:58,669
And a southpaw
throws your timing off, you see.

624
00:41:58,747 --> 00:42:01,079
Other guys it throws their timing off,
makes them look awkward.

625
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:02,878
Nobody wants to look awkward.

626
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:05,818
- You know where southpaw came from?
- Nine minutes!

627
00:42:05,888 --> 00:42:09,221
I'll tell ya. A long time ago, this guy...
maybe a couple hundred years ago...

628
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:12,692
he was fightin' in the...
I think it was around Philadelphia...

629
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:14,422
and his arm... he was left-handed,

630
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:17,761
and his arm was facing towards
New Jersey, you see, and that's south.

631
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:20,666
So then that's why they
call 'em southpaw, you see?

632
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:25,435
Southpaw, South Jersey.
South Camden, southpaw.

633
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:26,667
You know what I mean?

634
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:30,367
I don't know. Things probably
worked out for the best, don't you think?

635
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:32,936
Never got a chance, though,
because you're left-handed, huh?

636
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:35,848
Well, that's absolutely true,
you know. Watch out.

637
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:41,712
I just dislocated my finger.

638
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:45,916
Look at that. No, wait.
Hey, it ain't your fault. Look.

639
00:42:45,994 --> 00:42:48,986
See? Look, I had it...
it's an old wound, you see that?

640
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:51,897
Look. See?
Nothin'. It bends like that, see?

641
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,867
I originally done it...
look, push the button.

642
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:55,927
Bong. It works.
It ain't your fault.

643
00:42:56,004 --> 00:42:58,666
- Look, I'm gonna show you somethin'.
- Seven minutes!

644
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,903
Yeah, I originally done it.
I carry pictures of all my fights.

645
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:04,775
I originally done it
in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See that?

646
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:08,043
Big Baby's about the size of an airplane.
I broke both my hands on his face.

647
00:43:08,116 --> 00:43:11,279
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think? See how it works there?

648
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:12,513
Real nice.

649
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:15,479
Come on.
You having a good time?

650
00:43:16,325 --> 00:43:20,318
I'll tell you... you could see
I ain't too graceful. I don't move well.

651
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:23,728
But I'll tell you, I can really swat, you
know what I mean? I can really hit hard.

652
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:26,962
But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants
to fight no southpaw, know what mean?

653
00:43:27,035 --> 00:43:28,093
Huh?

654
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:34,439
You know how I
got started in fightin'?

655
00:43:35,344 --> 00:43:36,606
- Huh?
- No.

656
00:43:37,412 --> 00:43:39,471
Am I talkin' too loud?

657
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:41,140
- No.
- Three minutes!

658
00:43:41,216 --> 00:43:45,585
My father... he's, uh...
my old man, he was never too smart.

659
00:43:45,654 --> 00:43:48,122
He says to me, "You weren't born
with much of a brain,

660
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,522
so you better start using
your body," right?

661
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:51,923
So I become a fighter.

662
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:53,222
Oh.

663
00:43:53,295 --> 00:43:55,024
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

664
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:56,928
Why are you...
why are you laughin'?

665
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,160
My mother...
she said the opposite thing.

666
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:03,227
What'd she say?
What'd she say, the opposite?

667
00:44:03,972 --> 00:44:06,440
She said you weren't born
with much of a body,

668
00:44:06,508 --> 00:44:08,135
so you better develop your brain.

669
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,370
Did she say that?

670
00:44:09,444 --> 00:44:11,674
Yo! Time!

671
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:13,908
Can I ask you a question?

672
00:44:13,982 --> 00:44:15,313
Absolutely.

673
00:44:16,485 --> 00:44:19,750
- Why do you wanna fight?
- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.

674
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:21,652
Eh, oh.

675
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,519
Don't fall! Don't fall!

676
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,850
Hey, that was terrific.
I'm pretty good at this.

677
00:44:26,928 --> 00:44:28,259
You like the way I skate?

678
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,390
The last fight I had, I had
with this guy named Spider Rico.

679
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:34,094
He busted my head up.
You see that scar?

680
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:37,502
I'll tell ya...
things get pretty rough in the ring.

681
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:49,911
You know, with some people,
I'm very shy by nature, you know?

682
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:51,745
I suppose.

683
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:57,617
I say you're very shy
by nature, you know?

684
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:00,358
I suppose.

685
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:04,924
Ey! Ey.
The bum from the dark.

686
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,763
Get a job, you bum!

687
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:10,504
You know, some people think
that being shy is a disease,

688
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:12,403
but it don't bother me none.

689
00:45:12,474 --> 00:45:13,873
It don't bother me, either.

690
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,669
Then why'd I bother
bringing it up, huh?

691
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:19,407
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.

692
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:23,444
I think we make
a real sharp couple of coconuts.

693
00:45:23,518 --> 00:45:25,679
I'm dumb, you're shy.
What do you think, huh?

694
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:31,786
I don't understand why anybody
would wanna be a fighter.

695
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:34,622
Hey, you gotta be a moron.

696
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:38,291
You gotta be a moron to wanna be
a fighter, you know what I mean?

697
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:41,767
It's a racket where you're
almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

698
00:45:41,837 --> 00:45:45,466
- I don't think you're a bum.
- Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know?

699
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,030
But I'll tell ya somethin'.

700
00:45:48,543 --> 00:45:51,706
The worst thing about fightin'
is the mornin' after, you know?

701
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,509
- The mornin' after?
- I'll tell you. Yeah.

702
00:45:53,582 --> 00:45:57,450
The mornin' after a fight, you're nothing
but a large wound, know what I mean?

703
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:59,248
Sometimes I got pains
all over me.

704
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:03,052
I feel like callin' a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

705
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:04,888
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,

706
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,191
your face is all busted up,
your hands are swollen, you know?

707
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:11,096
Look at this face.
64 fights. Look at that nose.

708
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:12,497
See that nose?

709
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:14,967
That nose ain't never been broken.
64 fights.

710
00:46:15,036 --> 00:46:17,869
I've had guys bustin' on it,
I had guys chewin' on it,

711
00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:21,102
twistin' it, punchin' it...
I mean, whack! Boom!

712
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:23,838
These guys,
they hittin' my nose all the time.

713
00:46:23,912 --> 00:46:26,904
Never broken. I'm very proud of that.
Isn't that rare? That's rare.

714
00:46:27,682 --> 00:46:30,378
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why do you think?

715
00:46:32,187 --> 00:46:35,020
'Cause... you can't sing and dance.

716
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,581
Yeah, somethin' like that.
Somethin' like that.

717
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:39,149
Hey, you wanna come inside?

718
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,361
No. I gotta go.

719
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:45,422
Hey, come on.
Hey, I got some animals.

720
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,231
I got these rare... very rare
animals inside. Come on. Come on in.

721
00:46:49,304 --> 00:46:51,169
No, no. I gotta go.

722
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:54,402
Well, I gotta go, too.
I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.

723
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:55,738
Come on.

724
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:58,575
- No, I gotta go.
- Hey, look at this face.

725
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:02,048
Is that a face you could trust
or what? Huh? Is it?

726
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:04,642
They oughta stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

727
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:08,255
Come on. Come on in.

728
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:15,189
Yo. Come on.

729
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:36,677
Click.

730
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:44,186
Yo, Adrian, are you hungry?

731
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:45,658
No.

732
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:50,061
I got some things in there. If you
like soda, some donuts or something.

733
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,362
A couple cupcakes.
Huh? No?

734
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:56,495
I think I got
some chocolate in there.

735
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:57,560
No?

736
00:48:05,614 --> 00:48:06,945
Hot in here, you know?

737
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:11,245
I could go for some music.

738
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:18,791
Yo, Adrian.

739
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,023
These are the exotic animals
I was tellin' you about.

740
00:48:22,097 --> 00:48:24,122
These are my friends
Cuff and Link.

741
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:25,461
I sold 'em to you.

742
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:27,194
Sure, I know you sold them to me.

743
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:29,829
Remember you were workin'
at that pet shop, huh?

744
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:32,999
First day you was there, I came in
and bought both these animals, huh?

745
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:34,336
Yeah, I remember that.

746
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:36,138
I came and I bought this bowl

747
00:48:36,211 --> 00:48:38,941
and I bought the, uh, bought
the animals themselves, some food,

748
00:48:39,014 --> 00:48:40,948
the marbles that go
in the bottom there.

749
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:42,847
Remember?
Remember that mountain?

750
00:48:42,918 --> 00:48:46,752
I had to get rid of that mountain, though,
'cause they kept falling over and flipping.

751
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:53,016
Yo, why don't you
come on over here and sit down?

752
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:55,590
Hmm?

753
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:58,258
It's a nice couch.
I don't know.

754
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:03,396
There's big bugs in there, you know.
It's safer over here.

755
00:49:05,473 --> 00:49:07,304
You wanna sit down?

756
00:49:13,448 --> 00:49:16,042
Uh, these...
these your parents?

757
00:49:16,117 --> 00:49:17,982
Yeah, that's...
that's both of them there.

758
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:19,281
Is this you?

759
00:49:19,354 --> 00:49:21,049
Yeah, that's me
when I was eight years old.

760
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:23,852
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

761
00:49:26,361 --> 00:49:29,694
Why don't you come on over
and make yourself comfortable? Relax.

762
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:36,359
Do you have a phone?

763
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:37,769
No, I ain't got no phone.

764
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,172
I had it pulled 'cause of people
calling all the time, and, uh,

765
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:44,871
who needs the aggravation,
right? The interruptions.

766
00:49:44,946 --> 00:49:46,140
Who'd you wanna call?

767
00:49:46,214 --> 00:49:48,808
I wanna let my brother
know where I am.

768
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:51,245
Why?

769
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:54,511
I think he might be worried.

770
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:57,422
Well, I'll call your brother,
if that's the problem.

771
00:50:00,328 --> 00:50:04,424
Yo, Paulie, your sister's with me!
I'll call yous back later!

772
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:05,659
See ya!

773
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:14,138
What's the matter?
You don't like the room, do ya.

774
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:15,540
It's fine.

775
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,737
Well, it's only temporary,
you know.

776
00:50:17,812 --> 00:50:18,972
It's not that.

777
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,809
What's the problem?

778
00:50:25,887 --> 00:50:27,377
You don't like me?

779
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,787
You don't like the turtles?
What's the problem?

780
00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:32,520
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's okay.

781
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:36,786
I don't belong here.

782
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:41,097
Well, you know, it's okay,
'cause you're my guest.

783
00:50:42,203 --> 00:50:45,400
I don't...
know you well enough.

784
00:50:45,473 --> 00:50:49,466
I've never been
in a man's apartment alone.

785
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:53,541
Well, I...
they're all the same. You know.

786
00:50:58,353 --> 00:51:00,184
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

787
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,415
I don't feel comfortable.

788
00:51:04,492 --> 00:51:07,655
Yo, Adrian, you know,
I ain't so comfortable either.

789
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:11,456
I should go.

790
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:14,525
Don't go, please.
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.

791
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,030
Don't go.

792
00:51:20,742 --> 00:51:22,334
Do me a favor?

793
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,570
What?

794
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:25,476
Take off these glasses.

795
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:31,408
You have nice eyes.

796
00:51:33,421 --> 00:51:34,911
Do me another favor?

797
00:51:36,424 --> 00:51:38,085
Would you take off that hat?

798
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:46,967
I always knew you was pretty.

799
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,835
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasing you.

800
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:56,132
I ain't teasin' ya.

801
00:51:57,545 --> 00:52:00,378
I just...
wanna kiss you.

802
00:52:02,784 --> 00:52:05,184
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't want.

803
00:52:06,054 --> 00:52:07,715
But I wanna kiss you.

804
00:53:20,195 --> 00:53:22,186
Worm, I heard
you had a fight comin' up.

805
00:53:22,263 --> 00:53:25,096
Yeah, I'm gonna fight
next month.

806
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:28,431
That's good, man. You come down to
the gym, we'll see that you get in shape.

807
00:53:28,503 --> 00:53:29,663
How's your weight?

808
00:53:29,737 --> 00:53:32,069
- I weigh 175.
- Hey, Rock. How you doin', babe?

809
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,472
- Hey.
- Oh, Mick was lookin' for you up there.

810
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:35,600
- For me?
- Yeah.

811
00:53:35,677 --> 00:53:37,076
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

812
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:40,080
He was lookin' for you, Jack.
Get on up there and see him.

813
00:53:40,148 --> 00:53:41,672
Yeah. It ain't locked, right?

814
00:53:41,749 --> 00:53:43,842
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, go on, man.

815
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,963
Hey, you got somethin' for me?

816
00:54:00,034 --> 00:54:02,764
Yeah, there was some guy here
from Miles Jergens lookin' for you.

817
00:54:02,837 --> 00:54:04,828
They need sparring partners
for Apollo Creed.

818
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:06,396
- You're puttin' me on.
- There's the card.

819
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:08,203
- When was he here?
- About an hour ago.

820
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:10,938
They're probably lookin' for
sparrin' partners for Creed, you know?

821
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:14,003
I said that before,
you dumb dago!

822
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:18,841
I've been comin' here for six years,
and six years you been stickin' it to me.

823
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,182
I wanna know how come.

824
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:21,552
You don't wanna know.

825
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:23,318
Yeah, I wanna know how come.

826
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:25,382
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know!

827
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,291
Okay, I'm gonna tell ya!

828
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:30,263
'Cause you had the talent
to become a good fighter,

829
00:54:30,331 --> 00:54:31,730
and instead of that,

830
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:36,566
you became a leg-breaker
to some cheap, second-rate loan shark.

831
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:37,969
It's a livin'.

832
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:39,904
It's a waste of life!

833
00:54:58,259 --> 00:55:00,090
Yes, may I help you?

834
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:09,530
Oh! You must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
Mr. Jergens is expecting you.

835
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:10,935
Just a moment.

836
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,401
Mr. Rocky Balboa
to see you, sir.

837
00:55:19,113 --> 00:55:20,171
Fine.

838
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:23,610
- Will you please go in, Mr. Balboa.
- Can I have that?

839
00:55:23,685 --> 00:55:25,175
Oh, certainly.

840
00:55:25,253 --> 00:55:26,413
Thanks.

841
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:32,252
Mr. Balboa.

842
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,691
How are you?
George Jergens.

843
00:55:34,762 --> 00:55:36,354
Take a chair, please.

844
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:37,591
Thanks.

845
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,231
Mr. Balboa.

846
00:55:41,302 --> 00:55:43,293
- Call me Rocky.
- Rocky.

847
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:45,362
Tell me, Rocky,
you got any representation?

848
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,930
You have a manager?

849
00:55:47,008 --> 00:55:48,942
- No. It's just me.
- Oh.

850
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:54,245
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

851
00:55:54,315 --> 00:55:57,307
- Uh, sparrin'?
- Beg your pardon?

852
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:59,876
Well, it's just I know
you're lookin' for sparrin' partners,

853
00:55:59,954 --> 00:56:02,218
and I just wanna say
I'm very available, you know.

854
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,348
I'm sure you are.

855
00:56:03,424 --> 00:56:05,585
Absolutely. Sparrin' with the Champ
would be an honor.

856
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,321
- And you know what, Mr. Jergens?
- What?

857
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:11,058
I wouldn't take no cheap shots, either.
I'd really be a good sparring partner.

858
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:12,963
You don't understand me, Rocky.

859
00:56:13,835 --> 00:56:15,666
My proposition is this...

860
00:56:16,537 --> 00:56:19,028
Would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creed

861
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:21,268
for the World
Heavyweight Championship?

862
00:56:26,381 --> 00:56:27,712
No.

863
00:56:27,782 --> 00:56:29,477
Listen, Rocky...

864
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:32,082
Apollo's seen you fight.

865
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,481
He likes you.
He wants to fight you.

866
00:56:36,557 --> 00:56:38,491
Well, it's just that, you see, uh...

867
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,494
I fight in clubs, you know.
I'm really a ham-and-egger.

868
00:56:41,562 --> 00:56:44,963
This guy... he's the best, and, uh,
it wouldn't be such a good fight.

869
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:47,364
But thank you very much,
you know.

870
00:56:47,435 --> 00:56:49,300
I appreciate it and all that.

871
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:54,137
Rocky? Do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

872
00:56:55,009 --> 00:56:56,601
Yeah.

873
00:56:56,677 --> 00:56:59,009
Apollo Creed does.

874
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,014
And he's gonna prove it
to the whole world

875
00:57:01,082 --> 00:57:03,983
by giving an unknown
a shot at the title.

876
00:57:04,051 --> 00:57:07,020
And that unknown is you.

877
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:08,646
He picked you, Rocky.

878
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:12,582
Rocky, it's the chance
of a lifetime.

879
00:57:13,428 --> 00:57:15,760
You can't pass it by.

880
00:57:16,864 --> 00:57:18,263
What do you say?

881
00:57:23,337 --> 00:57:25,396
<i>All right, fellas, fellas.</i>
<i>That's enough pictures.</i>

882
00:57:25,473 --> 00:57:27,236
<i>We wanna ask Apollo</i>
<i>a few questions.</i>

883
00:57:27,308 --> 00:57:29,970
<i>Apollo, how do you like</i>
<i>the city of brotherly love?</i>

884
00:57:30,044 --> 00:57:33,377
<i>Well, just being in Philadelphia</i>
<i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>

885
00:57:33,448 --> 00:57:34,938
<i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i>

886
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:37,280
<i>comin' up to me on the street</i>
<i>wishing me the best.</i>

887
00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:40,582
<i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,</i>
<i>and I'm proud to be an American.</i>

888
00:57:40,655 --> 00:57:43,488
<i>Champ, Apollo,</i>
<i>why did you agree to fight a man</i>

889
00:57:43,558 --> 00:57:45,992
<i>who has virtually</i>
<i>no chance of winning?</i>

890
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,051
<i>Look, if history proves one thing,</i>

891
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:51,724
<i>American history proves</i>
<i>that everybody's got a chance to win.</i>

892
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:54,734
<i>Didn't you guys ever hear</i>
<i>of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

893
00:57:54,802 --> 00:57:56,793
<i>- Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

894
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:59,203
<i>It is a coincidence</i>
<i>that you're fighting a white man</i>

895
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:01,434
<i>on the most celebrated day</i>
<i>in the country's history?</i>

896
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:02,771
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

897
00:58:02,844 --> 00:58:05,039
<i>Is it a coincidence</i>
<i>that he's fighting a black man</i>

898
00:58:05,112 --> 00:58:07,273
<i>on the most celebrated day</i>
<i>in the country's history?</i>

899
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:08,940
<i>Right on!</i>
<i>Tell the truth, brother!</i>

900
00:58:09,016 --> 00:58:11,746
<i>Listen, Apollo, tell me... how do you</i>
<i>feel about your challenger?</i>

901
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:13,309
<i>- How do I feel about him?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

902
00:58:13,387 --> 00:58:15,150
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>Come here, Rock.</i>

903
00:58:15,223 --> 00:58:17,885
<i>My main man,</i>
<i>Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i>

904
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:19,221
<i>Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>

905
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:21,124
<i>Well, now, what does that mean?</i>

906
00:58:21,195 --> 00:58:24,426
<i>It means if he can't fight,</i>
<i>I bet he can cook.</i>

907
00:58:24,499 --> 00:58:25,659
<i>All right, Rocky.</i>

908
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:28,395
Do me a favor.
His lungs... punch 'em out.

909
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:29,868
Paulie.

910
00:58:29,937 --> 00:58:33,202
<i>But, Rocky, how do you expect</i>
<i>to fight Apollo Creed?</i>

911
00:58:33,274 --> 00:58:35,504
<i>Uh, well, geez, you know.</i>
<i>Creed's the best.</i>

912
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:37,840
<i>I guess I'll have to do</i>
<i>the best I can.</i>

913
00:58:37,912 --> 00:58:40,312
<i>Tell me, Rocky,</i>
<i>just between us...</i>

914
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:43,441
<i>where did you get the name</i>
<i>"Italian Stallion"?</i>

915
00:58:43,518 --> 00:58:46,851
<i>Oh... uh, I invented that</i>
<i>about eight years ago</i>

916
00:58:46,921 --> 00:58:48,354
<i>when I was eatin' dinner.</i>

917
00:58:48,422 --> 00:58:53,121
<i>Rocky, now your payday</i>
<i>will be $150.000.</i>

918
00:58:53,194 --> 00:58:54,593
<i>Any comment?</i>

919
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:59,122
<i>You... you got no comment,</i>
<i>Rocky, right? No comment.</i>

920
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,531
<i>Right.</i>
<i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>

921
00:59:00,601 --> 00:59:03,331
<i>Wait a minute. I just wanna</i>
<i>say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i>

922
00:59:03,404 --> 00:59:06,862
<i>- I, uh...</i>
<i>- Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.</i>

923
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:09,933
<i>Look at this. Can you believe</i>
<i>all this? They put a microphone on me.</i>

924
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:11,876
- You didn't.
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>

925
00:59:11,946 --> 00:59:16,178
<i>- Quit pushin', man!</i>
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>

926
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,845
Don't it matter he's makin' you
out a fool? I'd break his lips.

927
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:23,550
- He's taking cheap shots.
- It don't bother me none.

928
00:59:23,624 --> 00:59:28,755
Yo, Rock... I guess you'll be looking
for people to help you out.

929
00:59:28,829 --> 00:59:33,198
- Help in what?
- Keep you livin' the clean life.

930
00:59:33,267 --> 00:59:35,497
I'll do okay. You know.

931
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,299
You need someone to help
with the exercise,

932
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:41,467
and someone standing by with a towel,
or runnin' errands. You know.

933
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:44,272
Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared
about me yesterday, huh? Nobody.

934
00:59:44,345 --> 00:59:46,973
So I just think I'm
gonna train myself, you know.

935
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:49,107
Without such good people
around to help,

936
00:59:49,183 --> 00:59:51,208
you don't have
such a good chance.

937
00:59:51,285 --> 00:59:54,618
Einstein flunked out of school twice.

938
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:56,213
That so?

939
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,348
Yeah.

940
00:59:57,425 --> 01:00:00,417
Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind.

941
01:00:00,494 --> 01:00:02,428
I think Rocky's
got a good chance.

942
01:00:08,736 --> 01:00:10,397
Want me to get you
a beer, Paulie?

943
01:00:10,471 --> 01:00:14,635
Hey, you lookin' to do a good deed?
Keep out of my freakin' life!

944
01:00:15,776 --> 01:00:17,437
- What'd I do?
- Nothin'.

945
01:00:17,511 --> 01:00:21,106
- What? Did I say something wrong?
- You didn't say nothin'. It's all right.

946
01:00:21,182 --> 01:00:24,583
That's right... you didn't say nothin'!
Nothin' at all!

947
01:00:26,654 --> 01:00:28,713
- I gotta go.
- Oh.

948
01:00:29,457 --> 01:00:31,220
Where's the freakin' pretzels?!

949
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:38,822
I got the pretzels!
Hey! We ain't got any beer?

950
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:41,995
I thought you were supposed
to pick up some beer.

951
01:00:50,678 --> 01:00:53,169
How'd you like hearing
your name on TV tonight?

952
01:00:55,282 --> 01:00:58,115
I was shocked.
Why'd you do that?

953
01:00:58,185 --> 01:01:00,016
Come on.
You're puttin' me on, right?

954
01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:01,918
Absolutely.

955
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:03,650
What time should I expect you?

956
01:01:03,724 --> 01:01:05,214
Oh, about 7:00.

957
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:07,216
Hey.

958
01:01:21,755 --> 01:01:22,744
Hey...

959
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:28,387
You know how I said that stuff
on TV didn't bother me none?

960
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:29,621
Yeah.

961
01:01:32,465 --> 01:01:33,727
It did.

962
01:01:44,044 --> 01:01:47,536
Listen, the reason I brought you here
is because, uh...

963
01:01:47,614 --> 01:01:50,344
I wanna know if you got any money
for training expenses, eh?

964
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:51,975
I got a few dollars.

965
01:01:52,052 --> 01:01:54,452
A few bucks? Well, here.
Put this in your glove.

966
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:57,285
- What's this?
- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.

967
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,589
You know, you ain't never
had any luck,

968
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,528
but I think this time Lady Luck may be
in your corner. What do you think?

969
01:02:04,598 --> 01:02:06,259
Maybe. Maybe.

970
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:08,198
Hey, thanks for the money,
Tony, you know.

971
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:10,668
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
See ya, all right?

972
01:02:11,905 --> 01:02:13,395
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

973
01:02:13,473 --> 01:02:15,407
You're in training, huh?
Come on.

974
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:16,533
Hey.

975
01:02:23,984 --> 01:02:25,576
- Yo, Tony.
- What?

976
01:02:26,186 --> 01:02:28,518
You gonna show up at the fight?

977
01:02:28,588 --> 01:02:29,850
Ringside.

978
01:02:29,923 --> 01:02:31,083
Hey, ey.

979
01:02:32,425 --> 01:02:33,585
I'll see ya.

980
01:03:08,962 --> 01:03:10,054
Yeah?

981
01:03:15,669 --> 01:03:19,571
Hello, kid. I seen your light.
Can I come in?

982
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:21,470
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, good.

983
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:24,032
Hey, it's a nice place here.

984
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:28,046
All right, anyway,
what I come to tell you is that, uh...

985
01:03:28,815 --> 01:03:32,216
that what happened to you
is freak luck.

986
01:03:32,285 --> 01:03:35,777
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.

987
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:39,416
Now, they're good fighters, right?
They're colorful, they got good records.

988
01:03:39,492 --> 01:03:42,154
They fight their guts out
for peanuts.

989
01:03:42,228 --> 01:03:45,959
But you...
you get a shot at the title.

990
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:47,693
Freak luck is a strange thing.

991
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:49,997
Yeah, sure it is.
Can I sit down?

992
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,230
Yeah, sure.

993
01:03:52,339 --> 01:03:53,829
What the hell are those?

994
01:03:53,907 --> 01:03:55,636
Oh, those are domestic turtles.

995
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:58,405
The one on the top is Cuff
and the other guy's Link.

996
01:03:58,478 --> 01:03:59,968
The rest of them are marbles.

997
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:02,276
Yeah? They make good soup,
don't they?

998
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:08,845
Anyway, look... I'm here to warn ya
that you gotta be very careful

999
01:04:08,922 --> 01:04:11,857
about this shot
that you got at the title,

1000
01:04:11,925 --> 01:04:14,587
because, I don't know,
like the Bible says...

1001
01:04:14,661 --> 01:04:16,993
you ain't gonna get
a second chance.

1002
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:19,054
Yeah. All right.

1003
01:04:19,132 --> 01:04:20,963
You thought of that, huh?

1004
01:04:21,034 --> 01:04:25,130
Well, what you need
is a manager.

1005
01:04:25,205 --> 01:04:27,366
A manager.
Listen to me.

1006
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,035
I know because I've been
in this racket for 50 years.

1007
01:04:31,111 --> 01:04:32,510
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years.

1008
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:35,912
God, I've seen it all.
All of it.

1009
01:04:35,982 --> 01:04:37,973
- You know what I done?
- What?

1010
01:04:38,051 --> 01:04:39,985
I have done it all.

1011
01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:43,784
You shoulda seen me when I
knocked Giny Russo outta the ring.

1012
01:04:43,857 --> 01:04:47,918
Outta the goddamn ring.
That's, uh, September the 14th, 1923.

1013
01:04:47,994 --> 01:04:52,158
And it was the same night that Firpo
knocks Dempsey outta the ring.

1014
01:04:52,232 --> 01:04:54,894
The same night. So, who gets
the publicity? Figure that out.

1015
01:04:54,968 --> 01:04:56,629
- Dempsey.
- That's right. But why?

1016
01:04:56,703 --> 01:05:01,003
- 'Cause he was Champ.
- No! Because he had a manager.

1017
01:05:01,074 --> 01:05:03,065
I had nothin', man.

1018
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,301
I wanna show you somethin'.
Look at my face for a minute.

1019
01:05:06,379 --> 01:05:09,780
Look at this.
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.

1020
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:12,443
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

1021
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:16,114
You know what?
I had my nose busted 17 times.

1022
01:05:16,189 --> 01:05:20,353
The last time was
with that fight with Sailor Mike.

1023
01:05:20,427 --> 01:05:23,487
I got that clip in here.
That was a good fight.

1024
01:05:23,563 --> 01:05:24,894
You wanna read that?

1025
01:05:25,732 --> 01:05:27,723
You... oh, it doesn't matter.

1026
01:05:27,801 --> 01:05:31,293
Anyway, he put this vegetation
on my ear.

1027
01:05:32,405 --> 01:05:35,897
Ah, Rocky Marciano.

1028
01:05:36,743 --> 01:05:40,804
You know, you kinda remind me
of the Rock, you know that?

1029
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,040
You really think so?

1030
01:05:42,115 --> 01:05:46,643
That's right. You move like him,
and you got heart like he did.

1031
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,485
Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

1032
01:05:53,927 --> 01:05:55,758
Uh... anyway,

1033
01:05:55,829 --> 01:05:59,162
you know, when I begun
in this business, kid...

1034
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:05,067
Look, kid, I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

1035
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:06,969
You know, it's no good for you.

1036
01:06:07,974 --> 01:06:09,965
If you don't mind my sayin'.

1037
01:06:10,043 --> 01:06:11,977
Anyway, you know,
when I started this racket,

1038
01:06:12,045 --> 01:06:14,206
pugs like us,
we was treated like dogs.

1039
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,771
For ten bucks,
you gotta tear somebody's throat out.

1040
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:19,785
But I never had no management.
You know...

1041
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:23,583
One time,
this... this son of a bitch that I fought,

1042
01:06:23,656 --> 01:06:25,647
he put a nail right there.

1043
01:06:25,725 --> 01:06:27,886
- Thumb.
- The thumb, yeah. In the glove.

1044
01:06:27,961 --> 01:06:30,293
And he punched
so many holes in my face.

1045
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:33,491
I had the spit
shootin' out of my cheeks.

1046
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:34,964
Can you imagine that?

1047
01:06:35,635 --> 01:06:39,298
Anyway, I'll tell ya what I looked like
when I was, uh, in my prime.

1048
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:42,341
I want you to look at some...
will you look at that? Look at that.

1049
01:06:42,408 --> 01:06:46,469
That's the way I looked...
before these guys got at me.

1050
01:06:46,546 --> 01:06:50,539
That's nice. You take very
good care of the picture, though.

1051
01:06:50,617 --> 01:06:51,948
But I never had...

1052
01:06:52,018 --> 01:06:54,350
I never had no management...
that's the trouble!

1053
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,752
But now I got all this knowledge.
I got it up here.

1054
01:06:56,823 --> 01:06:59,087
Now I wanna give it to you!

1055
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:01,423
I wanna give you this knowledge.
I wanna take care of you.

1056
01:07:01,494 --> 01:07:05,294
I wanna make sure that all this shit that
happened to me doesn't happen to you.

1057
01:07:05,365 --> 01:07:06,855
You know what I mean?

1058
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,190
The fight's set.

1059
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:11,567
Listen to me.
I wanna be your manager.

1060
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:15,734
- You follow that, do you?
- The fight's set. I don't need a manager.

1061
01:07:15,808 --> 01:07:17,799
But you can't buy
what I'm gonna give you.

1062
01:07:17,877 --> 01:07:19,970
I mean, I've got pain
and I've got experience.

1063
01:07:20,046 --> 01:07:22,810
Well, I got pain
and I got experience, too.

1064
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,015
Listen, kid...

1065
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:27,143
- Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.
- What?

1066
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:30,155
I needed your help about
ten years ago, right? Ten years ago?

1067
01:07:30,223 --> 01:07:32,555
- Right.
- You never helped me. You didn't care.

1068
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:34,616
Well, if you wanted help...

1069
01:07:34,694 --> 01:07:37,026
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you ask?

1070
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:38,927
Why didn't you
just ask me, kid?

1071
01:07:38,998 --> 01:07:41,558
<i>Look, I asked,</i>
<i>but you never heard nothin'!</i>

1072
01:07:42,602 --> 01:07:43,864
Well, I...

1073
01:07:45,538 --> 01:07:47,130
I, uh...

1074
01:07:47,207 --> 01:07:50,540
I know I...
I'm 76 years old.

1075
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:58,049
And, uh... well.

1076
01:08:06,926 --> 01:08:08,416
Where the hell is...

1077
01:08:31,985 --> 01:08:33,976
Took you long enough to get here.

1078
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:37,182
Took you ten years
to come to my house?

1079
01:08:37,257 --> 01:08:39,418
Huh, what's the matter?
You don't like my house?

1080
01:08:40,226 --> 01:08:41,557
Does my house stink?

1081
01:08:42,662 --> 01:08:44,391
That's right... it stinks!

1082
01:08:44,464 --> 01:08:47,456
<i>I didn't have no favors from you!</i>

1083
01:08:47,533 --> 01:08:49,262
<i>Don't slum around me!</i>

1084
01:08:50,003 --> 01:08:52,403
Talkin' about your prime.

1085
01:08:52,472 --> 01:08:54,463
What about my prime, Mick?!

1086
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,371
<i>At least you had a prime!</i>

1087
01:08:57,477 --> 01:08:59,536
I didn't have no prime.
I didn't have nothin'!

1088
01:08:59,612 --> 01:09:02,604
Leg's are goin', everything is goin',
Nobody's gettin' no nothin'.

1089
01:09:02,682 --> 01:09:04,843
Guy comes up, offers me a fight.
Big deal.

1090
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:07,613
Wanna fight the fight?
Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

1091
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:11,453
<i>I wouldn't wanna fight. Know what's</i>
<i>gonna happen to me? I'm gonna get that!</i>

1092
01:09:11,524 --> 01:09:12,923
I'm gonna get that!

1093
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,393
And you wanna be ringside
to see it? Do ya?

1094
01:09:17,463 --> 01:09:18,896
You wanna help me out?

1095
01:09:18,965 --> 01:09:21,627
<i>Huh? Do you wanna see me</i>
<i>get my face kicked in?!</i>

1096
01:09:21,701 --> 01:09:23,532
<i>Legs ain't workin',</i>
<i>nothing's workin',</i>

1097
01:09:23,603 --> 01:09:26,128
<i>but they go.</i>
<i>"Go on, fight the champ."</i>

1098
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:27,970
Yeah, I'll fight him.

1099
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:32,639
Get my face kicked in.

1100
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:36,173
And you come around here.
You wanna move in here with me?!

1101
01:09:36,249 --> 01:09:38,183
Come on in!
It's a nice house!

1102
01:09:39,052 --> 01:09:42,044
Real nice.
Come on in and move. It stinks!

1103
01:09:43,122 --> 01:09:44,953
This whole place stinks.

1104
01:09:45,758 --> 01:09:49,250
<i>You wanna help me out?</i>
<i>Well, help me out!</i>

1105
01:09:49,329 --> 01:09:51,593
<i>Come on, help me out.</i>
<i>I'm standin' here!</i>

1106
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:54,587
<i>It's only about 28 degrees.</i>
<i>We'll check that forecast in just a minute.</i>

1107
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,925
<i>I feel very mischievous.</i>
<i>Very weird. Very...</i>

1108
01:10:58,765 --> 01:11:01,165
<i>Well, the thing is,</i>
<i>I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>

1109
01:11:01,234 --> 01:11:04,294
<i>When I hit the seats this morning,</i>
<i>I just went. "Whew!"</i>

1110
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,429
<i>I'm thinkin', if I'm up,</i>

1111
01:11:06,506 --> 01:11:09,669
<i>everybody in the Delaware Valley</i>
<i>should be up. Do you agree with me?</i>

1112
01:11:09,742 --> 01:11:13,075
<i>I mean, at three minutes past 4:00,</i>
<i>what else are you gonna do?</i>

1113
01:11:15,648 --> 01:11:17,479
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i>

1114
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,212
<i>This is Don Cannon,</i>
<i>W-I-B-G Philadelphia.</i>

1115
01:11:20,286 --> 01:11:21,776
<i>- How are you this morning?</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>

1116
01:11:21,854 --> 01:11:23,185
<i>- Mrs. Kramer?</i>
<i>- What?!</i>

1117
01:11:23,256 --> 01:11:27,920
<i>I think you have a lot of nerve calling me</i>
<i>at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!</i>

1118
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:35,166
<i>W-I-B-G</i>

1119
01:11:35,234 --> 01:11:40,695
<i>Philadelphia</i>

1120
01:11:41,374 --> 01:11:43,638
<i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,</i>
<i>and it's a good morning.</i>

1121
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:47,873
<i>I tell ya, I need someone to snuggle with,</i>
<i>28 degrees. It's cold out there.</i>

1122
01:11:47,947 --> 01:11:50,939
<i>We deserve it. We've been getting away</i>
<i>with murder the last couple weeks.</i>

1123
01:11:51,017 --> 01:11:53,417
<i>Our high today could possibly</i>
<i>be 58, and that's it.</i>

1124
01:11:53,486 --> 01:11:55,977
<i>Tonight we're back down</i>
<i>on the 20 degree range,</i>

1125
01:11:56,055 --> 01:11:59,718
<i>a little colder in the suburbs,</i>
<i>and tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i>

1126
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,123
<i>we may hit 40 somewhere.</i>

1127
01:12:01,194 --> 01:12:03,025
<i>But it's 28, it's awfully chilly.</i>

1128
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:06,155
<i>Make sure you have it</i>
<i>snuggled on before you bring it out.</i>

1129
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,371
Come on.

1130
01:14:30,209 --> 01:14:32,700
Stinks in... hey, come on.
It stinks in here, you know.

1131
01:14:32,778 --> 01:14:34,837
Yeah... I know.

1132
01:14:36,582 --> 01:14:38,413
Hey, did you kill all these things?

1133
01:14:39,418 --> 01:14:41,249
No. Across the street.

1134
01:14:43,623 --> 01:14:45,955
This place is like
an animal morgue, you know?

1135
01:14:46,659 --> 01:14:49,321
- It's a little cold in here, ain't it?
- Yeah.

1136
01:14:54,233 --> 01:14:55,894
Who killed all these things?

1137
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:58,192
What, are you crazy, Paulie?

1138
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:00,534
If you don't pay Gazzo,
you end up on the hook.

1139
01:15:00,606 --> 01:15:02,938
Come on, Gazzo's a good man.
You know that.

1140
01:15:03,009 --> 01:15:04,840
Hey, don't get excited.
I know that.

1141
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:08,744
That's why I want you to talk to him
about me... the collectin' job.

1142
01:15:08,814 --> 01:15:11,214
Get me out
of this stinkin' freezer.

1143
01:15:11,283 --> 01:15:12,944
Why don't you do yourself a favor?

1144
01:15:13,019 --> 01:15:15,852
Why don't you keep this job,
because you eat better, you know?

1145
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:18,613
Moo.

1146
01:15:18,691 --> 01:15:20,283
Does it ever snow in here?

1147
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:24,122
Uh... you and my sister.

1148
01:15:24,196 --> 01:15:26,027
How you gettin' along together?

1149
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:27,859
How do you think?

1150
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:31,999
Well, I'm not sure, Rock.
What's the story?

1151
01:15:32,071 --> 01:15:34,005
About what?

1152
01:15:34,073 --> 01:15:36,473
What's the story?
What's happening?

1153
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:38,271
Do you really like her?

1154
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:39,675
Sure, I like her.

1155
01:15:42,048 --> 01:15:44,312
I don't see it.
What's the attraction?

1156
01:15:45,685 --> 01:15:49,177
I don't know.
It fills gaps, I guess.

1157
01:15:49,255 --> 01:15:51,917
- What's gaps?
- I don't know. Gaps.

1158
01:15:51,991 --> 01:15:55,791
She's got gaps, I got gaps.
Together, we fill gaps. I don't know.

1159
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,029
You ballin' her?

1160
01:15:59,765 --> 01:16:00,823
Hey.

1161
01:16:01,467 --> 01:16:03,958
Hey, you don't talk dirty
about your sister.

1162
01:16:05,805 --> 01:16:07,830
Are you screwin' my sister?

1163
01:16:10,543 --> 01:16:14,138
You see? That's why I can't connect
you with Gazzo, you know that, Paulie?

1164
01:16:14,213 --> 01:16:17,842
Because you got a big mouth,
you know. You just talk too much.

1165
01:16:17,917 --> 01:16:20,078
It's gettin' cold in here.
I'm going home.

1166
01:16:20,152 --> 01:16:23,053
Cold in here?!
It is cold in here!

1167
01:16:23,122 --> 01:16:25,283
It stinks in here,
and you stink!

1168
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:56,080
Hey, you're breakin' the ribs.

1169
01:17:15,574 --> 01:17:19,066
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

1170
01:17:21,614 --> 01:17:23,605
I'll see ya tomorrow morning, okay?

1171
01:17:36,495 --> 01:17:38,827
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

1172
01:17:39,498 --> 01:17:43,662
You know, your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

1173
01:17:53,445 --> 01:17:56,778
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just... I'm just sore, okay?

1174
01:17:56,849 --> 01:17:58,339
I'll just... just sit here.

1175
01:17:58,417 --> 01:18:00,578
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1176
01:18:04,323 --> 01:18:06,655
Hey, come on.
No foolin' around, all right?

1177
01:18:07,493 --> 01:18:08,653
I'm tired.

1178
01:18:09,562 --> 01:18:11,553
Hey, Adrian,
I'm serious now.

1179
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:15,122
There's no foolin' around during training,
understand? I wanna stay strong.

1180
01:18:15,801 --> 01:18:18,133
- You're not kiddin'?
- No, I ain't kiddin'.

1181
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,301
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1182
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,707
Listen, why don't you
just make the meat, okay?

1183
01:18:28,347 --> 01:18:29,837
Okay, I'll make the meat.

1184
01:18:54,106 --> 01:18:55,266
Yo.

1185
01:18:56,909 --> 01:18:59,070
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1186
01:18:59,678 --> 01:19:00,736
Hey.

1187
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:27,603
Right, right.
Left, left.

1188
01:19:29,408 --> 01:19:31,069
Underneath.
Come on, underneath.

1189
01:19:31,744 --> 01:19:34,577
Underneath, underneath,
underneath. Come on!

1190
01:19:34,647 --> 01:19:35,978
Hold it. Hold it.

1191
01:19:36,048 --> 01:19:38,539
Hold it, Rock, will ya?
You drive me crazy.

1192
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:40,949
You're so sloppy
because you're off balance.

1193
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:44,183
Let's try this. Now, take this string.
Tie it to both ankles.

1194
01:19:44,256 --> 01:19:46,087
Leave about two feet of slack.

1195
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:47,750
I ain't never had good footwork.

1196
01:19:47,826 --> 01:19:49,817
Never mind footwork.
Now you're all balanced.

1197
01:19:49,895 --> 01:19:54,889
Marciano had the same problem,
and this string cured it.

1198
01:19:54,967 --> 01:19:56,127
Here's the idea...

1199
01:19:56,201 --> 01:19:59,762
that if you can move and you can hit
without breaking the string,

1200
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:00,998
you got balance.

1201
01:20:01,073 --> 01:20:03,200
You become
a very dangerous person.

1202
01:20:03,275 --> 01:20:05,266
- You follow?
- You're lookin' good, Rock.

1203
01:20:05,344 --> 01:20:06,675
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

1204
01:20:06,745 --> 01:20:08,406
That's it. That's it.
Underneath.

1205
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,072
- Hey, Rock.
- What?

1206
01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:12,549
- How 'bout you give us your autograph?
- Get outta here!

1207
01:20:12,618 --> 01:20:15,553
Don't you ever interrupt me
while I'm conducting business.

1208
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:18,055
Move your little
chicken asses out of here.

1209
01:20:18,123 --> 01:20:22,457
Listen, kid. You!
You lay off that pet shop dame.

1210
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,156
Women weaken legs.

1211
01:20:26,165 --> 01:20:28,429
Yeah, but I really like
this girl, you know?

1212
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,331
Then let her train ya!

1213
01:20:33,138 --> 01:20:36,699
- Okay, no more foolin' around.
- Okay. Now hit it.

1214
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:40,674
Women weaken legs, huh?

1215
01:20:45,184 --> 01:20:47,015
- Yo, Rock.
- Yo, Rocky.

1216
01:20:53,726 --> 01:20:54,784
Yo.

1217
01:20:56,295 --> 01:20:57,353
Yo.

1218
01:20:57,429 --> 01:20:59,124
Yo, you look great.

1219
01:20:59,965 --> 01:21:01,796
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1220
01:21:01,867 --> 01:21:04,961
Terrific. I mean,
you could be a heartbreaker.

1221
01:21:05,037 --> 01:21:06,698
You'll walk down the street
breaking hearts,

1222
01:21:06,772 --> 01:21:08,831
the way you're lookin'...
very sharp.

1223
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:11,341
I got... I got another surprise for you.

1224
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:12,570
What?

1225
01:21:13,412 --> 01:21:18,042
Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus!
Come here, kid! Come here!

1226
01:21:18,117 --> 01:21:19,744
To keep you company
when you run.

1227
01:21:25,324 --> 01:21:28,259
Come on in and meet the family.
The owner ever come back?

1228
01:21:28,327 --> 01:21:31,455
- He's yours. He's yours if you want him.
- Do I want him? Come here!

1229
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,361
What's he eat... this dog?

1230
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:36,265
- He eats little turtles.
- Yo, Butkus!

1231
01:21:59,858 --> 01:22:03,760
What's that, Butkus, huh?
Whose truck is this? Come on.

1232
01:22:05,998 --> 01:22:08,330
One call from me,
you're a celebrity.

1233
01:22:10,702 --> 01:22:13,637
- You're gonna need exposure.
- Oh, don't breathe on me, Paulie!

1234
01:22:13,705 --> 01:22:16,196
That's the big time!
Don't I know about these things?

1235
01:22:16,275 --> 01:22:18,505
You don't know nothin'!
What do these guys want from me?

1236
01:22:18,577 --> 01:22:20,238
To watch you train! Boom.

1237
01:22:20,312 --> 01:22:22,974
What is the matter with you, Paulie?
This was supposed to be private.

1238
01:22:23,048 --> 01:22:25,642
- I'm doin' you a favor!
- You ain't doin' me no favors!

1239
01:22:25,717 --> 01:22:27,378
You're embarrassin' me
in front of everybody,

1240
01:22:27,453 --> 01:22:29,853
you make me look bad
in front of your sister...

1241
01:22:29,922 --> 01:22:33,756
You see this cigar? I'll stick it
in your ear. Don't do these things to me!

1242
01:22:33,826 --> 01:22:36,317
You should've called me up
or something... leave a message.

1243
01:22:36,395 --> 01:22:38,056
Don't do that!

1244
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:39,859
My sister really likes you.

1245
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:44,295
I'm gonna kill you one of these days,
I swear to God!

1246
01:22:44,369 --> 01:22:45,427
Come on. Come on.

1247
01:22:45,504 --> 01:22:47,631
- Baby!
- Baby.

1248
01:22:47,706 --> 01:22:51,437
Here he is, the next
heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa!

1249
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,000
Hi, there. Rocky Balboa.

1250
01:22:53,078 --> 01:22:55,672
Listen, we wanna get a brief interview
with you. It won't take long.

1251
01:22:55,747 --> 01:22:57,146
- What about me?
- What about you?

1252
01:22:57,216 --> 01:22:59,707
- I'm in charge of the meat.
- Fine. Will you stand behind it, please?

1253
01:22:59,785 --> 01:23:01,946
Listen, just settle yourself in.
Just relax.

1254
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,853
What we're going to do is
just ask you a few questions, Rocky.

1255
01:23:04,923 --> 01:23:07,414
Just a few questions
about your unique training method.

1256
01:23:07,493 --> 01:23:08,824
Talk to the folks at home.

1257
01:23:08,894 --> 01:23:11,055
They really wanna know
how you got into this.

1258
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:12,859
I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.

1259
01:23:12,931 --> 01:23:14,421
Jimmy, you guys ready?
Let's roll.

1260
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,331
Rocky, why don't you turn
right around here.

1261
01:23:16,401 --> 01:23:18,392
Just don't take no cheap shots,
you know?

1262
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,461
No, I won't do that.
Just relax, Rocky.

1263
01:23:20,539 --> 01:23:23,872
Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

1264
01:23:23,942 --> 01:23:27,275
- The reason we're standing...
- The meat guy's stickin' his face in.

1265
01:23:28,413 --> 01:23:30,574
Let's try it again, Rocky.

1266
01:23:30,649 --> 01:23:34,483
<i>Today we're here with</i>
<i>heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>

1267
01:23:34,553 --> 01:23:36,953
<i>The reason we're standing</i>
<i>in this refrigerated box</i>

1268
01:23:37,022 --> 01:23:40,287
<i>is that Mr. Balboa has</i>
<i>an unusual method of training.</i>

1269
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:42,190
<i>In a moment,</i>
<i>he's going to demonstrate that</i>

1270
01:23:42,261 --> 01:23:43,922
<i>for the viewing audience at home.</i>

1271
01:23:43,996 --> 01:23:47,989
<i>But first, Rocky, how did you</i>
<i>come to train in an icebox?</i>

1272
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:50,466
<i>Uh, well, my friend...</i>
<i>the guy over there...</i>

1273
01:23:50,536 --> 01:23:53,596
<i>let me in one day and I hit</i>
<i>the beef here and kinda liked it.</i>

1274
01:23:53,672 --> 01:23:57,335
<i>And since I become a challenger,</i>
<i>the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>

1275
01:23:57,409 --> 01:24:01,470
<i>Is this a common training method?</i>
<i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>

1276
01:24:01,547 --> 01:24:03,378
<i>No, I think I invented it.</i>

1277
01:24:03,448 --> 01:24:06,781
Don't forget to confirm the reservation
for my people at ringside,

1278
01:24:06,852 --> 01:24:08,979
and be sure
to fly my barber to Philly.

1279
01:24:13,192 --> 01:24:16,025
How much is being channeled into
West Coast closed circuit advertising?

1280
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:18,494
- $300,000.
- Make it 450.

1281
01:24:18,564 --> 01:24:20,725
And send the mayor's wife
200 roses from me,

1282
01:24:20,799 --> 01:24:23,859
and make sure we get a picture
of it for all the newspapers.

1283
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:26,769
Do you wanna run
the 15 radio spots in the Midwest?

1284
01:24:26,838 --> 01:24:29,773
I think you could spend your money
better in Canadian publicity.

1285
01:24:29,841 --> 01:24:32,173
By the way... I've got
a couple of friends up in Toronto

1286
01:24:32,244 --> 01:24:34,337
who'd probably be able
to get you a good tax break.

1287
01:24:34,413 --> 01:24:37,143
George, I like your friends.

1288
01:24:44,556 --> 01:24:46,114
Hey, Champ...

1289
01:24:46,191 --> 01:24:48,785
you oughta come look at this boy
you're gonna fight on TV.

1290
01:24:49,695 --> 01:24:51,026
Looks like he means business.

1291
01:24:51,096 --> 01:24:52,757
Yeah, I mean business, too.

1292
01:24:53,332 --> 01:24:55,163
Shirley, we got
any more coffee out there?

1293
01:24:55,234 --> 01:24:57,634
Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed.
I'll get you some right away.

1294
01:24:57,703 --> 01:25:00,171
After the fight, I may just retire
and run for emperor.

1295
01:25:00,973 --> 01:25:02,907
The arena's
the only program concession,

1296
01:25:02,975 --> 01:25:06,968
and the gross rental of the arena
is gonna include the 400 ushers, right?

1297
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:20,753
Diana Lewis, in the meat house
with southpaw Rocky Balboa.

1298
01:26:07,406 --> 01:26:08,930
And he called the reporters?

1299
01:26:09,007 --> 01:26:11,601
Yeah, it threw
my whole training schedule off.

1300
01:26:11,677 --> 01:26:13,975
Don't be mad at him.
He's just trying to help.

1301
01:26:14,046 --> 01:26:17,038
Adrian, I ain't mad,
it's just that, uh,

1302
01:26:17,115 --> 01:26:19,276
when a reporter's around,
I get out of joint

1303
01:26:19,351 --> 01:26:22,013
'cause they take cheap shots,
and Paulie knows that.

1304
01:26:22,688 --> 01:26:25,589
Paulie keeps askin' me
for a job all the time,

1305
01:26:25,657 --> 01:26:28,683
but he don't know nothin'
about fightin'.

1306
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,489
Are you gonna say
anything to him?

1307
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:35,161
What's to say? I just don't know
what he wants from me.

1308
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:39,660
I don't want nothin' from you.

1309
01:26:40,672 --> 01:26:42,537
I don't want nothin' from you.

1310
01:26:43,742 --> 01:26:46,267
This ain't no charity case.

1311
01:26:46,345 --> 01:26:47,835
Get outta my house.

1312
01:26:47,913 --> 01:26:49,676
It's not just your house.

1313
01:26:50,582 --> 01:26:52,243
You ain't no friend no more.

1314
01:26:53,085 --> 01:26:56,316
- Get out of my house, I just says.
- Don't talk to him like that.

1315
01:26:56,388 --> 01:26:58,879
Both of you get out of my house.

1316
01:26:58,957 --> 01:27:00,481
Yo.

1317
01:27:00,559 --> 01:27:02,925
It's cold outside, Paulie.

1318
01:27:12,571 --> 01:27:14,732
I don't want you messin' her,

1319
01:27:14,806 --> 01:27:17,536
and I don't raise you
to go with this scum bum!

1320
01:27:17,609 --> 01:27:19,372
Come on! Wanna hit on me?
Come on!

1321
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:22,436
I'll break both your arms
so they don't work for ya!

1322
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:28,642
That's right! I'm not good enough
to meet with Gazzo...

1323
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:29,880
That's what I think of Gazzo!

1324
01:27:29,955 --> 01:27:32,355
Now you're a big-shot fighter
on your way up,

1325
01:27:32,424 --> 01:27:34,585
you don't even throw a crumb
to your friend Paulie!

1326
01:27:34,659 --> 01:27:36,923
When I go
and get you meat every morning!

1327
01:27:36,995 --> 01:27:39,657
You forgot that!
Then I even give you my sister, too!

1328
01:27:39,731 --> 01:27:42,894
- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?

1329
01:27:42,968 --> 01:27:44,697
A pig gives you the best?

1330
01:27:45,704 --> 01:27:48,366
You're such a loser!
I don't get married because of you!

1331
01:27:49,574 --> 01:27:51,804
You can't live by yourself!

1332
01:27:51,877 --> 01:27:55,369
I put you two together!
And you... don't you forget it!

1333
01:27:55,447 --> 01:27:56,937
You owe me!

1334
01:27:59,551 --> 01:28:01,712
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?!

1335
01:28:01,787 --> 01:28:04,278
You're supposed
to be good to me.

1336
01:28:04,356 --> 01:28:07,689
What do I owe you, Paulie?!
What do I owe ya?!

1337
01:28:07,759 --> 01:28:09,420
I treat you good!

1338
01:28:09,494 --> 01:28:12,930
I cook for you, I clean for you,
I pick up your dirty clothes!

1339
01:28:12,998 --> 01:28:16,991
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothin'!

1340
01:28:17,068 --> 01:28:19,730
And you made me feel
like a loser!

1341
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,470
I'm not a loser!

1342
01:28:22,541 --> 01:28:24,873
- You're busted!
- What?!

1343
01:28:24,943 --> 01:28:26,274
You're not a virgin!

1344
01:28:26,845 --> 01:28:30,337
You let him into your pants!
She's busted!

1345
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:35,753
I can't haul meat no more!

1346
01:29:06,251 --> 01:29:07,741
You want a roommate?

1347
01:29:12,791 --> 01:29:14,281
Absolutely.

1348
01:29:16,161 --> 01:29:18,595
Okay, now, when you
walk into the ring

1349
01:29:18,663 --> 01:29:21,154
with the number one
heavyweight of the world,

1350
01:29:21,233 --> 01:29:22,825
you'll be ready, won't ya?

1351
01:29:22,901 --> 01:29:28,066
Why? Because I waited
for 50 years to make you ready.

1352
01:29:28,139 --> 01:29:30,972
You'll be able to spit nails, kid.

1353
01:29:31,042 --> 01:29:33,203
Like the guy says,
you're gonna eat lightning

1354
01:29:33,278 --> 01:29:35,212
and you're gonna crap thunder.

1355
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,272
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

1356
01:29:38,350 --> 01:29:40,511
- Yo, Mickey.
- Hey! How are ya?

1357
01:29:40,585 --> 01:29:44,988
Oh, Rock. I want you to meet
our cutman here, Al Salvani.

1358
01:29:45,056 --> 01:29:47,047
- Take a look at his eye.
- How're you doin'?

1359
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:49,286
- That's right.
- It ain't bad. I seen worse.

1360
01:29:49,361 --> 01:29:50,851
You ain't so bad yourself.

1361
01:29:50,929 --> 01:29:53,523
- Cover up. Things'll be okay.
- Cover up? You cover up.

1362
01:29:53,598 --> 01:29:55,429
Go and take a shower, will ya?

1363
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,468
Okay, Mick.
I'll see ya tomorrow.

1364
01:29:58,904 --> 01:30:01,737
You covered that Whitmar fight,
didn't you?

1365
01:30:01,806 --> 01:30:02,966
That's why you wanted me.

1366
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:05,805
Listen, we got a winner here!
We got a chance!

1367
01:30:05,877 --> 01:30:08,368
He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

1368
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:11,779
You just stand by, boy.
We're gonna win.

1369
01:30:18,757 --> 01:30:21,624
Hey, Rock,
It's okay I talk to ya?

1370
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,787
Okay you talk to me?

1371
01:30:23,862 --> 01:30:24,920
Sure.

1372
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:28,324
I figured some angle
to make some money off your name.

1373
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,560
My name?

1374
01:30:30,302 --> 01:30:34,033
- How's that?
- Advertisin'. I know about that stuff.

1375
01:30:35,907 --> 01:30:38,899
What do you know
about advertisin'? Huh?

1376
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:44,710
Hey, you can make money
off my name, make it, okay?

1377
01:30:44,783 --> 01:30:46,273
I'm gonna take a shower.

1378
01:30:47,385 --> 01:30:50,218
- Wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.

1379
01:31:40,705 --> 01:31:46,007
Trying hard now

1380
01:31:46,177 --> 01:31:50,910
It's so hard now

1381
01:31:51,082 --> 01:31:56,247
Trying hard now

1382
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:26,941
You're gonna kill him!

1383
01:32:36,261 --> 01:32:40,994
Getting strong now

1384
01:32:41,166 --> 01:32:46,001
Won't be long now

1385
01:32:46,171 --> 01:32:50,733
Getting strong now

1386
01:33:09,994 --> 01:33:14,988
Gonna fly now

1387
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:19,899
Flying high now

1388
01:33:20,071 --> 01:33:25,441
Gonna fly

1389
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:27,976
Fly

1390
01:33:28,146 --> 01:33:33,413
Fly

1391
01:35:18,389 --> 01:35:21,916
Rocky.
What brings you here tonight?

1392
01:35:22,994 --> 01:35:25,462
Mr. Jergens,
the poster's wrong.

1393
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:26,861
What do you mean?

1394
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:30,264
Well, I'm wearin' white pants
with a red stripe.

1395
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:36,571
It doesn't really matter,
does it?

1396
01:35:36,641 --> 01:35:39,007
I'm sure you're gonna give us
a great show.

1397
01:35:40,578 --> 01:35:42,569
Try to get some rest, kid.

1398
01:35:43,481 --> 01:35:44,743
Good night.

1399
01:37:16,474 --> 01:37:18,066
I can't do it.

1400
01:37:20,979 --> 01:37:22,139
What?

1401
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:24,842
I can't beat him.

1402
01:37:26,317 --> 01:37:27,579
Apollo?

1403
01:37:28,486 --> 01:37:29,646
Yeah.

1404
01:37:30,922 --> 01:37:34,085
I've been out there
walkin' around, thinkin'.

1405
01:37:35,827 --> 01:37:39,228
I mean, who am I kiddin'?
I ain't even in the guy's league.

1406
01:37:44,569 --> 01:37:45,900
What are we gonna do?

1407
01:37:57,615 --> 01:37:59,014
I don't know.

1408
01:38:05,656 --> 01:38:07,317
You worked so hard.

1409
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:12,752
It don't matter,
'cause I was nobody before.

1410
01:38:14,832 --> 01:38:16,129
Don't say that.

1411
01:38:17,035 --> 01:38:19,435
Oh, come on, Adrian.
It's true.

1412
01:38:19,504 --> 01:38:21,165
I was nobody.

1413
01:38:22,907 --> 01:38:25,068
But it don't matter either,
you know?

1414
01:38:26,811 --> 01:38:28,403
So, I was thinkin'...

1415
01:38:29,881 --> 01:38:32,714
It really don't matter
if I lose this fight.

1416
01:38:34,619 --> 01:38:37,782
It really don't matter
if this guy opens my head, either.

1417
01:38:39,757 --> 01:38:42,419
'Cause all I wanna do
is go the distance.

1418
01:38:47,131 --> 01:38:49,725
Nobody's ever
gone the distance with Creed.

1419
01:38:51,102 --> 01:38:53,434
And if I can go that distance...

1420
01:38:54,739 --> 01:38:57,970
...see, if that bell rings
and I'm still standin'...

1421
01:39:02,914 --> 01:39:06,645
...I'm gonna know
for the first time in my life, you see...

1422
01:39:08,453 --> 01:39:11,854
...that I weren't just another bum
from the neighborhood.

1423
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:21,249
Time, kid.
Let's go.

1424
01:40:23,995 --> 01:40:25,326
I'll wait for you here.

1425
01:40:28,132 --> 01:40:30,623
Or how 'bout I wait here
and you fight, huh?

1426
01:40:31,836 --> 01:40:34,327
You're lookin' very great today...
you know that?

1427
01:40:36,974 --> 01:40:40,307
I gotta go now, but, uh,
don't you leave town, huh?

1428
01:40:41,479 --> 01:40:43,470
Wish me luck.
I'm gonna need it.

1429
01:40:44,649 --> 01:40:46,139
Good luck.

1430
01:40:46,717 --> 01:40:49,880
Say, Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, huh?

1431
01:40:50,421 --> 01:40:51,479
Good luck.

1432
01:40:51,556 --> 01:40:52,887
Don't leave town.

1433
01:40:55,793 --> 01:40:59,490
<i>I'd like to have you meet my colleague</i>
<i>workin' the fight with me... Stu Hansen.</i>

1434
01:40:59,564 --> 01:41:00,622
Thank you, Bill Baldwin.

1435
01:41:00,698 --> 01:41:03,826
The electricity is all over
the place tonight as Rocky Balboa...

1436
01:41:05,469 --> 01:41:07,130
Hey, what the hell is that?

1437
01:41:07,205 --> 01:41:09,605
I trained you to be a fighter,
not a billboard.

1438
01:41:09,674 --> 01:41:12,507
- I'm doin' it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

1439
01:41:12,577 --> 01:41:14,636
Paulie gets three grand,
I get the robe.

1440
01:41:14,712 --> 01:41:15,872
Shrewd.

1441
01:41:16,581 --> 01:41:18,981
The story about tonight's fight,
their difference in style,

1442
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:21,211
you can quote a recent
sports magazine which said,

1443
01:41:21,285 --> 01:41:23,446
"Could be the caveman
against the cavalier."

1444
01:41:23,521 --> 01:41:25,921
I noticed a buzzing
in the background now, Bill.

1445
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:28,322
<i>Could be the challengers</i>
<i>getting ready to get into the ring.</i>

1446
01:41:28,392 --> 01:41:31,725
Rocky! Look at my date.
Cost me $200.

1447
01:41:31,796 --> 01:41:34,287
- 250.
- I gotta go. I gotta work.

1448
01:41:34,365 --> 01:41:36,356
- How's the robe?
- It's a little baggy.

1449
01:41:36,934 --> 01:41:39,767
<i>A 50 to 1 underdog</i>
<i>living a Cinderella story,</i>

1450
01:41:39,837 --> 01:41:43,238

<i>imaginations all over the world.</i>

1451
01:41:47,979 --> 01:41:49,571
We love you, Rocky!

1452
01:41:49,647 --> 01:41:52,707
- Good luck, champ.
- Hey, thanks for showin' up.

1453
01:41:53,351 --> 01:41:55,182
<i>And his record... 44 victories.</i>

1454
01:41:55,253 --> 01:41:58,245
<i>He's got 38 by knockout,</i>
<i>and he's lost 20 fights.</i>

1455
01:41:58,322 --> 01:42:00,586
<i>Which makes me wonder,</i>
<i>can he stand it...</i>

1456
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:03,058
<i>the stamina and the skill</i>
<i>to last the three rounds?</i>

1457

<i>Some meat sign</i>

<i>Shamrock Meats, Inc.</i>

1462
01:42:16,507 --> 01:42:20,341
<i>A lot of noise coming from the back.</i>
<i>You could go deaf with that noise.</i>

1463
01:42:20,411 --> 01:42:22,106
<i>You have the spotlights.</i>

1464
01:42:23,281 --> 01:42:26,444
<i>Is that the world</i>
<i>heavyweight champion Apollo Creed?</i>

1465
01:42:26,517 --> 01:42:29,008
<i>He's in a boat... riding in a boat.</i>

1466
01:42:29,086 --> 01:42:30,815
<i>Is he supposed</i>
<i>to be George Washington?</i>

1467
01:42:30,888 --> 01:42:34,051
<i>Obviously so. He's got the hat on,</i>
<i>the whole thing. Look at that.</i>

1468
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:35,615
<i>It's been confirmed.</i>

1469

<i>The world champion Apollo Creed</i>

1471
01:42:42,166 --> 01:42:43,827
<i>- He's throwing money.</i>
<i>- I don't believe it.</i>

1472
01:42:43,901 --> 01:42:47,268
<i>Remember we were talking about</i>
<i>George Washington throwing the dollar?</i>

1473
01:42:47,338 --> 01:42:48,464
<i>Throwing the dollar.</i>

1474

<i>'Course, if you threw a dollar</i>

<i>Oh, he's taking his...</i>

1476
01:42:53,411 --> 01:42:55,675
<i>White wig came off,</i>
<i>the hat came off.</i>

Apollo Creed...
for you around the world

1480
01:43:06,657 --> 01:43:09,888
he was dressed as George Washington,
the father of our country.

1481
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,450
I want you!

1482

<i>"All of you." he's saying.</i>

1487
01:43:25,009 --> 01:43:27,500
I want you.
You.

1488
01:43:27,578 --> 01:43:30,138
- Is he talkin' to me?
- He's talkin' to you.

1489
01:43:30,314 --> 01:43:32,976
- Is he talkin' to me?
- Let him talk while he can talk.

1490
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:34,711
I want the Stallion!

1491
01:43:35,386 --> 01:43:37,650
<i>He says, "I want the Stallion.</i>
<i>I want the Stallion."</i>

1492

<i>- That's it, Creed.</i>

01:43:53,604 --> 01:43:55,162
<i>Creed in three.</i>

1498
01:43:55,239 --> 01:43:57,139
What do you think
that outfit cost?

1499
01:44:07,685 --> 01:44:09,846
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1500
01:44:10,821 --> 01:44:12,311
<i>Good evening.</i>

1501
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:14,722
<i>A very happy New Year.</i>

1502
01:44:14,792 --> 01:44:17,056
<i>Welcome to Philadelphia.</i>

1503
01:44:17,128 --> 01:44:19,619
<i>Well, everybody who's anybody</i>
<i>is here tonight.</i>

1504
01:44:19,697 --> 01:44:21,062
<i>Time...</i>

1505
01:44:21,732 --> 01:44:28,729
<i>Time does not permit me to introduce</i>
<i>the many luminaries of politics,</i>

1506
01:44:28,806 --> 01:44:33,175
<i>show business, and the sporting world</i>
<i>who are with us tonight.</i>

1507
01:44:33,244 --> 01:44:38,443
<i>But I would like to present</i>
<i>one of the immortals of pugilism,</i>

1508
01:44:38,516 --> 01:44:42,509
<i>a champion</i>
<i>in and out of the ring,</i>

1509
01:44:42,586 --> 01:44:48,354
<i>Philadelphia's own Smoking Joe,</i>
<i>the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!</i>

1510
01:44:58,536 --> 01:45:00,367
How you doin'?

1511
01:45:00,438 --> 01:45:02,429
Don't hurt him, okay?
Go light on him.

1512
01:45:02,506 --> 01:45:03,564
Come on, now.

1513
01:45:03,641 --> 01:45:05,632
<i>... he's been in his career</i>
<i>as a fighter.</i>

1514
01:45:05,709 --> 01:45:07,540
<i>Now he's coming over</i>
<i>to talk to the Champ.</i>

1515
01:45:07,611 --> 01:45:09,010
- Hey, how 'bout that?
- Hey, Joe.

1516
01:45:09,079 --> 01:45:12,571
- You've been ducking me long time.
- No, Joe. You're next, Joe.

1517
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:15,448
- I want you, you understand?
- You're next, Joe!

1518
01:45:15,519 --> 01:45:17,111
They must be friends.

1519
01:45:25,463 --> 01:45:27,397
Joe Frazier!

1520
01:45:27,465 --> 01:45:31,959
<i>The fight is on the way. Settle down</i>
<i>because it won't be long now.</i>

1521
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:37,766
<i>And now...</i>
<i>for the main event.</i>

1522
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,814
<i>The challenger,</i>

1523
01:45:44,882 --> 01:45:49,376
<i>white trunks,</i>
<i>weighing 190 pounds,</i>

1524
01:45:49,453 --> 01:45:51,944
<i>Philadelphia's favorite son,</i>

1525
01:45:52,022 --> 01:45:57,187
<i>The Italian Stallion,</i>
<i>Rocky Balboa.</i>

1526
01:46:03,701 --> 01:46:06,192
<i>And on my right,</i>

1527
01:46:06,270 --> 01:46:08,431
<i>wearing red, white and blue,</i>

1528
01:46:08,506 --> 01:46:12,067
<i>weighing 210 pounds,</i>

1529
01:46:12,142 --> 01:46:15,578
<i>undefeated in 46 fights,</i>

1530
01:46:15,646 --> 01:46:18,581
<i>the master of disaster,</i>

1531
01:46:18,649 --> 01:46:22,346
<i>the undisputed,</i>
<i>heavyweight champion of the world</i>

1532
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:24,580
<i>Apollo Creed.</i>

1533
01:46:26,657 --> 01:46:29,182
I want you and you.
You. You.

1534
01:46:31,562 --> 01:46:34,224
You, chump.
I want you!

1535
01:46:34,298 --> 01:46:37,461
You boys both fought in Philadelphia
before, and you know the rules.

1536
01:46:37,535 --> 01:46:40,561
No low blows,
watch your heads, no butting.

1537
01:46:40,638 --> 01:46:42,128
Shake hands now
and come out fightin'.

1538
01:46:42,206 --> 01:46:43,935
Put your hands up there, chump.

1539
01:46:44,008 --> 01:46:45,999
- Come out fightin'.
- Come on. Come on.

1540
01:46:48,279 --> 01:46:50,008
<i>Rocky's takin' it carefully.</i>

1541
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,743
<i>He's just going over and being calm,</i>
<i>it looks like from here.</i>

1542
01:46:54,852 --> 01:46:56,183
<i>There goes the big hat.</i>

1543
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:02,619
<i>I've never seen a fighter</i>
<i>that concerned about his hair.</i>

1544
01:47:11,869 --> 01:47:13,530
<i>And there's the bell</i>
<i>for round one.</i>

1545
01:47:14,905 --> 01:47:18,068
<i>The fighters come into the center</i>
<i>of the ring, looking at each other.</i>

1546
01:47:18,142 --> 01:47:19,473
<i>Rocky just looking.</i>

1547
01:47:19,543 --> 01:47:24,947
<i>The Champion gives one</i>
<i>of the left-handed jabs right there.</i>

1548
01:47:26,584 --> 01:47:30,076
<i>The Champ's stinging,</i>
<i>the slower challenger jabs at will.</i>

1549
01:47:30,154 --> 01:47:34,147
<i>In fact, it just looks like Rocky's</i>
<i>blocking the blows with his face.</i>

1550
01:47:34,224 --> 01:47:36,556
<i>The Champion doesn't look</i>
<i>the best he's ever been,</i>

1551
01:47:36,627 --> 01:47:38,322
<i>but he's really moving now.</i>

1552
01:47:38,395 --> 01:47:40,556
<i>Well, the Champion</i>
<i>is smiling now.</i>

1553
01:47:40,631 --> 01:47:42,030
<i>He's toying with this man.</i>

1554
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,991
Trying to give the fans
their money's worth.

1555
01:47:47,705 --> 01:47:50,868
<i>He's very clearly outdoing</i>
<i>the challenger right now.</i>

1556
01:47:51,709 --> 01:47:53,540
I'll get you. Come on.

1557
01:47:53,611 --> 01:47:57,445
<i>He's just trying to make this man</i>
<i>make him... see! Make him miss like that.</i>

1558
01:47:58,949 --> 01:48:01,440
<i>Oh, the Champ</i>
<i>is just taunting him now.</i>

1559
01:48:04,655 --> 01:48:06,145
<i>He's dancing around.</i>

1560
01:48:07,658 --> 01:48:09,558
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

1561
01:48:09,627 --> 01:48:11,925
<i>- The Champ is down.</i>
<i>- Yes, he is!</i>

1562
01:48:17,968 --> 01:48:21,369
<i>Creed is down!</i>
<i>What a surprise this is!</i>

1563
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:25,772
<i>This is the first time the Champion</i>
<i>has ever been knocked down.</i>

1564
01:48:27,945 --> 01:48:31,210
Six... seven... eight.

1565
01:48:31,281 --> 01:48:33,977
<i>Appears to be all right.</i>
<i>A little glassy-eyed, but okay.</i>

1566
01:48:35,886 --> 01:48:38,946
Let's go to work right now, Rock!
Come on!

1567
01:48:40,224 --> 01:48:43,557
<i>Now Rocky coming back out,</i>
<i>and he's like a bull in a china closet.</i>

1568
01:48:43,627 --> 01:48:44,958
<i>He really wants it.</i>

1569
01:48:47,164 --> 01:48:48,825
<i>Boy, the Champion's</i>
<i>coming back.</i>

1570
01:48:48,899 --> 01:48:52,062
<i>He's coming off the floor now,</i>
<i>and he's trying...</i>

1571
01:48:52,136 --> 01:48:54,798
<i>A left, a right, another left,</i>
<i>another right, combination!</i>

1572
01:48:54,872 --> 01:48:57,705
<i>Into the face!</i>
<i>And that's the Apollo we know.</i>

1573
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:03,010
<i>Now he's taunting him.</i>

1574
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:05,173
<i>He's taunting Rocky.</i>
<i>"Come on, let's go."</i>

1575
01:49:05,249 --> 01:49:06,614
<i>Left. There's another left.</i>

1576
01:49:07,484 --> 01:49:08,542
<i>Another left.</i>

1577
01:49:10,387 --> 01:49:12,150
<i>There!</i>

1578
01:49:13,624 --> 01:49:15,956
<i>Left and right.</i>
<i>Rocky's got him on the rope!</i>

1579
01:49:16,026 --> 01:49:17,186
Come on.

1580
01:49:17,261 --> 01:49:18,592
Okay, break.

1581
01:49:18,662 --> 01:49:20,323
Punch. Hit me. Hit me.

1582
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:27,164
<i>I tell you, there's no way we expected</i>
<i>this kind of hitting from him.</i>

1583
01:49:27,237 --> 01:49:29,432
<i>Oh, no way,</i>
<i>but with the ability of the Champion...</i>

1584
01:49:34,244 --> 01:49:37,236
<i>Apollo unloading a left, really</i>
<i>trying to get him up against the ropes.</i>

1585
01:49:46,056 --> 01:49:48,581
<i>They're leading him over to his corner.</i>
<i>Rocky can hardly find his way.</i>

1586
01:49:48,659 --> 01:49:50,752
<i>He's sitting down now.</i>

1587
01:49:50,828 --> 01:49:52,523
I told ya! I told ya!

1588
01:49:52,596 --> 01:49:53,927
Your nose is broke.

1589
01:49:53,997 --> 01:49:56,363
- How's it look?
- Ah, it's an improvement.

1590
01:49:56,433 --> 01:49:59,800
I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.
I want you to stick and move.

1591
01:49:59,870 --> 01:50:03,362
Go for the ribs.
Don't let that bastard breathe.

1592
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,839
The guy's great.

1593
01:50:04,908 --> 01:50:08,901
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

1594
01:50:08,979 --> 01:50:11,573
Finish this bum and let's go home.

1595
01:50:12,082 --> 01:50:14,915
Stay to the body. The body!
You're doing great!

1596
01:50:18,555 --> 01:50:20,216
<i>Creed got knocked down</i>
<i>at the end of the first.</i>

1597
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:23,885
<i>He came back strong at the end</i>
<i>of the first, but he's working hard.</i>

1598
01:50:23,961 --> 01:50:27,124
<i>A smart left.</i>
<i>Another left and a right.</i>

1599
01:50:27,197 --> 01:50:29,722
<i>And now coming</i>
<i>into the corner again.</i>

1600
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:39,905
<i>Oh, Balboa's taking</i>
<i>a tremendous beating here.</i>

1601
01:50:45,149 --> 01:50:47,083
Oh, come on, man. Can't you fight?

1602
01:50:47,151 --> 01:50:50,143
Stop clownin' around here
and give these people something to see.

1603
01:50:51,889 --> 01:50:53,379
<i>He says he wants him!</i>

1604
01:50:54,491 --> 01:50:58,655
<i>If you folks aren't aware... you're</i>
<i>watching a battle... I tell you that.</i>

1605
01:51:03,167 --> 01:51:04,532
<i>Balboa trying to fight back.</i>

1606
01:51:04,601 --> 01:51:06,762
<i>Oh! He tagged the Champ</i>
<i>with a tremendous hook!</i>

1607
01:51:06,837 --> 01:51:09,169
<i>The Champion is trying</i>
<i>to get himself out of there,</i>

1608
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:10,797
<i>but he just can't do it.</i>

1609
01:51:10,874 --> 01:51:14,002
<i>He is being barraged with lefts</i>
<i>and rights to the head, to the body.</i>

1610
01:51:14,077 --> 01:51:18,036
<i>Balboa is smacking the Champion</i>
<i>right on the kisser.</i>

1611
01:51:18,882 --> 01:51:22,443
<i>And the referee's... they're ready</i>
<i>to keep going. Look at that!</i>

1612
01:51:22,519 --> 01:51:24,953
- Back to your corner.
- Put that chump back in his corner.

1613
01:51:25,022 --> 01:51:27,718
- Come on, Creed.
<i>- Balboa doesn't want to quit. Hey.</i>

1614
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:29,383
<i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i>

1615
01:52:24,014 --> 01:52:26,346
<i>Now he's got him. A left.</i>

1616
01:52:36,526 --> 01:52:38,790
<i>A hard left</i>
<i>and a right combination.</i>

1617
01:52:38,862 --> 01:52:41,626
<i>What is keeping him up, Bill?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

1618
01:52:44,401 --> 01:52:46,596
<i>He can't even get his gloves up</i>
<i>to protect himself.</i>

1619
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,501
<i>He needs to stop, Bill.</i>

1620
01:52:54,411 --> 01:52:56,743
Down! Down!
Stay down!

1621
01:52:56,813 --> 01:52:59,145
<i>Apollo dancing around</i>
<i>with his arms in the air.</i>

1622
01:53:09,893 --> 01:53:13,158
...five... six...

1623
01:53:14,231 --> 01:53:17,860
seven... eight... nine...

1624
01:53:27,377 --> 01:53:29,208
<i>Apollo can't believe it.</i>

1625
01:53:46,363 --> 01:53:49,696
<i>The Champion got a left</i>
<i>to the ribs... his right rib.</i>

1626
01:53:49,766 --> 01:53:51,927
<i>Oh, this has been</i>
<i>a tremendous...</i>

1627
01:53:57,741 --> 01:54:00,232
- Okay, Champ?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1628
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:03,143
It hurts, though.
He broke my rib.

1629
01:54:03,213 --> 01:54:05,443
I can't see nothin'.
You gotta open my eye.

1630
01:54:05,515 --> 01:54:07,346
- Cut me, Mick.
- I don't wanna do it!

1631
01:54:07,417 --> 01:54:10,284
Go on, cut me.
Cut me.

1632
01:54:10,354 --> 01:54:12,083
Try it.

1633
01:54:16,093 --> 01:54:17,583
Oh, God.

1634
01:54:17,661 --> 01:54:20,095
You're bleeding inside, Champ.
I'm gonna stop the fight, understand?

1635
01:54:20,163 --> 01:54:23,564
You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.
You ain't stoppin' nothin'.

1636
01:54:23,633 --> 01:54:26,466
- You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.
- All right.

1637
01:54:26,536 --> 01:54:30,267
- Go if you wanna go.
- I'm goin'.

1638
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:33,173
You gotta go.
You gotta give it all. Give it all!

1639
01:54:33,243 --> 01:54:35,404
You gotta get him.
You gotta work on that body.

1640
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:42,842
<i>The crowd is on fire.</i>
<i>The 15th and final round.</i>

1641
01:54:51,595 --> 01:54:53,995
<i>They look like they've been</i>
<i>in a war... these two.</i>

1642
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:05,631
<i>Oh, the Champion</i>
<i>really tagged him!</i>

1643
01:55:05,709 --> 01:55:09,440
<i>And Apollo clearly protecting</i>
<i>his right side... his ribs.</i>

1644
01:55:14,818 --> 01:55:16,410
<i>Hard left and right!</i>

1645
01:55:16,486 --> 01:55:19,978
<i>- Look at the blood coming from his face.</i>
<i>- Oh, he's spitting up blood now.</i>

1646
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:26,427
<i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>

1647
01:55:26,496 --> 01:55:27,963
Go for it! Go for it, Rock!

1648
01:55:28,031 --> 01:55:30,795
<i>Listen to this crowd!</i>

1649
01:55:30,867 --> 01:55:34,667
<i>Oh! Another to the rib.</i>
<i>That left hand again right to the chin!</i>

1650
01:55:34,738 --> 01:55:36,535
<i>Oh! He's got him</i>
<i>up against the ropes!</i>

1651
01:55:36,606 --> 01:55:37,664
<i>Apollo the Champ.</i>

1652
01:55:42,112 --> 01:55:44,945
Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

1653
01:55:45,649 --> 01:55:46,809
Don't want one.

1654
01:55:57,494 --> 01:56:00,122
Rocky, you went the 15 rounds.
How do you feel?

1655
01:56:00,197 --> 01:56:01,255
I feel all right.

1656
01:56:01,331 --> 01:56:03,322
What were you thinking about
when that buzzer sounded?

1657
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,890
Adrian!

1658
01:56:04,968 --> 01:56:07,459
What? Adrian!

1659
01:56:07,537 --> 01:56:09,027
Rocky?

1660
01:56:09,172 --> 01:56:10,366
Rocky?

1661
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,931
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>your attention, please...</i>

1662
01:56:13,009 --> 01:56:14,203
Rocky?

1663
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:16,844
Rocky!

1664
01:56:16,913 --> 01:56:21,247
<i>You've had the privilege</i>
<i>of witnessing the greatest exhibition</i>

1665
01:56:21,318 --> 01:56:25,482
<i>of guts and stamina</i>
<i>in the history of the ring.</i>

1666
01:56:25,555 --> 01:56:27,546
Adrian!

1667
01:56:28,091 --> 01:56:30,025
Rocky!

1668
01:56:30,093 --> 01:56:32,152
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1669
01:56:32,229 --> 01:56:34,720
<i>we have a split decision.</i>

1670
01:56:38,135 --> 01:56:39,796
Adrian!

1671
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:41,201
Rocky!

1672
01:56:41,271 --> 01:56:42,761
<i>... for Creed.</i>

1673
01:56:45,442 --> 01:56:48,775
- No plans out there for a rematch?
- Ain't gonna be a rematch.

1674
01:56:48,845 --> 01:56:52,110
Oh, come on.
I don't know yet, okay?

1675
01:56:52,182 --> 01:56:53,706
You heard him, ladies and...

1676
01:56:53,783 --> 01:56:57,116
Rocko! That's my friend. Rocko!

1677
01:56:57,187 --> 01:56:59,883
- Hey, you're breakin' the jacket.
- Let's go, Buddy. Come on.

1678
01:56:59,956 --> 01:57:01,355
Paulie?

1679
01:57:01,424 --> 01:57:03,915
- Adrian? Adrian!
- Rocky!

1680
01:57:03,994 --> 01:57:06,258
Adrian!
Hey, where's your hat?

1681
01:57:06,329 --> 01:57:07,591
I love you.

1682
01:57:07,664 --> 01:57:09,291
I love you.

1683
01:57:09,432 --> 01:57:11,297
- I love you!
- I love you.

1684
01:57:13,003 --> 01:57:14,163
I love you.

1685
01:57:15,105 --> 01:57:16,629
I love you.
