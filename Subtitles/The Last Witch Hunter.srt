DOLAN THE 37TH: What?

330
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:06,558
He was killed by witches.

331
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:08,025
Never in the history of The Axe and Cross

332
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:10,028
has a Dolan ever been murdered.

333
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:12,731
You wanna quit?

334
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:14,867
No.

335
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:17,269
I want a raise.

336
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:18,604
This is a declaration of war.

337
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:20,105
Who could have done this?

338
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:21,906
A concealment spell was placed

339
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,675
to make everything look normal.

340
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:25,042
They were searching for something,

341
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:27,011
didn't want us to know.

342
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:31,617
Elemental magic is neutral.

343
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:36,188
At its root it's neither good nor evil.

344
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,260
But this is different.

345
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,561
This is dark magic.

346
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:45,797
Beyond evil.

347
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:52,036
They tied him to the chair.

348
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:05,884
"Death."

349
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:08,553
Is that part of the spell?

350
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:11,956
You were here last night
before he died, right?

351
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,925
Yes.

352
00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:19,230
Let me see your hands.

353
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,800
Now.

354
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:33,244
I was five years old

355
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:35,914
when witches set our house on fire.

356
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:37,616
My parents died.

357
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,684
But you walked through the flames,

358
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:40,018
wrapped me in a blanket,

359
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:42,320
and jumped out the second story window.

360
00:24:42,354 --> 00:24:44,289
Your body broke the fall.

361
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:47,792
I told you we'd met before.

362
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:51,163
If you don't remember, I
can refer you to the entry...

363
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:55,000
No. I remember.

364
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:01,105
You hunted down the witches
and brought them to justice.

365
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:06,612
I've waited my entire life for
the opportunity to help you.

366
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:11,883
Well, now's your chance.

367
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:16,287
You can help me hunt the
witches that did this.

368
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:23,127
Shouldn't I have a gun or
an iron mallet or something?

369
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,932
Take a deep breath. Center yourself.

370
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:28,800
DOLAN THE 37TH: Right. Of course.

371
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,636
Because resisting enchantment
requires a clear mind.

372

Now, Max is a 14th level warlock,

do. May as well relax.
