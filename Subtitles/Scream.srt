1
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:23,993
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,493
- Yes?
- Who is this?

3
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,583
- Who you trying to reach?
- What number is this?

4
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:32,583
- What number are you trying to reach?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:35,083
- I think you have the wrong number.
- Do I?

6
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:37,583
It happens. Take it easy.

7
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:49,263
- Hello!
- I'm sorry. I guess
I dialed the wrong number.

8
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:52,773
- So, why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.

9
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:56,523
- You're forgiven. Bye, now.
- Wait, wait! Don't hang up.

10
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:58,943
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

11
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:02,113
They've got 900-numbers
for that. See ya.

12
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,133
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

13
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:30,263
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.

14
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:33,273
- I don't think so.

15
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:35,603
- What's that noise?
- Popcorn.

16
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:37,603
- You're making popcorn?
- Uh-huh.

17
00:01:37,643 --> 00:01:39,903
I only eat popcorn
at the movies.

18
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:43,283
- Well, I'm getting ready
to watch a video.
- Really? What?

19
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,363
Oh, just some scary movie.

20
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:47,743
- You like scary movies?
- Uh-huh.

21
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:49,873
What's your favorite
scary movie?

22
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:52,833
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favorite.

23
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:54,833
What comes to mind?

24
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,833
Um..."Halloween."

25
00:01:56,873 --> 00:01:59,253
You know, the one with the guy
in the white mask...

26
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:02,213
who walks around
and stalks baby-sitters.

27
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:04,213
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

28
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:08,723
- Guess.
- Um..."Nightmare on Elm Street."

29
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:11,553
Is that the one where
the guy had knives for fingers?

30
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:14,063
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.
- Freddy, that's right.

31
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:16,773
I liked that movie.
It was scary.

32
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:19,393
Yeah, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

33
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:21,443
So, you got a boyfriend?

34
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:24,733
Why? You wanna ask me
out on a date?

35
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,363
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

36
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:30,613
- Mm... no.
- You never told me your name.

37
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:32,623
Why do you want
to know my name?

38
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:36,083
'Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

39
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:40,923
- What did you say?
- I wanna know who I'm talking to.

40
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:43,923
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?

41
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:48,093
What?

42
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,303
Hello?

43
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:53,603
Look, I gotta go.

44
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:55,603
Wait! I thought we
were gonna go out.

45
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,973
Uh, nah, I don't think so.

46
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,983
Don't hang up on me!

47
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:10,653
Shit.

48
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:14,453
- Yes?
- I told you not to hang up on me.

49
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,623
- What do you want?
- To talk.

50
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:19,333
Well, dial someone else, okay?

51
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:31,683
- Listen, asshole!
- No, you listen, you little bitch!

52
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:35,973
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?

53
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,563
Yeah.

54
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,563
Is this some kind of joke?

55
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:43,063
More of a game, really.

56
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:47,823
Can you handle that...

57
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:50,323
blondie?

58
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,373
Can you see me?

59
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:09,923
Listen, I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

60
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:14,223
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

61
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:19,353
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

62
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:31,193
Who's there?
Who's there?

63
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,283
- I'm calling the police.

64
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:39,033
You should never say,
"Who's there?"

65
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,543
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

66
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:46,213
You might as well just
come out here to investigate
a strange noise or somethin'.

67
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:49,713
Look, you've had
your fun now...

68
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:53,343
- so I think you better
just leave or else.
- Or else what?

69
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:58,053
Or else my boyfriend'll
be here any second, and he'll
be pissed when he finds out.

70
00:04:58,053 --> 00:05:00,063
I thought you didn't
have a boyfriend.

71
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:03,983
I lied! I do have a boyfriend,
and he'll be here any second...

72
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:07,103
- so your ass better be gone.
- Sure.

73
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:09,653
I swear.

74
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:14,613
He's big, and he plays football
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

75
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:17,913
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.

76
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:20,413
So you better just leave.

77
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:22,413
His name wouldn't be...

78
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:25,413
Steve, would it?

79
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:28,423
How do you know his name?

80
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:32,423
Turn on the patio lights... again.

81
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,603
Oh, God!

82
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:50,363
- I wouldn't
do that if I were you.
- Where are you?

83
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:52,483
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.

84
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:55,193
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?

85
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:57,743
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

86
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:00,413
- Then he dies right now!
- No! No!

87
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:04,993
Which is it?
Which is it?

88
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:09,003
Wha... What kind of game?

89
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:13,803
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

90
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:15,803
Just do it!

91
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:20,933
Casey! No! No!

92
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:23,053
No! Casey!

93
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:25,063
Here's how we play.

94
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:29,483
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

95
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,863
- Please don't do this.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

96
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,943
- Please...
- It's an easy category.

97
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,943
- Please...
- Movie trivia.

98
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:38,863
- I'll even give you
a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.

99
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:42,373
- Name the killer in "Halloween."
- No.

100
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:45,373
Come on! It's your favorite
scary movie, remember?

101
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:48,713
- He had a white mask;
he stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.

102
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,713
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

103
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:55,003
- What's his name?
- I can't think.

104
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:57,553
Steve's counting on you.

105
00:06:57,593 --> 00:07:00,683
Michael...
Michael, Michael.

106
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:03,303
Yes! Very good.

107
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:05,313
Now for the real question.

108
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,723
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

109
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:11,233
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!

110
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:14,363
Answer the question.
Same category.

111
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:17,363
Oh, please stop.

112
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:20,533
Name the killer
in "Friday the 13th."

113
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,243
Jason! Jason, Jason!

114
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:26,373
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.

115
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,913
No, it's not! No, it's not.
It was Jason.

116
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:32,213
Afraid not. No way.

117
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:36,213
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

118
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:39,423
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. Voorhees, was the original killer.

119
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:41,803
Jason didn't show up
until the sequel.

120
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:44,763
I'm afraid that was
a wrong answer.

121
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,763
You tricked me.

122
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:48,853
Lucky for you
there's a bonus round.

123
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:52,693
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!

124
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:21,053
Hey, we're not finished yet.

125
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:25,683
Final question.
Are you ready?

126
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:29,933
Please,
please, leave me alone.

127
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,933
Answer the question, and I will.

128
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:36,733
What door am I at?

129
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:40,403
- What?
- There are two main doors to your house.

130
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:42,403
The front door,
the patio doors.

131
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:44,403
If you answer correctly, you live.

132
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:46,703
Very simple.

133
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,873
Don't do this.
I can't; I won't.

134
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:52,503
Your call.

135
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:22,213
- Aah!

136
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:18,273
Did you water over here today?

137
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:20,813
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?

138
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:23,813
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.

139
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:29,443
Mom!

140
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:31,783
- Jesus!
- What is it?

141
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:47,633
Casey!

142
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:53,383
Oh, G...

143
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,353
Casey. Casey.

144
00:11:57,393 --> 00:11:59,353
Casey!

145
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,733
- Where is she?
- Call the police!

146
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:10,943
- Casey!

147
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:13,863
- Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

148
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,873
- Casey?
- She's here.

149
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:18,373
- Mom.
- Oh, my God,
I can hear her.

150
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:21,833
- Mom.
- Where is she?

151
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,833
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.

152
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,843
- Hey!

153
00:12:30,513 --> 00:12:34,513
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

154
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:37,933
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

155
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,933
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

156
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:25,023
- It's just me.

157
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:28,103
- Billy, what are you doing here?
- Sorry, don't hate me.

158
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:30,483
- You sleep in that?
- Yes, I sleep in this.

159
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,483
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.

160
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,903
- I'll just stay a sec.

161
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:37,033
No... You gotta go. Go, go, go.

162
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:39,243
What's going on in there?

163
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:41,243
- Are you okay?
- Can you knock?

164
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:43,163
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.

165
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:45,543
No?

166
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,713
Oh, well.
I'm hitting the sack.

167
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:51,253
My flight leaves
first thing in the morning.

168
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:54,383
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back 'til Sunday.

169
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:57,763
- There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at...
- The Hilton.

170
00:13:57,763 --> 00:14:00,723
- Out at the airport, so call if...
- I need anything.

171
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:03,813
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.

172
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:05,933
Have a good trip, okay?

173
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,943
Sleep tight, sweetie.

174
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:14,483
Oh... close call.

175
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:17,363
Billy, what're you doing here?

176
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,363
It occurred to me that...

177
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:21,623
- I've never snuck through
your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.

178
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:24,373
Great idea, now that
it's out of your system.

179
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,373
I was home watching television.

180
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:28,923
"The," uh,
"The Exorcist" was on.

181
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:32,843
- It got me thinking of you.
- It did?

182
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:36,763
Yeah, it was edited for TV. You know,
all the good stuff was cut out.

183
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:41,143
And it got me thinking of us...

184
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:44,813
how two years ago
we started off hot and heavy.

185
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:48,773
Nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.

186
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:53,733
And now... things have changed and...

187
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:02,243
lately we're just sort of
edited for television.

188
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:06,703
Oh, so you thought
you would climb in my window...

189
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:09,913
- and we'd have a little raw footage?
- No.

190
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:14,173
No, I wouldn't dream of breaking
your underwear rule.

191
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:19,173
I just thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

192
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:26,103
- Okay.
- Yeah?

193
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:28,103
Yeah.

194
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:32,103
If we ever fly away

195
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:36,573
Baby, I'm with you

196
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:41,493
Baby, I'm your man

197
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,493
Hey.

198
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:53,543
La, la, la, la
la, la, la

199
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:01,883
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-muffin.

200
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,893
God, you see what
you do to me?

201
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:08,393
You know what
my dad'll do to you?

202
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:10,893
Yeah.

203
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:13,893
- I'm going.
- Okay.

204
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:20,193
Romeo and Juliet

205
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:23,113
Are together in eternity

206
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:25,783
You know, l... I appreciate
the romantic gesture.

207
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:27,783
So, come on, baby

208
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,703
Hey, about the, uh,
the sex stuff?

209
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:34,463
I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

210
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:36,963
I was only half serious.

211
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:39,423
Okay.

212
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,723
Baby, I'm your man

213
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:47,393
Baby, I'm your man

214
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,393
Hey, Billy.

215
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:53,733
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

216
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:56,483
What's that?

217
00:16:56,523 --> 00:17:02,033
- La, la, la-la, la

218
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:05,993
My God. You're just a tease.

219
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:16,083
Thirty-five...

220
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:18,833
Situation under control.

221
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:21,843
Roger, dispatch.

222
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,673
There's blood found?
All right.

223
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:42,943
...are doing drugs they buy
in the classrooms...

224
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,443
and that they are
involved in the occult.

225
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:47,743
Occult?

226
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:50,873
Woodsboro, California,
was devastated last night...

227
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:53,703
when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

228
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:55,913
Authorities have yet
to issue a statement...

229
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:59,423
but our sources tell us
that no arrest has been made...

230
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:01,423
- and the murderer could strike again.
- Do you believe this shit?

231
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:04,633
- Damn! What is going on?
- You don't know?

232
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:08,303
Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.

233
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:10,303
What? No way.

234
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:12,813
And we're not just talking killed;
we're talking splatter-movie killed.

235
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,893
Ripped open from end to end.

236
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:17,523
Casey Becker, she sits
next to me in English.

237
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:19,523
Not anymore.
It's so sad.

238
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:21,903
Her mom and dad, they found her
hanging from a tree...

239
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:24,863
- her insides on the outside.
- Oh, my God!

240
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:26,863
Do they know who did it?

241
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:30,243
Fucking clueless.
They're interrogating the entire school.

242
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,783
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?

243
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,793
They don't know.
Dewey was saying this is
the worst crime they've seen in years.

244
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,793
- Even worse than...

245
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,543
Well... it's bad.

246
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:50,223
- Here you go, Mrs. Tate.
- Thank you, James.

247
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:54,723
Sidney.

248
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:57,143
It would appear to be your turn.

249
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:04,943
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.

250
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:07,743
She was daughter of, uh...

251
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,703
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

252
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,073
Hi, Sidney.

253
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,663
Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

254
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:19,413
Uh, that's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

255
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:22,883
- How is everything?
- Good.

256
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:25,043
And your dad?
How's he doin'?

257
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:29,013
- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this
very brief, Sidney.

258
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:31,763
The police just want to ask you
a few questions. You okay?

259
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:33,183
Mm-hmm.

260
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:36,513
Sidney, were you
very close to Casey Becker?

261
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:40,183
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

262
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:43,943
All students are encouraged to return
home promptly from school grounds.

263
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,023
Avoid strangers;
walk in twos and threes.

264
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:48,033
What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?

265
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:50,283
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- They asked me that too.

266
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,823
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.

267
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:54,823
Did they ask you?

268
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:56,873
Why would they ask you
if you liked to hunt?

269
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:59,373
'Cause their bodies were gutted.

270
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,673
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

271
00:20:02,713 --> 00:20:05,793
- 'Cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.

272
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,503
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct."

273
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:10,923
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

274
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:13,513
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

275
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:16,143
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

276
00:20:16,143 --> 00:20:18,143
Or a man's mentality.

277
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:20,683
How do you... gut someone?

278
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:28,523
You take a knife, and you slit 'em
from the groin to sternum.

279
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:32,363
Hey, it's called tact,
you fuck rag.

280
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:34,613
Hey, Stu, didn't you
used to date Casey?

281
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:38,703
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she
dumped him for Steve.

282
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:40,703
I thought you
dumped her for me.

283
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:44,123
- I did. He's full of shit.
- And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

284
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:47,333
Hey, what're you saying?
That I killed her?

285
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,383
It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."

286
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:53,303
- Stu was with me last night, okay?
- Yeah, I was.

287
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:56,933
Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

288
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:59,053
Fuck you, nutcase.
Where were you last night?

289
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:02,983
- Working, thank you.
- At the video store?
I thought they fired your ass.

290
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:05,023
Twice.

291
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:08,943
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.

292
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,693
Thanks, buddy.

293
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:15,823
Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

294
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:18,993
- I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.
- Tell me something.

295
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,493
Did you really put
her liver in the mailbox?

296
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:25,463
'Cause I heard that they
found her liver in the mailbox
next to her spleen and pancreas.

297
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:27,543
You goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here.

298
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,713
She's getting mad, all right?

299
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:31,753
You better "liver" alone.

300
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:37,553
"Liver" alone!

301
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:43,813
"Liv..." Ow!
"Liver. Liver." It was a joke.

302
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:52,573
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

303
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:19,223
So, you're sure I can stay over,
'cause my dad won't be back 'til Sunday.

304
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:21,513
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practice.

305
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:25,023
You okay?

306
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:27,523
Uh-huh. It's just...

307
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,523
you know, the police
and the reporters...

308
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:31,523
it's like déjà  vu
all over again.

309
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:33,903
I'll be there by 7:00.
I promise.

310
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:36,403
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

311
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:26,333
The bodies of 17-year-old
Casey Becker...

312
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,333
and her 18-year-old boyfriend,
Steven Orth...

313
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,333
were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents...

314
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,463
The Woodsboro double murder case.

315
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:35,503
Authorities are baffled
by the lack of clues and the savage...

316
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:39,133
The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...

317
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:41,933
although this is not the first time
this small community...

318
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:45,013
of Woodsboro
has endured such tragedy.

319
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,063
Only a year ago
Maureen Prescott, wife and mother...

320
00:23:47,103 --> 00:23:51,603
was found raped and murdered
not far from this peaceful town square.

321
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:06,013
- Hello?
- Practice ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?

322
00:25:07,893 --> 00:25:09,853
It's past 7:00.

323
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:12,853
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't
bite it 'til way after 10:00.

324
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:15,773
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.

325
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,773
I'm gonna swing by
the video store.

326
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:19,773
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise,
"All The Right Moves."

327
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:22,693
If you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

328
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:25,703
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.

329
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:40,713
- Tatum, just get in the car...
- Hello, Sidney.

330
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:44,553
Uh... hi, who is this?

331
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:48,223
You tell me.

332
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:50,723
Well, I-I have no idea.

333
00:25:50,763 --> 00:25:52,723
Scary night, isn't it?

334
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:57,603
With the murders and all,
it's like right out of
a horror movie or something.

335
00:25:57,643 --> 00:26:00,233
Randy, you gave yourself away.

336
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:02,523
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

337
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:06,113
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

338
00:26:06,153 --> 00:26:09,243
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

339
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:11,993
What's your favorite scary movie?

340
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:14,243
Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.

341
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:16,873
- Why not? Too scared?
- No. No.

342
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:19,003
It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

343
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:22,213
Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...

344
00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:25,213
who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.

345
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:29,223
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?

346
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:31,853
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

347
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:35,223
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.

348
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:44,273
So, who are you?

349
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:46,363
The question isn't
"Who am I?"

350
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:49,913
The question is
"Where am I?"

351
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:54,033
S-S-So, where are you?

352
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,083
Your front porch.

353
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:02,833
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

354
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:04,843
That's the original part.

355
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:08,513
Oh, yeah?

356
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:14,183
Well, I call your bluff.

357
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:29,863
- So, where are you?
- Right here.

358
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:04,943
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.

359
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:06,943
Uh-huh, okay.

360
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:09,993
What am I doin'? Huh?

361
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:13,493
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

362
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,743
Nice try, Randy.

363
00:28:16,783 --> 00:28:19,163
Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay?
Bye now.

364
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:21,833
If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!

365
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:28,633
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.

366
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:31,803
Fuck you, you cretin!

367
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:02,833
No!

368
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:34,693
Shit!

369
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:51,593
Billy!

370
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:53,843
The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

371
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:55,843
The killer's here.
He's in the house.

372
00:29:55,883 --> 00:29:58,803
He's in the house.
He's got a knife.

373
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:01,473
He's gone.
He's gone.

374
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:03,473
It's all right.

375
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,403
What?

376
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:21,623
Sid, what?

377
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,873
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!

378
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:28,463
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's going on?

379
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:32,043
Sidney, come back! Sidney!

380
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:40,433
Sorry! I found this. Come on!

381
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:42,433
All right, hold your hands together.

382
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:45,433
- Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?
- I didn't do anything.

383
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,433
Do you wish to give up
your right to speak to an attorney...

384
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,443
- And have them present
during questioning?

385
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:53,443
Ask her. She'll tell you.

386
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:55,613
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait. Who is that?

387
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:59,113
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.

388
00:30:59,113 --> 00:31:02,283
I didn't do it.
Sheriff, wait.

389
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:04,283
Wait, listen.
Call my dad.

390
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:06,703
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Call him.

391
00:31:06,753 --> 00:31:10,213
Sidney! Sidney!

392
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:12,333
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

393
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:15,343
She'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.

394
00:31:15,383 --> 00:31:18,843
- Sid!
- Well, we're seein' a lot of you today.

395
00:31:18,883 --> 00:31:22,723
You gonna be able to come
down to the station and answer
a few questions, Sid?

396
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:24,723
Oh, shit! Sidney!

397
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:26,973
God, Sid, I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?

398
00:31:27,023 --> 00:31:29,023
Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.

399
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:32,773
- It's okay.
- Her dad's out of town.
She's staying with us.

400
00:31:32,813 --> 00:31:34,773
Does Mom know?

401
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:37,283
- Yes, doofus.
- Let's get you out of here.

402
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:39,283
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

403
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:41,283
Oh, you won't believe this.

404
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:46,743
Creepy, huh?

405
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:57,713
- I'll be damned.
- What?

406
00:31:57,753 --> 00:32:00,723
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!
- My name isn't Jesus.

407
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,593
Sidney, is that you in there?

408
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:06,603
Excuse me. Is that Sidney Prescott
they took away?

409
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:08,603
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

410
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:12,063
- None of your damned business.
- I heard something about
a costume. Is that true?

411
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:16,193
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.

412
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:18,733
Leave Sid alone.

413
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:20,743
Where's she goin'?

414
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:24,533
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

415
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:26,913
I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight...

416
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:28,913
but when I say "hurry,"

417
00:32:28,953 --> 00:32:33,753
please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"

418
00:32:35,543 --> 00:32:38,423
Did you find him?

419
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:41,463
You sure it was the Hilton?

420
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:46,263
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.

421
00:32:47,603 --> 00:32:50,603
Could he have stayed
somewhere else?

422
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:53,853
I don't know. I guess.

423
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:56,193
Don't worry, Sid.

424
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:59,693
- We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.

425
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,193
I'll be right back.

426
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:15,623
Let me ask you this. What're you doin'
with a cellular telephone, son?

427
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,633
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

428
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:20,923
I didn't make those calls, I swear.

429
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:22,923
Check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake.

430
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:25,263
Call Vital Phone Comp. They got
the records of every number dialed.

431
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:28,223
Thanks, Hank.
We're on top of it.

432
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:30,973
What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?

433
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:33,563
I wanted to see her, that's all.

434
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:37,403
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

435
00:33:37,443 --> 00:33:39,813
You went out last night?

436
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:44,443
I was watching TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

437
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:47,323
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

438
00:33:47,363 --> 00:33:51,453
No, I didn't. Sheriff,
I didn't kill anybody!

439
00:33:56,753 --> 00:33:59,883
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
'til we get those phone records.

440
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:05,303
That's crazy.

441
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:09,433
You know that?
I didn't do it.

442
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,903
Camera Two? Okay.

443
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:24,233
Are there anymore
doughnuts in there?

444
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:27,283
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

445
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:30,283
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.

446
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:32,283
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.

447
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,793
Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live
from Woodsboro police station...

448
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,873
where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

449
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:40,923
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you
know who you're dealing with?

450
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:43,963
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

451
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:46,053
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

452
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:48,343
Sidney, come on.
You know me.

453
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:51,223
Sidney, look at me!

454
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:53,723
Come on!

455
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:02,063
Sid, we're gonna get you
out of here, okay? Are you okay?

456
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:07,613
They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

457
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:10,363
There's no way
to track the purchase.

458
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:12,703
What about that cellular
phone bill?

459
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:16,543
We're pulling Loomis's account.
We won't know anything
until the morning.

460
00:35:16,543 --> 00:35:20,003
Oh, come on!

461
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:23,793
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance."

462
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:28,673
But these kids today...
damned if I know.

463
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:31,973
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

464
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:35,433
- Goddamn it, Dewey!
- What did Mama tell you?

465
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,103
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law!

466
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:40,393
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go.

467
00:35:40,393 --> 00:35:43,443
- Now, okay?
- Whoa.

468
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:47,483
Take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

469
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:50,493
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

470
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:53,993
- He's my superior.
- Janitors are your superior.

471
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,373
Let's get back to work!

472
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:06,883
- Isn't there a back way
out of this building?
- Yeah.

473
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:09,383
Down that alley, I think.

474
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:15,183
You guys just stay here.
I'm gonna get the car.

475
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,183
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

476
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:21,943
There she is. Sidney!

477
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:25,153
Hi, that's some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

478
00:36:25,193 --> 00:36:27,613
She's not answering any questions.
Just leave us alone.

479
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:30,113
No, Tatum, it's okay.
She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?

480
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:33,613
- Yes, that's right.
- So, how's the book?

481
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:35,663
Well, it'll be out
later this year.

482
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:38,033
Oh, I'll look for it.

483
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,003
I'll send you a copy.

484
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:43,253
Jeez.

485
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:45,883
- Nice shot.
- Bitch.

486
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:49,053
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

487
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:52,053
God, I loved it.
"I'll send you a copy."

488
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,053
Bam! Bitch went down.

489
00:36:54,093 --> 00:36:58,303
"I'll send you a copy."
Bam! Sid... Superbitch!

490
00:36:58,353 --> 00:37:00,353
You are so cool.

491
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:02,683
Thought you might want
some ice for that right hook.

492
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:04,943
Thanks.

493
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:08,693
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

494
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,693
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:18,533
- Do you really think Billy did it?

496
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,543
He was there, Tatum.

497
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:25,123
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

498
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:27,633
- Telephone, honey.

499
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:29,633
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.

500
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:31,463
My dad?

501
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:34,383
- I don't think so.
- Take a message.

502
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:36,383
No, um, I'll get it.

503
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:42,723
How's she doin'?

504
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:46,773
Hello.

505
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:49,153
Hello, Sidney.

506
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:51,363
No!

507
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:53,363
Poor Billy-boyfriend.

508
00:37:53,363 --> 00:37:56,243
An innocent guy
doesn't stand a chance with you.

509
00:37:56,283 --> 00:38:00,533
- Leave me alone!
- Looks like you fingered
the wrong guy... again.

510
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,123
- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.

511
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:06,333
Don't worry.
You'll find out soon enough.

512
00:38:06,373 --> 00:38:09,293
- I promise.

513
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,293
What?

514
00:38:14,343 --> 00:38:16,303
- What?
- What?

515
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:23,893
Hello?

516
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:38,203
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...

517
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:40,203
is the daughter
of Maureen Prescott...

518
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:42,663
who was brutally
killed last year...

519
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:45,083
when convicted murderer
Cotton Weary broke into their home...

520
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,713
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

521
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:50,923
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting
appeal for the death sentence...

522
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:54,173
handed down after the young Sidney
testified against him.

523
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:57,013
She was the key witness in
the state's case against the...

524
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:01,893
It's never gonna stop, is it?

525
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,683
Billy was released.

526
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:09,313
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

527
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:11,943
We're checkin' every cellular account
in the county.

528
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:16,403
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

529
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:19,073
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

530
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:21,663
Okay?

531
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:41,183
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.

532
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:43,683
So how does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?

533
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:47,063
- Hey, leave her alone!
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.

534
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:49,063
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?

535
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:52,693
She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

536
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:55,193
What?

537
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:58,363
Just a sec.

538
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,203
Stop right there.

539
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:12,583
I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

540
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:15,213
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.

541
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:18,423
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.

542
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,973
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!

543
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:25,723
Your mother's murder
was last year's hottest court case.

544
00:40:25,763 --> 00:40:27,853
Somebody was gonna write about it.

545
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:30,853
And it had to be you with all your lies
and bullshit theories.

546
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:33,693
What is your problem?
You got what you wanted.

547
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:38,023
Cotton Weary's in jail.
They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.

548
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:43,283
Do you still think
he's innocent?

549
00:40:43,323 --> 00:40:46,163
Your testimony put him away.
It doesn't really matter what I think.

550
00:40:46,203 --> 00:40:50,203
During the trial, you did
all those stories about me.
You called me a liar.

551
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:52,463
I think you
falsely identified him, yes.

552
00:40:52,503 --> 00:40:56,043
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

553
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:58,093
And has his story changed?

554
00:40:58,093 --> 00:41:00,093
Not one word.

555
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:02,723
He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.

556
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:05,053
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

557
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:07,513
He raped her,
and then he...

558
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:10,473
He butchered her.
Her blood was all over his coat.

559
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:12,483
He was drunk that night.

560
00:41:12,523 --> 00:41:15,273
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

561
00:41:15,313 --> 00:41:19,523
- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat.

562
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:25,203
The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

563
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:29,413
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

564
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,163
You're not so sure anymore,
are you?

565
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:39,543
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.

566
00:41:39,593 --> 00:41:41,553
The killer's still
on the loose, isn't he?

567
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:44,013
- Come on, Sid.
- Those murders are related.

568
00:41:44,053 --> 00:41:46,883
I'm sorry I mangled your face.

569
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:50,053
- Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?

570
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:57,523
Jesus Christ!

571
00:41:57,563 --> 00:42:00,773
An innocent man on death row.
A killer still on the loose.

572
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:03,613
- Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?

573
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:06,953
- Not so fast. We don't have
anything concrete.
- You can't just sit on it.

574
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:10,123
I know!
That's why we need proof.

575
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:14,253
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

576
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:17,673
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

577
00:42:17,713 --> 00:42:20,213
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

578
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:24,593
I want you to meet me right here
after class, okay, Sid?

579
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:26,973
All right.

580
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:31,683
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

581
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:33,893
Oh, you mean after you
branded him the Candyman?

582
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:35,933
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!

583
00:42:45,073 --> 00:42:47,033
Why are they doing this?

584
00:42:47,073 --> 00:42:50,413
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

585
00:42:50,453 --> 00:42:53,533
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

586
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:56,373
Sidney!

587
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:58,503
- Ow!
- Jesus, shit!

588
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:01,333
It's just me.

589
00:43:01,383 --> 00:43:04,923
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

590
00:43:04,963 --> 00:43:07,423
No. No, I-I don't.

591
00:43:07,473 --> 00:43:10,933
It's just...
somebody was there.

592
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:13,013
Billy, someone tried to kill me.

593
00:43:13,013 --> 00:43:17,023
I know, I know. The cops said
I scared him away. It wasn't me, Sid.

594
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:21,483
I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.

595
00:43:21,523 --> 00:43:24,363
You see? It couldn't have
been me. I was in jail.

596
00:43:24,363 --> 00:43:26,363
Remember?

597
00:43:27,693 --> 00:43:31,203
I'm so... sorry.
Please understand.

598
00:43:31,203 --> 00:43:33,203
Understand what?

599
00:43:33,203 --> 00:43:35,793
That I have a girlfriend
who would rather accuse me...

600
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:38,583
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

601
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,793
You know that's not true.

602
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,633
- Then what is it?
- What... is it?

603
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:47,513
Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!

604
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:49,513
I mean between us.

605
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:52,393
You haven't been
the same since...

606
00:43:53,893 --> 00:43:56,643
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?

607
00:43:56,683 --> 00:43:59,233
My mom was killed.
I can't believe you're bringing this up!

608
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:03,523
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.

609
00:44:03,563 --> 00:44:05,523
I think it's time
you got over that.

610
00:44:05,563 --> 00:44:08,903
When my mom left my dad,
I accepted it. That's the way it is.

611
00:44:08,903 --> 00:44:10,863
She's not coming back.

612
00:44:10,903 --> 00:44:14,033
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

613
00:44:14,073 --> 00:44:17,083
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

614
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:20,163
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's a bad analogy.

615
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:22,503
It's just that...

616
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:25,583
I want my girlfriend back.

617
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:29,803
Sid!

618
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:31,803
Billy, I am sorry
if my traumatized life...

619
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:34,803
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

620
00:44:34,843 --> 00:44:38,063
What? Wh...
Nobody said that. Sid!

621
00:44:39,773 --> 00:44:41,733
Stupid.

622
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:43,943
You make me so sick!

623
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:48,483
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!

624
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:52,993
So, two of
your fellow students...

625
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:55,283
just savagely murdered...

626
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:58,583
and this is the way you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

627
00:44:58,623 --> 00:45:02,003
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!

628
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:05,333
Come on, Mr. Himbry!
It was just a joke.

629
00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:07,333
That's not fair!

630
00:45:10,463 --> 00:45:13,173
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.

631
00:45:13,223 --> 00:45:15,593
Fairness would be
to rip your insides out...

632
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:17,803
hang you from a tree
so we can expose you...

633
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:20,853
for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

634
00:45:32,903 --> 00:45:35,863
She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.

635
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:38,203
- Why would she lie about it?
- For attention!

636
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:40,533
The girl has some serious issues.

637
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,583
What if she did it?

638
00:45:48,633 --> 00:45:51,133
What if Sidney killed
Casey and Steve?

639
00:45:51,173 --> 00:45:53,133
Why would she do that?

640
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:56,513
Maybe she had the hots for Steve
and killed them both in a jealous rage.

641
00:45:56,513 --> 00:46:01,513
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend.

642
00:46:01,513 --> 00:46:04,983
Maybe she's a slut
just like her mother.

643
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:08,353
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.

644
00:46:08,353 --> 00:46:12,363
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack. She watched
her mom get butchered.

645
00:46:12,363 --> 00:46:14,653
And it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

646
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:17,323
Her mother's death leaves her
disturbed and hostile.

647
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:20,953
In a cruel and inhumane world,
she's delusional.

648
00:46:20,993 --> 00:46:23,993
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.

649
00:46:24,043 --> 00:46:26,833
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...

650
00:46:26,873 --> 00:46:30,333
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...

651
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:34,343
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

652
00:46:34,383 --> 00:46:37,343
- Where do you get this shit?
- Ricki Lake.

653
00:46:37,383 --> 00:46:40,553
You are pathetic.

654
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:55,943
Pathetic.

655
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:25,183
Sidney.

656
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:31,733
Is someone there?

657
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:13,353
In what appears to be a prank...

658
00:48:13,353 --> 00:48:16,073
several students were seen
wearing scary masks.

659
00:48:16,113 --> 00:48:18,073
School officials
have yet to comment...

660
00:48:18,113 --> 00:48:22,033
but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.

661
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:26,203
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth
have already lost their lives.

662
00:48:26,243 --> 00:48:28,203
Who's next?

663
00:48:28,243 --> 00:48:32,123
You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

664
00:48:32,163 --> 00:48:35,253
Hi! Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, "Top Story."

665
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:37,253
I know who you are,
Miss Weathers.

666
00:48:37,293 --> 00:48:41,723
- How's the eye?
- It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

667
00:48:41,763 --> 00:48:43,723
No, everything's under control.

668
00:48:43,763 --> 00:48:47,433
- Of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.

669
00:48:47,473 --> 00:48:50,523
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker...

670
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:52,563
but who knew?

671
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:55,103
You look awfully young
to be a police officer.

672
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:57,773
I'm 25 years old.

673
00:48:57,823 --> 00:48:59,783
You know, in a demographic study...

674
00:48:59,823 --> 00:49:03,243
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

675
00:49:03,283 --> 00:49:07,783
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.

676
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:10,203
Except in that
upper torso area.

677
00:49:10,203 --> 00:49:13,583
- Does the force require you to work out?
- No, ma'am.

678
00:49:13,623 --> 00:49:15,583
'Cause of my boyish good looks...

679
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:19,463
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

680
00:49:19,503 --> 00:49:22,173
I need your attention now, kids.

681
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:24,303
Due to the recent events
that have occurred...

682
00:49:24,343 --> 00:49:28,393
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

683
00:49:28,393 --> 00:49:33,023
- The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...

684
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:36,853
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

685
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:38,863
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

686
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:40,903
Serial killer's
not really accurate.

687
00:49:40,903 --> 00:49:43,783
Gotta knock off
a couple more to get that title.

688
00:49:43,823 --> 00:49:46,913
Well, we can hope, can't we?

689
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:50,083
I mean, we certainly
don't have any leads.

690
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:53,253
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.

691
00:49:53,253 --> 00:49:58,633
- He's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out
as a... possibility.

692
00:49:58,673 --> 00:50:02,213
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

693
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:06,053
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...

694
00:50:06,093 --> 00:50:09,643
you are much prettier in person.

695
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:11,893
So you do watch the show.

696
00:50:13,473 --> 00:50:18,653
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.

697
00:50:18,693 --> 00:50:22,023
Please, call me Gale!

698
00:50:22,073 --> 00:50:24,443
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

699
00:50:24,443 --> 00:50:26,743
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.

700
00:50:26,783 --> 00:50:30,743
You're not to pee alone anymore.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

701
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,413
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out."

702
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:35,413
I don't know what you did, Sidney.

703
00:50:35,453 --> 00:50:37,583
But on behalf of the entire
student body, we all say, "Thank you!"

704
00:50:37,623 --> 00:50:40,083
- Drop it, Stu.
- I say...

705
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:42,923
an impromptu party tonight,
my house.

706
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:44,923
Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?

707
00:50:44,963 --> 00:50:46,923
Are you serious?

708
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:48,933
This little vixen...

709
00:50:48,973 --> 00:50:51,303
doesn't invite the entire world,
we'll be fine.

710
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:53,813
Intimate gathering,
intimate friends.

711
00:50:53,813 --> 00:50:55,813
What do you say, Sid?

712
00:50:55,813 --> 00:50:57,813
I mean, pathos could
have its perks.

713
00:50:57,813 --> 00:51:00,313
Totally protected.
Yo, I am so buff.

714
00:51:00,313 --> 00:51:02,443
I got you covered, girl.

715
00:51:02,483 --> 00:51:06,443
Come on, Sid. For me?
It could be fun.

716
00:51:07,403 --> 00:51:09,743
Okay. Whatever.

717
00:51:09,783 --> 00:51:11,743
Yeah? Nice.

718
00:51:11,783 --> 00:51:13,743
Cool. You guys
bring food, all right?

719
00:51:31,683 --> 00:51:33,683
Yes?

720
00:51:33,683 --> 00:51:35,683
Hello?

721
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:13,393
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?

722
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:16,223
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.

723
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:10,233
Aaaah! Aaah!

724
00:53:10,283 --> 00:53:12,443
Ohhhhh!

725
00:53:22,293 --> 00:53:26,503
School's out for summer

726
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:32,013
- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary
is telling the truth?

727
00:53:32,053 --> 00:53:35,303
Maybe he was having
an affair with your mom.

728
00:53:35,303 --> 00:53:39,433
I mean, your dad was always out of town
on business. Maybe...

729
00:53:39,473 --> 00:53:42,603
Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.

730
00:53:42,643 --> 00:53:46,653
If they were having an affair, how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

731
00:53:46,693 --> 00:53:51,533
Well, you can't prove a rumor.
That's why it's a rumor.

732
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:55,653
Right. Created by that
little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

733
00:53:56,993 --> 00:53:59,623
It goes further back, Sid.

734
00:53:59,663 --> 00:54:02,623
There's been talk
about other men.

735
00:54:02,663 --> 00:54:05,163
And you believe it.

736
00:54:05,213 --> 00:54:11,043
Well, you can only hear
that Richard Gere gerbil story
so many times...

737
00:54:11,093 --> 00:54:14,053
before you have to start
believing it.

738
00:54:17,843 --> 00:54:20,013
Oh, I'm sorry.

739
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:25,523
Y-You know, if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary...

740
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:27,523
then... the killer's
still out there.

741
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:29,523
Don't go there, Sid.

742
00:54:29,523 --> 00:54:32,693
You're starting to sound like some
Wes Carpenter flick or something.

743
00:54:32,733 --> 00:54:36,743
Don't freak yourself, okay? We've got
a long night ahead of us. Okay?

744
00:54:37,743 --> 00:54:39,743
Let's boogie.

745
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:45,333
It's alive!

746
00:54:45,373 --> 00:54:49,333
- Henry...
- Oh, in the name of God,
now I know...

747
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:51,343
Excuse me, dude.

748
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:55,053
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

749
00:54:57,383 --> 00:54:59,383
Ohhhh!

750
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,803
Dork.

751
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:04,813
Jesus, this place
is packed tonight, man.

752
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:08,313
- We had a run
in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?

753
00:55:08,353 --> 00:55:10,903
Yeah, I'm off early.
Curfew, you know.

754
00:55:10,943 --> 00:55:13,943
What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?

755
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:17,073
- "The Howling."
Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

756
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:22,243
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

757
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:26,293
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...

758
00:55:26,293 --> 00:55:29,293
would you be standing
in the horror section?

759
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:33,253
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.

760
00:55:33,253 --> 00:55:35,253
You're such a little lapdog.

761
00:55:35,253 --> 00:55:38,763
- He's got "killer" printed
all over his forehead.
- Ohhh-kay!

762
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:42,553
Really? Well, why'd the cops
let him go, smart guy?

763
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:46,723
Obviously they don't
watch enough movies. This is
standard horror movie stuff.

764
00:55:46,773 --> 00:55:51,443
- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna
kill his own girlfriend?

765
00:55:51,443 --> 00:55:54,563
There's always some stupid,
bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.

766
00:55:54,613 --> 00:55:58,193
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all:
Simplicity.

767
00:55:58,243 --> 00:56:01,953
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.

768
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:04,073
Well, what's his reason?

769
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:06,623
Maybe Sidney
wouldn't have sex with him.

770
00:56:06,623 --> 00:56:10,163
- What, is she
savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.

771
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:14,923
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

772
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:22,803
No, I don't at all. No.

773
00:56:22,803 --> 00:56:26,223
You know who I think it is?

774
00:56:26,263 --> 00:56:28,933
You know, I think it's her father.

775
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:31,443
Why can't they find her pops, man?

776
00:56:31,483 --> 00:56:33,603
Because he's probably dead.

777
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:37,233
His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!

778
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:41,193
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

779
00:56:41,243 --> 00:56:43,993
- The police are always
off track with this shit.
- Man!

780
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,533
If they'd watch "Prom Night,"
they'd save time.

781
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:50,543
There's a formula to it.
A very simple formula!
Everybody's a suspect!

782
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:59,303
I'm telling you, the dad's
a red herring. It's Billy.

783
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:03,803
How do we know
you're not the killer? Huh?

784
00:57:03,843 --> 00:57:06,393
- Huh?
- Hi, Billy.

785
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:09,853
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its
reality button. You ever think of that?

786
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:12,853
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

787
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:16,353
- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.

788
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:18,363
And what would be your motive?

789
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:20,573
It's the millennium.

790
00:57:20,613 --> 00:57:22,573
Motives are incidental.

791
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:24,653
"Millennium." Hmm.

792
00:57:24,703 --> 00:57:29,033
"Millennium." I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.

793
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:32,083
Good kid.

794
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:36,333
"Millennium."
Good word, my man.

795
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:38,383
Are you telling me
that's not a killer?

796
00:57:41,173 --> 00:57:43,883
You'll see him
in your nightmares

797
00:57:43,883 --> 00:57:46,723
You'll see him
in your dreams

798
00:57:49,723 --> 00:57:52,523
He'll appear
out of nowhere

799
00:57:52,563 --> 00:57:54,853
But he ain't

800
00:57:54,893 --> 00:57:57,563
What he seems

801
00:57:57,603 --> 00:58:00,323
You'll see him
in your head

802
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:02,363
On the TV screen

803
00:58:02,403 --> 00:58:06,073
Hey, buddy, I'm warnin' you
to turn it off

804
00:58:06,113 --> 00:58:08,533
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god

805
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:11,743
He's a man
He's a guru

806
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:18,083
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan

807
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:22,053
Designed and directed
by his red right hand

808
00:58:23,093 --> 00:58:25,053
Sure is quiet.

809
00:58:25,093 --> 00:58:27,053
God, look at this place.

810
00:58:27,093 --> 00:58:29,473
It's "The Town
That Dreaded Sundown."

811
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:32,973
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

812
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:34,983
- Mmm.
- Hey, Sid, just think.

813
00:58:35,023 --> 00:58:37,983
If they make a movie about you,
who's gonna play you?

814
00:58:38,023 --> 00:58:41,653
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

815
00:58:41,693 --> 00:58:45,153
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

816
00:58:45,193 --> 00:58:48,153
I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.

817
00:58:48,203 --> 00:58:50,163
You girls don't go too far.

818
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:54,623
Is Billy gonna be there tonight?

819
00:58:54,623 --> 00:58:57,753
He'd better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.

820
00:58:57,793 --> 00:59:00,753
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

821
00:59:02,383 --> 00:59:05,843
Billy's right, you know. Whenever he
touches me, I just can't relax.

822
00:59:05,883 --> 00:59:09,513
So you have a few
intimacy issues as a result of
your mother's untimely death.

823
00:59:09,553 --> 00:59:12,103
That's no big deal.
You'll thaw out.

824
00:59:12,143 --> 00:59:15,603
Yeah, but he has been so patient
with me with all the sex stuff.

825
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:19,313
How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

826
00:59:19,353 --> 00:59:22,363
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

827
00:59:30,743 --> 00:59:32,703
Dewey, where the hell you been?

828
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:35,703
I was keepin' an eye
on Sidney, uh...

829
00:59:37,003 --> 00:59:41,673
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it...

830
00:59:41,673 --> 00:59:45,003
Dewey, Vital Phone
just faxed us.

831
00:59:45,053 --> 00:59:49,513
Those calls are listed
to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.

832
00:59:49,513 --> 00:59:53,183
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

833
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:57,393
There's no way a cellular
coulda been cloned?

834
00:59:57,433 --> 01:00:00,233
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.

835
01:00:00,273 --> 01:00:02,853
The anniversary
of his wife's death.

836
01:00:05,693 --> 01:00:08,693
We'll keep the roadblocks and
the curfew in effect through the night.

837
01:00:08,693 --> 01:00:12,033
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

838
01:00:13,163 --> 01:00:15,123
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.

839
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:18,703
- You want me to bring her in?
- Naw.

840
01:00:18,753 --> 01:00:20,753
Not just yet.

841
01:00:20,753 --> 01:00:24,253
Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

842
01:00:31,553 --> 01:00:34,183
You stay close to Sidney.

843
01:00:34,223 --> 01:00:36,853
Don't let her
out of your sight.

844
01:00:36,893 --> 01:00:39,183
Yes, sir.

845
01:00:58,703 --> 01:01:02,373
Say a prayer
for the youth of America

846
01:01:05,293 --> 01:01:08,463
God bless the youth
of America

847
01:01:11,263 --> 01:01:13,803
I can't stand
their sight anymore

848
01:01:13,843 --> 01:01:16,093
- All right, you girls have fun.

849
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:19,143
Not too much fun,
or I'll bust ya.

850
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:22,313
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

851
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:30,733
You're obsessed

852
01:01:30,783 --> 01:01:35,033
You're obsessed

853
01:01:35,073 --> 01:01:37,033
- Here, kids!

854
01:01:39,413 --> 01:01:41,373
Oh! That's absurd.

855
01:01:41,413 --> 01:01:44,373
You guys were tardy for the party,
so we started without you.

856
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:46,423
- My man!

857
01:02:01,103 --> 01:02:03,063
Shh.

858
01:02:04,233 --> 01:02:06,193
Were we spotted?

859
01:02:06,233 --> 01:02:09,193
I don't think so.
Go get the camera.

860
01:02:11,693 --> 01:02:14,073
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare ya.

861
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:17,323
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?

862
01:02:17,363 --> 01:02:21,533
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

863
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:25,663
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

864
01:02:25,713 --> 01:02:28,503
Then what are you doing here?

865
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:33,553
Just keepin' an eye on things.

866
01:02:33,553 --> 01:02:36,553
I'm gonna check the party out.

867
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:40,053
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

868
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:44,393
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.

869
01:02:49,563 --> 01:02:52,573
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

870
01:02:52,613 --> 01:02:54,573
Oh! Yeah.

871
01:02:56,693 --> 01:02:59,703
- How many "Evil Deads"?
- One! Two!

872
01:02:59,703 --> 01:03:02,033
- How many "Hellraisers"?
- Hellraiser right here.

873
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:05,583
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night."

874
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:09,083
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

875
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:11,673
She's the... scream queen.

876
01:03:11,713 --> 01:03:14,923
- With a set of lungs
like that, she should be.
- Yeah.

877
01:03:14,963 --> 01:03:16,553
Tits. See?

878
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:18,593
- Oh, I'll get it.

879
01:03:20,093 --> 01:03:22,603
Hey, Tate, grab another beer,
would ya?

880
01:03:22,603 --> 01:03:25,063
- There's more
beer in the garage.

881
01:03:25,063 --> 01:03:27,063
What am I, the beer wench?

882
01:03:27,063 --> 01:03:30,063
- She was nominated for "Terror Train."
- Oh, yeah?

883
01:03:30,063 --> 01:03:33,063
You are not gonna believe who's here!
It's that chick from "Top Story"!

884
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:35,023
- Gale Weathers?
- Here. Yeah.

885
01:03:37,903 --> 01:03:39,903
You're under age, son.

886
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:41,913
I'm kiddin'.
Have a good time.

887
01:03:41,913 --> 01:03:43,743
- Dewey.
- Hi.

888
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:46,913
Dewey.

889
01:03:46,913 --> 01:03:50,083
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me!

890
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:52,543
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

891
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:56,963
Now leave, and take
your media mouth with you.

892
01:03:58,423 --> 01:04:01,263
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

893
01:04:01,263 --> 01:04:03,263
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

894
01:04:03,263 --> 01:04:05,723
- Hey.
- Hey.

895
01:04:05,763 --> 01:04:08,393
- I need a camera.

896
01:04:08,433 --> 01:04:11,733
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

897
01:04:13,443 --> 01:04:15,943
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

898
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:21,533
- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one
I want..."Halloween."

899
01:04:21,573 --> 01:04:25,073
- Too bad, I've spoken

900
01:04:25,123 --> 01:04:27,743
When I look at you
you're forgiven

901
01:04:42,053 --> 01:04:44,143
Mmm.

902
01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:46,183
You're forgiven

903
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:07,703
- Jesus!

904
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:12,663
Tatum, it's okay.

905
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:24,383
Shit.

906
01:05:28,853 --> 01:05:30,853
Hey, shitheads!

907
01:05:32,353 --> 01:05:34,353
Hello!

908
01:05:35,653 --> 01:05:38,653
Shit. Piss.

909
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:57,543
Is that you, Randy?

910
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:03,593
Cute. What movie is this from?
"I Spit On Your Garage"?

911
01:06:05,553 --> 01:06:08,893
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

912
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:11,933
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?

913
01:06:11,933 --> 01:06:14,683
Can I be the helpless victim?

914
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:18,193
Okay, let's see... No, please
don't kill me, Mr. Ghost Face.

915
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:20,773
I wanna be in the sequel!

916
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:25,403
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.

917
01:06:27,243 --> 01:06:30,623
Randy, what the hell
are you doing? Aaah!

918
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,953
Aaah! Stop!

919
01:06:41,923 --> 01:06:43,763
Aaaah!

920
01:06:49,933 --> 01:06:52,603
Fucker!

921
01:06:52,603 --> 01:06:54,773
Aaah!

922
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:22,253
- Aaah! Aaaah!

923
01:07:22,293 --> 01:07:25,633
Aaaaah!

924
01:07:25,633 --> 01:07:29,093
No! No!

925
01:07:45,653 --> 01:07:48,743
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

926
01:07:48,783 --> 01:07:51,743
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here
but us chickens!

927
01:07:51,783 --> 01:07:54,783
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

928
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,703
- Aaah!

929
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:59,333
Oh. Billy. Hey.

930
01:07:59,373 --> 01:08:01,373
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?

931
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:04,213
I was hoping I could talk
to Sid alone.

932
01:08:04,253 --> 01:08:07,463
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

933
01:08:07,513 --> 01:08:10,473
Why don't you go up
to my parents' room?

934
01:08:10,513 --> 01:08:13,973
You know, you guys
can talk, whatever.

935
01:08:14,013 --> 01:08:16,473
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.

936
01:08:17,563 --> 01:08:20,563
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.

937
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:24,863
Oooh! Oww.

938
01:08:30,033 --> 01:08:31,993
What's Leatherface doin' here?

939
01:08:32,033 --> 01:08:34,663
Cute. He came to make up.

940
01:08:34,703 --> 01:08:37,663
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.

941
01:08:37,703 --> 01:08:39,833
As if. That's all I'm sayin'.

942
01:08:39,873 --> 01:08:41,833
As if.

943
01:08:41,873 --> 01:08:43,833
Oh, really, Alicia?

944
01:08:44,883 --> 01:08:47,753
"As if."
I'm gonna go check on them.

945
01:08:47,803 --> 01:08:50,843
- Come on!
- It was nice
to meet all of you.

946
01:08:54,093 --> 01:08:56,393
You're a genius.

947
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:58,723
- Oh, shit.
- What?

948
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:01,273
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

949
01:09:01,273 --> 01:09:05,273
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

950
01:09:05,273 --> 01:09:08,773
Lt'll be fine. Just record it.
Oh, the placement is perfect.

951
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:10,283
- Tell me, Kenneth...
- Hmm?

952
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:13,783
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

953
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,033
Well, first time
for everything.

954
01:09:16,073 --> 01:09:18,033
You're damn right.

955
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:26,543
S-So, um...

956
01:09:28,593 --> 01:09:30,553
- So...

957
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:35,473
I'm sorry.

958
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:40,563
I've been selfish,
and I want to apologize.

959
01:09:40,603 --> 01:09:43,773
No, Billy, I-I'm...

960
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:47,443
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...

961
01:09:47,443 --> 01:09:50,273
with all this
post-traumatic stress.

962
01:09:51,613 --> 01:09:55,613
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.

963
01:09:55,663 --> 01:09:57,663
Enough is enough.

964
01:09:57,663 --> 01:10:00,663
I can't wallow in
the grief process forever...

965
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,663
and...

966
01:10:04,163 --> 01:10:06,173
and I can't...

967
01:10:06,173 --> 01:10:10,463
keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

968
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:16,013
Yeah, I think
I'm really...

969
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:20,853
scared...

970
01:10:20,893 --> 01:10:24,353
that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?

971
01:10:25,483 --> 01:10:28,983
Like "The Bad Seed"
or somethin'.

972
01:10:29,023 --> 01:10:32,023
And I know it doesn't make sense.

973
01:10:33,153 --> 01:10:35,113
Yeah, it does.

974
01:10:36,993 --> 01:10:38,993
Hmm.

975
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:42,493
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"...

976
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:46,503
when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.

977
01:10:46,503 --> 01:10:48,673
But this is life.

978
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:50,673
This isn't a movie.

979
01:10:50,673 --> 01:10:53,253
Sure it is, Sid.

980
01:10:53,303 --> 01:10:55,263
It's all...
It's all a movie.

981
01:10:55,303 --> 01:10:57,263
It's all...

982
01:10:57,303 --> 01:10:59,263
one great big movie.

983
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:08,233
Only you can't pick your genre.

984
01:11:34,173 --> 01:11:37,213
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

985
01:11:40,223 --> 01:11:43,263
Or even a good porno.

986
01:11:45,773 --> 01:11:47,773
What?

987
01:11:47,773 --> 01:11:49,773
You heard me.

988
01:11:57,743 --> 01:11:59,703
Are you sure?

989
01:12:01,743 --> 01:12:03,703
Yeah.

990
01:12:03,743 --> 01:12:05,703
I think so.

991
01:12:22,343 --> 01:12:24,603
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.

992
01:12:24,643 --> 01:12:26,643
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

993
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:30,643
The blood is all wrong!
Why do they do that? It's too red!

994
01:12:30,643 --> 01:12:32,653
Wait. Here comes another.

995
01:12:34,523 --> 01:12:36,483
- Oooh! Oooh!
- Yes! Yes!

996
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:38,983
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.

997
01:12:39,033 --> 01:12:41,993
- How can you watch
this shit over and over?
- Shh!

998
01:12:42,033 --> 01:12:44,493
I wanna see
Jamie Lee's breasts.

999
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,993
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Breasts?

1000
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:49,453
Not until "Trading Places" in '83.

1001
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:51,963
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

1002
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:56,133
- She never showed her tits
'til she went legits.
- Could afford a decent pair.

1003
01:12:56,133 --> 01:13:00,593
That's why she always
outsmarted the killer in the
big chase scene at the end.

1004
01:13:00,633 --> 01:13:03,593
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

1005
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:05,593
- What rules?
- You don't...

1006
01:13:07,723 --> 01:13:10,273
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?

1007
01:13:10,313 --> 01:13:12,443
Have an aneurysm,
why don't ya?

1008
01:13:12,483 --> 01:13:15,443
There are certain rules
one must abide by...

1009
01:13:15,483 --> 01:13:18,363
in order to successfully
survive a horror movie.

1010
01:13:18,403 --> 01:13:21,443
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.

1011
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:25,823
Big no-no!
Big no-no!

1012
01:13:25,873 --> 01:13:27,703
I'd be a dead man.

1013
01:13:27,743 --> 01:13:29,703
Sex equals death. Okay?

1014
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:32,873
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.

1015
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:37,713
No, the sin factor.

1016
01:13:37,753 --> 01:13:40,713
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

1017
01:13:40,753 --> 01:13:44,513
And number three: Never, ever, ever
under any circumstances, say...

1018
01:13:44,513 --> 01:13:46,513
"I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.

1019
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:49,353
- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

1020
01:13:49,353 --> 01:13:51,853
- I'll be right back!
- Ohhhh!

1021
01:13:54,193 --> 01:13:58,023
You push the laws and you end up dead.
See you in the kitchen with a knife.

1022
01:13:58,063 --> 01:14:01,573
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

1023
01:14:01,573 --> 01:14:04,073
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

1024
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:06,073
You don't know the rules?

1025
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:10,373
- There are rules one must abide
by to survive a horror movie.
- Boring.

1026
01:14:10,373 --> 01:14:12,373
- For instance...

1027
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:15,583
The sheriff just radioed.

1028
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:19,343
Somebody reported a car
in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.

1029
01:14:19,383 --> 01:14:22,343
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

1030
01:14:22,383 --> 01:14:24,553
If you're sure it's all right.

1031
01:14:24,553 --> 01:14:28,433
Uh, ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.

1032
01:14:29,893 --> 01:14:31,893
Be right back.

1033
01:14:33,353 --> 01:14:35,313
- Kids Shouting, Whooping]

1034
01:14:35,353 --> 01:14:37,563
You push the laws,
you end up dead.

1035
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:40,613
- W... Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?

1036
01:14:40,613 --> 01:14:42,613
I thought maybe we'd walk.

1037
01:14:43,823 --> 01:14:47,703
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.

1038
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:52,283
You're not scared, are ya?

1039
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:54,293
No.

1040
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:56,873
- All right.
- Great.

1041
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:04,133
- Do you know what that constellation is?
- No. What is it?

1042
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:08,473
- I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.

1043
01:15:11,683 --> 01:15:13,643
What happened to Tatum, Stu?

1044
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:16,603
She probably got pissed
at me and bailed. Bye.

1045
01:15:18,603 --> 01:15:20,603
No, I'm just kidding.

1046
01:15:37,123 --> 01:15:40,123
Look! Here comes
the obligatory tit shot!

1047
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:45,753
- Yes! Oh! Beautiful!
- Lovely!

1048
01:15:45,803 --> 01:15:47,763
Ohh! Ohh.

1049
01:15:47,803 --> 01:15:50,513
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

1050
01:15:51,553 --> 01:15:53,513
You are so...

1051
01:15:55,063 --> 01:15:57,023
amazing.

1052
01:16:03,193 --> 01:16:05,943
- Hello? Yeah?

1053
01:16:10,243 --> 01:16:12,203
Holy shit.

1054
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,663
Listen up.

1055
01:16:17,663 --> 01:16:19,543
They found
Principal Himbry dead.

1056
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:23,633
He was gutted and hung from the goalpost
on the football field.

1057
01:16:23,673 --> 01:16:28,013
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go over there
before they bring him down.

1058
01:16:28,013 --> 01:16:31,343
- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!

1059
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:34,353
- Where did he say he was?
- At the football field!

1060
01:16:34,353 --> 01:16:37,643
- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?

1061
01:16:37,683 --> 01:16:41,143
We were just gettin'
to the good part.

1062
01:16:41,193 --> 01:16:44,653
Hello? Yeah?

1063
01:16:55,703 --> 01:16:57,993
- Whoo!

1064
01:17:06,883 --> 01:17:10,013
Hi-ho, Silver! Let's go!

1065
01:17:10,053 --> 01:17:13,223
So, is... is Dewey
your real name?

1066
01:17:13,223 --> 01:17:15,223
No, it's Dwight.

1067
01:17:15,223 --> 01:17:17,223
Dwight?

1068
01:17:17,223 --> 01:17:19,563
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

1069
01:17:19,563 --> 01:17:23,393
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.

1070
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:25,903
Well, I like it.

1071
01:17:25,903 --> 01:17:27,903
Sexy.

1072
01:17:27,903 --> 01:17:30,653
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.

1073
01:17:30,693 --> 01:17:34,153
Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.

1074
01:17:34,203 --> 01:17:36,663
What about Gale Weathers?

1075
01:17:36,703 --> 01:17:39,833
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist
or something.

1076
01:17:41,043 --> 01:17:43,003
People treat me...

1077
01:17:43,043 --> 01:17:45,463
like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.

1078
01:17:45,503 --> 01:17:47,463
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?

1079
01:17:47,503 --> 01:17:49,463
- No? No.

1080
01:17:49,503 --> 01:17:51,463
That's just 'cause
you kinda like me.

1081
01:17:51,513 --> 01:17:54,263
- They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!

1082
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:58,053
- Freeze... Jump!

1083
01:18:00,103 --> 01:18:02,063
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1084
01:18:02,103 --> 01:18:04,063
Yeah.

1085
01:18:15,783 --> 01:18:17,663
I'm sorry.

1086
01:18:17,703 --> 01:18:19,663
I'm on duty.

1087
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:30,003
Is that what you're looking for?

1088
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:32,003
My whole life.

1089
01:18:37,013 --> 01:18:39,013
- Damn!
- What?

1090
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:42,013
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

1091
01:18:42,013 --> 01:18:44,023
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

1092
01:18:45,313 --> 01:18:47,273
Jesus. What's he doing here?

1093
01:18:48,693 --> 01:18:51,153
We gotta get back.

1094
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:56,203
You okay?

1095
01:18:57,783 --> 01:18:59,743
Yeah.

1096
01:18:59,783 --> 01:19:01,743
Yeah, I'm fine.

1097
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,553
Who'd you call?

1098
01:19:14,593 --> 01:19:16,513
What?

1099
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:20,513
Um, well, I don't know,
when you're arrested you're
allowed one phone call.

1100
01:19:20,513 --> 01:19:23,513
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?

1101
01:19:25,023 --> 01:19:26,983
Called my dad.

1102
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:32,653
No, um, Sheriff Burke
called your dad. I saw him.

1103
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:38,863
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.

1104
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:45,373
Huh.

1105
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:53,043
You don't still think
it was me, do ya?

1106
01:19:56,423 --> 01:19:58,423
No.

1107
01:19:58,473 --> 01:20:00,433
No.

1108
01:20:00,473 --> 01:20:05,603
I was just thinking, if it were
you it'd be a very clever way
to throw me off track.

1109
01:20:05,643 --> 01:20:10,353
You know, using your one phone call to
call me so I wouldn't think it was you.

1110
01:20:10,393 --> 01:20:12,693
Really.

1111
01:20:20,493 --> 01:20:25,083
What do I have to do to prove to you
that I'm not a killer?

1112
01:20:26,543 --> 01:20:29,253
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?

1113
01:20:30,413 --> 01:20:32,793
- Oh, my God.
- Sidney...
- Billy, watch out!

1114
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:35,253
- Aaah!
- Aaaah!

1115
01:20:42,763 --> 01:20:44,933
Sid.

1116
01:20:54,103 --> 01:20:55,903
No!

1117
01:21:20,213 --> 01:21:23,513
- Shit!

1118
01:21:29,183 --> 01:21:32,943
Help me, somebody! Help me!

1119
01:21:51,543 --> 01:21:53,833
Help me!

1120
01:22:23,243 --> 01:22:27,163
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.

1121
01:22:27,203 --> 01:22:30,493
Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.

1122
01:22:30,533 --> 01:22:33,543
You... You know...

1123
01:22:33,543 --> 01:22:36,083
Look, there he is.
I told you.

1124
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:38,833
I told you he was
right around the corner.

1125
01:22:38,883 --> 01:22:40,883
Jamie. Jamie.

1126
01:22:42,303 --> 01:22:46,053
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.

1127
01:22:46,053 --> 01:22:48,723
Turn around.
Behind you.

1128
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:52,353
All the time!
Behind you!

1129
01:22:52,393 --> 01:22:54,733
Behind you, Jamie.

1130
01:22:54,733 --> 01:22:59,733
Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.

1131
01:22:59,733 --> 01:23:02,573
Help me! Help!

1132
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:17,503
- Let me in!

1133
01:23:17,543 --> 01:23:21,293
- The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.

1134
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:24,883
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!

1135
01:23:24,923 --> 01:23:26,803
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.

1136
01:23:26,843 --> 01:23:29,093
Jamie. Jamie.

1137
01:23:29,093 --> 01:23:31,803
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

1138
01:23:31,853 --> 01:23:34,643
- Behind ya!
- Look around!

1139
01:23:36,483 --> 01:23:38,943
- Shit.
- What?

1140
01:23:38,943 --> 01:23:41,483
- We're on 30-second delay.
- Oh, my God.

1141
01:23:42,983 --> 01:23:44,783
Aaaah!

1142
01:23:48,783 --> 01:23:51,073
The... door.

1143
01:23:54,953 --> 01:23:57,793
Aaah!

1144
01:24:34,663 --> 01:24:38,253
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

1145
01:24:38,293 --> 01:24:41,833
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

1146
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,293
Be careful!

1147
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:02,313
- Neil?

1148
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:07,823
Mr. Prescott?

1149
01:25:09,903 --> 01:25:11,863
Shit!

1150
01:25:19,873 --> 01:25:22,913
Oh!

1151
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:30,673
Kenny, I need the cellular!

1152
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:34,843
Kenny!

1153
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:39,933
- Kenny!
- Kenny! Kenny!

1154
01:26:00,203 --> 01:26:03,873
- 9-1-1.

1155
01:26:03,913 --> 01:26:06,793
- What's going on?
- Ooh! Aah!

1156
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:09,213
Aaaah!

1157
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:20,973
Oh, God!

1158
01:26:30,273 --> 01:26:32,733
Oh!

1159
01:26:37,203 --> 01:26:40,583
Oh, God, Kenny, I'm sorry,
but get off my fucking windshield!

1160
01:26:45,623 --> 01:26:47,793
- Stop!

1161
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,843
Oh, God!

1162
01:27:05,023 --> 01:27:08,023
Dewey!

1163
01:27:08,063 --> 01:27:10,023
Dewey!

1164
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:13,943
- Dewey, where are you?

1165
01:27:13,983 --> 01:27:15,943
Dewey!

1166
01:27:16,993 --> 01:27:18,663
Sidney?

1167
01:27:23,663 --> 01:27:25,703
Dewey!

1168
01:27:53,233 --> 01:27:54,733
Shit!

1169
01:28:20,883 --> 01:28:24,643
7825, suspect at 105 North Avenue 52.

1170
01:28:24,683 --> 01:28:27,893
Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.

1171
01:28:27,933 --> 01:28:32,353
It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's going to try and kill me.

1172
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:58,093
Sidney! Sidney!

1173
01:28:58,093 --> 01:29:00,593
Jesus, we've got to get
the fuck out of here!

1174
01:29:00,593 --> 01:29:04,013
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead.

1175
01:29:04,053 --> 01:29:06,053
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!

1176
01:29:06,103 --> 01:29:08,103
- Stay back!
- Stu did it.

1177
01:29:08,103 --> 01:29:10,733
- He killed Billy. He killed my Tatum.
- You did it!

1178
01:29:10,773 --> 01:29:13,103
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!
- You lie!

1179
01:29:13,143 --> 01:29:15,443
Sidney, baby, please,
give me that gun!

1180
01:29:15,443 --> 01:29:17,443
Give me that gun!
Christ, man!

1181
01:29:17,483 --> 01:29:19,903
No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!

1182
01:29:19,943 --> 01:29:23,493
He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1183
01:29:23,533 --> 01:29:26,073
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!

1184
01:29:26,123 --> 01:29:28,793
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!

1185
01:29:28,833 --> 01:29:31,913
- Open up! He did it!

1186
01:29:31,963 --> 01:29:36,293
Help me! He's going crazy!

1187
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:38,423
- Sidney! Go away!

1188
01:29:38,463 --> 01:29:40,803
Sidney?

1189
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:44,633
Leave me alone.

1190
01:29:47,513 --> 01:29:49,763
- Sid.
- Billy.

1191
01:29:54,813 --> 01:29:59,233
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?

1192
01:29:59,273 --> 01:30:02,153
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.

1193
01:30:02,153 --> 01:30:04,993
No, I'm like a stuck pig,
but I'm all right.

1194
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:07,163
Get up.

1195
01:30:07,203 --> 01:30:09,493
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

1196
01:30:10,543 --> 01:30:12,503
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.

1197
01:30:12,543 --> 01:30:15,673
- No, he's out there!
- No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.

1198
01:30:15,713 --> 01:30:18,133
It's okay. It's okay.

1199
01:30:18,173 --> 01:30:20,133
Careful.

1200
01:30:21,253 --> 01:30:23,803
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!

1201
01:30:23,843 --> 01:30:26,053
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!

1202
01:30:28,473 --> 01:30:30,683
We all go a little mad sometimes.

1203
01:30:30,683 --> 01:30:32,603
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1204
01:30:38,563 --> 01:30:41,983
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho."

1205
01:30:45,703 --> 01:30:48,033
Mmm.

1206
01:30:48,033 --> 01:30:52,703
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in "Carrie."

1207
01:30:55,873 --> 01:30:58,173
Stu.

1208
01:30:58,213 --> 01:31:02,053
Help me, please.

1209
01:31:02,093 --> 01:31:05,173
Surprise, Sidney.

1210
01:31:08,303 --> 01:31:11,013
- No!
- Ooh!

1211
01:31:11,053 --> 01:31:13,723
Oh, now. Whoa.

1212
01:31:15,393 --> 01:31:18,943
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1213
01:31:18,983 --> 01:31:21,693
Why are you doing this?

1214
01:31:21,733 --> 01:31:23,783
It's all part
of the game, Sidney.

1215
01:31:23,823 --> 01:31:26,613
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die."
- Fuck you!

1216
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:31,283
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?

1217
01:31:31,323 --> 01:31:34,413
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.

1218
01:31:34,453 --> 01:31:37,503
See, we ask you a question,
and if you get it wrong,

1219
01:31:37,543 --> 01:31:39,753
"boo-kah," you die!

1220
01:31:39,753 --> 01:31:42,883
You get it right, you die.

1221
01:31:42,923 --> 01:31:46,553
- You're crazy, both of you.
- Actually, we prefer
the term "psychotic."

1222
01:31:46,593 --> 01:31:50,723
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?

1223
01:31:51,593 --> 01:31:53,813
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1224
01:31:53,853 --> 01:31:56,603
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1225
01:31:56,643 --> 01:32:00,603
Watch a few movies,
take a few notes.

1226
01:32:00,653 --> 01:32:03,063
- It was fun. - No!

1227
01:32:03,113 --> 01:32:05,403
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?

1228
01:32:05,443 --> 01:32:08,153
Why?

1229
01:32:08,193 --> 01:32:10,743
- Why did you kill my mother?

1230
01:32:10,783 --> 01:32:14,583
Why? Why?

1231
01:32:14,623 --> 01:32:17,293
Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1232
01:32:19,503 --> 01:32:21,463
I don't really believe
in motive, Sid.

1233
01:32:21,503 --> 01:32:23,463
- I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
- No.

1234
01:32:23,503 --> 01:32:27,673
Did they ever really decide
why Hannibal Lecter liked to
eat people? Don't think so!

1235
01:32:27,713 --> 01:32:31,513
See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1236
01:32:31,553 --> 01:32:34,103
We did your mom a favor, Sid.

1237
01:32:34,143 --> 01:32:37,773
That woman was a slut-bag whore
who flashed her shit all over
town like she was Sharon Stone.

1238
01:32:37,813 --> 01:32:40,273
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney,

1239
01:32:40,313 --> 01:32:43,483
your mother
was no Sharon Stone, hmm?

1240
01:32:48,653 --> 01:32:51,203
Is that motive enough for you?

1241
01:32:52,363 --> 01:32:55,663
How about this?

1242
01:32:55,663 --> 01:33:00,203
Your slut mother
was fucking my father,

1243
01:33:02,003 --> 01:33:05,673
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1244
01:33:08,343 --> 01:33:10,383
How's that for a motive?

1245
01:33:10,383 --> 01:33:14,013
Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behavior.

1246
01:33:14,053 --> 01:33:16,853
It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1247
01:33:16,853 --> 01:33:21,313
That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin. Oooh!

1248
01:33:21,353 --> 01:33:23,353
I said "virgin." Whoops!

1249
01:33:23,393 --> 01:33:26,403
Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.

1250
01:33:26,443 --> 01:33:30,653
Let's pretend it's all
a scary movie, Sid. How do
you think it's gonna end?

1251
01:33:33,913 --> 01:33:37,533
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1252
01:33:37,533 --> 01:33:40,083
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.

1253
01:33:40,123 --> 01:33:43,043
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1254
01:33:43,043 --> 01:33:46,043
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.

1255
01:33:46,043 --> 01:33:49,093
You know what time it is, Sid?

1256
01:33:49,133 --> 01:33:51,173
It's after midnight.

1257
01:33:51,213 --> 01:33:54,933
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.

1258
01:33:54,973 --> 01:33:57,893
We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1259
01:33:57,893 --> 01:34:02,393
Attention! Oh, what do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1260
01:34:02,433 --> 01:34:04,233
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it.

1261
01:34:04,233 --> 01:34:06,063
That's enough.

1262
01:34:06,103 --> 01:34:09,403
- Guess we won't be needing this anymore.
- Uh-huh!

1263
01:34:09,403 --> 01:34:12,743
And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.

1264
01:34:12,743 --> 01:34:14,863
Got the ending
figured out yet, Sid?

1265
01:34:14,903 --> 01:34:16,993
Come on, Sidney.
You think about it now, huh?

1266
01:34:17,033 --> 01:34:19,833
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1267
01:34:19,873 --> 01:34:23,293
- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?

1268
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:26,583
Your mother's anniversary
set him off, and he went on
a murder spree, killing everyone.

1269
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,923
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1270
01:34:28,923 --> 01:34:32,093
Then he... kills you...

1271
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:34,843
and shoots himself
in the head.

1272
01:34:34,883 --> 01:34:37,763
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.

1273
01:34:37,763 --> 01:34:39,763
Watch this.

1274
01:34:43,733 --> 01:34:48,103
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!

1275
01:34:48,103 --> 01:34:52,943
Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!

1276
01:34:57,743 --> 01:35:00,283
Good one, man. Jesus.

1277
01:35:00,323 --> 01:35:02,083
Oh, shit.

1278
01:35:02,123 --> 01:35:04,413
My turn.

1279
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:09,583
Don't forget. Stay to the side
and don't go too deep.

1280
01:35:10,633 --> 01:35:13,303
Okay. I'll remember.

1281
01:35:14,303 --> 01:35:17,803
Aaah! Fuck! Fuck!

1282
01:35:17,803 --> 01:35:20,303
Fuck! Goddamn it, Stu!

1283
01:35:20,343 --> 01:35:23,433
Sorry, Billy. I guess I got
a little too zealous, huh?

1284
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:26,523
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1285
01:35:26,563 --> 01:35:29,483
Give me the knife!

1286
01:35:32,323 --> 01:35:34,283
Now!

1287
01:35:36,533 --> 01:35:41,323
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.

1288
01:35:41,323 --> 01:35:43,993
We get to carry on
and plan the sequel,

1289
01:35:44,043 --> 01:35:48,333
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days ya gotta have a sequel!

1290
01:35:51,043 --> 01:35:53,963
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1291
01:35:54,003 --> 01:35:56,513
Now, Sid, don't you
blame the movies.

1292
01:35:56,553 --> 01:36:00,343
Movies don't create psychos.
Movies make psychos more creative!

1293
01:36:00,343 --> 01:36:04,063
Stop it, Billy,
would you? All right?

1294
01:36:04,103 --> 01:36:07,853
I can't take any more.
I feel a little woozy here!

1295
01:36:10,563 --> 01:36:14,573
All right. All right,
you get the gun.

1296
01:36:14,613 --> 01:36:16,533
I'll untie Pops, okay?

1297
01:36:19,903 --> 01:36:23,163
- Now!
- Okay.

1298
01:36:32,213 --> 01:36:34,843
Um. Uh...

1299
01:36:34,883 --> 01:36:38,553
Houston, we...
we have a problem here.

1300
01:36:40,553 --> 01:36:43,183
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.

1301
01:36:43,223 --> 01:36:46,853
I put it right there,
and it's not there.

1302
01:36:46,893 --> 01:36:50,183
- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.

1303
01:36:51,733 --> 01:36:55,273
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.

1304
01:36:55,313 --> 01:36:58,113
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.

1305
01:36:58,153 --> 01:37:01,203
The reporter left for dead
in the news van...

1306
01:37:01,243 --> 01:37:03,323
comes to,

1307
01:37:03,363 --> 01:37:05,743
stumbles on
you two dipshits,

1308
01:37:05,743 --> 01:37:07,913
finds the gun,

1309
01:37:07,953 --> 01:37:11,753
foils your plan
and saves the day.

1310
01:37:11,753 --> 01:37:14,253
I like that ending.

1311
01:37:15,593 --> 01:37:17,803
I know something you don't.

1312
01:37:21,133 --> 01:37:23,843
Fuck. No!

1313
01:37:26,603 --> 01:37:28,933
Yeah, man.

1314
01:37:28,973 --> 01:37:32,773
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.

1315
01:37:37,863 --> 01:37:42,403
- It works better
without the safety on.

1316
01:37:47,703 --> 01:37:50,833
This is Gale Weathers signing off.

1317
01:37:50,873 --> 01:37:53,293
Babe, you're gonna love this!

1318
01:37:55,543 --> 01:37:57,503
Shit.

1319
01:37:59,133 --> 01:38:01,093
What?

1320
01:38:06,893 --> 01:38:09,353
- Where are they?
Where are they?

1321
01:38:09,393 --> 01:38:11,433
I don't know,
but I'm hurtin', man.

1322
01:38:11,473 --> 01:38:13,943
- Fuck!

1323
01:38:13,983 --> 01:38:18,443
Shall I let the machine get it?

1324
01:38:18,483 --> 01:38:21,323
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

1325
01:38:21,323 --> 01:38:23,653
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?

1326
01:38:23,693 --> 01:38:26,663
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.

1327
01:38:26,703 --> 01:38:31,623
It's called "Guess Who Just
Called The Police And Reported
Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass."

1328
01:38:31,663 --> 01:38:35,333
- Find her, you dipshit. Get up.
- I can't, Billy. You cut me too deep.

1329
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:39,173
I think I'm dying here, man.

1330
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:42,673
- Talk to her. Talk to her.

1331
01:38:49,513 --> 01:38:54,353
- Hello.
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.
What's your motive?

1332
01:38:54,353 --> 01:38:57,483
Billy's got one. The police are on
their way. What are you gonna tell them?

1333
01:38:57,523 --> 01:38:59,983
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.

1334
01:39:00,023 --> 01:39:03,483
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch,
just like your fucking mother!

1335
01:39:03,533 --> 01:39:06,283
- You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!

1336
01:39:06,323 --> 01:39:09,203
Ow. You fuckin' hit me
with the phone, dick!

1337
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:11,913
- Fucker, where are you?

1338
01:39:14,043 --> 01:39:17,623
- You fuck!

1339
01:39:17,673 --> 01:39:21,633
- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.

1340
01:39:21,673 --> 01:39:25,013
My mom and dad
are gonna be so mad at me.

1341
01:39:25,053 --> 01:39:28,133
Aaah! Bitch!

1342
01:39:56,953 --> 01:39:59,293
Aaah!

1343
01:40:02,293 --> 01:40:05,053
Aaah!

1344
01:40:21,733 --> 01:40:25,023
Aah!

1345
01:40:25,073 --> 01:40:27,233
Ohh! My arm!

1346
01:40:34,163 --> 01:40:36,623
I always had a thing for ya, Sid!

1347
01:40:42,293 --> 01:40:45,923
- Bitch.
- In your dreams.

1348
01:41:10,403 --> 01:41:12,363
- I'm sorry. It's all right.

1349
01:41:12,413 --> 01:41:14,533
Oh, my God, Randy,
I thought you were dead.

1350
01:41:14,573 --> 01:41:17,623
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1351
01:41:17,663 --> 01:41:19,873
- Fucker!

1352
01:41:25,503 --> 01:41:28,503
- Say hello to your mother.

1353
01:41:35,223 --> 01:41:38,603
Aaah!

1354
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:06,043
It's okay.

1355
01:42:08,883 --> 01:42:11,803
Guess I remembered
the safety that time, you bastard.

1356
01:42:24,103 --> 01:42:26,063
Careful.

1357
01:42:26,103 --> 01:42:29,773
This is the moment when the supposedly
dead killer comes back to life...

1358
01:42:29,823 --> 01:42:31,783
for one last scare.

1359
01:42:36,073 --> 01:42:39,743
Not in my movie.

1360
01:42:43,753 --> 01:42:45,413
Dad.

1361
01:42:45,463 --> 01:42:48,043
Randy, help me out.

1362
01:42:51,753 --> 01:42:53,763
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?

1363
01:42:56,133 --> 01:42:58,933
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1364
01:43:00,393 --> 01:43:04,063
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1365
01:43:04,063 --> 01:43:06,063
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.

1366
01:43:06,063 --> 01:43:10,233
Okay, I think it's going to go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1367
01:43:10,273 --> 01:43:13,283
- Hi, this is Gale Weathers...

1368
01:43:13,323 --> 01:43:18,323
with an exclusive eyewitness account
of this amazing breaking story.

1369
01:43:18,363 --> 01:43:20,823
Several more local teens
are dead...

1370
01:43:20,873 --> 01:43:23,833
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery
of the mass killing...

1371
01:43:23,873 --> 01:43:26,503
that has terrified
this peaceful community...

1372
01:43:26,543 --> 01:43:29,293
like the plot
of some scary movie.

1373
01:43:29,293 --> 01:43:31,923
It all began with
a scream over 9-1-1...

1374
01:43:31,923 --> 01:43:36,263
and ended in a bloodbath
that has rocked the town of Woodsboro,

1375
01:43:36,303 --> 01:43:38,843
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse...

1376
01:43:38,883 --> 01:43:41,513
far from the crimes and the sirens
of the larger cities...

1377
01:43:41,553 --> 01:43:43,683
that its residents had fled.

1378
01:43:43,723 --> 01:43:46,433
Okay, let's take it back
to one. Come on. Move it.

1379
01:43:46,483 --> 01:43:49,193
This is my big shot. Let's go.

1380
01:44:21,803 --> 01:44:26,023
Love comes down upon us
and it flows like water

1381
01:44:26,023 --> 01:44:30,233
Burning with the hope
of insight

1382
01:44:30,273 --> 01:44:34,323
There the books, the colors
of a bright elation

1383
01:44:34,363 --> 01:44:38,493
Stolen in the sight of love

1384
01:44:38,533 --> 01:44:42,703
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1385
01:44:42,703 --> 01:44:46,873
Fighting our way
around indecision

1386
01:44:46,873 --> 01:44:51,043
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1387
01:44:51,043 --> 01:44:57,923
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1388
01:45:03,553 --> 01:45:07,643
Birds fly in the eye
of the faithless daughters

1389
01:45:07,683 --> 01:45:11,893
Spoken at the bitter end

1390
01:45:11,893 --> 01:45:16,073
Wasted, sacrificed
for the new nirvana

1391
01:45:16,113 --> 01:45:20,323
Nighttime sends us all above

1392
01:45:20,363 --> 01:45:24,373
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1393
01:45:24,413 --> 01:45:28,493
Fighting our way
around indecision

1394
01:45:28,543 --> 01:45:32,753
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1395
01:45:32,753 --> 01:45:38,843
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1396
01:45:38,883 --> 01:45:43,383
A whisper to a scream

1397
01:45:43,383 --> 01:45:47,353
Whisper to a scream

1398
01:45:47,393 --> 01:45:53,773
A whisper to a scream

1399
01:46:01,943 --> 01:46:06,033
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1400
01:46:06,073 --> 01:46:10,293
Fighting our way
around indecision

1401
01:46:10,333 --> 01:46:14,463
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1402
01:46:14,503 --> 01:46:18,793
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1403
01:46:18,843 --> 01:46:22,923
- Whisper to a scream
- A whisper to a scream

1404
01:46:22,973 --> 01:46:27,143
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1405
01:46:27,183 --> 01:46:31,313
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1406
01:46:31,353 --> 01:46:35,483
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1407
01:46:35,523 --> 01:46:39,653
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1408
01:46:39,693 --> 01:46:43,823
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1409
01:46:43,863 --> 01:46:49,873
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1410
01:46:49,913 --> 01:46:53,753
Whisper to a scream

1411
01:48:42,943 --> 01:48:46,903
Look outside of my window

1412
01:48:48,993 --> 01:48:52,913
But all I see
is the rain come down

1413
01:48:54,413 --> 01:48:59,293
A pink umbrella
and a bit of her lace

1414
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:04,673
Is all I need
and I'll come, come

1415
01:49:04,713 --> 01:49:08,883
I don't care
if you don't care

1416
01:49:10,173 --> 01:49:13,513
The world looks
just fine to me

1417
01:49:15,553 --> 01:49:20,813
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1418
01:49:20,813 --> 01:49:25,443
What's it like to be free

1419
01:49:32,823 --> 01:49:38,083
I don't care
if you don't care

1420
01:49:38,123 --> 01:49:41,873
The world looks
just fine to me

1421
01:49:43,543 --> 01:49:48,803
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1422
01:49:48,803 --> 01:49:54,513
What it's like to be free

1423
01:50:04,813 --> 01:50:10,153
I don't care
if you don't care

1424
01:50:10,193 --> 01:50:13,903
The world looks
just fine to me

1425
01:50:15,493 --> 01:50:20,743
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1426
01:50:20,793 --> 01:50:27,133
What it's like to be free

1427
01:50:37,143 --> 01:50:40,313
- Don't be shy
- Told you, baby

1428
01:50:40,353 --> 01:50:42,893
Don't be shy
