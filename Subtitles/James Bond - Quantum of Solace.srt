1
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:12,896
Quantum of Solace

2
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:46,234
SIENA, ITALY

3
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,758
It's time to get out.

4
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,260
Don't bleed to death.

5
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,975
- Hello Mitchell.
- Bond.

6
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,686
The Americans aren't going to be
none too pleased about this.

7
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:51,980
I promised them Le Chiffre
and they got Le Chiffre.

8
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,440
They got his body.

9
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,443
If they'd wanted his soul they should
have made a deal with a priest.

10
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:58,862
Has he said anything?

11
00:07:58,862 --> 00:07:59,905
No.

12
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,948
Going to check perimeters, Ma'am.

13
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,535
You look like hell.

14
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,955
When was the last time you slept?

15
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:12,501
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,
the one who was abducted in Morocco...

16
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,211
the one she was trying to save.

17
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:17,005
His body was washed up on
a beach near Ibiza.

18
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:19,216
We were meant to believe
the fish did that to his face.

19
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:21,510
His wallet and ID were in his pocket.

20
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,386
- Well that's convenient.
- Quite.

21
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:25,388
Which is why I did a DNA check
on a lock of his hair...

22
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,474
found in Vesper's apartment.

23
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,850
It's not him.

24
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,519
A lock of his hair?

25
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,855
I wouldn't have thought
Vesper's the sentimental type.

26
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:37,359
Well, we never really know anyone,
do we?

27
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,403
But I do need to know Bond...

28
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:43,824
I need to know
that I can trust you.

29
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:44,866
And you don't?

30
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:47,702
He'd need to be a pretty cold
bastard who didn't want revenge...

31
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,246
for the death of someone he loved.

32
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:51,206
You don't have to worry about me.

33
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,710
I'm not gonna go chasing him.
He's not important.

34
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:59,214
And neither is she.

35
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,341
It's clear, Ma'am.

36
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,884
Thanks, Mitchell.

37
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:04,594
Shall we?

38
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:24,906
You're gonna tell us who you work for?

39
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,869
I was always very interested
to meet you.

40
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,288
I'd heard so much
about you from Vesper.

41
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:32,998
In fact, the real shame is that...

42
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:36,710
if she hadn't killed herself,
we would've had you too.

43
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,504
I think you would have done
anything for her.

44
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:43,341
Well, you know you're not in Britain,
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.

45
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,343
Which should tell you
that eventually...

46
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:48,054
you'll tell us about the people
you work with...

47
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,766
and the longer it takes,
the more painful we"ll make it.

48
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:58,773
You really don't know
anything about us.

49
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:04,488
It's so amusing, because we on
the other side... thinking, oh...

50
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:07,032
the MI-6, the CIA, they're
looking over our shoulders...

51
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:09,284
they're listening
to our conversations...

52
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:12,287
and the truth is,
you don't even know we exist.

53
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:16,166
Oh, we do know, Mr White...
and we are quick learners.

54
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:22,714
Well, then, the first thing
you should know about us is...

55
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:25,217
that we have people everywhere.

56
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,010
Am I right?

57
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,782
Oh, my God... what inhumanity!

58
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:43,201
Anything?

59
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:46,329
Craig Mitchell worked for me for 8 years.

60
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,583
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year.

61
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,961
He didn't leave so much as a scrap
of paper to explain any of it.

62
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,797
Eight years,
five as my personal bodyguard.

63
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:57,007
I found this...

64
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:59,801
and 3 other bloody Christmas presents
I bought him, about the house.

65
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,761
I don't think he smoked.

66
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,514
And you had to kill him! You couldn't
bring him in for questioning...

67
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:06,600
so we might actually
learn something.

68
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,477
When someone says:
"We've got people everywhere"...

69
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:09,978
you expect it to be hyperbole.

70
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,271
Lots of people saying that...

71
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,689
Florists use that expression.

72
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:16,776
It doesn't mean they've got someone
working for them inside the bloody room.

73
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:19,279
What the hell
is this organization, Bond?

74
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,990
How can they be everywhere and
we know nothing about them?

75
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,453
- I assume we found no trace of White.
- No, ma'am.

76
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:30,207
The agent guarding the door in the garage
was dead before you passed him on the stairs.

77
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,167
I passed him on the stairs?
Christ!

78
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:35,337
Mitchell must have killed him,
when he went out to check the perimeter.

79
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:38,465
- You're lucky to be here.
- You think White is still alive?

80
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,550
- Yes I do.
- What is it?

81
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,428
Craig Mitchell, 45 years old,
has no living family...

82
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:45,013
gave generously to charity.

83
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:46,681
- Tell me you know more than that.
- Yes...

84
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:49,434
Our money men went through every
bill in Mitchell's wallet and house.

85
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:52,729
- How much did he have?
- Less than 100 pounds.

86
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:54,731
And about the same,
in euros and dollars.

87
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:56,399
Excuse me! Excuse me, ma'am.

88
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,402
We did a complete forensic analysis
of every note and its traceable history.

89
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,363
I'm not in the mood.

90
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,950
After you.

91
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:08,036
This particular note from Mitchell's
wallet might be of interest.

92
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:11,414
We introduced tagged bills into
Le Chiffre's money laundering operation...

93
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:13,583
by intercepting illegal payoffs.

94
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,711
We traced money through several of
his bank accounts around the world.

95
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,046
That's pretty thin.

96
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:19,422
At the rate
money changes hands...

97
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:21,842
you could probably find a tenner
in my robe with a tag.

98
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:25,512
That's true Ma'am, a single bill could be a
coincidence, but what about a whole stack?

99
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,973
These bills from
the same series as Mitchell's...

100
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:31,351
were just scanned at a bank
in Port au Prince, Haiti.

101
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,563
Deposited into the account
of a Mr Slate.

102
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:35,939
Impress me.

103
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:39,860
We have a Mr Edmund Slate, returning to
Port au Prince from Heathrow this morning.

104
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,155
His entry documents have
him staying at Hotel Dessalines.

105
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:45,949
He's in room 325.

106
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,293
Thank you.

107
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,336
You're welcome.

108
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,633
Do you have any messages for 325?

109
00:20:10,302 --> 00:20:14,598
Oh, no sir, the only message is about
the briefcase that was delivered earlier.

110
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,266
Did you want us
to continue holding it?

111
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:18,477
- No, I'll take that now.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,273
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

113
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,991
Get in.

114
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:35,911
- What?
- Get in!

115
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:38,955
Fine.

116
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:43,877
You're late.

117
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,295
Oh...
I got pulled into a meeting.

118
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:49,049
- Who with?
- A friend of Mr. Whites.

119
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:52,177
I don't think I know him.

120
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:57,307
It's funny.

121
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:59,476
You don't look at all
like I expected.

122
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:00,936
Really?

123
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:01,978
What were you expecting?

124
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:04,606
I didn't think geologists
looked so...

125
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:06,650
So?

126
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,946
Friend of yours?

127
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:12,697
I don't have any friends.

128
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:22,123
Get outta the way, move it!

129
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,513
We didn't settle on a price.

130
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:38,682
Make me an offer.

131
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:42,644
Okay, we can work out later,
over drinks.

132
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,773
Dominic,
didn't give you any trouble, did he?

133
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,108
No.

134
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,447
What the hell is this?

135
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,200
I think someone wants to kill you.

136
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,625
That wasn't very nice.

137
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:10,255
You were supposed to shoot her.

138
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:11,882
Well, I missed.

139
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:24,895
- I guess he didn't like that.
- Get Bond.

140
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:26,730
Where is he now?

141
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,733
Approaching the docks.
Kings Key.

142
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:34,070
- Tanner?
- I've got Bond.

143
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,157
<i>- Ask him about Slate.
- She wants to know about Slate.</i>

144
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:40,243
- Tell her Slate was a dead end.
- Slate was a dead end.

145
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:43,246
Damn-it!...
He must have killed him.

146
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:58,595
Yes mommy, it's awful hot here.

147
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,281
- Wough... wough... whough... wough.
- Touch me and I'll break your wrist.

148
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:31,294
Camille?

149
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:34,214
How nice to see you.

150
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:36,299
Alive you mean?

151
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:40,887
I knew we shouldn't have
slept together.

152
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,306
I think I'm starting to like you.

153
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:45,934
So you did just try
to have me killed?

154
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:51,481
And that made me very sad
thinking I would never see you again.

155
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,442
- But... here you are.
- Damn-it, Dominic!

156
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:56,862
I was trying to help you!

157
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:01,825
I was trying to uncover a leak.

158
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:04,786
And you...
you send someone to kill me?

159
00:24:04,786 --> 00:24:07,455
Please, don't talk to me
like I'm stupid!

160
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:11,126
It's unattractive.

161
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:15,797
Come, I wanna show you something.

162
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:19,134
Come.

163
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:22,596
There is nothing that makes me
more uncomfortable, than...

164
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,931
friends talking behind my back.

165
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:27,184
It feels like...

166
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:29,811
ants under my skin.

167
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:32,189
It's been that way forever...

168
00:24:32,397 --> 00:24:35,317
I remember when I was 15.

169
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:38,570
I had a crush on one of my
mother's piano students.

170
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:40,989
Somehow...

171
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:44,910
I overheard her saying very
nasty things about me.

172
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:48,038
I got so angry...

173
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:51,082
I took a knife...

174
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:55,796
Is that him?

175
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:59,508
I don't...
We only spoke on the phone.

176
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:05,138
It's such a shame, because he's one
of my best geologists.

177
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:08,683
He said you asked
to buy information.

178
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:12,771
No, he called me and offered
to sell information.

179
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:17,484
Why would I come back here
if I was lying?

180
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:19,694
Because you love me.

181
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:21,863
I was doing it for you.

182
00:25:22,113 --> 00:25:24,699
To stop him from betraying you.

183
00:25:25,283 --> 00:25:29,287
You know what burns more...
then all your bullshit?

184
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:33,750
Is that I always got the feeling
that you were only sleeping with me...

185
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,878
to get to General Medrano.

186
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:39,214
Is that him?

187
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:42,634
You know how these
deposed dictators are.

188
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:46,096
Solicitous of their safety.

189
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:48,598
Stick around.

190
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:51,518
I'll introduce you.

191
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:55,480
You see the girl
that just walked in here?

192
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,774
Would you give her that
and tell her to call me.

193
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:22,174
<i>You have reached Universal Exports,
all our offices are currently closed...</i>

194
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:31,516
And you can do all this for me?

195
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,562
Well look at,
what we did to this country.

196
00:26:35,604 --> 00:26:37,856
The Haitians elect a priest
who decides...

197
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:41,359
to raise the minimum wage
from 38 cents to one dollar a day.

198
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,360
Oh...

199
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,614
It's not a lot, but it's enough
to upset the corporations...

200
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:48,825
who were here making T-hirts
and running shoes.

201
00:26:48,825 --> 00:26:53,079
So they called us
and we facilitated the change.

202
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:58,835
The difference is my country is not some
fly speck in the middle of the Caribbean.

203
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:02,172
Plus we've already begun
destabilizing the government.

204
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:04,549
We'll supply the private security.

205
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,968
We'll pay off the right officials...

206
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:11,223
And we have 26 countries ready to
officially recognize your...

207
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:14,476
new Bolivian government.

208
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:17,145
You want your country back.

209
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:21,233
My organization can give it
to you within... two weeks.

210
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:24,528
You've been busy.

211
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:27,948
And in return...
you want what?

212
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:29,533
A desert.

213
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,709
- This part.
- This land is worthless.

214
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:43,046
Ahh...
So you're getting a great deal?

215
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:45,132
You won't find oil there.

216
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:47,384
Everyone has tried.

217
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:48,885
Maybe.

218
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:50,720
Maybe not.

219
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,558
But we own...
whatever we find.

220
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:57,894
Good.

221
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:01,398
Huh...

222
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:06,611
- Did you know, Ernesto Montes?
- A very powerful man in his day.

223
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:10,073
- He had a beautiful Russian wife.
- I know he did...

224
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:12,325
- A dancer...
- Mm'hm.

225
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:15,245
And his daughter works for me...

226
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:17,247
or... did.

227
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:19,207
She's lovely.

228
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:21,626
But I don't see the resemblance.

229
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:26,506
Why don't you consider her
something to sweeten the deal?

230
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:32,471
Just promise me to drop her over
the side when you're done.

231
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:37,058
Camille...
General Medrano.

232
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:43,148
- General... Mucho gusto. (Great pleasure)
- Mucho gusto, señorita.

233
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:55,035
Be careful what you wish for,
my dear.

234
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:05,295
Have fun you too.

235
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:17,784
Don't let 'em get away!
Don't let 'em get away!

236
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,667
What the hell are you doing?

237
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:28,170
- You're welcome!
- You idiot, take me back.

238
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,338
You know, maybe I'll do that later.

239
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:35,760
You're not one of Greene's?

240
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:38,597
Dominic Greene?

241
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:43,977
Get down!

242
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:10,796
- Give me the wheel!
- Navigate!

243
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:18,512
Left!

244
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:32,150
- What're you doing?
- Hold on!

245
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,293
Get down!

246
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,957
- Excuse me.
- Take her.

247
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:11,958
Thank you.

248
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,710
She's seasick.

249
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:48,328
It's Bond...
Connect Bond!

250
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:50,539
Yes?

251
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:54,709
Name check: Dominic Greene.
G- R- double E-N-E.

252
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,586
We'll need more than this.

253
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:59,381
Might need a little more than that,
there're a lot of Dominic Greenes'.

254
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:01,508
Do you have a social security
or passport number?

255
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:02,425
No.

256
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:05,554
Anything?

257
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,390
Do you have anything?

258
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,517
- Will you put her on, please.
- I am on, Bond.

259
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:11,935
What happened to Slate?

260
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:14,479
I'm not dwelling on the past,
I don't think you should either.

261
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:16,106
You killed him?

262
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:18,733
NOR just hit: Dominic Greene,
CEO of Greene Planet.

263
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:21,027
It's... a utility company...

264
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:23,446
but Greene's been doing a lot of
philanthropic work...

265
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:25,782
buying up large tracts of land
for ecological preserves.

266
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:27,868
<i>You should be getting
his picture now.</i>

267
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:30,495
Yeah, that's him.

268
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:33,415
I'm afraid there's a firewall
around his other corporate holdings...

269
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,083
so, we have no other information.

270
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,877
Get me the Americans.

271
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:38,420
<i>Connect.</i>

272
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,463
<i>Go ahead.</i>

273
00:34:39,463 --> 00:34:42,090
Interest in Dominic Greene,
Greene Planet.

274
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,176
<i>Transferring you now...</i>

275
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,596
<i>Hold for Gregory Beam, please.</i>

276
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:51,892
<i>Thank you... oh, hi,
this is Gregory Beam, ma'am.</i>

277
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:53,602
Hello, Mr. Beam.

278
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:56,938
<i>Huh... so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr. Greene.</i>

279
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:59,733
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Beam.
- Connection terminated.</i>

280
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,443
He's a person of extreme interest.

281
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:03,487
- But he just said that...
- Tanner...

282
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:06,740
I asked about the man and she transferred
me to the section chief of South America.

283
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,493
How would she know to do that
if they weren't tracking him?

284
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:16,750
<i>Bond, we have your location
as approaching an airfield.</i>

285
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,543
<i>Is Greene on the move?</i>

286
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:22,214
Yeah, I've got a tail number
Golf Zero Charlie Sierra Charlie.

287
00:35:22,214 --> 00:35:24,174
<i>It'll get you it's destination.</i>

288
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:31,681
<i>It's a... private charter, going to
Bregenz Austria, leaving immediately.</i>

289
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:35,352
<i>Tanner,
authorize a Charter for 007.</i>

290
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:40,941
And Bond, if you could avoid killing every
possible lead, it would be deeply appreciated.

291
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:45,529
<i>- Yes, ma'am... I'll do my best.
- Connection terminated</i>

292
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:47,447
I've heard that before.

293
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:51,368
- Hello.
- Hi.

294
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:53,286
Ah, welcome aboard.

295
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,664
Bon jour... Ca va? (Okay?)

296
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:58,416
- Ca va, ca va. (Okay, okay.)
- Come, have a seat.

297
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,477
Jeez.

298
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,229
Sorry.

299
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:24,317
How much longer?

300
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:28,905
So do we have an understanding?

301
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:30,782
Well, yeah...

302
00:36:30,782 --> 00:36:34,911
We do nothing to stop a coup
in Bolivia and in exchange, the huh...

303
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:38,915
new government gives America
the lease to any oil found.

304
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:41,710
If it's oil you want.

305
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:45,505
You didn't find diamonds, did ya?

306
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,596
Ah, drilling underground...

307
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:54,848
you kept off everyone's radar
for a very long time but...

308
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:59,019
you can't buy that much piping
without somebody getting curious.

309
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:02,314
We'll have to verify the find.

310
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:07,694
I'm not really admitting there is one.
You are getting this for free.

311
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:11,031
Venezuela, Brazil now Bolivia.

312
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:15,535
With you tied up in the Middle East,
South America is falling like dominoes.

313
00:37:16,995 --> 00:37:21,625
You don't need another Marxist giving
national resources to people, do you?

314
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,460
No, we can hardly be expected...

315
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,879
to do something about a coup
we know nothing about.

316
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:32,219
I think, I have a... pest

317
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:40,060
You have any idea who that is?

318
00:37:50,612 --> 00:37:52,364
Sorry.

319
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:56,952
It's James Bond,
British Secret Service.

320
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,997
I don't know how
I could've missed that.

321
00:38:02,499 --> 00:38:05,544
I will need for you
to get rid of him for me.

322
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:08,255
Yeah...
That's not gonna be a problem.

323
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:27,315
You know who Greene is, and you
wanna put us in bed with him.

324
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:28,608
You are kidding right?

325
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,945
Yeah, you're right.
We should just deal with nice people.

326
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:34,948
I need to know
you're on the team, Felix.

327
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:37,868
I need to know
you value your career.

328
00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:12,671
- Good to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

329
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:14,589
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

330
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:25,387
<i>- How much more pipeline do we need?
- Should be Ideal maybe...</i>

331
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:27,264
2000 kilometers.

332
00:42:27,264 --> 00:42:29,224
<i>Are there any objections?</i>

333
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:33,895
<i>- No... not here.
- No objections.</i>

334
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,482
Transfer the funds from
our Siberian holdings.

335
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,025
<i>Done.</i>

336
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,198
Where do the Americans stand?

337
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:49,661
The CIA doesn't care about another
dictator as long as they get a free hand.

338
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:52,456
But when they find out that
they've been duped?

339
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:54,040
I'm working on that.

340
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,502
I'm still not sure that the Tierra project
is the best use for Quantum this time.

341
00:42:57,544 --> 00:42:59,963
<i>Perhaps we should shift
our focus to the Canadians.</i>

342
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:02,883
<i>This is the world's most
precious resource.</i>

343
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:05,719
<i>We need to control as
much of it as we can.</i>

344
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,346
Bolivia must be top priority.

345
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,932
Can I offer an opinion?

346
00:43:11,975 --> 00:43:16,313
I really think you people should
find a better place to meet.

347
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:24,029
Where do you think you're going?

348
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:46,968
Thank you.

349
00:43:56,978 --> 00:44:00,315
It seems Tosca isn't for everyone.

350
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:15,932
Drop it!

351
00:45:19,102 --> 00:45:21,480
So, who're you working for?

352
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,148
Piss off!

353
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:27,319
Get rid of anything we brought with us.
We've been compromised.

354
00:45:29,654 --> 00:45:32,115
I asked you,
who you were working for.

355
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,296
- Is he one of ours?
- No.

356
00:45:46,296 --> 00:45:48,757
Then he shouldn't be looking at me.

357
00:45:57,182 --> 00:45:59,601
Get me M.

358
00:46:01,186 --> 00:46:04,981
- Fräulein...
- Heinz... connect call.

359
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:07,609
We've ID'd the pictures.

360
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:09,277
Show me.

361
00:46:09,277 --> 00:46:13,865
Gregor Karakov, former minister, now
owns most of the mines in Siberia.

362
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:17,869
Moeshi Saroff, former Mossad,
now Telecomm giant...

363
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:20,497
and Guy Haines, special envoy
to the prime minister.

364
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:22,999
- Get Bond.
- There's something else.

365
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:27,337
It appears Bond shot Haines's
bodyguard and threw him off a roof.

366
00:46:31,883 --> 00:46:34,136
<i>- Where are you?
- Did you get my pictures?</i>

367
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:36,680
<i>Abridge this conversation,
can you link these people?</i>

368
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,099
<i>- I hear stress in your voice.
- I need you to come in and debrief.</i>

369
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:42,352
- I don't have time.
- Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz.

370
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:43,812
I did my best not to.

371
00:46:43,812 --> 00:46:45,772
You shot him at point blank
and threw him off a roof.

372
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:47,816
I'd hardly call that
"showing restraint".

373
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:50,360
Especially since he was
a member of special branch.

374
00:46:53,488 --> 00:46:55,031
So, who was he guarding?

375
00:46:55,031 --> 00:46:57,868
Bond, you're missing the fact that you
killed a member of the special branch.

376
00:46:57,868 --> 00:47:00,871
- I want you to come in.
- And I would...

377
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:03,457
but right now I need to find
the one who tried to kill you.

378
00:47:03,457 --> 00:47:06,418
<i>- Go back to sleep.
- Connection terminated</i>

379
00:47:06,418 --> 00:47:09,588
Restrict Bond's movements.
Cancel his cards.

380
00:47:09,588 --> 00:47:11,882
Put an alert on his passports.
All of them...

381
00:47:11,882 --> 00:47:14,217
and I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.

382
00:47:14,217 --> 00:47:16,219
- Yes, ma'am.
- And Tanner...

383
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:18,430
be careful who you trust with this.

384
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:21,016
Hopefully you're a better
judge of character than I am.

385
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:24,978
You want to follow your friends
to La Paz, Bolivia?

386
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,563
Please.

387
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:28,482
(Abgelehnt Rejected)

388
00:47:28,482 --> 00:47:30,150
Oh, I'm sorry sir,
but this one doesn't work.

389
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,319
Do you have another card?

390
00:47:32,444 --> 00:47:34,070
No.

391
00:47:39,201 --> 00:47:41,077
Could you do me a favor.

392
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:43,163
You're gonna get a phone call
in a minute.

393
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:46,082
Would you mind telling them
I'm headed for Cairo?

394
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,834
I'll be happy to.

395
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:49,419
Thank you.

396
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:56,384
Ocean Sky, guten abend.
(good evening)

397
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,627
Mathis.

398
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:32,295
What do you want?

399
00:48:32,712 --> 00:48:34,798
Come to apologize?

400
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,555
You know Mathis...
I think retirement suits you.

401
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:44,224
None for him.

402
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:47,227
Sorry...
he is in a bad mood today.

403
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:13,670
I need a passport
and matching credit cards.

404
00:49:13,837 --> 00:49:15,672
Has MI-6 run out of plastic?

405
00:49:17,757 --> 00:49:20,135
Well oddly right now you're the
only person I think I should trust.

406
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:21,845
That is odd.

407
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:25,182
But I guess, when one's
young it seems very easy...

408
00:49:25,182 --> 00:49:27,184
to distinguish between
right and wrong.

409
00:49:27,184 --> 00:49:29,311
But as one gets older...

410
00:49:29,311 --> 00:49:30,854
it becomes more difficult.

411
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:33,940
The villains and the heros
get all mixed up.

412
00:49:34,774 --> 00:49:37,819
I was sorry to hear about Vesper.

413
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:40,572
- I think she loved you.
- Hm'hm...

414
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:43,575
right up until the
moment she betrayed me.

415
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:45,452
She died for you.

416
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:49,706
Why did you really want to see me?

417
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:53,960
I need some information.

418
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:57,631
Ahh...

419
00:49:57,631 --> 00:49:59,633
you have some hard friends.

420
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:03,136
This man is some kind of
facilitator, fingers in many pies...

421
00:50:03,136 --> 00:50:05,055
but that don't leave any prints.

422
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:07,474
These men were together?

423
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:08,975
They're buying up oil pipeline.

424
00:50:08,975 --> 00:50:11,436
Something called
the "Tierra Project", you know it?

425
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:15,190
Destroy these! That's the guy, Haines.
You don't know him?

426
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,400
- Should I?
- I suppose not.

427
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,237
You haven't been keeping
secrets as long as I have.

428
00:50:20,237 --> 00:50:22,322
He keeps a very low profile...

429
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:26,159
but is one of the
Prime Ministers' closest advisers.

430
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,246
And they say that you're judged
by the strength of your enemies...

431
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:32,249
You know anything about Bolivia?

432
00:50:32,249 --> 00:50:35,460
I was stationed
in South America for 7 years.

433
00:50:35,877 --> 00:50:37,129
You probably still have
some contacts there?

434
00:50:37,129 --> 00:50:38,880
A few.

435
00:50:38,922 --> 00:50:40,674
What do you want to know?

436
00:50:41,716 --> 00:50:43,593
Come with me.

437
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:16,001
You can't sleep?

438
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:18,253
May I fix you a drink, sir?

439
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:20,338
What're you drinking?

440
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,924
I don't know,
what am I drinking?

441
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:26,803
3 measures of Gordon's Gin,
1 of Vodka, 1/2 a measure of Kina O...

442
00:51:26,803 --> 00:51:29,848
- Kina Ole...
- Kina Ole, which is not Vermouth.

443
00:51:29,848 --> 00:51:31,975
Shaken well until it's ice cold...

444
00:51:31,975 --> 00:51:34,603
then served with a large
thin slice of lemon peel.

445
00:51:35,312 --> 00:51:36,688
Six of them.

446
00:51:37,063 --> 00:51:40,609
- That's impressive.
- They're good, you should have one.

447
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:44,029
Nah... it would just keep me awake.

448
00:51:47,949 --> 00:51:50,619
So, what's keeping you awake?

449
00:51:52,954 --> 00:51:55,415
I was wondering
why you came with me.

450
00:51:57,209 --> 00:52:00,545
It takes something
to admit you were wrong.

451
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:05,383
You want a sleeping pill?

452
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:08,428
- No.
- Pain pill?

453
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,430
I have pills for everything.

454
00:52:10,555 --> 00:52:13,058
Some make you taller.

455
00:52:13,683 --> 00:52:15,852
Some make you forget.

456
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:21,483
I'm gonna try
to get some sleep.

457
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:22,943
Good idea.

458
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,334
Thank you.

459
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:42,712
One moment, Mr. Bond, my name is Fields,
I'm from the consulate.

460
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:45,215
Well, of course you are,
what'd you do at the consulate, Fields?

461
00:52:45,215 --> 00:52:47,843
That's not what's important.
My orders are to turn you around...

462
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:50,178
and put you on the first plane
back to London.

463
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,681
Do those orders
include my friend Mathis?

464
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,808
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

465
00:52:55,142 --> 00:52:57,769
You see that? Gone such a short
time and already forgotten.

466
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:00,147
Ahh, you're just saying that
to hurt me.

467
00:53:00,272 --> 00:53:03,483
Mr Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authority.

468
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,696
Tomorrow morning.

469
00:53:07,696 --> 00:53:09,030
Well then, we have all night.

470
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,991
If you try to flee,
I will arrest you...

471
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:13,869
drop you off in jail and take you
to the plane in chains. Understand?

472
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:15,787
Perfectly, after you.

473
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:18,707
I think she has handcuffs.

474
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:19,875
I certainly hope so.

475
00:53:27,382 --> 00:53:30,635
He blames the water shortage
on global warming.

476
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:40,687
The colonel,
who heads the national police.

477
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,873
Carlos, momentito.

478
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:07,672
- We have a reservation.
- One moment.

479
00:54:07,672 --> 00:54:08,799
- Okay.
- I'll have to verify it.

480
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:09,925
Very well, thank you.

481
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:12,427
- Your name?
- Miss Fields.

482
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:15,555
Wait...

483
00:54:17,057 --> 00:54:18,225
You're going nowhere.

484
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:19,935
So, shoot me,
I'd rather stay at a morgue.

485
00:54:19,976 --> 00:54:22,312
We are teachers on sabbatical,
it fits our cover.

486
00:54:23,146 --> 00:54:24,397
No, it doesn't... get in.

487
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:26,066
Get in!

488
00:54:40,956 --> 00:54:41,998
Ola... (Hello...)

489
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,593
Follow me please.

490
00:55:01,017 --> 00:55:02,936
May I show you your room, Señor?

491
00:55:02,978 --> 00:55:05,021
- No, it's fine, thank you.
- Gracias.

492
00:55:22,122 --> 00:55:26,501
I can't find the, um...
the stationery.

493
00:55:27,252 --> 00:55:28,795
Come and help me look.

494
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:45,479
We've been invited to a party.

495
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,772
I didn't know we had any friends here.

496
00:55:49,357 --> 00:55:50,692
Green Planet.

497
00:55:51,985 --> 00:55:53,570
You're not coming?

498
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:55,864
I'm having a drink with my friend,
the Colonel.

499
00:55:55,864 --> 00:55:57,657
I'll see you there later.

500
00:56:02,537 --> 00:56:05,207
Do you know
how angry I am at myself?

501
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:07,959
I can't imagine.

502
00:56:10,879 --> 00:56:12,714
You must be furious.

503
00:56:19,095 --> 00:56:20,722
Do you wanna go to a party?

504
00:56:22,224 --> 00:56:23,433
Party?

505
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:26,269
But I have nothing to wear.

506
00:56:26,812 --> 00:56:28,396
We'll fix that.

507
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:50,252
It might be useful
to know your real name.

508
00:56:50,502 --> 00:56:51,837
Fields.

509
00:56:53,672 --> 00:56:55,257
Just Fields.

510
00:56:56,341 --> 00:56:58,009
Fields it is.

511
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:02,681
We are in a spiral
of environmental decline.

512
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:05,350
Since 1945...

513
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:12,566
17% of the planet's vegetated surface
has been irreversibly degraded.

514
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,613
The Tierra project is just one small
part of a global network, of equal parts...

515
00:57:18,738 --> 00:57:23,452
that Green Planet has created,
to rejuvenate the world...

516
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:25,120
on the verge of collapse.

517
00:57:26,663 --> 00:57:31,460
I hope that tonight, you make the
decision to be part of that.

518
00:57:32,627 --> 00:57:34,212
Thank you.

519
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,051
And have fun.

520
00:57:43,805 --> 00:57:45,640
Excellent speech. Congratulations.

521
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:47,559
Wonderful speech, Dominic.

522
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:49,311
Thank you.

523
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:51,813
Miss Fields, Mr. Bond...

524
00:57:52,022 --> 00:57:54,733
- my friend Carlos.
- Pleased to meet you.

525
00:57:54,733 --> 00:57:55,775
Ma'am.

526
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:59,404
Mr. Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

527
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,784
I want you to know my entire
police force... is at your disposal.

528
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:05,118
Well, that could be very useful.

529
00:58:05,202 --> 00:58:07,204
You know, there are people
in this country...

530
00:58:07,204 --> 00:58:09,748
spending half their paycheck
just to get clean water.

531
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:11,291
What do you think of that?

532
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,627
The Bolivian government
is the problem.

533
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:16,213
They cut down the trees,
then act surprised...

534
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:19,007
when the water and the soil,
wash out to sea.

535
00:58:19,132 --> 00:58:20,550
I couldn't agree more.

536
00:58:20,592 --> 00:58:22,469
I hope this figure
is to your liking.

537
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:24,721
Cherie, you shouldn't tease.

538
00:58:25,138 --> 00:58:29,434
Why don't you tell them about all the
land you bought up outside near the sea?

539
00:58:29,476 --> 00:58:31,937
It's been a pleasure.
Would you excuse me?

540
00:58:33,104 --> 00:58:36,358
Somehow the logging rights went
to a Multinational Corporation...

541
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:38,068
that cut down the forests.

542
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:42,781
But only after our last government
sold the land to Green Planet.

543
00:58:43,532 --> 00:58:45,283
What was that?

544
00:58:45,283 --> 00:58:48,120
- Oh, have I got my facts crossed?
- Yes, I think you did.

545
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,747
Will you excuse us?

546
00:58:51,998 --> 00:58:54,042
What a wonderful night, Señor.

547
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:59,798
You just cost me quite a bit
of money darling.

548
00:58:59,798 --> 00:59:02,509
You can't put a price
on integrity.

549
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:04,427
I can try.

550
00:59:11,434 --> 00:59:15,188
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight
just to piss on my parade.

551
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:18,692
Why are you still after this
general's head, for your mantel?

552
00:59:18,942 --> 00:59:20,777
A little of both.

553
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:26,700
Tell me where Medrano is, and maybe
you won't lose any more investors.

554
00:59:29,536 --> 00:59:33,290
You are really breaking my heart
choosing an insect like that over me.

555
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:36,877
You're going to throw me over?

556
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:40,213
Well, you've been drinking...
maybe you slipped?

557
00:59:41,131 --> 00:59:43,300
Oh... just think
how much you'd miss me.

558
00:59:48,472 --> 00:59:50,015
Good evening.

559
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,766
There you are.

560
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,061
Would you excuse me?

561
00:59:55,854 --> 00:59:57,606
Mr. Bond.

562
00:59:58,273 --> 01:00:00,150
What a pleasure.

563
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:04,780
Careful with this one,
she won't go to bed with you...

564
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:07,574
unless you give her something
she really wants.

565
01:00:07,574 --> 01:00:12,412
That's a shame, because she's really quite
stunning once you... get her on her back.

566
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:15,373
Yeah, I wish I could say that
the feeling was mutual.

567
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:17,042
I'm sorry Mr. Greene,
but we have to go.

568
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:19,002
Please,
my friends call me Dominic.

569
01:00:19,002 --> 01:00:21,087
I'm sure they do.

570
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:25,258
How much do you know about Bond,
Camille, because he's rather...

571
01:00:25,258 --> 01:00:29,262
a tragic case, his MI-6 says
that he's difficult to control.

572
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:34,559
Nice way of saying that everything
he touches seems to wither and die.

573
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:35,852
Shall we?

574
01:00:35,852 --> 01:00:38,355
It doesn't bode well for you,
I'm afraid.

575
01:00:38,355 --> 01:00:40,732
You two do make
a charming couple, though.

576
01:00:40,732 --> 01:00:43,610
You're both...
what's the expression?

577
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,904
Damaged goods.

578
01:00:48,657 --> 01:00:50,534
Oh my Gosh!

579
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:53,036
I'm so sorry.

580
01:00:56,248 --> 01:00:58,708
Come on, lighten up.
You're cramping my style.

581
01:01:00,043 --> 01:01:04,214
So it's British intelligence now?
What the hell they want from me?

582
01:01:04,214 --> 01:01:06,591
You're gonna show me
Dominic Greene's Tierra Project.

583
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:09,010
- Are you up to it?
- Do I have choice?

584
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,428
Do you want one?

585
01:01:10,887 --> 01:01:13,557
There's something horribly
efficient about you.

586
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:15,433
What a compliment.

587
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:32,784
What's the bet that Dominic Greene
has friends in the police force?

588
01:01:44,087 --> 01:01:45,714
Stay here.

589
01:01:48,091 --> 01:01:49,926
Buenas Noches. (Good Evening)

590
01:02:06,526 --> 01:02:09,029
<i>Now why would you
want me to do that?</i>

591
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:43,021
Mathis.

592
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:47,400
There's a hospital
on the other side of town.

593
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:51,988
Please... stay with me.

594
01:02:51,988 --> 01:02:54,616
Stay here, please.

595
01:02:54,616 --> 01:02:55,951
Please.

596
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:57,661
Come here.

597
01:02:58,954 --> 01:03:01,164
It's alright...
hold on.

598
01:03:01,248 --> 01:03:03,291
Okay.

599
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:06,253
That's better.

600
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:08,588
That way doesn't hurt.

601
01:03:11,133 --> 01:03:13,510
Is Mathis your cover name?

602
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,221
Yes.

603
01:03:17,806 --> 01:03:19,975
Not a very good one, is it?

604
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:28,942
Do we forgive each other?

605
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:33,113
I shouldn't have left you alone.

606
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:36,658
Vesper.

607
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,578
She did everything for you.

608
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:43,373
Forgive her.

609
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:47,127
Forgive yourself.

610
01:04:08,523 --> 01:04:10,901
Is that how you treat your friends?

611
01:04:11,276 --> 01:04:13,320
He wouldn't care.

612
01:04:19,409 --> 01:04:21,077
Let's go.

613
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:37,928
The Foreign Secretary
is asking to see you.

614
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:40,680
What don't I know?

615
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,266
<i>René Mathis, has been
shot dead in Bolivia.</i>

616
01:04:43,391 --> 01:04:45,977
<i>The police claim it was Bond.</i>

617
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,292
Buenos días. (Good morning)

618
01:05:12,087 --> 01:05:13,296
Buenos días.

619
01:05:20,262 --> 01:05:23,181
- How much did you pay him?
- Well, he wanted you.

620
01:05:23,181 --> 01:05:25,684
But I left him the car
as collateral.

621
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:28,019
He'll make much more
when he sells us out.

622
01:05:31,398 --> 01:05:34,359
Alright...
let's see if this thing will fly.

623
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:51,751
Here...

624
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:54,963
all the information I found said
there was nothing of value there.

625
01:05:54,963 --> 01:05:57,466
But Greene's geologists
had prove that there was.

626
01:06:01,553 --> 01:06:04,973
My sources tell me you're
Bolivian Secret Service...

627
01:06:05,974 --> 01:06:08,018
or used to be.

628
01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:12,814
And you infiltrated Greene's
organization by having sex with him.

629
01:06:13,064 --> 01:06:16,151
- That offends you?
- No, not in the slightest.

630
01:06:16,568 --> 01:06:18,653
So, what's your interest
in Greene?

631
01:06:18,653 --> 01:06:21,573
Well, amongst other things,
he tried to kill a friend of mine.

632
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,992
- A woman?
- Yes...

633
01:06:23,992 --> 01:06:25,494
but it's not what you think.

634
01:06:25,494 --> 01:06:28,288
- Your mother?
- She likes to think so.

635
01:06:31,792 --> 01:06:33,794
What's that... down there?

636
01:06:36,546 --> 01:06:40,300
That's a sink hole...
There are a few around here.

637
01:06:41,635 --> 01:06:44,846
Just for the record,
I wasn't with Greene for a...

638
01:07:51,455 --> 01:07:53,498
I think we lost him.

639
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:04,885
He's coming fast.

640
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:52,891
He's right behind you!

641
01:09:34,808 --> 01:09:37,769
Here!
Put that on!

642
01:10:21,772 --> 01:10:24,107
Come on!

643
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:45,754
Come here!

644
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:06,900
According to Bolivians
it was a routine stop...

645
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,237
and when they discovered Mathis's body,
Bond disarmed and shot them.

646
01:11:10,237 --> 01:11:12,697
Of course there are no witnesses
to prove otherwise.

647
01:11:12,697 --> 01:11:15,408
I need something.
I can't go in there unarmed.

648
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,160
I'm sorry, there's nothing.

649
01:11:19,996 --> 01:11:21,832
Come in.

650
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:25,752
What's today's excuse?
That Bond is legally blind?

651
01:11:25,752 --> 01:11:27,254
No, Minister.

652
01:11:27,254 --> 01:11:30,048
I don't think I need to tell you
how upset the P.M. is.

653
01:11:30,465 --> 01:11:32,968
With respect, the P.M. has
my direct line.

654
01:11:32,968 --> 01:11:35,428
And he would've used it
if he wanted to speak to you.

655
01:11:36,847 --> 01:11:42,644
I'm sorry M... things have changed...
We've had long discussions with our cousins.

656
01:11:42,644 --> 01:11:45,188
Mr. Greene's interests
and ours now align.

657
01:11:45,188 --> 01:11:47,149
Minister, this man
is a major player...

658
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:49,943
in one of the most dangerous
and powerful organizations...

659
01:11:49,943 --> 01:11:51,778
We've never even heard of.

660
01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:55,157
Foreign policy cannot be conducted
on the basis of hunches and inuendo.

661
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:59,453
Then give us time to gather enough evidence
so you can make informed decisions.

662
01:11:59,494 --> 01:12:01,246
Fine.

663
01:12:01,246 --> 01:12:04,166
Say you're right...
say Greene is a villain.

664
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:08,336
If we refused to do business with villains
we'd have almost no one to trade with.

665
01:12:09,463 --> 01:12:12,966
The world is running out of oil, M...
The Russians aren't playing ball...

666
01:12:12,966 --> 01:12:15,427
the Americans and Chinese are
dividing up what's left.

667
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:20,932
Right or wrong doesn't come into it.
We're acting out of necessity.

668
01:12:23,143 --> 01:12:29,357
Bond... is running wild.
Who's to say he hasn't been turned?

669
01:12:29,441 --> 01:12:31,443
Pull him in...

670
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:34,863
or the Americans will put him down.

671
01:12:36,823 --> 01:12:39,034
I think I've found a way out.

672
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:41,411
You're freezing.

673
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:43,497
I'm fine.

674
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,557
So what is it
that Greene has that you want?

675
01:13:07,729 --> 01:13:11,900
It's not Greene, it's Medrano...
the man you met in Haiti.

676
01:13:13,151 --> 01:13:16,655
My father...
worked for the Military Junta.

677
01:13:16,655 --> 01:13:19,157
He was a very cruel man.

678
01:13:20,283 --> 01:13:22,619
But he was my father.

679
01:13:26,123 --> 01:13:31,545
When I was a small child, the opposition
sent General Medrano to our house.

680
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:39,845
He shot my father... he did things
to my mother and my sister...

681
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:45,183
and then strangled them
while I watched.

682
01:13:45,642 --> 01:13:48,937
I was too young to be any trouble.

683
01:13:49,688 --> 01:13:52,566
So he just smiled at me...

684
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:56,862
and set the house on fire.

685
01:13:59,197 --> 01:14:01,783
He left his mark.

686
01:14:04,703 --> 01:14:06,663
So, when I pulled you
off the boat...

687
01:14:06,663 --> 01:14:09,791
I waited years for that chance.

688
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,127
I apologize.

689
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:16,923
Seems, we're both using
Greene to get to somebody.

690
01:14:18,258 --> 01:14:20,969
You lost somebody?

691
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:23,263
I did, yes.

692
01:14:23,263 --> 01:14:25,974
You catch whoever did it?

693
01:14:26,099 --> 01:14:28,894
No... not yet.

694
01:14:29,352 --> 01:14:32,105
Tell me when you do...

695
01:14:32,272 --> 01:14:35,150
I'd like to know how it feels.

696
01:14:39,488 --> 01:14:41,615
We should go.

697
01:14:42,032 --> 01:14:43,617
You ready?

698
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:19,069
They've used dynamite.

699
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:24,282
This used to be a river bed.

700
01:15:41,049 --> 01:15:44,928
Greene isn't after the oil,
he wants the water.

701
01:15:45,846 --> 01:15:47,430
We can't leave it like this.

702
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:49,099
It's one dam.

703
01:15:49,099 --> 01:15:52,686
He's creating a drought...
And he'll build others.

704
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:23,485
Excuse me sir...
your wife left a message.

705
01:17:23,485 --> 01:17:26,446
The English woman.
She left it for you this morning.

706
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:28,490
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

707
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:30,325
Run!

708
01:17:30,575 --> 01:17:32,202
What is it?

709
01:17:33,495 --> 01:17:35,539
Would you mind waiting down here?

710
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:38,166
I'll be outside.

711
01:17:57,269 --> 01:17:59,020
So that's what she meant?

712
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:01,189
I hope you can trust
these men.

713
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:03,442
Just a moment...
It's Tanner.

714
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:06,611
Yes?

715
01:18:06,653 --> 01:18:08,113
We've got the girl downstairs...

716
01:18:08,113 --> 01:18:10,615
She says to tell you she's sorry
but this is not her fight.

717
01:18:10,615 --> 01:18:12,075
It isn't... let her go.

718
01:18:12,075 --> 01:18:14,119
She isn't our concern.

719
01:18:14,911 --> 01:18:16,538
Well, I'm disappointed.

720
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,540
You are?

721
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,709
How much oil
did the Americans promise you?

722
01:18:20,709 --> 01:18:22,961
- This isn't about oil.
- Well, that's good, there isn't any.

723
01:18:22,961 --> 01:18:24,713
It's about trust.

724
01:18:24,838 --> 01:18:26,923
You said you weren't motivated
by revenge.

725
01:18:26,923 --> 01:18:28,592
I'm motivated by my duty.

726
01:18:28,592 --> 01:18:30,135
No.

727
01:18:30,343 --> 01:18:35,015
I think you're so blinded by inconsolable
rage that you don't care who you hurt.

728
01:18:35,765 --> 01:18:39,394
When you can't tell your friends
from your enemies it's time to go.

729
01:18:47,152 --> 01:18:50,572
You might like to still hold your
theory about there being no oil.

730
01:18:50,697 --> 01:18:52,866
Her lungs are full of it.

731
01:18:54,242 --> 01:18:55,368
It was Greene.

732
01:18:55,368 --> 01:18:57,329
No doubt. But Why?

733
01:18:58,205 --> 01:19:01,249
- It's just misdirection...
- I mean... why her Bond?

734
01:19:01,249 --> 01:19:03,126
She was just supposed
to send you home.

735
01:19:03,126 --> 01:19:06,713
She worked in an office...
collecting reports.

736
01:19:07,172 --> 01:19:10,217
Look how well
your charm works, James.

737
01:19:10,217 --> 01:19:13,261
They'll do anything for you,
won't they?

738
01:19:13,261 --> 01:19:15,847
How many is that now?

739
01:19:15,847 --> 01:19:19,184
You're removed from duty and suspended
pending further investigation.

740
01:19:19,226 --> 01:19:22,813
You'll give whatever weapons you have
to have these men and leave with them now.

741
01:20:09,693 --> 01:20:11,153
Miss Fields showed true bravery.

742
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:13,405
I want that mentioned
in your report.

743
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:15,240
Now, you and I
need to see this through.

744
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,700
There's nowhere to go.

745
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:19,161
There's a capture
or kill order out on you.

746
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,872
Who would have done that?

747
01:20:31,631 --> 01:20:33,258
Ma'am?
Find out where he's going.

748
01:20:33,258 --> 01:20:35,260
- He's on to something.
- Ma'am, the CIA is insisting...

749
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,762
I don't give a shit about the CIA,
or their trumped up evidence.

750
01:20:37,762 --> 01:20:40,182
He is my agent.
And I trust him.

751
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:41,683
Go on.

752
01:20:52,694 --> 01:20:54,029
Get in.

753
01:20:54,362 --> 01:20:55,614
You're gonna try to shoot me?

754
01:20:55,614 --> 01:20:57,491
I said, get in.

755
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:14,841
You'll be getting botulism
if you keep drinking that.

756
01:21:14,841 --> 01:21:17,552
It's bottled water.

757
01:21:17,969 --> 01:21:20,639
It probably came from some stream
just around the corner from here...

758
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:23,141
a bunch of little kids
peein' in it.

759
01:21:24,309 --> 01:21:27,896
- That's why I eat the peppers.
- Well, all I'm sayin' is...

760
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:30,899
you can't trust a damn thing
around here.

761
01:21:34,903 --> 01:21:36,780
Lincoln Exportar, buenos noches.
(Lincoln Export, good evening)

762
01:21:36,988 --> 01:21:39,407
You know when someone calls, you can
just tell 'em it's the "CIA", Felix.

763
01:21:39,407 --> 01:21:41,993
A taxi driver told me
where your office was.

764
01:21:41,993 --> 01:21:44,621
Well, if it's so easy
to find, James...

765
01:21:44,621 --> 01:21:46,873
you really should come visit.

766
01:21:47,415 --> 01:21:50,335
Or maybe you should go out
and see some more of the city.

767
01:22:11,523 --> 01:22:13,275
I heard a rumor you'd gone native.

768
01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:15,235
Felix.

769
01:22:15,235 --> 01:22:17,696
- ¿Qué le gusta? (What would you like?)
- Una cerveza, por favor. (a beer, please.)

770
01:22:19,281 --> 01:22:21,825
You know, I was just wondering
what South America would look like...

771
01:22:21,825 --> 01:22:23,952
if nobody gave a damn
about coke or communism.

772
01:22:23,952 --> 01:22:26,580
It always impressed me the way
you boys would carve this place up.

773
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,166
I'll take that as a compliment
coming from a Brit.

774
01:22:31,334 --> 01:22:33,753
Are you sure you're playing
with the right side?

775
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:36,339
Regimes change
once a week down here.

776
01:22:36,339 --> 01:22:38,550
Medrano will be no dirtier
than the next guy.

777
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:40,552
Oh you see, that's what I like
about U.S. intelligence...

778
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:43,388
- you'll lie down with anybody.
- Including you brother.

779
01:22:43,388 --> 01:22:46,975
- Including you.
- Do you know you're being played?

780
01:22:46,975 --> 01:22:49,770
Dominic Greene is gonna suck this
place dry and then he's gonna move on...

781
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,980
and you're gonna be left
picking up the broken crockery...

782
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,733
What can I tell you, there's
no such thing as a free lunch.

783
01:22:54,733 --> 01:22:58,069
You see Felix, I do not think you're
half as cynical as you make out to be.

784
01:22:58,069 --> 01:23:00,238
You don't know me.

785
01:23:00,947 --> 01:23:03,158
Why?...

786
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:05,160
Just because you didn't come alone?

787
01:23:05,577 --> 01:23:08,789
- How long have I got?
- 30 seconds.

788
01:23:10,081 --> 01:23:12,125
Well, that doesn't give us
a lotta time, does it?

789
01:23:14,419 --> 01:23:17,756
Medrano can't move until he's pays
off the army and the police chief.

790
01:23:17,756 --> 01:23:20,467
Greene's bringing him
his money now at the hotel called...

791
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:24,346
"Pérola de las Dunas",
in the desert.

792
01:23:24,346 --> 01:23:26,348
Thank you, Felix.

793
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:28,266
James!
Move your ass!

794
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:56,503
What the hell happened?
What did you tell him?

795
01:23:56,503 --> 01:23:58,463
Just what we agreed.

796
01:25:22,047 --> 01:25:23,965
What're you doing?

797
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:27,427
It slides cocked.

798
01:25:28,512 --> 01:25:30,680
Maybe you should check your own.

799
01:25:31,014 --> 01:25:32,682
I will.

800
01:25:37,354 --> 01:25:39,815
Have you ever killed someone?

801
01:25:43,318 --> 01:25:47,114
The training will tell you that when the
adrenalin kicks in, you should compensate.

802
01:25:48,198 --> 01:25:52,369
But part of you is not gonna believe in the
training because this kill here is personal.

803
01:25:53,954 --> 01:25:56,331
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

804
01:25:56,331 --> 01:25:58,125
You only need one shot.

805
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:00,460
Make it count.

806
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:12,806
General, he is here.

807
01:26:13,348 --> 01:26:15,934
- The time has come, General.
- Let's go.

808
01:26:58,477 --> 01:27:03,732
- Welcome.
- How are you?

809
01:27:07,068 --> 01:27:10,864
In Euros... as requested.

810
01:27:10,864 --> 01:27:13,492
The Dollar isn't what it once was.

811
01:27:13,492 --> 01:27:15,577
The cost of war.

812
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:20,373
Yes, I'm afraid that the corruption
in this current Government...

813
01:27:20,373 --> 01:27:21,958
can no longer be tolerated

814
01:27:23,335 --> 01:27:24,795
Presidente?

815
01:27:24,795 --> 01:27:26,505
And mine?

816
01:27:26,713 --> 01:27:29,299
You'll get that as soon
as you sign over my land.

817
01:27:45,482 --> 01:27:47,901
My first official act.

818
01:27:53,323 --> 01:27:54,991
And this, if you would.

819
01:27:55,408 --> 01:27:56,993
What is this?

820
01:27:56,993 --> 01:27:59,871
As of this moment,
my organization owns...

821
01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:03,542
more than 60%
of Bolivia's water supply.

822
01:28:03,542 --> 01:28:07,003
And this contract states
that your new government...

823
01:28:07,003 --> 01:28:10,841
will use us as utilities provider.

824
01:28:10,924 --> 01:28:14,052
This is double
what we're paying now.

825
01:28:17,222 --> 01:28:19,683
Oh... well, then don't sign it!

826
01:28:20,308 --> 01:28:25,939
But you should know something about me
and the people I work with.

827
01:28:26,148 --> 01:28:32,112
We deal with the left or the right,
or dictators or deposed dictators.

828
01:28:32,404 --> 01:28:37,200
If the current president had been more
agreeable, I wouldn't be talking to you.

829
01:28:37,284 --> 01:28:41,288
So, if you decide not to sign,
you'll wake up with your balls...

830
01:28:41,288 --> 01:28:45,792
in your mouth and your willing
replacement standing over you.

831
01:28:47,377 --> 01:28:50,630
If you doubt that then shoot me,
take that money...

832
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:53,800
and have a good night's sleep.

833
01:29:52,776 --> 01:29:55,612
You and I had a mutual friend.

834
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:48,243
Sounds like
you just lost another one.

835
01:33:57,813 --> 01:34:02,567
Not this way, not this way!
I can't... I can't.

836
01:34:20,669 --> 01:34:22,295
Make your shot.

837
01:34:22,295 --> 01:34:24,381
Take a deep breath.

838
01:34:25,173 --> 01:34:27,509
Make it count.

839
01:34:42,899 --> 01:34:44,609
Come on!

840
01:34:58,623 --> 01:35:00,625
Wait here.

841
01:35:31,615 --> 01:35:33,617
You promised that you...

842
01:35:33,617 --> 01:35:35,452
Let you go?

843
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,371
I answered your questions.

844
01:35:38,705 --> 01:35:41,500
I told you what you wanted to know
about Quantum.

845
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:42,876
Yes, you did.

846
01:35:42,876 --> 01:35:46,296
And your friends would know that,
so they're probably be looking for you.

847
01:35:46,296 --> 01:35:47,672
But the good news is...

848
01:35:47,672 --> 01:35:49,716
you're in the middle of the desert.

849
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,263
Here.

850
01:35:56,723 --> 01:36:00,477
I bet you make it 20 miles
before you consider drinking that.

851
01:36:00,477 --> 01:36:02,562
Goodbye, Mr. Greene.

852
01:36:02,562 --> 01:36:05,982
<i>Motor Oil</i>

853
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:43,895
Thank you.

854
01:36:43,895 --> 01:36:45,647
It's my pleasure.

855
01:36:46,898 --> 01:36:48,567
Are you alright?

856
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:50,861
I'm fine.

857
01:36:50,902 --> 01:36:55,490
But I keep thinking, he's dead,
and now what?

858
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:58,160
Well, the dam we saw
will have to come down.

859
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,369
And there'll be others too...

860
01:36:59,411 --> 01:37:01,830
someone who worked for Greene
might be of help.

861
01:37:02,998 --> 01:37:05,167
Not a bad idea.

862
01:37:09,671 --> 01:37:12,340
Do you think I'll be able
to sleep now?

863
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,763
I don't think the dead
care about vengence.

864
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:23,810
I wish... I could set you free.

865
01:37:27,272 --> 01:37:29,941
But your prison is in there.

866
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:25,247
Fine, anything for an easy life.

867
01:38:26,456 --> 01:38:27,791
Sit down.

868
01:38:28,542 --> 01:38:30,710
Sit down!

869
01:38:31,378 --> 01:38:33,130
It's okay, baby.

870
01:38:49,729 --> 01:38:52,107
You're Canadian?

871
01:38:52,107 --> 01:38:54,401
You work in Canadian intelligence?

872
01:38:54,401 --> 01:38:57,028
I'm sorry, I know you do.

873
01:38:57,028 --> 01:38:59,322
And knowing this man..

874
01:38:59,322 --> 01:39:01,741
I guess you have access
to some very sensitive material...

875
01:39:01,741 --> 01:39:03,702
which you will be forced
to give up.

876
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:05,078
His life will be threatened...

877
01:39:05,078 --> 01:39:08,373
and because you love him...
you won't hesitate.

878
01:39:08,707 --> 01:39:11,084
That's a beautiful necklace.

879
01:39:11,626 --> 01:39:13,795
Did he give it to you?

880
01:39:15,464 --> 01:39:18,300
I have one just like it...

881
01:39:20,886 --> 01:39:23,388
He gave it to a friend of mine.

882
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:26,641
Someone very close to me.

883
01:39:28,643 --> 01:39:30,645
- Your name is?
- Corine.

884
01:39:30,645 --> 01:39:32,272
Corine.

885
01:39:32,481 --> 01:39:35,233
Corine, I suggest you leave now,
you contact you're people...

886
01:39:35,233 --> 01:39:38,528
and you tell them to check
their seals they have a leak.

887
01:39:38,653 --> 01:39:40,906
Do it now, please.

888
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:44,910
This man and I
have some unfinished business.

889
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,797
Thank you.

890
01:40:00,884 --> 01:40:02,636
Please.

891
01:40:02,844 --> 01:40:04,888
Make it quick.

892
01:40:13,855 --> 01:40:15,524
He is still alive?

893
01:40:15,524 --> 01:40:16,983
He is.

894
01:40:17,192 --> 01:40:18,860
I'm surprised.

895
01:40:19,694 --> 01:40:22,197
Did you find what you were looking for?

896
01:40:22,197 --> 01:40:24,074
- Yes.
- Good.

897
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:27,828
- I assume you have no regrets.
- I don't.

898
01:40:27,953 --> 01:40:29,621
What about you?

899
01:40:30,038 --> 01:40:32,582
Of course not.
It would be unprofessional.

900
01:40:34,084 --> 01:40:37,963
They found Greene dead in the middle
of the Bolivian desert, of all places.

901
01:40:37,963 --> 01:40:40,507
Two bullets in the back of his skull.

902
01:40:40,507 --> 01:40:43,301
They found motor oil
in his stomach.

903
01:40:43,301 --> 01:40:45,011
Does that mean anything to you?

904
01:40:45,011 --> 01:40:46,221
I wish I could help.

905
01:40:46,221 --> 01:40:47,347
You'll be glad to know...

906
01:40:47,347 --> 01:40:49,474
I straightened things out
with the Americans.

907
01:40:49,474 --> 01:40:51,893
Your friend Leiter
has been promoted.

908
01:40:51,893 --> 01:40:53,228
He'll replace Beam.

909
01:40:53,228 --> 01:40:55,647
Well then, the right people
kept their jobs.

910
01:40:55,647 --> 01:40:57,607
Something like that.

911
01:40:59,067 --> 01:41:01,319
Congratulations, you were right.

912
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:03,113
About what?

913
01:41:03,864 --> 01:41:05,824
About Vesper.

914
01:41:07,617 --> 01:41:09,494
Ma'am!

915
01:41:11,371 --> 01:41:13,248
Bond.

916
01:41:13,874 --> 01:41:15,834
I need you back.

917
01:41:16,251 --> 01:41:18,753
I never left.

918
01:41:18,753 --> 01:41:39,608
