1
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:16,784
I still don't know why l'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,286
Yes, l could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,413
And l would expect you, of all people,

4
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,166
would understand
my feelings on misuse of power.

5
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,337
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, l know, Charles.

6
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,007
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

7
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,510
You're here because I need you.

8
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,304
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

9
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:41,183
No. This one's special.

10
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,354
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

11
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,023
Yeah, the brochure is great.

12
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:52,027
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

13
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,530
- Illness?
- John.

14
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,865
You think your daughter is sick, Mr Grey?

15
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,744
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

16
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,247
Of course.

17
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,999
Jean, can you come down, dear?

18
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,054
We'll leave you, then.

19
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:33,068
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr Lensherr's, without our permission.

20
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,780
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

21
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,242
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

22
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,371
Really? l doubt that.

23
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,098
Oh, Charles.

24
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,268
I like this one.

25
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,896
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

26
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,816
The question is,
will you control that power?

27
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,779
Or let it control you?

28
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,553
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

29
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,141
- What's going on?
- Nothing. l'll be right out.

30
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,811
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

31
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,023
Open the door. Warren.

32
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,317
One second!

33
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,655
Open this door.

34
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,448
Warren.

35
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,328
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

36
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,470
Oh, God.

37
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,974
- Not you.
- Dad, l'm sorry.

38
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,856
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,286
Bobby!

40
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,212
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:31,306
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,644
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,149
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,984
Logan.

45
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,490
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,201
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:55,038
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,208
Yeah. Good luck with that.
Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,670
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,189
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,528
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,783
Simulation complete.

53
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,373
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

54
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,292
- You know what l mean.
- Lighten up.

55
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,545
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,715
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,677
Yeah, best defense is a good offense.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,806
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,352
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,455
- Scott!
- Jean.

61
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,957
Scott. Scott.

62
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,545
Scott.

63
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,715
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

64
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,303
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

65
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,599
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

66
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,102
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have l ever put any pressure on you?

67
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,857
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

68
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,612
They were looking for you.
You didn't show.

69
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
What do you care?

70
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,033
- For starters, l had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

71
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,244
No, you didn't. The professor did.

72
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,872
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

73
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,124
Hey, look.

74
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,213
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

75
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,301
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

76
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,267
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

77
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,624
- Mr Secretary.
- Yes.

78
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:50,171
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,304
Mr President.

80
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,514
Have a seat, Hank.

81
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,019
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

82
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,689
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

83
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:12,861
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

84
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,697
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

85
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,242
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

86
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,412
Yes, sir. She can do that.

87
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,583
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

88
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,378
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

89
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,714
Where is Magneto?

90
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,383
Raven?

91
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:40,096
- Raven, l asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

92
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,350
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

93
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,895
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

94
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,066
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

95
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,070
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

96
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,909
In here with us.

97
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,996
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

98
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,624
You don't want to play games with me?

99
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:12,379
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

100
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,715
You wanna know where he is?

101
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,725
Homo sapien.

102
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,317
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

103
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,445
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

104
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,449
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

105
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,954
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

106
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,624
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

107
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,585
It's what she stole from the FDA.

108
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,635
Dear Lord.

109
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,056
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

110
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,687
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

111
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:16,651
Yes. l do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

112
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,241
When an individual acquires great power,

113
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,203
the use or misuse of that power
is everything.

114
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:34,002
Will it be for the greater good or will it be
used for personal or for destructive ends?

115
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,838
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

116
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,674
Why? Because we are mutants.

117
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,552
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

118
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,182
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

119
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,976
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

120
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,980
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

121
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,399
without any superhuman authority behind it.

122
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,111
Einstein wasn't a mutant
so far as we know.

123
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:07,285
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr Moira McTaggert. Jones.

124
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,289
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

125
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,211
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

126
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,048
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

127
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,301
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

128
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,887
into the body of this man?

129
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:31,851
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

130
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,449
Professor?

131
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,580
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

132
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,215
The forecast was for sunny skies.

133
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,969
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,982
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

135
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,861
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

136
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,990
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

137
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:31,953
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

138
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,164
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

139
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,376
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

140
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:44,007
In fact, l thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

141
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,346
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

142
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,099
He took Jean's death so hard.

143
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,310
Yes, things are better out there,

144
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,480
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

145
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,234
There's something you're not telling us.

146
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,995
Hank?

147
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,247
Ororo. Charles.

148
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,753
I love what you've done with your hair.

149
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,673
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

150
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,427
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

151
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,763
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

152
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,016
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

153
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:39,687
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

154
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,231
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

155
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,151
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

156
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,904
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

157
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,366
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

158
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,534
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

159
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,455
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

160
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,084
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

161
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,045
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

162
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,256
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

163
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,051
They're calling it a cure.

164
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,307
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

165
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,686
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

166
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,896
Storm.

167
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,399
They're announcing it now.

168
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,907
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

169
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,077
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

170
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,247
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

171
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,709
But l stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

172
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,004
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

173
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,091
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

174
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,427
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,723
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

176
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,184
Finally, we have a cure.

177
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:08,484
Who would want this cure? l mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

178
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,989
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

179
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,158
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

180
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:20,163
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

181
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,750
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

182
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:28,629
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant
rights since before you had claws.

183
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,925
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

184
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,304
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

185
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,017
No. Professor.

186
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,269
They can't cure us.

187
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:49,358
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

188
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,986
Or any of us, for that matter.

189
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,867
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what l think.

190
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:03,164
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

191
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,835
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

192
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:13,007
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

193
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:19,013
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

194
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:25,019
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

195
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,689
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

196
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,317
Nobody is talking about extermination.

197
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,112
No one ever talks about it.

198
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,199
They just do it.

199
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:44,455
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

200
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:50,336
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

201
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,257
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

202
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,551
the extermination has already begun.

203
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:01,264
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

204
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,392
They will force their cure upon us.

205
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:10,106
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

206
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,442
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

207
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,737
Who will you stand with? The humans?

208
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,408
Or us?

209
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,420
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

210
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,672
Back off.

211
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,010
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

212
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,681
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

213
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,767
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

214
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,645
You know who you're talking to?

215
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,898
Do you?

216
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,611
And what can you do?

217
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,947
So you have talents?

218
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,117
That and more. I know you control metal.

219
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,288
And l know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

220
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,540
Other than you two.

221
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,296
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

222
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,425
Could you locate one for me?

223
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:42,448
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

224
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,160
Do you know who l am?
I'm the president of the United States.

225
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,037
Oh, Mr President.

226
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,289
Shut up.

227
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:58,172
Why are you doing this to me? Let me
down. I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

228
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,882
Please.

229
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,844
Keep it up. l'll spray you in the face, bitch.

230
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:09,767
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

231
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,019
Yeah, right.

232
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,384
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

233
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,803
Thank you, Dr Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

234
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,641
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

235
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,228
He is a mutant.
You understand our concern.

236
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:58,899
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

237
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,903
Until we can fully map his DNA. We can
replicate it, but we can't generate it.

238
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,406
And his power? What is its range?

239
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,658
You'll see.

240
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,247
Jimmy.

241
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,917
There's someone I would like you to meet.

242
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,003
Hello there, son.

243
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,089
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

244
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,223
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,226
It's OK.

246
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:47,114
You have an amazing gift.
Thank you, Jimmy.

247
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,251
Extraordinary, isn't he?

248
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,463
Yes, he is.

249
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:55,391
Scott.

250
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,645
- Can you hear me? l'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

251
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,189
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

252
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,025
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

253
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,528
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

254
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,448
Stop!

255
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,839
Jean?

256
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,550
Scott.

257
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,055
How?

258
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,937
I don't know.

259
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,870
I wanna see your eyes.

260
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,124
- Take these off.
- No.

261
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,045
No.

262
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,923
Trust me. l can control it now.

263
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,767
Open them. You can't hurt me.

264
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,389
- What happened?
- No clue.

265
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,143
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

266
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,966
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

267
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,408
I can't see a damn thing.

268
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,911
I can take care of that.

269
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,262
What the...

270
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,757
Logan!

271
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,306
She's alive.

272
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,020
Jean.

273
00:28:55,442 --> 00:29:00,738
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

274
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,073
The only explanation of Jean's survival

275
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:08,328
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

276
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,832
Is she gonna be OK?

277
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,588
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've
ever encountered, her potential limitless.

278
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:22,468
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

279
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:27,014
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

280
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,683
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

281
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:35,856
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

282
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:41,904
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

283
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:48,035
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

284
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:54,458
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

285
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,880
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

286
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:05,219
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

287
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,764
or the Phoenix furiously struggling
to be free.

288
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,809
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

289
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:17,439
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

290
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,900
What have you done to her?

291
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,570
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

292
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,657
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

293
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,244
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

294
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:34,540
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

295
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,584
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

296
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:41,255
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

297
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,425
It sounds to me like Jean
had no choice at all.

298
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,972
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

299
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,607
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

300
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,111
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

301
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,489
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

302
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:13,912
Some are desperate for this cure while
others are offended by the very idea of it.

303
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,177
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

304
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:34,516
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

305
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,644
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

306
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,314
Good. Bring him in.

307
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,649
Are you sure you want to start with him?

308
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,277
I think it's important. Yes.

309
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,156
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

310
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,700
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

311
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,661
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

312
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,332
Everything's gonna be fine. l promise.

313
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,878
You ready?

314
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,160
The transformation can be a little jarring.

315
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,876
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

316
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,836
It'll all be over soon.

317
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:51,885
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. l can't do this.

318
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,887
Warren, calm down.

319
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,098
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

320
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,309
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

321
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:03,313
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

322
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,323
Warren, it's a better life.

323
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,119
- It's what we all want.
- No.

324
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,539
It's what you want.

325
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,085
Warren, no!

326
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,911
Told you so.

327
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,011
About time.

328
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,598
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

329
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,519
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

330
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,355
Without him, they have nothing.

331
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,524
Read off the guest list.

332
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:15,862
"Cell 41 205. James Madrox."

333
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,031
This one robbed seven banks.

334
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,041
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

335
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,837
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

336
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,553
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

337
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,640
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

338
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,227
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

339
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,896
How fascinating.

340
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,234
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

341
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,405
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? l need a pee.

342
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,420
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

343
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,758
I think he'll make a fine addition
to our army.

344
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,927
No!

345
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,288
You saved me.

346
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,793
Eric.

347
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,965
I'm sorry, my dear.

348
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,593
You're not one of us any more.

349
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,310
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

350
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,320
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

351
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,073
Policy is being made without me,
Mr President.

352
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,326
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

353
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,163
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

354
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,040
That was an isolated incident.

355
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,502
You have to understand
those mutants were a real threat.

356
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,881
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

357
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,217
I have.

358
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,137
And l worry about how democracy survives

359
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,848
when one man can move cities
with his mind.

360
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,017
As do l.

361
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,982
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

362
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:01,361
All the more reason
why l need to be where l belong.

363
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,807
Jean.

364
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,148
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

365
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,906
Back where we first met. Only l was
in your place and you were in mine.

366
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,868
Are you OK?

367
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,663
Yeah.

368
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,917
More than OK.

369
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,766
Logan, you're making me blush.

370
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,270
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

371
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:39,292
It's OK.

372
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,583
- Wait.
- No.

373
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,674
Jean.

374
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,844
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

375
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,013
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

376
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:40,186
The professor said you might be different.

377
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,524
He would know, wouldn't he?

378
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,361
What? You think he's not in your head too?

379
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,949
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

380
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,539
Where's Scott?

381
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,003
Jean?

382
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:09,215
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

383
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,303
You need to tell me
what happened to Scott.

384
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,392
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

385
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,906
Oh, God.

386
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,249
Look at me.

387
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,130
Stay with me. Talk to me.

388
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,090
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

389
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,051
Focus. Focus, Jean.

390
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,597
Kill me.

391
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,433
- What?
- Kill me before l kill someone else.

392
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,143
- Don't say that.
- Please.

393
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,771
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

394
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,275
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

395
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,070
It'll be all right. We can help you.

396
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,657
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

397
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,742
I don't want to fix it.

398
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,799
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

399
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,386
I told you they would draw first blood.

400
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,055
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

401
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:45,144
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

402
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,398
Come. We have an army to build.

403
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,653
I picked something up.

404
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,990
An electromagnetic force. lt's massive.

405
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,534
It's a mutant.

406
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:03,788
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

407
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,165
More powerful than you.

408
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,129
Where is she?

409
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,217
Logan.

410
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,428
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

411
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,680
What have you done?

412
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,062
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

413
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,192
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

414
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:44,954
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

415
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,041
It may be too late.

416
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,589
- Wait for me here.
- What?

417
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,841
I need to see Jean alone.

418
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,719
You were right, Charles.

419
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,222
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

420
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,267
Same as the professor.
Visiting an old friend.

421
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,603
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do l.

422
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,855
So, shall we go inside?

423
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,610
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

424
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:20,865
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

425
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,744
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

426
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,913
Nobody gets inside.

427
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:17,213
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

428
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,465
-l have no home.
- Yes, you do.

429
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,134
You have a home and a family.

430
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,804
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

431
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,850
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

432
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,811
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

433
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,980
No. I want to help you.

434
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:38,317
Help me? What's wrong with me?

435
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,319
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

436
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,448
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

437
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,159
For your own good, Jean.

438
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,120
Stay out of my head.

439
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,835
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

440
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:06,053
Look at me, Jean. l can help you.
Look at me.

441
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,139
Get out of my head.

442
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:14,729
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

443
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:18,191
- But l can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

444
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,528
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

445
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,989
No! Stop it!

446
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,702
That's it.

447
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,163
Jean, let me in.

448
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,519
No, Jean.

449
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,771
Jean!

450
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,874
Don't let it control you.

451
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,635
Charles.

452
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,373
My dear. Come with me.

453
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,098
No.

454
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,769
God!

455
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,974
We live in an age of darkness.

456
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:06,812
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

457
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:11,984
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

458
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,821
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

459
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,825
A world he tried to heal.

460
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,621
A mission he never saw accomplished.

461
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:29,502
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

462
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:34,840
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

463
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,511
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

464
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,515
And when we were alone,
he gave us a family.

465
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:50,815
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

466
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:54,360
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

467
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:58,489
And that's a vision of a world united.

468
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,557
Kitty.

469
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,601
Bobby.

470
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,565
- You OK?
- Yeah.

471
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,739
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

472
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,952
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

473
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,121
Yeah, me too.

474
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:51,417
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

475
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,669
You have Rogue and l have...

476
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,798
You know, I just miss home.

477
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,760
The first snow and all that.

478
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,600
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

479
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,144
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

480
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,938
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

481
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,690
Come on.

482
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,121
This place can be home too.

483
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,330
Thank you for this, Bobby.

484
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,765
You need a lift, kid?

485
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,017
No.

486
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,105
Where are you going?

487
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,192
You don't know what it's like
to be afraid of your powers,

488
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,236
afraid to get close to anybody.

489
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,697
Yeah, l do.

490
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:49,535
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

491
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,122
A hug. A handshake.

492
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,207
A kiss.

493
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,877
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

494
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,048
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

495
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,635
Just be sure it's what you want.

496
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,723
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

497
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,933
To go upstairs and unpack?

498
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:16,270
I'm not your father. l'm your friend.

499
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,400
Just think about what l said, Rogue.

500
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:26,488
Marie.

501
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:10,783
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when l looked at you?

502
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:16,955
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and l dreamt of finding.

503
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,126
And l thought to myself,
"Why would Charles

504
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,922
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

505
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:33,138
I can manipulate the metal in this,

506
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:36,809
but you, you can do anything.

507
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,228
Anything you can think of.

508
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,865
Jean.

509
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:57,538
Enough.

510
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,126
You sound just like him.

511
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,170
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

512
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:09,341
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

513
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,344
As nature intended.

514
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:20,352
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

515
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,981
And that fight begins now.

516
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,284
She shouldn't be here with us.

517
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:39,204
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

518
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,749
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

519
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:48,714
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

520
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,885
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

521
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:58,891
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

522
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,701
So what now? What do we do?

523
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:21,330
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

524
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:27,336
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:33,258
I can't believe this. l can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

526
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,933
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

527
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,437
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

528
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,606
It was, son.

529
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:55,447
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

530
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:59,451
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

531
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,634
Rogue.

532
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,637
Hey, Rogue.

533
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:32,150
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

534
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:49,334
Logan.

535
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,169
- Logan.
- Jean?

536
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,172
Logan. Where am l? Logan.

537
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,174
Logan. Logan.

538
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,594
- Logan.
- Stop.

539
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,054
Logan. Logan. Logan.

540
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,578
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

541
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,540
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

542
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,084
She killed the professor.

543
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,546
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

544
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,884
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

545
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,721
Why can't you just let her go?

546
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,890
Because you love her.

547
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,444
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

548
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,781
So if you're with us, then be with us.

549
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:27,683
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

550
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:34,439
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

551
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,234
I'm looking for someone.

552
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,571
Oh, l get it. Your girlfriend.

553
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:46,952
I figured she'd want the cure.
She's pathetic.

554
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,125
Come on, lceman.

555
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,920
Make a move.

556
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,971
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

557
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,486
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

558
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,490
So long as the cure exists,
our war will rage.

559
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:31,997
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

560
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:36,001
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

561
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,837
Join us or stay out of our way.

562
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:43,008
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

563
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:47,262
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

564
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:53,894
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know l agree, sir.

565
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:58,190
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

566
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:01,860
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

567
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:08,200
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

568
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,536
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

569
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,289
Let's go. Keep it moving.

570
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,043
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

571
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,713
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

572
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:26,009
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

573
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,136
Absolutely no metal.

574
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:53,912
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

575
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:17,389
They wish to cure us.
But l say to you we are the cure.

576
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:25,689
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

577
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,943
They have their weapons.

578
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:33,029
We have ours.

579
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:41,413
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

580
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:49,087
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

581
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,507
We shall go to Alcatraz lsland,

582
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,801
take control of the cure,

583
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,303
and destroy its source.

584
01:06:57,471 --> 01:07:01,141
And then nothing can stop us.

585
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,158
Jean.

586
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:33,840
I know the smell of your adamantium
from a mile away.

587
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,885
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

588
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:41,598
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

589
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:55,153
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

590
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,907
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

591
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,494
And you stood there and let him die?

592
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:06,164
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

593
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,805
OK.

594
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:26,518
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr President.

595
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:32,565
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

596
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:39,197
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

597
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,535
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

598
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,989
Approaching target dead ahead.

599
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,909
Set for 360-degree incursion.

600
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:41,009
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

601
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,765
OK, send them in.

602
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,017
OK.

603
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:53,605
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

604
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:10,788
OK. I give up.

605
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,042
Sorry, Mr Secretary, it was a decoy.

606
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,086
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

607
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:29,515
Worthington Labs. lt ends where it began.

608
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:32,977
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 1 00%.

609
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:36,773
So how are we supposed to get there?
Cos l don't swim.

610
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,567
Leave that to me.

611
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:47,742
Storm. Storm.

612
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,662
What are you doing back here?

613
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,747
I need help.

614
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,667
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

615
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,670
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

616
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,506
-You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go.

617
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,008
They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

618
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:07,595
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

619
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,847
Let's suit up.

620
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,603
Hard to believe this once fit me.

621
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,064
If Magneto gets that cure,
we can't stop him.

622
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:21,192
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

623
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:27,031
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

624
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,035
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

625
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:33,705
I'm not gonna lie to you.

626
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,124
But we lost Scott.

627
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,376
We lost the professor.

628
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:43,381
If we don't fight now, everything
they stood for will die with them.

629
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,384
I'm not gonna let that happen.

630
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,553
Are you?

631
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,764
Then we stand together.

632
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,393
X-Men.

633
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,645
All of us.

634
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:06,529
We're in.

635
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:08,740
Let's go.

636
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,705
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

637
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:22,045
But are you ready to do what
you need to do when the time comes?

638
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,634
Dad, what's going on?

639
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,012
It's an earthquake.

640
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:00,977
We're trapped.

641
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:08,104
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

642
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:25,413
My God.

643
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:53,524
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

644
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:12,877
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

645
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:16,380
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

646
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,983
In chess, the pawns go first.

647
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:41,155
Humans and their guns.

648
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:52,917
Plastic. They've learned.

649
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:01,884
That's why the pawns go first.

650
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:14,271
Target the bridge.

651
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,571
Fire!

652
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:34,250
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

653
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:58,149
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

654
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:04,655
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

655
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:08,617
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

656
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:11,454
Then God help us.

657
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,340
They're coming for him.

658
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,043
Don't ever do that again.

659
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,302
You men cover the doors!

660
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,639
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

661
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:30,157
Traitors to their own cause.

662
01:20:36,414 --> 01:20:38,999
Finish them!

663
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,870
Not yet.

664
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,387
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

665
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,639
With pleasure.

666
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,148
Hold it!

667
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,985
He's going for the boy!

668
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,321
Not if l get there first.

669
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,531
Kitty!

670
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,960
Come on.

671
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:10,007
Grow those back.

672
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:22,770
Don't you know who I am?

673
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:26,357
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

674
01:22:58,223 --> 01:22:59,890
Going somewhere?

675
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,397
You're the guy that invented the cure,
right?

676
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,565
Yes, l am.

677
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,110
Girls.

678
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,570
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

679
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:16,907
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. l didn't do anything.

680
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,243
Calm down. Calm down.

681
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:21,620
Everything's gonna be OK.

682
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:44,393
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

683
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,272
Oh, you get the point.

684
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,483
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

685
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:52,943
No.

686
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:03,871
No, don't worry. l'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

687
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,499
This way.

688
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:12,463
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

689
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,552
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

690
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:24,308
I'm the wrong guy
to play hide-and-seek with.

691
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,810
Who's hiding, dickhead?

692
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,324
Don't. No.

693
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,868
Don't.

694
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:46,830
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

695
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:50,000
Do we look like we need your help?

696
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,199
It's time to end this war.

697
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,963
Take cover.

698
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,258
Get out of the way.

699
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:54,106
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

700
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:55,732
Go! Go! Go!

701
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,116
We work as a team.

702
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:50,412
Best defense is a good offense.

703
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:58,921
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

704
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,603
Go ahead.

705
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:18,315
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

706
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,484
Right.

707
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:12,077
You're in over your head, Bobby.

708
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:15,205
Maybe you should go back to school.

709
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,218
You never should have left.

710
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,722
This is it.

711
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:33,807
Hey.

712
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,893
Make it a strike.

713
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,073
You never learn, do you?

714
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:55,245
Actually, I do.

715
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,844
I'm...

716
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:13,722
One of them?

717
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:27,110
This is what they want for all of us.

718
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:49,925
It's over, Jean.

719
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,596
It's over.

720
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,643
No! Don't shoot!

721
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,324
No!

722
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:34,636
Everybody get out of there!

723
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,355
Bobby!

724
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,534
What have l done?

725
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:12,591
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

726
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:15,135
Go.

727
01:31:18,806 --> 01:32:07,771
Jean!

728
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:10,273
I know you're still there!

729
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,447
You would die for them?

730
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:02,617
No, not for them.

731
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:10,000
For you.

732
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:17,007
Save me.

733
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,093
I love you.

734
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:02,445
You're back.

735
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:11,329
I'm sorry.

736
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,540
I had to.

737
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:17,419
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

738
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:20,964
It's what I want.

739
01:35:33,185 --> 01:35:34,853
Hey.

740
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:38,022
Good to see you, buddy.

741
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:40,817
With the thanks of a grateful nation

742
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:44,154
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

743
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:48,450
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

744
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:51,369
human and mutant alike,

745
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:53,621
Dr Hank McCoy.

746
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,918
Way to go, fur ball.

747
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:49,639
Morning.

748
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:56,812
Hello, Moira.
