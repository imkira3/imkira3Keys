2
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:50,577
Oh, shit.

3
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:12,267
You just got Wolfed.

4
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,041
- What?
- That is an official trademark...

5
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,008
...that I am getting registered.

6
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:20,183
It's a lot of stuff you gotta do,
hoops you gotta jump through.

7
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:21,611
Gotta get on the Internet.

8
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:25,982
Gotta go to some stupid-ass website
where you register a catch phrase.

9
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,522
I wanted "Bam,"
but Emeril had taken it.

10
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,154
I'm rambling, man.
Get up, man. Get up, man.

11
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:37,964
Is the contender ready?

12
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,568
- Ready.
- Is the gladiator ready?

13
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,139
Three, two, one.

14
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:47,201
Things are heating up for the Wolf.

15
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,642
I just opened a Target in Reseda...

16
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:53,043
...and my own brand of BBQ sauce.

17
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:58,886
I'm calling it Wolf's BBQ Sauce,
available in regular and chipotle.

18
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:02,553
You still going?
You still want more of this, man?

19
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,750
I learned that in Oriental land.

20
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,828
Whoa, yeah. U.S. A!

21
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:15,837
They're so small anyway, from steroids.

22
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:40,923
A saber-tooth.

23
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:45,633
Amy Winehouse?

24
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:52,101
Piss off.

25
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:55,278
You don't wanna mess with
a bitch straight out of rehab.

26
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,449
Listen, like the dinosaurs
being destroyed by the Ice Age...

27
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:05,052
...you, too, will soon be extinct.

28
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:06,483
When?

29
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,591
- How much time do we have?
- Bloody hell.

30
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,823
Just calm down.
Do you know you're speaking so fast...

31
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:16,396
...I can't even hear, mate?
You're making my head hurt.

32
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,499
Or maybe that was
the gasoline I drank.

33
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:23,537
Oh, my God, it was good.
Oh, God, I love drinking gasoline.

34
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,004
It's excellent for the vocal cords.

35
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,801
That's my little secret.

36
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:30,309
- You're welcome.
- How much time do we have?

37
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,077
Let me see.

38
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:34,409
Hang on a bit.

39
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:36,943
There we go.

40
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,285
All right, let's have a look-see.

41
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:44,618
Everyone's on Facebook.

42
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:46,796
It says...

43
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:53,970
...that the end of the world
will be August 29th, 28.

44
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:58,532
Oh, God.

45
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,407
Bottoms up.

46
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,384
Sick.

47
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:56,259
Mark my words, leather boy.

48
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,430
Cave dweller.

49
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:01,229
Beaver hunter.

50
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:07,873
Your doom lies with this.

51
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,072
- The crystal skull.
- That's right. Did your nibblies go tight?

52
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:16,775
Yeah, they did. Just went up
inside you, didn't they?

53
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:27,055
Oh, boy.

54
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:36,504
I knew I shouldn't have
taken all those Ambien.

55
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:49,750
Amy. Wake up, baby.
I just had the weirdest dream.

56
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:51,853
Amy.

57
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:53,588
What? What the...?

58
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,157
Flava-Flav! Yeah, boy!

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,658
I've been giving your girl
the flavor of love.

60
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:03,424
She's been sucking
my clock all night long.

61
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,157
Get the hell out of here, Flava!

62
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,300
I'm Flava-Flav!

63
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,574
- What is that about?
- What?

64
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:17,007
You said you didn't
wanna be in a relationship.

65
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:20,508
I know, but Flava?

66
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:23,512
Will...

67
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:27,155
...I wanna take it to the next level.

68
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:33,622
I love you.

69
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,332
I like you too.

70
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:41,667
Oh, man.

71
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,031
Look, you don't understand.

72
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,675
I think the world is coming to an end.

73
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,941
That's a way of saying
you have commitment issues.

74
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:56,340
Unbelievable. Come on, Jojo.

75
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,213
You're taking Jojo?

76
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:02,713
Goodbye, Will.

77
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,321
Are you still coming
to my Sweet 16 party?

78
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:09,364
You're 25.

79
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:12,034
- I never had one.
- Grow up.

80
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:40,426
Yeah.

81
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,966
- Hey.
- Yeah.

82
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,011
Amy, you came.

83
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,737
Come on.

84
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,131
Oh, hey, Will.

85
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:27,571
- Happy Sweet 16.
- Thanks.

86
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:30,704
Take a look at these.

87
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:32,380
Oh, God.

88
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:38,779
Hey, Will. It's your buddy, Dr. Phil.

89
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:45,260
Hey, let me show you
why my frat brothers...

90
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:48,328
...used to call me Dr. Phil-You-Up.

91
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:50,556
Oh, hey, baby.

92
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:58,267
Dyke. Come back here, I like it rough.

93
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:01,908
Hey, Will, where's that
girlfriend of yours, Amy?

94
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,011
Don't let her get away.

95
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:08,240
She's a real quality girl,
a real keeper, like that one.

96
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,146
Hey, come on back here, you whore.

97
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:12,245
Thanks.

98
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,514
Yo!

99
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:19,655
Let's prank his ass. He passed out.

100
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,300
He's sleeping like a baby.

101
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:33,637
We can put his hands in warm water.

102
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:36,339
Or I have a better idea.

103
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:39,276
- Call it.
- Tails.

104
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:43,040
It is tails.

105
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,556
Punch.

106
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,862
What's up, baby?

107
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,406
Those guys are trying
to steal our booze.

108
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,337
- What?
- We gotta get the alcohol...

109
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,706
...so we can get the girls drunk
so we can finally get laid.

110
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:12,244
I am McLover.

111
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:14,712
- Yeah, I know.
- I am McLover.

112
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:18,045
- Stop saying that.
- I am McLover.

113
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,983
God, you are such a douche.

114
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,487
Yeah, fake ID, what?

115
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,892
Just get the booze.

116
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:27,187
Nobody tries to steal my Goldschläger.

117
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,489
Shoot the target.

118
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:35,329
Lisa, how am I supposed to do that?
I don't even have a clear shot.

119
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:47,339
- Curve the bullet.
- Say what?

120
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:51,715
You can control the bullet
to go wherever you want.

121
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,220
Don't tell him what to do. He's my man.

122
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,521
Back off, bitch.
You don't want none of me.

123
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,426
Shit.

124
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:10,932
Get off of me.

125
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,446
Come on, bitch.

126
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,792
Take that, bitch.

127
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:46,433
How do you like that?

128
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:55,116
Pretty little thing.
Oh, look at you laying there.

129
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:58,845
I should kiss you. Give me a kiss, baby.

130
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,635
Left foot, yellow.

131
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,308
Calvin?

132
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,170
Calvin.

133
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:25,347
- Are you gonna curve the bullet or what?
- Hello?

134
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:28,382
Yeah. Yeah, right, right.

135
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:34,614
Let's go back to my hot tub.
You can suck on my...

136
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:39,021
- Damn.
- Sorry, Phil.

137
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,802
Shit. I can... I can do this.

138
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,872
- Shit. Hurry up.
- Dude.

139
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,206
Just curve the bullet.

140
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:00,575
I know you have the power.

141
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,359
Fucking hurry up. Hurry up.

142
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:24,372
Nice shot, asshole.

143
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:35,545
<i>Juney, why won't you
Have an abortion?</i>

144
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,811
<i>You're not exactly part of
The Christian Coalition</i>

145
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:43,355
<i>I could just grab a wire hanger
And do it myself</i>

146
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:48,689
<i>Like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm keeping this baby</i>

147
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:52,026
<i>And, look, stud
You are no George Clooney</i>

148
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:56,864
<i>In fact, I just sold the baby
To the highest bidder on eBay</i>

149
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,905
<i>You're a sarcastic teen
Who talks like she's 30...</i>

150
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:22,292
- Think Amy's coming tonight?
- Man, I don't know.

151
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,523
That's your girlfriend.

152
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:26,292
Actually, we broke up.

153
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:28,834
Oh, you want some new booty.

154
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:30,266
- A little Asian freak.
- No...

155
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,839
<i>A little "One Night in Bangkok,"
a little sake-sake.</i>

156
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:35,977
<i>I saw Memoirs of a Geisha.
I know that shit goes on.</i>

157
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:38,146
I'm in love with her.

158
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:40,440
Then what your dumb ass
break up with her for?

159
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,412
It never would've worked out.

160
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,848
It's better to end it
than to end up hurting her.

161
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:47,750
You know what?
You got commitment issues, dog.

162
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,983
Well, I didn't exactly have
the best example growing up.

163
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:53,593
I never even knew my dad.
He split when I was young.

164
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:57,858
That's your girl right there.

165
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:02,698
Who's that dude she with?

166
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:05,999
She started dating some
Calvin Klein underwear model.

167
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:13,380
Forget about her, man.
I got something that'll cheer you up.

168
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:20,345
Dude, what is up
with the marching band?

169
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:23,354
What better way to celebrate
your super-duper Sweet 16...

170
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,551
...than with a high school musical?

171
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,497
<i>Tonight, tonight
We're gonna get real crunk</i>

172

<i>Tonight, tonight,
A bum's peeing in the punch</i>

173

<i>Hello, my friends
You're all at my party</i>

174
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,647
<i>It's so good to see all of you</i>

175
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:59,885
<i>My ex-girl, Amy
And my main man, Calvin</i>

176
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:03,998
<i>And the priest that molested me too</i>

177
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,897
<i>That reminds me
Of the time I was in college</i>

178
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:10,664
<i>I was experimenting</i>

179
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:16,005
<i>Hooking up with a hot
Foreign-exchange student</i>

180
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:20,114
<i>I think his name was Hop Sing</i>

181

184

It'd be kind of shitty</i>

<i>One, two, three, four</i>

186
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,167
<i>After we split
I took the break-up real hard</i>

187
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:49,538
<i>- I started foolin' around
- Foolin' around</i>

188
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:53,579
<i>I did a black dude
I thought he was Kanye</i>

189
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,479
<i>And the Jonas Brothers all got down</i>

190
00:17:57,686 --> 00:18:01,622
<i>Now that you're split
I'll get her hooked on the reefer</i>

191
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:06,158
<i>Yeah, I'll start pimping her out</i>

192
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:08,830
- Wait, what?
- Hey, hey, now.

193
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:12,496
<i>Snoop Dogg's got nothin' on this playa</i>

194
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:17,570
<i>I'll get the first prize at the Playa's Ball</i>

195
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,670
<i>Hey, hey, man, whoa!</i>

196
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:24,209
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on
We can do it all day long</i>

197
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:27,541
<i>It's the new phenomenon, whoa!</i>

198

<i>Oh, babe</i>

206
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,547
<i>If I sang you a melody</i>

207
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:10,214
<i>Would you toss me
Your panties?</i>

208
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,691
<i>I don't mean to be a boastful man</i>

209
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,926
<i>But I've done groupies

<i>Come to think of it
I've had so much ass</i>

213
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:33,341
<i>All that's left for me is Lance Bass</i>

214
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,685
Look, everyone. It's Jessica Simpson.

Put your pants back on, Dad.

00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:04,107
Go, Romo! Oh, my God.
He's gonna score a basket goal.

219
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:07,043
Wait. What's it called again?
Oh, my gosh, I totally forget.

220
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,376
What is it, a rubdown?

221
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,485
What? A tickle down.

222
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:14,383
Oh, a touchdown.

223
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,114
Frigging jinx.

224
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,685

Take a Xanax, Fabio.

...this Wednesday, 8, 7 Central.

291
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:19,016

00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:20,751
Damn.

293
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:29,233

294
00:25:29,438 --> 00:25:34,876
...were leaked onto MySpace

296
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:39,981

Oh, my God. Hannah Montana

299
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,563
Well, duh. No shit, Sherlock.

300
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:04,227
All I do is wear a wig

...and those dumb kids
can't tell the difference.

00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,404
Then I get twice the pay
and twice the merchandise.

00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:24,647
Holy shit!

319
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:27,117
- It's coming this way.
- What should we do?

320
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:30,257
- Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
- Let's go!

321
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:35,121
This way. Over here.
Come on. Come on.

322
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:36,688
Go, go, go.

323
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:47,498
- What are we gonna do now?
- Baby, I don't know.

324
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:48,971
Look, we'll just...

325
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:51,805
We'll wait out the storm here
until it passes by.

326
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,373
Hey.

327
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:02,824
This is our hiding place.

328
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:06,152
Get lost. Right, Carrie?

329
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,053
Hello, lover.

330
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,426
Unless you wanna fight.

331
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,695
Look, we don't want any trouble.

332
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:24,539
I never back down.

333
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:29,615
- Get some.
- As you can see, I already did.

334
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:37,084
<i>And so I thought: Could a simple
New York City gal like me...</i>

335
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:41,058
<i>... really beat the shit
out of a pregnant teenager? I wonder.</i>

336
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:45,757
<i>Like Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV,
I must break you.</i>

337
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,633
- Yes!
- Yeah!

338
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:17,929
I'm lactating. Moo.

339
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,099
Got milk?

340
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:32,173
Oh, God.

341
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:40,248
- Is that your feet?
- Yeah.

342
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:43,015
And this is my baby's foot.

343
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:47,024
Smell it.

344
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:50,088
And taste it.

345
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,858
Suck on my placenta.

346
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:59,736
- Yeah!
- Oh, Carrie.

347
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:01,932
Carrie, darling, are you all right?

348
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:04,805
Come on, ladies.
Let's get out of here now.

349
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:12,786
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

350
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:15,513
Wake up and smell the Prius.

351
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:19,626
I know it's an inconvenient truth,
but it's called global warming.

352
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:22,661
No. No, it's not global warming.

353
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:26,360
Amy Winehouse
came to me in my dreams...

354
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:28,399
...after I fought an American Gladiator.

355
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,361
I think it has something to do
with the crystal skull...

356
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:35,471
Come on. Crackhead Winehouse?
Crystal skull?

357
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:36,974
You sound like a crazy man.

358
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:40,705
Look, it's getting late. Let's just stay
here tonight and wait out the storm.

359
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:42,480
I'm freezing.

360
00:30:43,018 --> 00:30:44,417
We gotta take off our clothes.

361
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:50,117
- What?
- Our bodies will keep each other warm.

362
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:53,192
Otherwise, we're not gonna make it
through the night.

363
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,493
Yeah. Yeah.

364
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:58,422
He's right. Come on.

365
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:09,668
I think my water's gonna break.

366
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:11,401
Water?

367
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,811
What the...?

368
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,578
Sorry.

369
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,789
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker.

370
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:28,519
- I'm a jumper.
- A what?

371
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,459
I can teleport through time and space.

372
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:02,162
I hope we stay together forever.

373
00:32:02,364 --> 00:32:03,558
I love you.

374
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,332
Later.

375
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:14,772
I am Prince Caspian,
here to save Narnia.

376
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:19,437
Little help?

377
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:22,743
You guys?

378
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:28,923
<i>It's the guy who ruined Star Wars.</i>

379
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:37,464
- What?
- Will, we saw your dream.

380
00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:42,733
- Oh, man.
- Man, you messed shit up with Amy.

381
00:32:42,937 --> 00:32:45,531
You're lucky a girl like that
would even talk to you.

382
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,834
She's hot, sexy. She got a job.

383
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,702
- Man, that girl out your league.
- She's not out of my league.

384
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:55,678
Shit, she gotta put up
with your stank breath.

385
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:59,718
Not to mention your
abnormally high plumber's crack.

386
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:06,223
Man, put your shirt down.

387
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:09,454
All right. You're right, you're right.
I messed up with Amy.

388
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,530
I never should've let her go.

389
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,666
Jesus Christ. That was a rump shaker.

390
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:23,207
Okay, here's the plan.
We gotta get the hell up out this city.

391
00:33:23,411 --> 00:33:25,003
What you say?

392
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:29,012
What the hell y'all doing leaving me?

393
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,714
Keep it moving, people. Nothing to see.

394
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:38,055
All the disasters have been contained.
The city is secure.

395
00:33:44,432 --> 00:33:45,421
Shit.

396
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:47,924
Sick.

397
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:53,697
Like I said, keep moving.
It's under control.

398
00:33:58,713 --> 00:33:59,702
I'm out of here.

399
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:09,323
- What was that?
- That was a head. That was a head.

400
00:34:09,524 --> 00:34:12,015
- Hello?
- Whose head?

401
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:13,524
<i>- Hello?
- Will, it's me.</i>

402
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,525
Amy, where are you?

403
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,790
I'm at work at the museum.
I was worried about the artifacts.

404
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,935
- Are you okay?
- I'm scared.

405
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:24,528
It's gonna be all right, I promise. Listen.

406
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:27,503
There is something
that I need to tell you...

407
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,973
...and I should've told you long before.
I was an idiot.

408
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:35,139
I love you.

409
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:39,950
<i>Oh, baby, I love you too.</i>

410
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,890
What do...? What do you say?
Do you still love me?

411
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:48,824
<i>Yes, yes, of course, yes.</i>

412
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:50,520
<i>Say something.</i>

413
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,158
Say something, you stuck-up bitch.

414
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,966
Asshole.

415
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:02,400
Hello? Hello, Amy?

416
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,938
Shit.

417
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:09,179
Oh, what the...?

418
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:11,851
- We gotta go back.
- Say what?

419
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:13,850
Amy's in trouble.
I'm going back for her.

420
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:16,148
I let her go before.
I'm not losing her again.

421
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:19,554
Man, you crazy. There's all kinds
of shit breaking out in the city.

422
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:22,252
We don't leave right now,
we're gonna die.

423
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:24,124
It's something I gotta do.

424
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,424
You guys keep going.

425
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:30,996
No, I'm your boy, man.
I'm gonna roll with you.

426
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:33,606
Yeah, I mean, I'm already knocked up...

427
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:37,972
...so, what other shenanigans
can I really get into?

428
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,706
<i>I mean, I'm more bloated
than Vince Vaughn in The Break-Up...</i>

429
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,350
<i>...or Vince Vaughn in Fred Claus...</i>

430
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,821
...or I guess Vince Vaughn in general.

431
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:50,718
- So let's go.
- Yeah, please.

432
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:54,685
Lisa, come on.

433
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:56,989
- No, guys.
- Come on, baby.

434
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,166
I really have a bad feeling about this.

435
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,695
Lisa!

436
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,465
They killed Lisa!

437
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:08,801
- Lisa!
- Come on, come on.

438
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,104
- They killed Lisa! You bastards!
- Come on, come on. We gotta go.

439
00:36:12,313 --> 00:36:13,837
Come on.

440
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:24,357
I'm really sorry about your girlfriend,
home skillet.

441
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,357
<i>Lo ciento about your main squeeze,
kemosabe.</i>

442
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:33,398
I'd offer you my sexual favors, but
I've got a lot of mucus discharge lately.

443
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:34,863
Lisa was a great girl.

444
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,104
Lisa who?

445
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:48,845
Oh, where am I?

446
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:51,717
Oh, what an enchanting place.

447
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:56,681
It smells like meat and stress.

448
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,419
Wonderful.

449
00:37:02,297 --> 00:37:03,764
What magical creature are you?

450
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:11,838
<i>My dear prince</i>

451
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:20,414
<i>You have rescued me
You've caught me in your arms</i>

452
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:25,882
<i>Actually, you landed on my balls</i>

453
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:27,418
Let me guess.

454
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:31,615
An evil witch banished you
from your fairy-tale kingdom?

455
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:36,096
No, my silly, pasty, quirky teen.

456
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:39,789
Actually, I'm just a demented
homeless chick who lives in the sewers.

457
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:42,596
- How'd you end up there?
- Drugs.

458
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:46,103
Lots and lots and lots...

459
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:50,937
...of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!

460
00:37:53,414 --> 00:37:55,439
I don't judge.

461
00:37:58,152 --> 00:37:59,710
It's dangerous out there.

462
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,754
You might wanna come with us
if you wanna live.

463
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,390
- Okay.
- All right.

464
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:07,527
- Goodbye. Oh, I'm going with you.
- Yes, you are.

465
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:10,596
The Natural History Museum
is just uptown. Let's go.

466
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,439
<i>Dreams and fairy tales
My true love</i>

467
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:25,978
<i>Talking squirrels and magic and stuff</i>

468
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:29,515
No, princess, wait.
Where are you going?

469
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:32,151
And who's that Moorish ruffian?

470
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,651
I'm her new boyfriend. What it do?

471
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,318
Very funny, dark peasant.
I'm Prince Edwin.

472
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:43,728
- Princess, he your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

473
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:49,134
But that's all right.
I could have a pimp and a boyfriend.

474
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:51,231
Oh, what to do?

475
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:58,203
Whichever prince can vanquish
the other shall win my hand.

476
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:06,411
You ready to step up?

477
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:09,948
<i>Wait. You mean like
the first Step Up movie...</i>

478
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:12,854
...where the street-dancer dude
went to the dance academy?

479
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,119
<i>No, I was thinking
more like Step Up 2...</i>

480
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:18,230
...when the tough street-dancing chick
went to dancing academy.

481
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,191
I feel you.

482
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:24,235
He ain't ready for me. Juney, Will,
I'm about to break him down, baby.

483
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:26,771
You want some? Well, here you go.

484
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:38,113
Oh, a hoedown?

485
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:41,444
It's crazy-shirt man.

486
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:48,754
Oh, no, no, no.

487
00:39:53,968 --> 00:39:55,367
It's just my sleeve.

488
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,595
Oh, come on.

489
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:00,371
He's double-jointed.
Who cares about that?

490
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,368
There must be a mirror somewhere.

491
00:40:07,048 --> 00:40:08,913
Make some room. Make some room.

492
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,378
Make some room.

493
00:40:10,585 --> 00:40:13,076
- Come on, chubby.
- Okay.

494
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:16,657
What? What? What?

495
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:19,752
Oh, damn, that ho is all on point.

496
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:33,435
That bitch better work.
She is off the chizzain.

497
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:34,767
I think she's crowning.

498
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,408
I want to dance.

499
00:40:39,614 --> 00:40:42,981
I'm not sure I can though. I'm not sure.

500
00:40:43,184 --> 00:40:46,153
L... Don't pressure me!

501
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:49,582
I'm ready.

502
00:40:50,124 --> 00:40:52,524
Oh, look out. Look at her coming in.

503
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:55,321
Oh, yeah.

504
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:39,132
I'm out of here.

505
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,068
Bye.

506
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:43,709
She's all yours, bro.

507
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:45,643
It's a twister!

508
00:41:45,846 --> 00:41:48,041
Run! Run!

509
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:57,750
Is there anyone that can save us?

510
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,859
We need a hero.

511
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:09,697
I am Iron Man.

512
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:15,366
Oh, man! That twister shat out a cow.

513
00:42:16,844 --> 00:42:18,209
Shit. That's so messed up.

514
00:42:22,149 --> 00:42:24,583
Now you're pissing me off.

515
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,946
I'm the only badass around here.

516
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:34,121
Oh, damn!

517
00:42:34,328 --> 00:42:36,023
Another cow?

518
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,237
What was that?

519
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:45,803
It's not nice.

520
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:48,407
Look at me. Look at this.

521
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:50,201
It's a lobster claw.

522
00:42:50,411 --> 00:42:51,400
Whatever.

523
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:55,207
Look, I'm carrying a lot of baggage.
I didn't need that, man.

524
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:03,523
Don't make me angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

525
00:43:03,991 --> 00:43:07,791
There's aspects of my personality
that I can't control.

526
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,546
At least he didn't get hit with a cow.

527
00:43:30,284 --> 00:43:33,151
- Man!
- Hey, Casanova, forget Amy.

528
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:35,254
We're never gonna make it
to the museum.

529
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:36,787
I know she's still alive.

530
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:39,255
<i>Hello? Jojo?</i>

531
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,020
Jojo? No, no, it's me.

532
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:44,493
Will. Will, I'm trapped.

533
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:48,294
<i>An Egyptian statue fell on me
during the earthquake.</i>

534
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:50,663
<i>Stay calm, Amy. Just stay calm.</i>

535
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:53,704
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

536
00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:56,604
All right, Amy, listen to me. Don't panic.

537
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,344
I will be there, I promise.

538
00:44:04,885 --> 00:44:07,115
Amy? Amy?

539
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,551
Guys, I'm going back for her.

540
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:18,331
You can't save her if you're dead!
Come on, let's go!

541
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:20,363
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Go, go.

542
00:44:20,568 --> 00:44:21,660
Goodbye.

543
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:23,063
- Amy. No!
- Will, let's go.

544
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,965
- No! Damn it!
- You got to!

545
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:35,779
I know you think I'm crazy...

546
00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:38,850
...but these disasters have to do
with the crystal skull.

547
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:42,511
- It's like TMTH.
- TM what?

548
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,850
Too much to handle.

549
00:44:45,259 --> 00:44:46,851
Bitch, why you don't just say that?

550
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:49,723
Why everything a goddamn acronym
with you?

551
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,922
Chilly Willy out, LL Not Cool J.

552
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:57,002
Oh, do stop all of this quarreling.
Honestly.

553
00:44:57,204 --> 00:44:59,764
Now, who's hungry?

554
00:45:08,249 --> 00:45:09,614
Delicious.

555
00:45:10,451 --> 00:45:12,214
Whatever.

556
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:14,747
Would you like some?

557
00:45:15,222 --> 00:45:16,246
No.

558
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,954
What?

559
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:28,263
<i>Y'all, that's my Get Smart phone.
Just give me a minute.</i>

560
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:39,436
You got poop.

561
00:45:39,947 --> 00:45:40,936
Just a smidge.

562
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,952
Did I get it? Did I get it all?

563
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,422
What y'all looking at me like that for?

564
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,149
You got... Yeah.

565
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:54,750
Is it right there?

566
00:45:55,596 --> 00:45:58,087
- It's fine.
- Just go:

567
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:00,831
Just... I get it all the time, all over.

568
00:46:05,606 --> 00:46:07,233
What it do?

569
00:46:10,244 --> 00:46:13,736
Hey, y'all, it's Lisa's mom.

570
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:16,772
I gotta tell her what happened
to her daughter.

571
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:23,450
Hi, Miss Heller.

572
00:46:27,928 --> 00:46:29,418
Lisa...

573
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,522
Lisa dead.

574
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:35,366
But booyah!

575
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,806
I met this fine, hot
enchanted-princess chick...

576
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:43,499
...willing to do anything
and everything I want.

577
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,838
You gotta talk to her. Talk to her.

578
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,574
Hello? Oh, yes, he's right.
I will do anything. Truly.

579
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:54,083
I'm not referred to on the street
as the Cavernous Princess for nothing.

580
00:46:54,288 --> 00:46:57,348
A nomenclature well-deserved,
most assuredly.

581
00:46:57,558 --> 00:46:59,958
If you've got 5 bucks or some meth,
I'll show you.

582
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,458
One time I hooked up
with a 1 -year-old wizard.

583
00:47:02,663 --> 00:47:06,292
His penis kept reappearing
in all sorts of different places.

584
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,990
Never again.

585
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:11,365
You're so cool.
We should totally hang out.

586
00:47:11,572 --> 00:47:13,369
<i>She's awesome.</i>

587
00:47:13,574 --> 00:47:15,735
Look, we gotta get to Amy
at the Natural History Museum.

588
00:47:20,114 --> 00:47:21,138
Oh, my.

589
00:47:21,582 --> 00:47:24,483
- Oh, no.
- I can't see anything.

590
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:28,620
- Neither can I.
- Somebody is totally feeling me up.

591
00:47:28,822 --> 00:47:31,052
- Calvin.
- I didn't do it.

592
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:36,727
They're so perky.
They're filled with milk.

593
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:41,201
What the hell was that?

594
00:48:27,214 --> 00:48:30,945
Wonderful.
What adorable woodland creatures.

595
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:34,643
I'm not merry, really. That didn't...
I mean, that didn't make me merry.

596
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:37,881
I don't feel merry, I guess.

597
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:15,359
Man, them guys are all right.

598
00:49:15,963 --> 00:49:17,590
That's cute. That's cute.

599
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:56,494
Okay, you guys are not
Alvin and the Chipmunks, are you?

600
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:00,471
I think that one's got rabies.

601
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:07,107
Where you going, punk-ass?

602
00:50:10,284 --> 00:50:12,548
Alvin!

603
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:20,154
Get him off!

604
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,328
Chipmunks love nuts.

605
00:50:27,634 --> 00:50:31,001
Get him off! What the hell?
I thought you was my friend!

606
00:50:31,672 --> 00:50:32,661
Salty.

607
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:41,437
You're hitting the wrong thing! You...!

608
00:50:48,055 --> 00:50:52,185
I feel left out.
No one's biting my flesh. Pooh.

609
00:50:56,497 --> 00:50:58,362
Is that the best you got, pussy?

610
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:03,428
You are such a girl.

611
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:20,714
Redrum!

612
00:51:30,597 --> 00:51:32,394
Where'd he go?

613
00:51:40,874 --> 00:51:42,000
Yeah!

614
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:47,242
Don't bite me. Get lost!

615
00:51:56,123 --> 00:51:58,284
Oh, boy, tasty vertebrae.

616
00:51:59,293 --> 00:52:00,521
- Juney.
- Let her go.

617
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:02,592
Let her go, man.
Ain't nothing we can do.

618
00:52:02,796 --> 00:52:04,161
But she's still alive.

619
00:52:04,364 --> 00:52:05,729
They're munching me harder...

620
00:52:05,933 --> 00:52:10,131
<i>...than Rachael Ray chowing down
eggs Benedict on $40 a Day.</i>

621
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:11,361
Yeah.

622
00:52:11,572 --> 00:52:15,941
Even when the bitch is dying,
she don't shut up with her witty repartee.

623
00:52:16,143 --> 00:52:19,840
Hey, BFFs, what's the 411 on the 911?

624
00:52:20,047 --> 00:52:22,345
Oh, she is rather annoying.

625
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:26,542
WTH? I'm so not ROTFLOL'ing...

626
00:52:26,753 --> 00:52:31,850
...but please KIT, before I get 187'd.

627
00:52:33,126 --> 00:52:35,026
Blog you later.

628
00:52:36,163 --> 00:52:38,028
- Finally.
- Finally.

629
00:52:38,765 --> 00:52:41,495
That was just the amuse bouche.
Now the main course.

630
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,205
- Come back here, you bitches.
- Bitches!

631
00:52:48,408 --> 00:52:50,467
I'll get you in your grill.

632
00:52:50,677 --> 00:52:52,201
Pussies.

633
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:53,470
Die!

634
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,081
Can't breathe. Need air.

635
00:52:59,086 --> 00:53:00,644
Shitheads!

636
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:09,988
Is everybody okay?

637
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:11,892
Yeah, I'm okay.

638
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:15,660
Hey, baby, your knees
are all skinned up.

639
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,030
Oh, yes, but that's not
from the chipmunks.

640
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,772
But I do have this terrible headache.

641
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:26,912
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

642
00:53:27,114 --> 00:53:29,548
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

643
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,218
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

644
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:34,546
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

645
00:53:34,755 --> 00:53:36,518
I just... I just did.

646
00:53:36,723 --> 00:53:38,190
<i>I said, Head On, bitch.</i>

647
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:40,360
<i>- Apply directly to the forehead.
- Whatever.</i>

648
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,050
<i>Don't cop an attitude, slut.</i>

649
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:45,823
<i>I said, apply Head On directly
to your goddamn forehead.</i>

650
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:48,900
Okay, okay. Happy?

651
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:51,127
<i>Look, you little white-trash
piece of shit...</i>

652
00:53:51,338 --> 00:53:52,498
<i>... Head On, motherfucker.</i>

653
00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:55,436
<i>Apply directly to your
motherfucking forehead.</i>

654
00:53:55,642 --> 00:53:58,736
Okay? There. It's all over.

655
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:03,541
Head on, face on, nose on, eyes on.

656
00:54:05,652 --> 00:54:07,381
Oh, that's great.

657
00:54:07,587 --> 00:54:08,952
My headache is gone...

658
00:54:09,156 --> 00:54:12,250
...but I still have that dreadful
yeast infection.

659
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:14,992
Sourdough anyone?

660
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:18,560
- I could've did without that.
- Let's get to the museum.

661
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,331
- Let's go!
- Move it!

662
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:27,507
Out of the way!

663
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,574
Excuse me, sir.

664
00:54:37,784 --> 00:54:39,809
What's going on?
Where's everybody going?

665
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,148
It's a mass evacuation. Everyone
has to leave the city right now.

666
00:54:43,357 --> 00:54:45,120
Hold up, hold up.
You leaving, Batman?

667
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:49,159
Shit. Yes. Yeah, I'm leaving. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

668
00:54:49,363 --> 00:54:51,456
Not on my schedule today.
Not on my to-do list.

669
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:54,998
It wasn't, "Wake up, make breakfast, jog,
science experiment, die."

670
00:54:55,202 --> 00:54:59,195
Not on it. Not on it. Okay?
Are we done?

671
00:54:59,406 --> 00:55:00,771
All right.

672
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:04,274
Anyone who stays in town
is gonna be buried in rubble.

673
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:05,604
I hate rubble.

674
00:55:05,812 --> 00:55:09,475
I've gotta get to the Natural History
Museum, to my girl, Amy. She's trapped.

675
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:13,119
If you go back after your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

676
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,614
I'll take those odds.

677
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:21,325
- She must be some piece of pussy.
- She is, sir. She is.

678
00:55:22,829 --> 00:55:26,128
Look, the evacuation bus
is leaving city hall at 21 hours.

679
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:29,097
Twenty-one hundred?
Hold on, what is...? That's...

680
00:55:29,302 --> 00:55:31,463
- Five, carry the six...
- Nine p.m.

681
00:55:31,671 --> 00:55:34,333
I'm gonna save you your crazy math.
It's 9 p.m.

682
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,839
You start at noon, then nine hours later.

683
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:40,342
That's 9. That's the time you need
to get on those evacuation buses...

684
00:55:40,547 --> 00:55:42,037
...or you're dead.

685
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:43,716
Dead?

686
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:47,212
Come on, it's already 5:3.

687
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:50,353
Say again, 5:3? Oh, Jesus.

688
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:53,082
Oh, God. I wasted the whole day.

689
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:56,558
I was... I was on Amazon
looking for stuff.

690
00:55:56,763 --> 00:56:00,096
Shit. Why? Why would I
go Christmas shopping today?

691
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:04,601
Why would I pick today?
Son of a bitch. Okay, plan B.

692
00:56:09,443 --> 00:56:10,774
- Hi.
- Hi.

693
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:12,001
I'm Batman.

694
00:56:12,212 --> 00:56:14,009
I'm Enchanted Princess.

695
00:56:14,214 --> 00:56:16,808
True story: I had a woman one time...

696
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:21,283
...tell me I was in the top four
best lovers she's ever had.

697
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:22,887
That's a true story.

698
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,716
And she had been around the block.

699
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,356
Would you want to watch me
play with myself?

700
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:33,988
Goodbye.

701
00:56:45,579 --> 00:56:47,069
Come on, let's go.

702
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:51,580
Break yourself, fool.

703
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:54,879
You best be getting out of that Mach 5
or I'll toe-tag your ass.

704
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,125
You know, they say that the first kill...

705
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,130
...is supposed to be quite difficult.

706
00:57:08,335 --> 00:57:11,998
But I find it easy. In fact, rather fun.

707
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:15,771
Take it. Do it.

708
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:23,043
Look, Ma, no eyes.

709
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,774
I didn't have a mother!

710
00:57:28,522 --> 00:57:31,491
That was better than sex with a camel.

711
00:57:42,936 --> 00:57:45,962
What? We're just playing
with my monkey.

712
00:57:50,577 --> 00:57:52,135
Let's roll.

713
00:57:55,649 --> 00:57:56,775
Oh, my!

714
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:10,018
Come on!

715
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:13,696
Run.

716
00:58:15,402 --> 00:58:17,199
We gotta keep going.

717
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:21,705
These glass slippers
are awfully hard to run in.

718
00:58:29,883 --> 00:58:31,544
Help. Help.

719
00:58:32,352 --> 00:58:33,649
Amy.

720
00:58:35,755 --> 00:58:38,019
- You came back for me.
- I love you, Amy.

721
00:58:38,692 --> 00:58:41,593
I know. I love you too.

722
00:58:43,263 --> 00:58:45,561
Now get this freaking spear
out of my shoulder.

723
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:46,754
Yeah.

724
00:58:47,701 --> 00:58:49,032
- Okay.
- It hurts.

725
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,395
Okay. All right.

726
00:58:50,604 --> 00:58:52,595
She's pinned through to the floor, guys.

727
00:58:52,806 --> 00:58:55,570
This isn't gonna be easy.
Calvin, I'm gonna need your help.

728
00:58:55,775 --> 00:58:57,402
Right.

729
00:59:02,048 --> 00:59:04,983
- What was that for?
- I was trying to knock her unconscious...

730
00:59:05,185 --> 00:59:06,550
...so she wouldn't feel pain.

731
00:59:07,821 --> 00:59:09,448
Good thinking.

732
00:59:10,056 --> 00:59:13,423
- Baby, this is for your own good.
- Okay.

733
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,100
Man, you hit like a pussy. Let me try.

734
00:59:32,746 --> 00:59:34,407
Man, this girl can take a hit.

735
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,219
Why?

736
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,160
It's not working.
Let's just pull it out of her.

737
00:59:50,864 --> 00:59:51,853
On the count of three.

738
00:59:52,065 --> 00:59:54,499
One, two, three.

739
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:56,134
Good job.

740
01:00:07,981 --> 01:00:10,575
We gotta get out of here.
This place is gonna collapse.

741
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:16,612
No. Not until we return this...

742
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,114
...back to the altar.

743
01:00:19,626 --> 01:00:21,355
A magic bong.

744
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:24,394
The crystal skull.
The one from my dreams.

745
01:00:24,597 --> 01:00:29,000
Now, legend has it that if the
crystal skull is missing from the altar...

746
01:00:29,202 --> 01:00:31,363
...it's the end of the world.
Earthquakes...

747
01:00:31,571 --> 01:00:34,096
...asteroids, return of the Spice Girls.

748
01:00:34,307 --> 01:00:35,433
Yes!

749
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:38,032
The apocalypse.

750
01:00:38,244 --> 01:00:40,769
And you know this shit
because you're the docent?

751
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,642
<i>I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom
of the Crystal Skull.</i>

752
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,442
Do you know what this means?

753
01:00:45,652 --> 01:00:48,519
Me dreaming about the skull,
and you knowing about the skull?

754
01:00:48,722 --> 01:00:52,317
- That we were destined to be together?
- No, that we both really love skulls.

755
01:00:53,426 --> 01:00:55,121
But that too.

756
01:00:56,763 --> 01:00:59,288
Will, we gotta get out of here.
It's almost 9:

757
01:00:59,499 --> 01:01:02,696
If we don't make it to them
evacuation buses, we're gonna die.

758
01:01:05,004 --> 01:01:06,403
Go, Calvin.

759
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:09,632
I'm staying here with Amy.
We're returning the skull to the altar.

760
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:13,239
- See you.
- Nice meeting you.

761
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,873
Let's find that altar.

762
01:01:43,877 --> 01:01:44,866
What's happening?

763
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:48,343
Everything in the museum
is coming to life.

764
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,577
Hell, no!

765
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,048
Bully! Bully!

766
01:01:56,623 --> 01:01:57,783
Yes!

767
01:02:01,694 --> 01:02:04,424
- Let's get the hell up out of here.
- Drugs are great.

768
01:02:09,002 --> 01:02:11,971
- The altar to the crystal skull is this way.
- Okay.

769
01:02:18,144 --> 01:02:19,907
I am Beowulf.

770
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:25,811
Hello.

771
01:02:28,488 --> 01:02:29,750
What?

772
01:02:31,024 --> 01:02:32,286
I am Beowulf.

773
01:02:34,027 --> 01:02:36,427
- Can you put some clothes on?
- I am Beowulf.

774
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:40,463
I fought the monster Grendel with
no armor, and that is how I'll fight you.

775
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:42,834
Wait. You fight naked?

776
01:02:45,905 --> 01:02:46,894
I am Beowulf.

777
01:02:47,106 --> 01:02:48,300
That's kind of gay, bro.

778
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,776
It's not... It's not gay. It's...

779
01:02:50,977 --> 01:02:52,911
No, I'm sorry. That's gay.

780
01:02:53,112 --> 01:02:54,943
It's not gay. It's not.

781
01:02:55,148 --> 01:02:58,777
It's how we do it in 57, dick.

782
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:01,852
- Ask anybody.
- All right, I will. I'll ask my friend Paul.

783
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:05,183
We're boating tomorrow.
I'll ask him when we're out in the seas.

784
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:09,158
- Paul?
- My friend Paul, who is my partner.

785
01:03:10,697 --> 01:03:13,188
He's my friend. We're also partners.

786
01:03:14,234 --> 01:03:16,964
- Life partner?
- No, business partners.

787
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,003
We opened an antique shop together.

788
01:03:20,206 --> 01:03:21,969
- That's gay.
- Why is that gay?

789
01:03:22,175 --> 01:03:25,542
Why are antiques gay? Because
I like old things that are kitschy?

790
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,509
I'm Beowulf!

791
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:33,282
Excuse me, are you ready
to get your ass kicked?

792
01:03:39,626 --> 01:03:43,494
Oh, hell, no, Kung Fu Panda.

793
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:46,688
You shouldn't have done that.

794
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:55,333
Get ready to feel the thunder.

795
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,601
Your girl looks familiar, man.

796
01:04:25,805 --> 01:04:30,504
Last year, I paid her 2 bucks
for 2 minutes, if you know what I mean.

797
01:04:30,843 --> 01:04:33,403
It's true. And a curious factoid:

798
01:04:33,613 --> 01:04:36,844
Pandas actually have
three descending testicles.

799
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:40,209
That's it.

800
01:05:33,072 --> 01:05:34,437
Oh, shit.

801
01:05:42,382 --> 01:05:44,509
Oh, wonderful job.

802
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:52,451
<i>My dear prince
You have defended my honor</i>

803
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:55,054
Kiss me, baby.

804
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:21,386
- You a dude?
- I'm a trannie. I thought you knew.

805
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:24,055
No.

806
01:06:35,068 --> 01:06:36,296
Get him, Will.

807
01:06:37,103 --> 01:06:39,571
- I am Beowulf.
- Yeah, I know already.

808
01:06:39,772 --> 01:06:42,332
Surrender so we can go get brunch.

809
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:45,807
<i>And I got us tickets to Jersey Boys.</i>

810
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:47,569
No.

811
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:00,919
We can go to my place.

812
01:07:01,127 --> 01:07:04,961
<i>I TiVo'd Dancing with the Stars,
results show.</i>

813
01:07:05,164 --> 01:07:07,029
- No!
- Beowulf!

814
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:11,597
I wanna take you
on Rosie O'Donnell's cruise.

815
01:07:11,804 --> 01:07:15,262
Just me, you,
and my dear friend George Takei.

816
01:07:15,775 --> 01:07:17,265
Screw this.

817
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,008
I'm Beowulf!

818
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,010
Beowulf out.

819
01:07:27,687 --> 01:07:29,245
Hurry, we're running out of time.

820
01:08:01,354 --> 01:08:02,946
Indiana Jones?

821
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:07,324
Indiana, my ass.

822
01:08:09,061 --> 01:08:10,289
I'll take it from here.

823
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:20,238
Thanks, son.
That's right, I'm your father.

824
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:25,344
- You're my dad?
- Your mom got around.

825
01:08:25,545 --> 01:08:28,412
- A real slut, actually.
- Right, I get it.

826
01:08:28,614 --> 01:08:30,104
She did this special thing...

827
01:08:30,316 --> 01:08:34,343
...with her big toe and candle wax...
- Okay.

828
01:08:34,554 --> 01:08:36,647
I'm sorry I walked out
on you and your mother.

829
01:08:36,856 --> 01:08:38,756
But I got an adventurous spirit...

830
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:41,654
...and a hot-ass whore
in every major city.

831
01:08:43,296 --> 01:08:44,820
What do we have here?

832
01:08:45,031 --> 01:08:46,498
Is this your girl?

833
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:49,930
- Yeah.
- What a nice young lady.

834
01:08:50,136 --> 01:08:51,933
And you got some shape on you.

835
01:08:52,138 --> 01:08:54,470
Yeah, baby. You're so nice.

836
01:08:54,674 --> 01:08:57,973
- And you got some ass on you.
- Dad.

837
01:08:58,177 --> 01:09:00,338
- Oh, so beautiful.
- Dad.

838
01:09:00,546 --> 01:09:04,448
If a nice ass meant a hamburger,
baby, you'd have a Whopper.

839
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:06,049
- Oh, shit.
- Dad.

840
01:09:06,252 --> 01:09:09,983
Do you do Pilates?
I'm just asking. Just asking.

841
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:16,360
Don't do what your old man did.
Settle down.

842
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,795
Hell, I got gonorrhea so many times...

843
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,058
...my johnson looked like a melted
Baby Ruth.

844
01:09:23,536 --> 01:09:27,131
Hell, in the '7s, my nickname was
Chlamydia Jones.

845
01:09:28,507 --> 01:09:32,671
There is no cure for herpes,
and I bullshit you not.

846
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,208
Thanks, Dad.

847
01:09:57,536 --> 01:10:00,369
- This looks easy.
- Not as easy as it used to be.

848
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,942
Oh, shit, my hip.

849
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:15,076
- You know I gotta get my hustle on.
- Bye, Dad.

850
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:18,650
I'm gonna make it.

851
01:10:18,858 --> 01:10:20,450
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

852
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,922
Oh, shit!

853
01:10:25,031 --> 01:10:27,864
That hurts. Oh, shit!

854
01:10:55,194 --> 01:11:00,325
Why don't you just walk to the altar?
It's like 1 feet away.

855
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:03,165
Silly girl.

856
01:11:10,509 --> 01:11:13,603
No, don't cry. I'll be fine.

857
01:12:00,459 --> 01:12:02,120
I am the Guru Shitka.

858
01:12:02,328 --> 01:12:05,957
And we are here today
to bring together Amy and Will...

859
01:12:06,165 --> 01:12:09,100
...in a union of peace and happiness.

860
01:12:09,301 --> 01:12:15,137
And to point out, gee,
Amy, you are totally hot. TM.

861
01:12:17,176 --> 01:12:18,734
Amy, do you take Will...

862
01:12:18,944 --> 01:12:22,641
...to be your peanut butter and jelly
that goes into your love belly?

863
01:12:22,848 --> 01:12:23,872
I do.

864
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:28,486
And, Will, do you take Amy
to be your doughnut of love...

865
01:12:28,687 --> 01:12:31,679
...that you'll fill with cream every day?

866
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:32,880
I do.

867
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,394
Well, in that case, give her a pound.

868
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:42,425
Lock it down.

869
01:12:42,802 --> 01:12:44,667
Break the pickle.

870
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,230
Now, tickle my pickle.

871
01:12:55,514 --> 01:12:56,503
I love you, Will.

872
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:58,774
I love you too, Amy.

873
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:01,518
But there's something I should tell you.

874
01:13:02,621 --> 01:13:03,610
What is it?

875
01:13:16,402 --> 01:13:17,630
<i>I'm fucking Matt Damon</i>

876
01:13:18,304 --> 01:13:20,636
You're fucking Matt Damon?

877
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,364
<i>Well, I'm fucking Hannah Montana</i>

878
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:23,974
<i>She's fucking Hannah Montana</i>

879
01:13:24,176 --> 01:13:27,771
<i>Backstage at my concert
Fucks me on my parents' bed</i>

880
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:31,040
<i>After school, at my locker,
In the car I give her head</i>

881
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,774
<i>I'm also fucking the Flava</i>

882
01:13:32,985 --> 01:13:35,453
<i>Yeah, boy
She's fucking Flava-Flav, fool</i>

883
01:13:35,654 --> 01:13:38,452
<i>You know what time it is
Because I'm fucking Juney too</i>

884
01:13:39,525 --> 01:13:42,961
<i>Yeah, I know, but it's true
Flava-Flav, he fucks me too</i>

885
01:13:43,162 --> 01:13:46,427
<i>And I swap with Calvin
And he swaps with that dude</i>

886
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:48,065
<i>And we're all fucking Hellboy</i>

887
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:54,602
<i>Yeah, they're fucking Hellboy
And I'm fucking the Hulk</i>

888
01:13:54,807 --> 01:13:58,174
<i>When I get really mad
I start fucking Iron Man</i>

889
01:13:58,377 --> 01:14:01,574
<i>A most uncomfortable screw
But I fuck the princess too</i>

890
01:14:03,282 --> 01:14:05,147
<i>Who's that ringing on my bell?</i>

891
01:14:05,351 --> 01:14:07,114
<i>The bitch who's fucking Iron Man</i>

892
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:12,086
<i>That's l-R-O-N M-A-N
And I fuck him in the mouth</i>

893
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:15,783
<i>That's fucking great
Because I'm fucking Wolf</i>

894
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,891
<i>He's fucking Wolf
Ain't that a pity?</i>

895
01:14:20,099 --> 01:14:23,432
<i>Because I'm fucking those bitches
From Sex and the City</i>

896
01:14:24,837 --> 01:14:27,806
<i>He fucks the Sex and the City gals</i>

897
01:14:28,007 --> 01:14:30,805
So I wondered:
Would Wolf really get jealous...

898
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,002
...if he knew we were fucking
that guy with the big utility belt?

899
01:14:35,614 --> 01:14:36,842
<i>They're all fucking Batman</i>

900
01:14:37,049 --> 01:14:40,246
<i>At Wayne Manor, in the Batcave
Butler Alfred is our love slave</i>

901
01:14:40,452 --> 01:14:42,147
<i>Riddle me this
Holy bathhouse</i>

902
01:14:42,354 --> 01:14:43,844
<i>I'm fucking Amy Winehouse?</i>

903
01:14:44,056 --> 01:14:47,355
<i>He's fucking Amy Winehouse</i>

01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,154
<i>Yeah, on the down-low, low, low</i>

905
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:53,297
<i>And I'm fucking Jessica Simpson</i>

906
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:57,196
<i>'Cause I'm on blow, blow, blow</i>

907
01:14:57,403 --> 01:15:01,362
<i>She's fucking Jessica Simpson
Oh, yeah</i>

908
01:15:01,574 --> 01:15:05,601
<i>And I think I might have fucked
That hot assassin</i>

909
01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:08,974
<i>Everyone's fucked me
And I've fucked them back, you see</i>

910
01:15:09,181 --> 01:15:12,514
<i>And the Mexican too
With the tragic hairdo</i>

911
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:15,887
<i>Call it, heads, I'm fucking J. T.</i>

912
01:15:16,088 --> 01:15:19,023
<i>I'm fucking that male model
'Cause he's so fine</i>

913
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:22,352
<i>And I like to get up
In them Calvin Kleins</i>

914
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:28,932
<i>It's true, J. T. Fucked my ass again
But I'm also fucking Prince Caspian</i>

915
01:15:29,468 --> 01:15:32,665
<i>I am handsome and I am cool</i>

916
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:36,068
<i>That's why this prince
Fucks the kids from high school</i>

917
01:15:39,945 --> 01:15:41,435
<i>- Come on
- Let's hear it</i>

918
01:15:41,647 --> 01:15:43,581
<i>- Now's the time to party
- Let me hear you</i>

919
01:15:43,782 --> 01:15:45,943
<i>- You know what time it is?
- No, what time is it?</i>

920
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:48,085
<i>- It's time to get fucked
- Fuck me</i>

921
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:50,346
<i>- No, fuck me
- Fuck me</i>

922
01:15:50,556 --> 01:15:52,490
<i>He fucks all us kids in high school</i>

923
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:56,627
<i>Under the bleachers, in the showers
While we're changing for gym class</i>

924
01:15:56,829 --> 01:15:58,660
<i>- I'm fucking Oprah

01:16:19,918 --> 01:16:21,647
<i>Oh, yeah, he's fucking the Chipmunks</i>

932
01:16:21,854 --> 01:16:25,415
<i>Sad to say, but it's true
He fucks the Chipmunks, yeah</i>

933
01:18:51,637 --> 01:18:53,264
You just got Wolfed.

934
01:18:53,472 --> 01:18:56,373
That's a little move I learned in jail.

935
01:18:56,575 --> 01:18:57,974
Yeah, I was in jail.

936
01:18:58,177 --> 01:19:00,737
Wolf wrote some bad checks in '95.

937
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:03,073
Left foot, yellow.

938
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:05,781
Oh, that's right, I fall.

939
01:19:11,757 --> 01:19:14,783
Sorry about that. This is mine.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

940
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:19,760
Wait. Oh, this is my jam.

941
01:19:19,965 --> 01:19:22,525
Oh, okay. You get on it.

942
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:24,230
I am Beowulf.

943
01:19:24,436 --> 01:19:28,031
I'm the strongest man
in seven kingdoms.

944
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:32,333
Let myself go a little bit.

945
01:19:32,544 --> 01:19:34,409
Got a little bit flabby.

946
01:19:34,613 --> 01:19:36,513
I went on that Zone Diet...

947
01:19:36,715 --> 01:19:41,482
...but I would eat like a whole week's
worth of meals in like two days...

948
01:19:41,687 --> 01:19:43,279
...and then be back to square one.

949
01:19:43,488 --> 01:19:47,515
If you've got crack anywhere,
I don't care where it comes from...

950
01:19:47,726 --> 01:19:51,184
If it's in your crack...
If the crack's in your crack.

951
01:19:52,764 --> 01:19:56,029
"If the crack's in your crack."
Oh, that's rich.

952
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:58,426
You ever been
with a bald doctor before?

953
01:19:58,637 --> 01:20:00,730
- No.
- We give better...

954
01:20:02,774 --> 01:20:04,901
Do I look like Harrison Ford to you?

955
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:07,305
- He your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

956
01:20:11,116 --> 01:20:13,482
Oh, what to do? Yes, I've got it.

957
01:20:13,685 --> 01:20:17,143
You can be my prince of light,
and you can be my prince of darkness.

958
01:20:17,356 --> 01:20:19,187
- Yes. No? Okay.
- No.

959
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:22,252
Left foot, yellow.

960
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:25,458
Look at this onion.

961
01:20:25,664 --> 01:20:29,657
Baby, how did you get into it with him.
You should be with me.

962
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:33,736
Also, when I make love to a girl,
she's also been Wolfed.

963
01:20:33,939 --> 01:20:39,434
I don't hit her with a stick,
I just have sex with her.

964
01:20:39,645 --> 01:20:41,772
Or him. Doesn't matter.

965
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:44,175
Wolf goes both ways,
you know what I'm saying?

966
01:20:44,383 --> 01:20:46,817
I got us tickets
to Madonna's reunion show...

967
01:20:47,019 --> 01:20:49,214
...and then I wanna
kiss your sweet face.

968
01:20:49,421 --> 01:20:51,150
No!

969
01:20:52,357 --> 01:20:54,450
Take it from the top again.
She says, "Hello."

970
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,458
Don't hit her so hard.
Just hit her really lightly.

971
01:20:57,663 --> 01:20:59,096
Okay?

972
01:20:59,798 --> 01:21:01,197
Good enough for me.

973
01:21:02,935 --> 01:21:04,664
It's all very funny.

974
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,937
Cut.

975
01:21:07,606 --> 01:21:11,337
Oh, it's my Blake, incarcerated.
Hi, Blakey.

976
01:21:11,543 --> 01:21:13,943
How are you? I love you.

977
01:21:14,146 --> 01:21:15,977
He did not kill those three prostitutes.

978
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:20,174
They were already dead when he
got to them. I'm swearing to God.

979
01:21:20,686 --> 01:21:23,712
Look, I have to tell you something.
I'm not really a banker.

980
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:25,549
As my voice cracks.

981
01:21:25,757 --> 01:21:30,820
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

982
01:21:31,029 --> 01:21:34,396
I can teleport through space and time.

983
01:21:37,736 --> 01:21:40,102
- What is it again? Time and space.
- Time and space.

984
01:21:40,505 --> 01:21:42,097
Look, I have something to tell you.

985
01:21:42,307 --> 01:21:44,502
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

986
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:47,679
- A what?
- I can teleport through time...

987
01:21:54,086 --> 01:21:55,417
You're a talking panda.

988
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:59,147
Come back to my magical kingdom,
and I'll show you my talking beaver.

989
01:21:59,658 --> 01:22:01,558
It just keeps coming.

990
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,594
Knock, knock. Who's there?
Milk in your mouth.

991
01:22:11,503 --> 01:22:18,341
Hey, is my singing stick on?
It is on? Is the singing stick on?

992
01:22:21,046 --> 01:22:24,345
You know, everyone wants to know
where I got my:

993
01:22:24,549 --> 01:22:27,609
It all started one night
when I was crying in my truck.

994
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:30,720
Yeah. I ain't crying no more, man.

995
01:22:30,922 --> 01:22:32,913
Fourteenth highest-rated show on TV.

996
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:36,026
I got a time-share in Key West.

997
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:40,994
<i>Oh, baby, I make shoes</i>

998
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:45,067
<i>And these are my boobs</i>

999
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,500
I want you to see me
in my birthday suit.

1000
01:22:47,706 --> 01:22:49,936
I want you to watch me
take a bubble bath.

1001
01:22:50,142 --> 01:22:53,009
I'm gonna play around with the bubbles
and make a little beard.

1002
01:22:53,211 --> 01:22:55,145
Pretend I'm Santa Claus.

1003
01:22:56,515 --> 01:22:59,211
Oh, son, I'm loving this.

1004
01:22:59,584 --> 01:23:03,020
Hang on a bit.
You're a bit of stuff, aren't you?

1005
01:23:03,221 --> 01:23:06,281
Look at you.
What are you packing under there?

1006
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:08,015
What are you hiding under that?

1007
01:23:08,226 --> 01:23:11,093
I can see your sausage and biscuits.

1008
01:23:12,431 --> 01:23:13,955
I love sausage and biscuits.

1009
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:28,976
Wonderful!

1010
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:32,141
I'd like to get you naked
and analyze you.

1011
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:34,477
Oh, shit.

1012
01:23:34,686 --> 01:23:37,086
Do you like this shirt?
I totally made it myself.

1013
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:39,883
Well, it's because I ripped it.
It's because I burned it.

1014
01:23:40,092 --> 01:23:41,787
I was leaning over my birthday candles.

1015
01:23:41,993 --> 01:23:43,722
I was gonna blow them out,
make a wish.

1016
01:23:43,929 --> 01:23:45,556
Instead my shirt caught on fire.

1017
01:23:45,997 --> 01:23:49,694
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1018
01:23:50,035 --> 01:23:52,003
I'll take those odds.

1019
01:23:53,205 --> 01:23:55,139
Do you hear that train?

1020
01:23:57,509 --> 01:24:01,240
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1021
01:24:01,446 --> 01:24:03,107
I'll take those odds.

1022
01:24:03,315 --> 01:24:06,512
You hear that train again?
You hear that again, that second time?

1023
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:10,684
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1024
01:24:11,123 --> 01:24:12,181
I'll take those...

1025
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,858
Train. I knew it was coming too. Yeah.

1026
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,860
- Is that the train we should catch?
- No, no. Take a...

1027
01:24:21,566 --> 01:24:22,555
Couple more?

1028
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:25,634
You're hot. Are those things real?

1029
01:24:27,639 --> 01:24:31,837
Hey, everybody, be sure to remember
to always use Proactiv. It helped me.

1030
01:24:32,043 --> 01:24:36,707
<i>It helped my skin
It helped my skin</i>

1031
01:24:36,915 --> 01:24:42,581
<i>It helped my skin
It helped my skin, baby</i>

1032
01:24:42,787 --> 01:24:46,154
It helped me. I used to have it
all around this part of my face...

1033
01:24:46,358 --> 01:24:48,155
...and all around my talking hole...

1034
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,818
...and then out of this squishy part
right here.

1035
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:54,521
I had it everywhere, and now it's gone.

1036
01:24:54,733 --> 01:24:59,864
There's a medical term
for what you do to me: Horny.

1037
01:25:00,305 --> 01:26:00,818
