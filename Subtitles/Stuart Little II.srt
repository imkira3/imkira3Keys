2
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,602
George, wake up.

3
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:23,323
It's Saturday.

4
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:27,084
I know, but it's the first day of soccer.
It's our first game.

5
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,324
Soccer?

6
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:32,126
I can't today. I caught a cold while sleeping.

7
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,521
You'll be fine.

8
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,958
Come on, come on, it'll be great.

9
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:43,118
We're going to play like Brazilians.

10
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:50,325
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Mum.

11
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,559
Stuart, don't forget your water bottle. George...

12
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,287
Don't forget your cleats.

13
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,645
You look especially beautiful today.

14
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,289
Some people just know how to wear oatmeal.

15
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,808
Okay, open up.

16
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,048
Did you hear that? She said "blah-blah."

17
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,847
I can't believe it.

18
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,357
Her first word.

19
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,929
Where's the baby book? I'm writing it down.

20
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:14,079
I'm not sure that's technically a word.

21
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,761
Of course it is.

22
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,238
But your Uncle Crenshaw says
that every Little starts talking by nine months.

23
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,365
In Uncle Crenshaw's case, never stops.

24
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,280
Are you both coming to the game?

25
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:25,688
Wouldn't miss it.

26
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,523
Frederick...

27
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,444
...this soccer game's making me very...

28
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:33,646
- Proud?
- Anxious. Especially about...

29
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,320
- I'm fine.
- He's fine.

30
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:44,438
All those boys stomping around with cleats.
What if someone...

31
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:48,477
Oh, honey. He's a Little.
All Littles are natural athletes.

32
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,401
- Do you need...
- Could you?

33
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,287
Okay, that's it for you.

34
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,481
Snow, food.

35
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,602
Food? Is it tuna? Or herring?

36
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,238
Or, dare I say it, is it lox?

37
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,168
Oh! Please be lox!

38
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:11,877
That's for you.

39
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,923
- Boys, are we ready to play some soccer?
- You bet, Dad.

40
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:17,608
Oh, great. It's glop.

41
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:22,644
Look what I'm reduced to.
I'm a Handi Wipe with hair.

42
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,808
Wallace! Get up! There we go!

43
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,285
That's right! Dig! Dig!
Go downfield! Downfield!

44
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,485
You guys, spread out! Spread out!

45
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,885
Well, George is getting a workout.

46
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,045
What bothers me is that every kid
has had a chance to play except Stuart.

47
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,482
There's plenty of time.

48
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,799
Plenty of time? There's 40 seconds.

49
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,802
He did an excellent job
of handing out the orange slices.

50
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,800
That's not as easy as it looks.

51
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,647
Okay, I'm glad he's not in the game.
I don't want him to get hurt.

52
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,118
It's Pee-Wee soccer. Nobody gets hurt.

53
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,481
Irwin, are you okay?

54
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,168
Are you all right, Irwin?

55
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,443
Do I look all right?

56
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,201
Here. Come on.

57
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,088
Better substitute.

58
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,479
Tie game. We could play with just 10.

59
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,719
But we have George, so it's like having nine.

60
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,162
We'll have none of that.

61
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:38,205
Come on, coach.

62
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:41,284
Stuart! Go in for Irwin!

63
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:44,367
Mum! Dad! I'm going in!

64
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,678
Yeah, Stuart!

65
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:46,758
Oh, dear.

66
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,639
Watch your tail out there.

67
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,879
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

68
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,288
Now, go get them.

69
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,564
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

70
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,484
Over here! I'm open!

71
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,042
I got it! I got it!

72
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:14,087
- I'm going to snatch him off the field.
- Honey, honey.

73
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,167
Knowing boys as I do,
I think he might find that a little...

74
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:18,523
Embarrassing.

75
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:27,562
Get it, George!

76
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:29,764
Go after it!

77
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,568
Pass me the ball, lame-o. Come on.

78
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,561
George, shoot!

79
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,968
I got it! I got it!

80
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,278
Shoot!

81
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,961
I got it! I got it!

82
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,526
Yeah, I did it!

83
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:06,519
I have to start wearing a cup.

84
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,045
He just looked so small out there.

85
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:16,765
So lacking in bigness.
Does he really have to go back next week?

86
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:19,085
We have to give him room to grow.

87
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,763
I do. I let him slice his own banana.

88
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:22,998
With a spoon.

89
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:26,206
I let him drive his car to school.
No other mother does that.

90
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,042
With George walking beside him
every step of the way.

91
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,324
How much more room should I give him?

92
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,164
A bit more than you're giving him now.

93
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:49,039
Maybe Mum was right.
Maybe I shouldn't be playing soccer anymore.

94
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,479
What does she want you to go out for?

95
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,321
Painting or dancing.

96
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,087
I guess it's my fault.

97
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:58,726
I'm sorry I kicked you into the goal.

98
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,245
That's okay. You won the game.
That's the main thing.

99
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:06,328
No. The main thing is I hit Wallace in the face.

100
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:45,166
Bogeys, 12:00! I got him, Brooklyn!

101
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,285
Wouldn't it be cool if I actually flew this?

102
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,724
Yeah. There's only one problem.

103
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,283
Mum.

104
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,762
- Hello, Mrs. Little.
- Hi, Will.

105
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,885
- Is George home?
- He's with Stuart.

106
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,001
We just need to tighten her up
and she's ready to fly.

107
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,642
Hi, George. Hi, Stuart.

108
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:04,957
Hi, Will.

109
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:07,848
You want to take a break for a while?
I brought my PS2.

110
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:08,998
Yeah, okay.

111
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,847
But what about the plane?

112
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:14,001
I want to play with Will for a while.
Play with Snowbell.

113
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:30,602
Oh, well. Guess I'll have to finish it myself.

114
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:41,001
If I can just...

115
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:46,398
Oh, dear.

116
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,166
Hey, what's that noise?

117
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:55,961
Sounds like a lawnmower.

118
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,887
Inside the house?

119
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:00,202
Stuart!

120
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,884
What are you doing?

121
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,687
I'm not doing anything!

122
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,407
Pull the brake!

123
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:21,798
Get the book!

124
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,524
This is cool.
All my brother does is jam crayons up his nose.

125
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,881
It says, "On takeoff, pull back on the throttle."

126
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,761
Takeoff? I'm in the air!

127
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,038
Snowbell, get out of the way!

128
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:39,921
Please, don't hurt me!

129
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:42,798
What's going on?

130
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:44,925
Stuart's just flying in the house.

131
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:46,964
Flying in the house?

132
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,517
At least he's indoors, nothing bad can happen.

133
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:50,644
Watch out!

134
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,003
Hit the dirt!

135
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:56,118
Stuart!

136
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,158
Duck!

137
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,320
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

138
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,206
I'm okay.

139
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:22,688
Everything's fine.

140
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:26,761
Fine? Stuart, you destroyed it.

141
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:30,006
I'm sorry I wrecked it, George.

142
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:35,004
I'm sure we can fix it with some glue.

143
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,642
No, we can't. That's going in the trash.
It's much too dangerous.

144
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,361
Thanks, Stuart.

145
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:48,518
Why don't you take the boys home?
I think Stuart and I need to have a talk.

146
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,008
Good idea.

147
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,164
Come on, boys. Let's go home.

148
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,560
She treats me like a baby.

149
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,363
I'll fix you both some lunch.

150
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,522
She just loves you so much.
It's hard for her to think of you in danger.

151
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,600
Oh, this has been a bad day.

152
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,724
Mum's mad, George won't play with me...

153
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,324
I know. But every cloud has a silver lining.

154
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:15,639
Doesn't that make them kind of heavy?

155
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,526
No, it's an expression, Stuart.

156
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:20,999
The thing about being a Little is
that you can look at any situation...

157
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,045
...no matter how bleak, how hopeless...

158
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,439
...and still see the bright side. The silver lining.

159
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,684
Like in this situation,
the silver lining would be...

160
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:35,522
Help me, Dad, because I'm struggling.

161
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:40,001
George has found a new friend.
So you could find a new friend, too.

162
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,165
You're a lot better at this than I am.

163
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,848
I've been a Little a lot longer than you have.
You'll get the hang of it.

164
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:49,489
Meantime, keep your chin up...

165
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:52,686
...your back straight and your heart open.

166
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:55,727
- Then what?
- One step at a time.

167
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,360
And Canada is separate
from the United States because...

168
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:06,407
...Canadians like to be alone.

169
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:08,764
Review tomorrow, test on Friday.

170
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:11,807
And please take your leftover lunches with you.

171
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:15,325
My husband is tired of me coming home
smelling like salami.

172
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:18,606
Tony, would you like to come over
to my house this afternoon?

173
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,919
Sorry, pal. I've got karate.

174
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,284
Hey, Mark.

175
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:24,166
Guitar lessons.

176
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:50,359
Some of the guys are going over to Will's house
to play basketball.

177
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,484
Can I come?

178
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:53,958
They didn't exactly mention
that you were invited.

179
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:57,479
Oh, that's okay. I'm busy anyway.

180
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,719
Just tell Mum I walked you home.

181
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,482
I owe you one.

182
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,123
Sure.

183
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:26,124
Whoa!

184
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:34,638
Miss?

185
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:36,244
Miss?

186
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,362
Are you alive?

187
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,121
She's alive.

188
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,004
Out of the way, please.
Injured bird coming through!

189
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,368
What's going on?

190
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,401
My wing.

191
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:57,447
Where am I? Hey! Where's the falcon?

192
00:15:57,609 --> 00:15:58,724
What falcon?

193
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,088
That falcon! Drive! Get out of here!

194
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:04,762
Oh, my!

195
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:07,044
Get lost, you disgusting vulture!

196
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:12,158
Eat my feathers, you vile buzzard!

197
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:14,479
Do we really want to antagonize him?

198
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,119
Oh, boy, we've got a problem.

199
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,484
No, you can make it. Don't slow down.

200
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:35,923
You did it.

201
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,808
Yeah. I did.

202
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:41,403
So, who do I have to thank?

203
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:45,324
Forgive me. My name is Stuart. Stuart Little.

204
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:48,959
I'm Margalo. Just Margalo.

205
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:51,282
Margalo.

206
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:57,768
You're so strong. Are you an athlete?

207
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,681
Well, yeah.

208
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:01,761
I play a little soccer...

209
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,442
...fly airplanes...

210
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:04,723
...race boats.

211
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:09,127
You can put me down now.
My legs are fine. It's my wing that's hurt.

212
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:12,964
Oh. Yeah. Of course.

213
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,239
There used to be bandages in here.

214
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:24,367
- Hey, why don't we try your scarf?
- Good idea.

215
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,119
My pin, it's...

216
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:33,606
Must have happened
when that falcon smashed into me.

217
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:37,683
It was part of our nest when I was a baby.
I've had it my whole life.

218
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:40,568
It's the only thing I have left of my mother's.

219
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,839
Gee, that's too bad.

220
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,522
Yeah.

221
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,287
There. How's that?

222
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:54,486
That's much better, thank you.

223
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:57,567
So tell me, Stuart Little,
do you actually live here?

224
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,607
Oh, yeah. I'm a real Little. I'm the middle child.

225
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,208
The middle Little.

226
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:03,364
Cute.

227
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:05,520
So, where do you live?

228
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:10,564
- You know, here and there.
- You mean you don't have a home?

229
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,408
Once, we lived in a box. Well, not really a box.

230
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:16,720
It was one of those things
where people keep their jewelry.

231
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:17,924
A jewelry box?

232
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,921
Yes! That's what it must have been.
A jewelry box.

233
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:23,318
It was wonderful.

234
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:28,406
Well, I've taken too much of your time.
I'd better go before it gets dark.

235
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:33,040
No, wait. You can't go out there.
Not while you're hurt. You should stay here.

236
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:37,128
I couldn't impose.
I mean, you'd really do that for me?

237
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,008
Sure, I have just the thing. I'll be right back.

238
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:42,922
- Meanwhile, you can use my cat's bed.
- You have a cat?

239
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:46,479
Don't worry about Snowbell.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

240
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:55,287
Those flies really come back on you.

241
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:04,846
I try to eat right and yet I still feel bloated.

242
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,961
Maybe more food will help.

243
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:10,644
Hi there.

244
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,204
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you!

245
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,929
Scare me? That's a laugh.

246
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,280
Hear that? That was a laugh.

247
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:28,446
Hairball. Major hairball.

248
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:32,684
And yet we continue to lick ourselves.
Unbelievable.

249
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:36,245
Hey, Snowbell. Meet Margalo.
She'll be staying with us for a while.

250
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:38,399
Staying? Are you out of your mind?

251
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:43,165
You can't just drag stray birds in here.
Do you think this is a halfway house?

252
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:44,808
Look, she's filthy.

253
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:47,278
No offence. She could have germs.

254
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:51,608
And how do you know she's not a vagrant
or a thief? Get rid of her.

255
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,441
We're home. Sorry we're late.

256
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,248
- Little hi, Little low.
- Little hey, Little ho.

257
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,041
What the heck was that?

258
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:00,889
That's just how we greet each other.

259
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,158
Interesting.

260
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,486
Nauseating is more like it.
You're in for it now, missy.

261
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,880
Mother Little hates when animals
walk in here off the street.

262
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,399
When she sees this, she's going to throw a fit.

263
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,519
Such a pretty little birdie.

264
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:24,087
Maybe it's just my friends she hates.

265
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:28,078
- I found her.
- Found me? He saved my life.

266
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,403
He did?

267
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:32,406
- From a falcon.
- What's that?

268
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:34,639
Stuart saved this little bird from a falcon.

269
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:37,277
A falcon? They are fierce creatures.

270
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,805
Why does the city have falcons?
That shouldn't be allowed. Write a letter.

271
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:44,598
On the other hand, we have a hero here.
Way to go, Stuart.

272
00:20:44,689 --> 00:20:46,759
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

273
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,521
Silver lining.

274
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:52,362
It's a guy thing.

275
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:53,598
Is it?

276
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:57,324
Isn't it nice that Stuart has a friend?

277
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,162
I don't think Stuart thinks of her as a friend.

278
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:03,645
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's smitten.

279
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,277
He's infatuated. He's bedazzled.

280
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:08,922
But he's a baby.

281
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,842
Boys start having crushes really young.

282
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:17,158
Frederick, did you have many crushes?

283
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:20,041
I'm still having one.

284
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:28,409
So, Margalo, can I get you anything else?

285
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:31,288
Whip you up an omelette? Pop you a tart?

286
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:32,962
Stuart, I'm full.

287
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:39,165
Full? You eat like a bird.

288
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:40,688
Come on, Stuart, time for school.

289
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:43,403
I'm not going to school.
I'm staying home to take care of Margalo.

290
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:47,158
Guess again. You are going to school,
and I'll take care of Margalo.

291
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:48,807
Look both ways crossing the street...

292
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:51,528
...wear galoshes and, in art class,
don't run with scissors.

293
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,167
I'll get your backpack.

294
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:57,045
Mothers... You know.

295
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,241
- Well, I don't really know.
- No?

296
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:03,761
See, my mum just kind of one day...

297
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,840
...wasn't there anymore.

298
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,847
So you've been completely
on your own all your life?

299
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:12,887
- You bet.
- I'll bet it's been scary.

300
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:15,007
No, it's been an adventure.

301
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:17,284
I wish I had some adventures.

302
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:19,407
I'm only allowed to paint.

303
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:24,205
Hey, life is an adventure.
Just walking out that door is an adventure.

304
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:26,280
Come on, Stu. We're late.

305
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,801
Go for it, kid.

306
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,482
The adventure begins.

307
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:42,003
That feels like enough adventure for one day.

308
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,646
Hey, look! The Yankees won.

309
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:49,445
There we go.

310
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:52,163
Can you say, "Walk with Mummy"?

311
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,603
"Mummy"?

312
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:55,282
"Walk"?

313
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:58,244
Nothing.

314
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:12,567
Martha and I are going out for a bit.
Can I bring you anything?

315
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:13,844
No, thanks.

316
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,162
Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."

317
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:19,286
Say, "Bye-bye." Martha. Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."

318
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:33,928
Fresh air.

319
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:45,723
Remember me?

320
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:47,208
You scared me.

321
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,849
What can I say? I'm a scary guy.

322
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:54,879
So, Margalo, you case the joint?
Any valuables? Come on, thrill me. Chill me.

323
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:58,518
They ain't got much.
The mum's got a ring, but it's only two carats.

324
00:23:58,649 --> 00:23:59,877
All right, fine.

325
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:04,964
What else have they got?

326
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:07,245
Well, you know, not that much.
I mean, they mostly just have each other.

327
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:08,842
A moment while I vomit.

328
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:10,760
Why don't we just try somewhere else?

329
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,077
Because you're set up here.

330
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,364
They trust you. They like you.

331
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:17,887
And maybe...

332
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,125
...you like them.

333
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:23,282
Hey, Margalo, come on.

334
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,122
Don't con a conman.

335
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:27,963
Nobody else ever invited me to live with them.

336
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:31,126
Oh, really? Who found a pitiful orphan bird...

337
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:33,479
...and plucked her out of the gutter?

338
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:35,207
Who shared his food with her...

339
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:38,520
...and, I hasten to add,
taught her a trade? Who?

340
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,369
- You did.
- I did. Right.

341
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:46,324
Well, then, straighten up and fly right.
And remember, you are here on business.

342
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,440
You're not here to play around.

343
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:53,968
Come on, Falcon!
When I'm on a job, I never play around!

344
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:28,042
Are you cold?

345
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:33,080
I guess when the weather gets too cold,
you'll just fly south for the winter?

346
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:36,764
Well, to tell you the truth, I've never flown south.

347
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,363
It's kind of a dream of mine.

348
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:42,641
Get out of this cold, windy city,
catch that jet stream...

349
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:47,804
Fruit trees, millions of new birds to meet.

350
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:49,999
- I hear it's paradise.
- Then how come you haven't gone?

351
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:54,208
Something's always stopping me.

352
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,840
Something's always stopping me, too.

353
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:00,046
Everybody around here thinks
I'm too small to accomplish anything.

354
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:03,804
Hey, the way I see it, you're as big as you feel.

355
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:06,642
Yeah. Boy, I'm really glad you fell into my car.

356
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:11,484
I mean, you know...
I mean I'm not glad you fell. I just...

357
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:13,401
Want some more popcorn?

358
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:15,163
Okay.

359
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:19,159
What?

360
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,242
My pin.

361
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,641
It's fixed. How...

362
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:27,080
On my way home from school,
I drive right past where you crashed.

363
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:28,648
It was no big deal.

364
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:30,481
I mean, there was finding it...

365
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:33,720
...figuring out how the pieces fit together...

366
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:35,885
...and you know, fixing it.

367
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,368
And no big deal. Just...

368
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,564
<i>Oh, Scottie.</i>

369
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:42,239
...one, two, three.

370
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:48,008
Good as new.

371
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:53,207
No, Stuart, it's not.

372
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,047
It's much, much better.

373
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,169
<i>- Stay with me.</i>
<i>- All the time.</i>

374
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:30,164
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

375
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:32,041
What are you talking about?

376
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:36,680
I'm talking about you
and your little mouse friend.

377
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:41,725
Big mistake! Never make a friend I can eat.

378
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:44,121
Now, get me that ring!

379
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,759
Or the mouse is lunch.

380
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:04,243
- I'll do the dishes.
- You did them last night.

381
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,479
For you, I'd do dishes every night.

382
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:14,118
That way, I don't have to change the baby.

383
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,645
She just dropped her dolly.

384
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:24,364
I'll just...

385
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:28,448
- Frederick!
- What?

386
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:30,520
- My ring. It's gone.
- What do you mean?

387
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:32,042
It's gone!

388
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:33,921
- Are you absolutely...
- Positive.

389
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:35,442
Unless...

390
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:38,442
I'll call the plumber!

391
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:41,324
What's going on?

392
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:44,765
Mum's ring went down the drain. I can't reach it.

393
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:46,681
Hey! What about me?

394
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:49,238
I can do it. Let me go, Dad.

395
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,485
- Go where?
- Down the drain.

396
00:29:51,729 --> 00:29:54,607
I can bring it back up. It's an adventure.

397
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:57,158
I don't know. It's awfully dark down there.

398
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:59,121
And smelly. And cold.

399
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:03,117
But it's Mum's ring. She loves that ring.

400
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,287
Come on, Dad. Let me try.

401
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:29,567
Now, if it gets too cold, or too scary...

402
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:30,957
...you just tell us.

403
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:33,643
Don't worry, Dad. I can handle it.

404
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:38,999
- Or yank on the string, we'll pull you up.
- Will do.

405
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,288
How's it so far?

406
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:49,646
Wet. There's a lot of slimy stuff
all over the walls.

407
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:53,126
- What does it look like?
- Like the inside of your nose.

408
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:58,287
- Can you see the bottom yet?
- No, just more pipe.

409
00:30:58,449 --> 00:31:00,804
And everything we ate for dinner last week.

410
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:03,244
And the pipe seems to go on and on.

411
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,247
Well, the plumber said...

412
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:07,117
What's going on?

413
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,562
Is that a new top?

414
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:13,959
You know, you have such taste.
Simple elegance is what I call it.

415
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:15,801
What's on the other end of that string?

416
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:17,242
- This string?
- Yes.

417
00:31:17,969 --> 00:31:21,723
Well, now, don't get excited,
but someone that you and I love...

418
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:25,246
...has volunteered to go down the drain
to get your ring.

419
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,321
- Stuart?
- Good guess, Mum.

420
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:30,203
You let our son go down the kitchen drain?

421
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:32,121
Now, Eleanor, don't be upset.

422
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:36,362
It's been well thought out.
If there's a problem, I pull on the string and...

423
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:39,482
Now you can be upset.

424
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:41,607
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

425
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:44,157
Hurry! I'm slipping.

426
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,367
- Get more string.
- Great.

427
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:48,568
There must be string here.

428
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:51,527
- There is no more.
- What else can we use?

429
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:53,162
- Spaghetti?
- We're out of spaghetti.

430
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:55,843
- Well, do we have macaroni?
- That's too short.

431
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:58,159
- We can tie it together with...
- No.

432
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,688
Hurry!

433
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:01,288
Hang on, Stuart!

434
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:05,239
- Margalo, what are you doing?
- Stuart, I'm coming! Grab on!

435
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:06,964
Lower! Lower!

436
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,767
I got it!

437
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:13,244
- Are you all right?
- Are you hurt?

438
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,564
Don't scare me like that.

439
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,205
Margalo, you're the best friend I ever had.

440
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:32,524
What if someone had accidentally
turned on the garbage disposal?

441
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:34,282
I would not have let that happen.

442
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,837
- You let him go down the drain.
- He wanted to go.

443
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:38,601
If Martha wanted to go up the chimney...

444
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:41,647
...or George wanted to go into the toilet,
would you let them?

445
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:44,289
I love Stuart as much as you do.

446
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:46,804
I just don't happen to be quite as...

447
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:50,598
Emotional? Irrational?
What were you going to say?

448
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:52,723
I forget.

449
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,318
I know I'm overprotective, it's just...

450
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:58,322
...I can't stand the idea of Stuart getting hurt.

451
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:42,244
I'm sorry, Stuart.

452
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:25,204
What?

453
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:35,639
You people sure like your meat loaf.

454
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:37,608
You find the ring?

455
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:40,317
Everything but.

456
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,566
Has anyone seen Margalo?
I can't find her anywhere.

457
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,923
Maybe she just went for a walk
or a little flight around the neighbourhood.

458
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:52,681
Sure, to strengthen her wing.

459
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:56,648
Yeah, maybe. But why'd she leave me her pin?

460
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:00,767
Oh, you know, Stuart...

461
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:03,682
...Margalo is kind of a free spirit.

462
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,199
Maybe she just felt it was time to go.

463
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,485
Without even saying goodbye?

464
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:32,717
What are you doing?

465
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:35,881
I think I know what happened.
I think that falcon got her.

466
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:38,844
- Yeah?
- I'm going to find her.

467
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:42,277
And don't try to talk me out of it.
I've made up my mind.

468
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:45,088
Are you crazy? You can't go out there.

469
00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:49,242
Because I'm too small? Let me tell you
something, you're as big as you feel.

470
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:51,799
Then let me come with you.

471
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:54,437
No, I need you to stay and cover for me.

472
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,446
Cover for you? How?

473
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:58,600
Make something up. You're smart.

474
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,247
Stuart, she's just a bird.

475
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,048
No, George, she's my friend.

476
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:06,878
And when you're friends with Stuart Little,
you're friends for life.

477
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:11,720
Well, if you won't let me come,
at least get somebody to go with you.

478
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:16,884
Snow!

479
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:20,001
The good silverware's in the dining room.
Take anything, but don't hurt me.

480
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:21,961
It's me. Stuart.

481
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:25,319
You. This better be important.

482
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:27,008
Margalo's still missing.

483
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:30,445
I should've been more specific.
I meant important to me.

484
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:33,169
I'm going to look for her. I hoped you'd come.

485
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:37,368
Look, Stuart, do yourself a favour.
Buy a parakeet and forget her.

486
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:41,198
I can't forget her.
She's in terrible trouble and I have to help her.

487
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,718
I mean what am I, a man or a...

488
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:44,884
...mouse?

489
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:48,441
Is that a trick question?

490
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:51,878
It's important. You got to help me.

491
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:53,641
And why would I do that?

492
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,322
Well, because we're family...

493
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:58,287
...and because I'd do the same for you.

494
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:03,239
And if you don't, and the Littles ask where I am,
George'll say you ate me.

495
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:04,728
What?

496
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:07,682
Why you little rat!

497
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:09,921
You know something?

498
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:14,560
Everybody thinks you're so nice.
You're not so nice.

499
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:18,608
Come on! Lt'll be fun. It's an adventure.

500
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:26,081
Hey! Mario Andretti, slow down.
Let's pace ourselves.

501
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:27,762
I'll have a heart attack.

502
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:32,320
I think I'm having a thrombosis
and I don't even know what it means.

503
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:39,280
George! Stuart! Breakfast!

504
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:41,642
Get it while it's hot.

505
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:43,521
Say, "Mama."

506
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:46,684
Say, "Dada."

507
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,965
Say anything?

508
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,802
'Morning, George.

509
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:53,158
Where's Stuart?

510
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:54,568
He already left.

511
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:57,245
He did? Without eating breakfast?

512
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,639
He had to get to school early...

513
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,885
...because he's in a school play.

514
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:04,523
Really?

515
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,522
Yes. He plays a mouse.
And they rehearse every morning before school.

516
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:12,167
Why didn't he tell us?

517
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:15,446
He forgot.
You know, being worried about Margalo.

518
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,197
Right.

519
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:20,919
Good. This'll keep his mind off it.

520
00:38:22,129 --> 00:38:23,323
Got to go.

521
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:32,606
Say, "Oatmeal."

522
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:38,644
Oh, boy. This is a sign, Stuart.
Like the burning bush.

523
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:42,928
Except it's a carburetor and I'm not Moses.

524
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:44,921
But it's telling us something.

525
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:46,886
Let your people go!

526
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:49,319
- We're not giving up.
- Oh, why not?

527
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:52,487
Giving up is fun.
And look at all the time you save.

528
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:56,921
I'm telling you, if more people gave up,
there'd be fewer wars.

529
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,203
Bill.

530
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:29,688
George.

531
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,038
Hi, Mum.

532
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:33,798
Where's Stuart?

533
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:35,083
He's not home?

534
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:39,644
Oh, I just remembered.
He told me to tell you that he's rehearsing again.

535
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:42,641
At Will's house.
And he's sleeping over there tonight.

536
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,686
Sleepover? On a school night?

537
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:47,329
Hey, that's what he said. Got to go.

538
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,164
Hello?

539
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:03,720
Hey, Will. It's me, George.
If my mum calls, Stuart's at your house, okay?

540
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:05,488
Hold on a second.

541
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:07,798
Hello?

542
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:11,086
Will, hi. It's Mrs. Little.
May I speak with Stuart, please?

543
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,325
- Stuart?
- You know, my son.

544
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:16,203
Oh, Stuart. You mean now?

545
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:18,200
Well, now is when I'm calling.

546
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:20,519
Oh, he just went in the bathroom.

547
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:24,324
I think he'll be a while. He brought a magazine.

548
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,322
- Well, then, is your mother there?
- Hold on a second.

549
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:30,121
- I told her.
- Did she buy it?

550
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:33,366
Yeah, but now she wants to speak to my mum.
What will I tell her?

551
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:34,962
Make something up. You're smart.

552
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:37,722
If I was smart, I wouldn't be in this situation.

553
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:42,839
She can't come to the phone right now.
She's in the bathroom, too.

554
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:45,159
But not the same bathroom!

555
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:49,158
- Just let her know I called. Thanks.
- Okay, Mrs. Little.

556
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:52,479
- It's all clear.
- I owe you one.

557
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:56,688
- Now will you tell me what's going on?
- It's too complicated. Later.

558
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:00,167
Little hi, Little low.

559
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,807
Little hey, Little ho.

560
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:06,159
- Boys home?
- Well, George is.

561
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:10,681
But Stuart is rehearsing his play.
Then he's sleeping over at Will's house.

562
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:15,360
- He's going without George?
- I think it'll give him room to grow.

563
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:25,197
Oh, Stuart, we've been walking for hours.
I can't take another step.

564
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:30,368
You know me, I hate to be negative.
But when I walk this much, I chafe.

565
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:34,045
Also, I hate to bring this up...

566
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:36,367
...but I need to go tinky.

567
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,128
How about the alley?

568
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,962
I'm a house cat. We're fastidious creatures.

569
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:45,600
We don't just yell, "Bomb's away!"
And go wherever we are!

570
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:48,562
Oh, look, let's face it. We'll never find her.

571
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:51,323
If only we knew someone
who really knew the city.

572
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:54,481
Yeah, someone who knows
the city's disgusting underbelly.

573
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:56,805
Who do I know that's disgusting?

574
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:10,048
Don't threaten me!
What I could tell the health inspector...

575
00:42:10,129 --> 00:42:12,484
...would close you down in a New York minute!

576
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:13,888
Monty!

577
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:19,365
Snowbell! What are you doing here?

578
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:22,441
- We've been looking all over for you.
- We need your help.

579
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:25,680
Hey, Snow, are you two still friends
or can I eat him?

580
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:28,847
- No, Monty, you can't eat him.
- Please.

581
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:30,567
No! Now, pay attention.

582
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:33,163
What do you know about a bird called Falcon?

583
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:37,760
Falcon? Oh, that's a bad guy.
You don't want to fool with him.

584
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,408
Where would we find him?

585
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:41,605
You don't want to find him.

586
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,920
You don't want anything to do with him.
Trust me.

587
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:48,797
He'd eat you so fast you'd be falcon poop
before you could yell for help.

588
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:50,678
Falcons are vicious.

589
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:54,523
They grab you by your neck and carry you
so high, you can't even see the ground.

590
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:59,729
Then they drop you. And when you land,
they drink what's left through a straw.

591
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:02,408
Snowbell, are you all right?

592
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:05,561
Oh, yeah. In fact, good news:

593
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:08,118
I no longer need a litter box.

594
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:12,603
Mop up on aisle three.

595
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:17,567
Stu, listen.
This whole thing has been a groove and a gas...

596
00:43:17,649 --> 00:43:20,209
...but it's important to know when the fun's over.

597
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:23,326
You don't want to be that last pathetic person
who leaves a party.

598
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:27,163
I told you. I'm not giving up.
We're going to find the falcon.

599
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:29,957
All right, then. It's your funeral.

600
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:32,518
Okay, listen. Listen carefully.

601
00:43:32,689 --> 00:43:35,328
The falcon lives across the park...

602
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:38,681
...at the very tiptop of the Pishkin Building.

603
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:42,444
Not many people go up there.
And even fewer return.

604
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,408
Well, here we are, Snowbell. This is it.

605
00:44:13,649 --> 00:44:16,209
"Salmon, catfish, tuna."

606
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:17,848
Why do they taunt me?

607
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:22,121
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Stay on track, will you?

608
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:24,519
I'm nervous. When I'm nervous, I eat.

609
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:29,404
Because I know in my growling gut
if anything happens to you, I'll be blamed.

610
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:33,568
I'm sure they already know we're gone
and plan to replace me with a hamster.

611
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:35,640
Don't worry. George has us covered.

612
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:39,483
George?
George doesn't know poop from applesauce.

613
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:41,805
And I say that with a great deal of affection.

614
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:51,319
- Hello, Little residence.
<i>- Oh, George. I'm glad you answered.</i>

615
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:53,201
Who is it? Can you speak louder?

616
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:55,564
George, it's me, Stuart.

617
00:44:58,569 --> 00:45:02,403
Where are you? How are you? Did you
find her? Are you all right? How's Snowbell?

618
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:05,242
When'll you be home?
Mum and Dad are asking lots of questions.

619
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:06,159
<i>So are you.</i>

620
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:09,719
I only have a second.
I just want you to know that we're on the trail...

621
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:13,085
<i>... and with any luck, we'll be home by dinner.</i>
<i>And, George...</i>

622
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:15,638
...thanks for covering for me.
<i>- Sure.</i>

623
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:17,162
But where are you?

624
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:20,321
Now, listen closely.
We're at the Pishkin Building.

625
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:23,242
<i>Please deposit $0.35 for the next five minutes.</i>

626
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:27,368
- Snowbell, I need more change.
- What do I look like, a fanny pack?

627
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:29,082
Are you still there?

628
00:45:29,249 --> 00:45:31,365
Is that Stuart?

629
00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:33,446
Let me think. Yeah.

630
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:36,280
I thought he was coming home.

631
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:39,401
He is. Later.
He and Will just need to rehearse some more.

632
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,367
In fact, I just left him at Will's.

633
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:49,639
Hello, Mrs. Little. Is George home?

634
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,199
- Will, I found it!
- Found what?

635
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,723
- The calculator.
- The calculator?

636
00:45:56,969 --> 00:45:58,960
Will, where's Stuart?

637
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,084
It's okay. She knows about the play.

638
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,365
It's supposed to be a surprise.

639
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:08,768
I had to tell her so she'd know
Stuart's at your house. We're going back there.

640
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,488
Oh, yeah. Right. It's going to be great.

641
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,605
I just need to get the calculator?

642
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:17,079
- To figure out how long to rehearse.
- It's a very complicated play.

643
00:46:17,169 --> 00:46:20,320
- Come on. Let's go.
- See you later, Mrs. Little.

644
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:23,483
George, don't forget
you two have a soccer game later.

645
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:25,002
We'll meet you there!

646
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:33,367
I can't handle this. I'm too stressed.
All this lying. I've never lied before.

647
00:46:33,649 --> 00:46:35,401
That's why she believes you.

648
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:37,400
- Boy, are we in trouble.
- "We"?

649
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:41,038
Yeah, "we." He didn't spend the night
rehearsing at my house.

650
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:54,324
What are you planning to do,
Mighty Mouse, scale the wall?

651
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:56,366
I'll think of something.

652
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:11,128
So long, Snowbell!

653
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:12,768
You've got guts, kid.

654
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:15,723
Guts and spunk.

655
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:17,999
Not to mention moxie.

656
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,280
You've got guts, spunk and moxie.

657
00:47:38,449 --> 00:47:40,644
Okay. Here we go.

658
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:45,168
All right, Falcon.
Hand her over and nobody gets hurt.

659
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:07,283
You up here?

660
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:13,768
Is anybody here?

661
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:16,286
I'm here.

662
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:22,724
I came for my friend Margalo.
If you've hurt her, I'll...

663
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:25,846
- You'll what?
- Tell me right now. Is she all right?

664
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:29,362
Why not ask her yourself, Whiskers?

665
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:33,880
Margalo, run!

666
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:37,719
Fly away while I've got him covered.
What are you waiting for?

667
00:48:40,729 --> 00:48:44,483
This kid's priceless.
Tell me, Cheese-face, does this sound familiar?

668
00:48:44,729 --> 00:48:47,607
"Oh, my wing. I don't think I can fly."

669
00:48:48,129 --> 00:48:49,642
What are you talking about?

670
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:54,041
I can't drill through the wood.
She scammed you. She played you like a harp.

671
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:57,083
Margalo, what does he mean?

672
00:48:57,169 --> 00:49:01,606
Okay, now it's getting sad.
Maybe this will clear things up.

673
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:04,520
My mum's ring.

674
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:11,168
I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.

675
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:14,602
But, Margalo, why?

676
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:16,841
Don't be upset, Mouse-boy.

677
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:21,122
She has conned smarter than you.
Or did you think you were special?

678
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,887
A real friend?

679
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:25,478
I didn't lie about that, Stuart.

680
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:27,687
You are my friend.

681
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:30,161
Then come with me.

682
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,607
She's not going anywhere.

683
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:34,248
Oh, yes, she is.

684
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:40,684
Was that your best shot?
Now, let me show you mine.

685
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:43,999
Don't hurt him, Falcon!

686
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,288
I won't hurt him. The sidewalk will!

687
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:49,764
Can't we talk this over?

688
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:53,361
No! Stuart!

689
00:49:55,169 --> 00:49:57,922
Let me go! No, Falcon!

690
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:14,638
A few days in here should provide you
with an attitude adjustment.

691
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:21,920
What have I done?

692
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:28,200
I'll bet something terrible has happened.
The Littles will kill me.

693
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:32,168
I know, I'll bring home another mouse
in a snazzy outfit...

694
00:50:32,249 --> 00:50:35,924
...teach him to drive a sports car
and pass him off as Stuart.

695
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:39,798
Who am I kidding?
I have to get up there. But how?

696
00:50:47,689 --> 00:50:49,600
I hope I live to regret this.

697
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:56,681
Stuart? Yoo-hoo?

698
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:04,639
Come out, come out wherever you are.

699
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:08,448
Please don't jump out from behind anything.

700
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:12,648
Remember, I have a strong stomach
but a very weak heart.

701
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:16,448
Here, Mousie-Mousie.

702
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:19,521
Snowbell? Is that you? Is that really you?

703
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:22,802
- Margalo? Where are you?
- In the can.

704
00:51:22,889 --> 00:51:24,242
Oh, okay. I'll wait.

705
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:26,638
No, in the paint can.

706
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:32,447
Why are you in there?
Is this some kind of trick?

707
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:34,042
Just get me out.

708
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:36,241
Is Stuart in there, too?

709
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:39,128
No, Snowbell, he's dead.

710
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:41,598
What? Stuart is dead?

711
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,282
Falcon killed him.

712
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:46,247
No. He can't be, he's...

713
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:49,685
I was supposed to protect him.

714
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:53,528
I wish it was me who had been killed.

715
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:55,484
Really?

716
00:51:55,769 --> 00:52:00,126
No. But I am very unhappy!

717
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:25,488
Oh, dear. I'm dumped on a boat.

718
00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:29,448
I'm on a garbage barge. I got to get off.

719
00:52:30,209 --> 00:52:33,042
Hello there!

720
00:52:33,129 --> 00:52:37,884
I'm over here! On the barge! Can you hear me?

721
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:39,323
Help!

722
00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:42,003
I'm not supposed to be here!

723
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:44,406
I need to get off!

724
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:46,640
Help me!

725
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:48,842
Help!

726
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,245
Rita, hi. I was in the neighbourhood.
I thought I'd get the boys.

727
00:53:02,409 --> 00:53:04,525
- George and Will?
- George and Stuart.

728
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:07,004
George is here, but I haven't seen Stuart.

729
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:09,166
But he slept here last night.

730
00:53:10,169 --> 00:53:11,124
No.

731
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:13,368
George!

732
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:17,641
What are you going to do now?

733
00:53:17,729 --> 00:53:19,128
Which way's Canada?

734
00:53:27,449 --> 00:53:29,246
This is terrible.

735
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:31,961
I just want to go home.

736
00:53:33,689 --> 00:53:36,886
I know a Little is supposed
to always see a silver lining.

737
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:41,083
Maybe this means I'm not really a Little.

738
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:45,206
Maybe I'm just Stuart Nobody.

739
00:53:45,729 --> 00:53:47,481
Stuart Nothing.

740
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:05,079
There is no silver lining!

741
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:13,039
Oh, no. What have I done?

742
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:32,078
My plane.

743
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:33,922
My plane!

744
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:37,206
The silver lining! This is it!

745
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:47,245
- All right, George, where is he?
- And this time, the truth.

746
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,001
I'm not sure.

747
00:54:49,249 --> 00:54:51,524
It is never okay to lie to your parents.

748
00:54:51,609 --> 00:54:53,759
Is it okay to break a promise to your brother?

749
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:56,602
It's wrong to promise your brother
you'll lie to your parents.

750
00:54:56,689 --> 00:55:00,523
Listen to the tone of my voice.
Tell us where Stuart is.

751
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:02,565
It was a promise. Brother to brother.

752
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:05,209
George, I understand. I have a brother.

753
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:09,243
But if he was in danger,
that would matter more to me than the promise.

754
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:13,561
How would we all feel
if anything happened to Stuart?

755
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:17,406
He's at the Pishkin Building.

756
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:19,804
- Dad.
- What?

757
00:55:19,969 --> 00:55:23,166
- Am I in trouble?
- No, son. You're in big trouble.

758
00:56:56,729 --> 00:57:00,608
- Mum, Dad, I'm really sorry.
- You should be.

759
00:57:00,729 --> 00:57:05,086
For all we know, Stuart could be out there now,
lying face down with his...

760
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:09,119
Or, he could be fine.
We don't have to assume the worst.

761
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:11,279
After all, it's not the Little way.

762
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:16,324
Yes, you're right. He could be puttering home
right now in his shiny little car.

763
00:57:16,409 --> 00:57:17,728
Smiling and happy.

764
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,004
His whiskers fluttering in the breeze.

765
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:21,727
- Mum.
- Yes, George.

766
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:23,845
I don't think he's puttering home.

767
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:28,488
Who would do this?

768
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:33,565
Tiny little vandals.

769
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:37,959
That miserable falcon!

770
00:57:38,449 --> 00:57:41,680
From this day forward, I vow revenge.

771
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:45,245
If that falcon were here right now,
I'd rip his throat out.

772
00:57:45,449 --> 00:57:47,724
I'd scratch his face off. I'd...

773
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,004
That's him.

774
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:52,437
Don't hurt me.

775
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:54,121
Kill the bird, not me.

776
00:57:54,329 --> 00:57:56,684
I'm going to be falcon poop.

777
00:57:57,649 --> 00:58:00,766
Well, well, well. The canary is out of her cage.

778
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:04,041
And how nice.
She's brought a friend for dinner.

779
00:58:04,209 --> 00:58:07,167
Too bad I don't like canned food.

780
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:12,562
Snowbell, get out!

781
00:58:12,649 --> 00:58:15,880
Can't. Stuck. Too fat!

782
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:29,969
Don't do it, Falcon. Or else!

783
00:58:30,129 --> 00:58:31,642
Do what? What's he doing?

784
00:58:31,729 --> 00:58:32,923
Or else what?

785
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,524
Or else you'll lose this.

786
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:39,005
Put that down, Margalo.

787
00:58:39,209 --> 00:58:43,088
I'm through doing what you tell me to do.
I'm leaving you, Falcon, forever.

788
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:46,446
Oh, and what do you think you'll be without me?

789
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:48,403
Free.

790
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:56,284
Big mistake. I'll be back for you, Fur-ball.

791
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:57,524
Don't hurry!

792
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:16,281
- Stuart! You're alive!
- So far!

793
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:18,002
Where'd you get the plane?

794
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:19,488
A garbage dump.

795
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:20,917
Sorry I asked.

796
00:59:21,129 --> 00:59:24,360
- I hope we're not too late.
- Keep your eyes peeled. He could be anywhere.

797
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:26,679
Careful now. One step at a time.

798
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:29,960
That's it. You're going to make it. Yeah!

799
00:59:37,129 --> 00:59:40,326
I'm alive. I'm alive.

800
00:59:41,929 --> 00:59:45,763
Stuart! Is that you? Take me with you!

801
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:50,044
What about me? How will I get down from here?

802
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:55,282
I think this is it. Turn here.

803
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:56,484
Okey-dokey. No problem.

804
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,768
Hey, look! It's Stuart.

805
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:05,441
Stop the car!

806
01:00:11,529 --> 01:00:12,757
Stuart!

807
01:00:14,049 --> 01:00:16,324
Look at that bird. He's bigger than me.

808
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,326
We got to save him. Come on.

809
01:00:18,529 --> 01:00:21,043
It's the Littles. I'm saved!

810
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:23,037
Wait! It's me!

811
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:24,722
Follow that flying mouse.

812
01:00:24,809 --> 01:00:26,401
- No problem.
- Hey-Little, Ho-Little...

813
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,447
...Hoo-Little, Hey-Hottle, Ho-Wottle, Wo-Wittle.

814
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:47,961
There he is!

815
01:00:53,169 --> 01:00:56,639
If we get out of this,
I'm sticking to painting and dancing.

816
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:01,045
Hey, lady! Get out of the way!

817
01:01:04,209 --> 01:01:05,642
He's closing in.

818
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:21,888
Oh, my goodness.

819
01:01:28,369 --> 01:01:29,518
Keep it running.

820
01:01:29,609 --> 01:01:31,247
Okey-dokey. No problem.

821
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:43,528
He can't hear you.

822
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,646
I think we lost him.

823
01:01:50,129 --> 01:01:51,403
Going up?

824
01:01:53,929 --> 01:01:56,159
Frederick, I feel so helpless.

825
01:01:59,889 --> 01:02:02,084
A mouse needs to know his limitations.

826
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:08,562
Stuart! Pull up!

827
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:10,720
I can't! It's stuck!

828
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:12,641
Well, try harder!

829
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:16,084
Margalo! Get out! Save yourself!

830
01:02:16,529 --> 01:02:19,680
No, Stuart! If we go, we go together!

831
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:24,727
Stuart! Pull up!

832
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:27,523
- Pull up, Stuart!
- Stuart, pull up!

833
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:43,844
You should've stayed
in your little hole, Mouse-boy.

834
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:47,399
Stuart, we can't outrun him.

835
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:49,400
Then we'll just have to face him.

836
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:52,208
It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.

837
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:55,401
But I have to try. I'll be back for you later.

838
01:02:56,009 --> 01:02:57,283
What do you mean?

839
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,325
Stuart! Don't do it!

840
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:10,080
Party's over, Fur-face.

841
01:03:18,049 --> 01:03:19,038
What's he doing?

842
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,357
They'll crash!

843
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,127
Stuart! Turn! Run away!

844
01:03:37,209 --> 01:03:39,040
Bye-bye, Birdbrain!

845
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,361
Oh, dear.

846
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:51,522
Got you.

847
01:03:58,649 --> 01:04:01,209
Can't I get a decent meal in this city?

848
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:08,958
Thank you.

849
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:14,365
Stuart! Are you okay?

850
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:16,246
I am now. Margalo saved me.

851
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:18,001
We saved each other.

852
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:20,359
What did you think you were doing?

853
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:23,839
- You almost gave me a heart attack.
- I'm sorry, Mum.

854
01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:25,727
- You ran away from home.
- I know.

855
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:27,527
And you had George lie to us.

856
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:28,598
Yeah.

857
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:32,046
Then why am I so proud of you?

858
01:04:32,609 --> 01:04:34,918
Mrs. Little, this belongs to you.

859
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:37,518
My ring.

860
01:04:37,849 --> 01:04:39,601
Yeah, I took it.

861
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:41,646
And now she's giving it back.

862
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,842
I'm just happy to have all of you back.

863
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:55,002
Snowbell!

864
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:56,078
You made it.

865
01:04:56,289 --> 01:05:00,646
- Thank goodness you're all right.
- Snowbell, where have you been?

866
01:05:01,249 --> 01:05:03,558
You wouldn't believe
what Stuart and Margalo have been through.

867
01:05:05,169 --> 01:05:08,684
You should have seen it.
These two were so brave.

868
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:12,042
Let's go home.

869
01:05:14,969 --> 01:05:18,006
And how about me? I played no part in this?

870
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:22,117
Well, I have had enough!
I'm staying right here, folks!

871
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:25,246
Oh, yeah. You'll never see me again!

872
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:28,084
Snow, want some tuna when we get home?

873
01:05:28,209 --> 01:05:31,519
Tuna? I love these people.

874
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:34,802
Wait! Wait for me!

875
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:42,845
I guess they're flying south for the winter?

876
01:05:43,009 --> 01:05:44,328
I guess.

877
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:52,119
You've always dreamed of going, haven't you?
But Falcon never let you.

878
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:55,999
Every year I'd just watch all the other birds go.

879
01:05:56,249 --> 01:05:58,240
The ones who were free.

880
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:00,483
You're free.

881
01:06:02,289 --> 01:06:04,678
We'd be so far apart.

882
01:06:06,089 --> 01:06:08,000
It wouldn't change a thing.

883
01:06:31,569 --> 01:06:32,524
Well...

884
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:36,688
- You're sure of the way? We can call AAA.
- We can get you maps, discount coupons.

885
01:06:36,769 --> 01:06:40,444
There's a place in South Carolina
where they do the best pecan pie.

886
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:43,083
I'm a bird. Instinct should take over.

887
01:06:43,529 --> 01:06:45,520
I guess you've waited for this a long time.

888
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:48,482
All my life. Only...

889
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:51,322
Only what, dear?

890
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:54,765
Well, now it's not just talk.
Now, it's the real thing.

891
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:56,203
Are you scared?

892
01:06:56,489 --> 01:06:59,686
The world's pretty big, and I'm pretty small.

893
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:03,598
Somebody once told me,
"You're as big as you feel."

894
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:06,000
Just spread your wings...

895
01:07:06,449 --> 01:07:08,167
...and soar.

896
01:07:09,009 --> 01:07:11,079
I'll miss you, Stuart.

897
01:07:16,729 --> 01:07:18,560
I'll miss you, too.

898
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:25,446
I'll miss all of you.

899
01:07:26,449 --> 01:07:28,041
You, too, Snowbell.

900
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:30,565
I'm not going to cry.

901
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:41,480
Little hi, Little low.

902
01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:43,919
Little hey, Little ho.

903
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:49,324
Stuart?

904
01:07:49,489 --> 01:07:50,558
Yeah, Dad?

905
01:07:50,729 --> 01:07:52,799
What's the silver lining this time?

906
01:07:53,809 --> 01:07:55,845
She'll be back in the spring.

907
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:02,560
Bye-bye, birdie.

908
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:07,044
- Did you hear that?
- Her first words! She spoke!

909
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,638
- Of course she did.
- I knew she could do it.

910
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:14,246
Big deal. When she can fall from a tree
and land on her feet, then I'll be impressed.

911
01:15:07,289 --> 01:15:09,280
Sous-titres : Filou ;-)

912
01:15:09,805 --> 01:16:09,828
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
