Here we are, folks,
on the red carpet at the grand opening...

3
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,970
of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum.

4
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,144
Tonight's premiere exhibit
is a rousing look back...

5
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,013
at the exploits of Mystery lncorporated.

6
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,850
And here they are.

7
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,980
Folks, this crowd is going crazy
over Mystery Inc.

8
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,241
- Fred!
- Fred, we love you!

9
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:38,703
Here you go, girls.
I got an ascot for each of you.

10
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,833
Hello!

11
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:47,075
Check it out! It's a Shag and Scoob quake
and the whole city's shaking!

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,580
Yeah!

13
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,753
Come on, Scoob.

14
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,263
Oh, sorry.

15
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,179
I consider it a privilege, sir.

16
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,019
- Daphne!
- Don't you two look beautiful. Thank you.

17
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,515
Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!

18
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:14,482
Hi! We love you! We have you tattooed
on our chests! Look!

19
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,028
That's very sweet.

20
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,525
Velma! Velma!

21
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,037
- Sign it, please.
- We love you, Velma.

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,460
Thanks.

23
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,798
- I love her so much.
- May I have a word...

24
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,796
- with Coolsville's hottest detectives?
- Absolutely.

25
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,589
That's your word.
Come on, dear. We're late.

26
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,062
Heather Jasper-Howe
at the grand opening...

27
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,643
of the new Coolsonian
Criminology Museum...

28
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,808
with our guests of honor, the master
detectives of Mystery Incorporated.

29
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,320
Shaggy!

30
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,614
Hey!

31
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,567
Right on!

32
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,817
Hello! Hello!

33
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,673
With all your success, will you still
have time for us in little old Coolsville?

34
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,467
Of course little old Coolsville
can solve its problems without us...

35
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,843
but we'll always be here to help.

36
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,012
The people of Coolsville
are the best in the world!

37
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,192
Fred, can you
tell us a little about the exhibit?

38
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,937
Absolutely. Mystery Inc.
Is proud to donate...

39
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,570
the costumes of criminals
we've unmasked.

40
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,993
- Like The Black Knight Ghost.
- Our very first case.

41
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,489
- The 10,000 Volt Ghost.
- Uh-huh.

42
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:53,375
The Skeleton Men,
and even the dreaded Pterodactyl Ghost.

43
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,548
We've also donated the costumes
of some of our more ridiculous foes.

44
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,046
Like Chickenstein.

45
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,797
Can we get a shot of you
next to The Black Night?

46
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,720
Ridiculous? Obviously she forgot...

47
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,808
- that dude tried to pluck us.
- Yeah.

48
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,894
- Remember what I told you?
- Never pick your nose in public?

49
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,562
- No.
- No, but that's good too.

50
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,820
- Image is everything.
- Yes! Image is everything.

51
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,483
The whole city's watching,
so try and keep a brave face.

52
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,819
They're costumes.

53
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,659
- Oh.
- Oh, right.

54
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:31,579
She's right, Scoob.
Up close, they look totally fake.

55
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:39,545
The Tar Monster scared the locals
of Byzantius away to take their treasure.

56
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,919
But on the positive side,
he'd pave your driveway for free.

57
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,551
Isn't that right, Velma?

58
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,104
Velma?

59
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

60
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,458
Uh... Oh, um...

61
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,263
Daphne, this is Patrick Wisely.

62
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:27,264
He's the curator here at the museum.

63
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,298
It's very nice to meet you, Patrick.

64
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,812
I hope you'll be working closely with
Velma on this ever-expanding exhibit.

65
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,808
I know that you're a glamorous,
mysterious, jet-set adventurer...

66
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,821
preoccupied with
international intrigue and all...

67
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,114
- Yes. That's me.
- I know, but...

68
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:51,739
There's a symposium coming up on syntactic
reasoning in the criminal brain...

69
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,163
I have always found
a criminal's inclination...

70
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:59,961
to incorrectly use the interrogative
pronoun in place of the relative...

71
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,708
delightfully absurd.

72
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,585
- Me too!
- Really?

73
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,087
Yeah. So maybe you'd want
to go together?

74
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,215
Suppose you mean like...

75
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,640
Like a...

76
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,693
Like a date. With me.

77
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,733
Oh, I... No, I can't, Patrick.

78
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,441
Oh.

79
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,242
Mystery is my mistress.
I must heed her sweet call.

80
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,993
Okay.

81
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,847
What's happening?

82
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,567
Oh, boy.

83
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,161
Daphne!

84
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,735
Go, Ned! Get it! Get it!

85
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,670
We need to come up with a plan.

86
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,246
- Hiding is our plan.
- Yeah.

87
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,382
In case you haven't noticed, there's
an unidentified freaky object in here!

88
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,394
- The curtains!
- We're on them!

89
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,929
Come on, you chickens! Grab those ropes!

90
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,309
- Okay.
- But chickens aren't good with ropes!

91
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,516
We got him!

92
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,109
Shaggy, use the ropes to tie him up!

93
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,527
It's just a costume!
It's just a costume!

94
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,322
It's just a costume!

95
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,778
We tied it! Let go!

96
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,802
Sorry!

97
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,720
- We have to save Shaggy and Scooby!
- As usual!

98
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,651
Fire!

99
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,067
Yahoo!

100
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,120
Mystery lncorporated.

101
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,497
This is only the first rung
on the ladder of your demise.

102
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,788
Look out!

103
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,850
And this time,
you'll be the ones unmasked...

104
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,481
as the buffoons you truly are!

105
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,819
Any clues to the cause of the attack?

106
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,030
How did the dinosaur
get through security?

107
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,330
Where did Mystery lnc.'s plan go wrong?

108
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,459
A secret hatch!

109
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,637
The real Pterodactyl Ghost
must have come through here!

110
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,561
A reptilian scale.

111
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,562
A most wonderful clue.

112
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:53,571
He stole two costumes: The Black Knight
Ghost and The 10,000 Volt Ghost. Why?

113
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,156
Fred, Daphne. Could you answer
a few questions for the press?

114
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,410
Fred, I don't think
that's a really good idea.

115
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,207
We always face the press
after we've unmasked the creeps.

116
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,253
We looked ridiculous back there.

117
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,208
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
The press loves us.

118
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,759
The higher the pedestal,
the harder the fall.

119
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,262
And Mystery Inc. Fell far...

120
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,926
in the embarrassing debacle...

121
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,942
that tarnished the reputation
of the once-great gang.

122
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,935
It was an utter disaster
as two of the gang's key members...

123
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,109
Norville "shaggy" Rogers
and scoobert "Scooby-Doo"...

124
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,118
caused untold damage to Coolsville's
hottest new tourist attraction...

125
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,032
which took a full two years
to complete.

126
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,622
When asked for comment, Fred Jones,
leader of Mystery lnc., said this:

127
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,460
Coolsville can solve its
problems without us.

128
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,126
I didn't say that! I mean...

129
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,795
I did, but that's out of context!

130
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,625
This is Heather Jasper-Howe,
disillusioned from Coolsville.

131
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,305
It's all my fault.

132
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,308
I'm the one who told Shaggy
and Scooby to get the ropes.

133
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,772
No, Velma, it's my fault.

134
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,319
I should have checked
that they were tied before I let go.

135
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,153
It's my fault too.

136
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,648
We all know how Shaggy
and Scooby can be.

137
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,161
But it's all right.

138
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,082
We just need to stay strong,
in control, and work fast.

139
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,493
Come on, gang. Let's get to the lab.

140
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,002
We'll figure a way out
of this Jurassic jumble.

141
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,999
Shaggy?

142
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,506
- We're screwups.
- Yeah.

143
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,094
I guess, looking back, every time
they made a plan...

144
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,840
we did screw it up somehow.

145
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,263
- I just never noticed before.
- Me neither.

146
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,681
There's gotta be some way we can prove
that we actually belong in the gang.

147
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,646
We've gotta do something
totally unlike us.

148
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,363
- Hmm...
- You know, Scoob...

149
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,528
we could act like real detectives!

150
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,570
Really?

151
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,540
Scooby-Doo, raise your right paw.
No, your right paw. Your other paw.

152
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,535
Repeat after me. From this day forward
we will no longer be our goofy selves.

153
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,377
We will be awesome detectives.

154
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,972
And we will act more like Fred
and Velma and Daphne.

155
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,385
We will be terrific and fantastic
and spectacular...

156
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,888
and cease to be "loser-iffic,"
"lame-tastic" and "suck-tacular."

157
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,732
Yeah, yeah. Suck-tacular.

158
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,732
Right, like, it's time
to solve the mystery.

159
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,072
- Let's kick this investigation up to an 11!
- Yeah.

160
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,070
What the heck are you guys doing?

161
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,832
We figured the first step
in solving a mystery...

162
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,584
would be to wear the right attire.

163
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:55,037
I'm sorry, Daph,
but your go-go boots didn't fit...

164
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,341
me!

165
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,592
Scooby! Those so don't go
with that sweater!

166
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,929
Really?

167
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,929
Ah, clues!

168
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,192
Alas, what are these strange markings?

169
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,937
Words.

170
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,609
Ahh...

171
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,186
Words!

172
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,113
Scooby-Doo, take notes.

173
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,780
- Gotcha.
- Come on, you kooks.

174
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,699
Okay.

175
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,449
It's come back positive.

176
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,963
This is a real pterodactyl scale.

177
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,124
Precisely!

178
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,632
That masked figure
was out to humiliate us.

179
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,048
Maybe it's someone we unmasked.

180
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,304
But who would be able to make
a real Pterodactyl Ghost?

181
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,807
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

182
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,473
Dr. Jonathan Jacobo.

183
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,983
That's right!

184
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:00,318
Jacobo wreaked havoc
in a statewide crime spree.

185
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,318
Jacobo stole millions...

186
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,987
which he used to finance his failed
experiments trying to create monsters.

187
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,080
Come alive! Come alive!

188
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,009
You think Jacobo's behind this?

189
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,012
Impossible. Three years ago
he attempted a prison escape.

190
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,862
So long, suckers!

191
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,362
Help me, suckers!

192
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,369
His body was lost at sea.

193
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:57,044
How about this? Jacobo's cellmate was
released from prison two months ago.

194
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,706
Jeremiah Wickles.

195
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,884
The Black Knight Ghost. That was
one of the costumes that was stolen.

196
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,875
Right! And...

197
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,381
Uh...

198
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,303
Scooby-Doo! What's your conclusion?

199
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,393
Bunny.

200
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,561
It seems Old Man Wickles
deserves a visit...

201
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,402
before any of our other creepy
conquests make a comeback.

202
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,068
Freddy, up on the right.

203
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,908
Old Man Wickles' ancestral manor.

204
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,996
Oh, man. Another creepy crib!

205
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,043
How come we can't ever investigate,
like, a KFC or something?

206
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,248
Shaggy!

207
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,714
All right. Then again,
creepy is my middle name.

208
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,551
Yeah, yeah. Yeah!

209
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,591
Scoob!

210
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,726
Come on, Scoob!

211
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,392
Looks like a bit of a fixer-upper.

212
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,898
Hey!

213
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,324
Nice job last night. Losers!

214
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,436
Quick, we need to think of a comeback.

215
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,951
What dorks.

216
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,283
Hey! Shut up!

217
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,830
That's a good one.

218
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,790
You are trespassing on Wickles Manor.

219
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,956
- Leave now or pay the price.
- What jerk makes that his doorbell?

220
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,709
Dude.
He just said we'd pay the price.

221
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,631
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy.

222
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,389
What could possibly happen
by ringing a doorbell?

223
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,739
Help me!

224
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,360
Shaggy!

225
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,502
I think I pulled something.

226
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,498
That's what can happen
by ringing a doorbell, Fred. That!

227
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,758
At 7 p.m.,
the owner will be home to set you free.

228
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,343
Hey.

229
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,508
You want to buy a box of cookies?

230
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,760
Excuse me.
Have you heard the Good News?

231
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,181
Yeah. There's cookies!

232
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,853
Watch the junk!

233
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,188
Sorry.

234
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,863
Oh, brother.
The lock's on a laser thumbprint scanner.

235
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,534
- Let me just get to my makeup.
- Daph, now?

236
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,863
You know what, Velma? It's never too
late to learn to properly apply makeup.

237
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,371
Okay. The last good thumbprint
should still be there, so...

238
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,405
a little blush...

239
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,042
a pore strip...

240
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,208
and voilà.

241
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,884
All right, Daph!

242
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,045
I enjoy being a girl.

243
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,385
Thank you!

244
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,683
See if I can get my mechanic's job back.

245
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,847
- Twenty, 30, 40...
- Thanks for the cookies.

246
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,225
50... Welcome!
Sixty, 70, 80...

247
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:11,647
Okay, gang. Let's, like,
split up and search for clues.

248
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,647
Scoob and I will go this way.
Come on, Scoob.

249
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,664
He stole my thing that I say!

250
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,455
Search for clues. Search for clues.

251
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,883
Huh?

252
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,760
Aha! A clue!

253
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,942
Shiny footprints.

254
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,269
The glow is similar
to the pterodactyl scale.

255
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,947
Aha!

256
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,372
A clue!

257
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,078
It looks like Wickles shares...

258
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,208
Jacobo's fascination
with the supernatural.

259
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,547
He collects everything
from Piri Reis to Aleister Crowley.

260
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,877
He collects dust too.

261
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,720
No. The dust is good.
We can tell what he's been reading lately.

262
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,638
Like here!

263
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,387
What is it?

264
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:31,902
It's an obsolete Celtic text used by
secret societies in the mid-19th century.

265
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,323
Look. The book belonged to J. Jacobo.

266
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,815
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

267
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,819
Maybe he gave it to Wickles
before he died.

268
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,763
Can you read it?

269
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,426
It's an amalgamation
of magic and science.

270
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,180
Here's a list of ingredients...

271
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,692
on how to create
your own carbon-based...

272
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,944
organic, composite predators.

273
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,357
This is an instruction manual
on how to create...

274
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,357
- monsters.
- Monsters.

275
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,369
Scoob.

276
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,201
Clues!

277
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,714
Those aren't clues, Scoob.
Those are just things you want.

278
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,584
Like, why is a toilet brush a clue?

279
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:44,221
Just because you can sing in it doesn't
make it a clue. It makes it awesome.

280
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,188
Hey... Like, what's this?

281
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,401
"The Faux Ghost."

282
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,147
We're in luck.
It's tonight, Scoob!

283
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,908
- We are detectives.
- Really?

284
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,615
You found an actual clue!

285
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,405
I found a clue!

286
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,084
Do the clue dance! Do the clue dance!

287
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,590
We're going back, we're going back!

288
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,767
Black Knight Ghost!

289
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,019
Run, Shaggy!

290
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,282
Let's go.

291
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,027
Like, lock the door!

292
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,277
Heavy stuff, Scoob!

293
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,624
Give me a hand, Scoob!

294
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,170
See him get through this!

295
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,789
Heavy!

296
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,295
We outsmarted that moron!

297
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,804
Yeah! What a moron.

298
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,221
Look at me.

299
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,297
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

300
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,977
- Yo, metalhead!
- Yes?

301
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,816
Bring it.

302
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,992
He brought it.

303
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,825
Daphne! Hold him off!

304
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,498
I'll look in the book.

305
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,668
Maybe there's a formula
for finding his weakness.

306
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,090
Here. "To find a creature's
weakest point..."

307
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,023
take the angle between
the current position of the sun...

308
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,517
- "...and your geographical point..."
- Velma!

309
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,437
"Add this point, 28 and a half
feet up from sea level."

310
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,029
That tickles.

311
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,696
This is bad.

312
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,863
"Multiply this number..."

313
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,951
"Add the square inches of..."

314
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,541
Velma!

315
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,165
"Take the square root..."

316
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,467
Now it's good night, ladies!

317
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,017
"Your X-axis."

318
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,021
Oh.

319
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,749
"And subtract 9034. That's your Y-axis."

320
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,917
Look. No hands!

321
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,915
Any time would be great, Velma!

322
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,167
I'm trying.

323
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,589
"Subtract one, divide by B,
follow upward eight degrees north."

324
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,930
Which makes his weakest point right here!

325
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,519
Right in the roundtables.

326
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,765
Run!

327
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,267
In your face! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

328
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,609
Come on, Scoob! Inside!

329
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,778
I'll compare the glow of those
footprints to the pterodactyl scale.

330
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,949
We'll check out Wickles' book.

331
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,447
Dude, The Faux Ghost
is an awesome clue.

332
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,120
- Yeah.
- But what do we do with it?

333
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,118
Let's solve the mystery.

334
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,577
If we solve the mystery by ourselves...

335
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,631
it would certainly prove to the gang
that we belong.

336
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,756
- Yeah.
- Let's head to The Faux Ghost...

337
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,053
find Wickles, and see what he knows.

338
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,137
But first, let's give the gang
the old "slipperooney."

339
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,982
Hey, guys.

340
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,478
Scooby's feeling kind of...

341
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,571
like he's got rabies.

342
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,368
We're just gonna go outside
to get some fresh air.

343
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,877
Jinkies!

344
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,675
What's up, Velms?

345
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,271
The analysis of the pterodactyl scale.

346
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,346
It contains randamonium,
which this books says...

347
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,322
is the critical ingredient
needed to make monsters.

348
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:54,033
Doesn't randamonium glow,
like those footprints in Wickles' mansion?

349
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:58,025
If we prove Wickles is behind this,
this mystery goes down like a dot-com...

350
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,199
- and Coolsville digs us again.
- Where would he get randamonium?

351
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,539
Randamonium is the byproduct
of silver mines.

352
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,706
Like the abandoned mining town
in old Coolsville.

353
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,707
Then we better get to that mining town
and see what's...

354
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,338
I'm invisible. I'm invisible.

355
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,046
Get rid of him!

356
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,679
Keep him busy.

357
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,731
What are you doing?

358
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,063
He wants to ask me on a date.

359
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,901
It's okay to be scared.

360
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,737
I am not scared.
I've fought werewolves and ghosts.

361
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:40,405
But in the end, we usually unmask them
and it's a little scared man inside.

362
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,525
It's the same with dating.

363
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:47,578
Velma, have you ever considered
that maybe werewolves and ghosts...

364
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,589
are just distractions to keep you away
from what really frightens you?

365
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,593
Intimacy with another person.

366
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,045
And by intimacy, I mean someone
who thinks you're really hot.

367
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:02,928
But I'm more comfortable
in the world of logic and facts.

368
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,059
And...

369
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,902
I'm not hot.

370
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,113
Me neither.

371
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:19,066
Everybody has flaws, Velma.
The object of a healthy relationship...

372
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,239
is to never let the other person
know they're there.

373
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,791
- To museums.
- To museums.

374
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,210
Daph, I really like this guy.

375
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,463
What would you do if someone thought...

376
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:36,085
that you were some glamorous
and mysterious jet-setter?

377
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,764
I'd make myself one.

378
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,273
Who's your mommy?

379
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,316
My... My mommy?

380
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,029
Come on, let's solve a mystery.

381
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,246
Ow.

382
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,507
Uh, Velma?

383
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:23,844
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No, I can't in this outfit.

384
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,325
Okay, Scooby-Doo, the coast is clear.

385
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,373
Here we go.

386
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,377
That's it, Scoob. The Faux Ghost.

387
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,629
Man, I recognize a lot of these cats.

388
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,300
Like, that's C.L. Magnus.
He used to dress up as Redbeard's ghost.

389
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,140
And that's Aggie Wilkins,
a.k.a. the Ozark Witch.

390
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,734
These are all folks we unmasked.

391
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,903
If they spot us,
they'll invite us to a weenie roast.

392
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,404
One where we're the weenies!

393
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,727
Mmm, hot dogs!

394
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,991
There's gotta be some way that we can
use our awesome, fearless new skills...

395
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,405
to get us in there
without being recognized.

396
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,271
Hey, hey, hey!

397
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,858
Everyone part like the Red Sea.

398
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:04,284
It's me, Shizzy McCreepy,
and my brother, S.D. McCrawley.

399
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,275
- Oh, yeah.
- We are in the house and ready to party.

400
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,452
Hey, handsome.

401
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,448
Hello, baby.

402
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,581
- Zoinks!
- Jinkies!

403
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,289
- Hey, gang.
- Jinkies!

404
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,749
- Hey!
- Yipe!

405
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,140
A Ghost Clown is a heck of a lot scarier
than a Cotton Candy Glob!

406
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,562
Watch out, idiot.

407
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,560
- Old Man Wickles!
- Leave me alone.

408
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,315
No!

409
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:46,322
I just... I just wanted to say thank you.

410
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:52,079
Your portrayal of the Black Knight Ghost
was inspirational to my brother and me.

411
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,575
Hey...

412
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,825
Have you done anything cool
and creepy lately?

413
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,338
Listen, I'm not normally one
for giving advice...

414
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:07,013
but I feel sorry for you because
of your brother's hideous nose deformity.

415
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,719
Get out of this game
while you got a chance.

416
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,178
All of us here ain't nothing to admire.

417
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,351
We needed people to believe
we were different than we were.

418
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,360
Maybe because we believed...

419
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:25,232
that there was something wrong
with who we were in the first place.

420
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,954
I guess you're sort of grateful
to Mystery lnc...

421
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,036
- for unmasking you.
- Are you kidding?

422
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,711
If I see those twerps,
I'd tear their eyes out of their skulls.

423
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,832
Make them eat the one eye...

424
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,002
while watching themselves
eat it with the other eye!

425
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,215
Bye.

426
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,224
Here's a clue for you.

427
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,178
- That dude's wearing his freak hat 24/7.
- Yeah.

428
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,730
I gotta take a whiz.
Don't do anything to attract attention.

429
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,185
Gotcha.

430
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,862
Hey, doll.

431
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,399
You wanna dance?

432
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,777
Groovy.

433
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,280
Here we go.

434
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,197
Shake it, baby.

435
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,844
Give me five!

436
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,283
Oh, yeah!

437
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,115
Everybody!

438
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,538
Yahoo!

439
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,798
Oh, yeah.

440
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,759
Hey, Shaggy!

441
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,074
Hey!

442
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,834
It's Scooby-Doo! The meddling mutt
what helped throw us in jail!

443
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,413
Who, me? Uh-uh.

444
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,627
No, wait, that's not Scooby-Doo!

445
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:51,384
That's S.D. McCrawley.
He's just wearing a mask.

446
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:02,098
And that's Doo's beatnik best pal,
Shaggy Rogers.

447
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,386
- Where?
- There.

448
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,309
Zoinks! Gangway!

449
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,528
Run, Shaggy. Wait for me!

450
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,333
And stay out!

451
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,674
That wasn't so bad, Scoob.

452
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,019
That was my outfit, I swear.

453
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:58,736
You know, Velma,
you are as beautiful as ever.

454
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,698
You're just so different than I expected.

455
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,368
You know, I'm just...

456
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,422
- Oh, my goodness!
- What the heck's going on?

457
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,590
This cannot be good.

458
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,260
My museum.

459
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,101
Wait!

460
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,941
Any comments on the museum robbery?

461
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,113
Mystery lnc. Is investigating
the two stolen costumes.

462
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,193
No, the one that just happened.

463
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,608
Where The Black Knight and Pterodactyl
Ghost stole the rest of the costumes?

464
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,279
The rest of the costumes?

465
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:55,419
So, what you're saying is
it's all downhill for Mystery Inc.

466
00:36:55,588 --> 00:37:00,128
No! You're doing that thing again where
you take everything I say out of context.

467
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,971
You're trying to make it look
like I think Coolsville sucks.

468
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,927
No! Don't record that!

469
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:18,316
Patrick, I'm so sorry.
It must be so hard for you.

470
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,316
I'm sorry, I have to go. Okay?

471
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,781
- I'll go with you...
- No! Just...

472
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,994
No, I have to figure out what's going on.

473
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,345
All Fred Jones had to say was:

474
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,981
I think Coolsville sucks!

475
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,687
In light of the city's recent chaos...

476
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:01,698
Jones' response was disheartening
to the fans who have supported them.

477
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,492
Perhaps it's time for the crime-solving
gang to shape up or ship out.

478
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,698
I'll be right back.

479
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,117
This is Heather Jasper-Howe
for lnvestigative Probe Reporting.

480
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,539
What's with the personal attacks?

481
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,708
Look, I'm a huge fan.
It's just my editor...

482
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:22,047
Who are you kidding?

483
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,376
Don't think I don't know your game.

484
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,886
What do you do for the gang?

485
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,718
Really?

486
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,849
Velm♪s the smart one. Fred's the leader.

487
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,849
All you are is a pretty little face.

488
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,402
Why are you doing this?

489
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:42,066
Because it's my job to unmask
those who pretend to be who they're not.

490
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,664
"Unmask those"? You sound like...

491
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,164
Sound like who?

492
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,037
The evil masked guy.

493
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,915
But you know that, because
just as you know I'm standing here...

494
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,249
you know I know
who you know you are...

495
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,500
which is him, who's a her,
which is you.

496
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,424
Oh, now I see what you do for the gang.

497
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,843
You're in charge of incoherent babbling.

498
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,601
Mystery lncorporated.

499
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:16,732
Once again, you are proven useless
before my power.

500
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,936
Because of you, soon Coolsville...

501
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,942
will be mine.

502
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,777
Darn it.

503
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,284
Thanks a lot!
The scoop of the night, gone.

504
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,162
Can't you do anything right?

505
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,581
Ned, get your camera and follow me.

506
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,248
Guess not.

507
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,969
Stop wasting my time!

508
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,889
You hear me? Now I want you to question
all your scum-bucket friends.

509
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,805
Find out what they know
about those stolen costumes.

510
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,944
Or else you'll be known
as the Soiled Underwear Ghost!

511
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,063
- I want answers. Now, go!
- Yes, sir.

512
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,060
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

513
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,612
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

514
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,989
Patrick.

515
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,699
Shaggy. Scooby.

516
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,504
What are you guys doing here?

517
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,077
We just came down here
to be undercover and stuff.

518
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,921
Huh. Me too.

519
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,796
My museum got broken into again...

520
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,513
so I had to come here
and try and get some answers.

521
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:30,215
Gotta put on the tough-guy act,
or these guys will eat me alive.

522
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,006
What's the matter, you don't believe me?

523
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,349
No, no.

524
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,227
I'm kidding!

525
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,859
- It's the tough-guy act.
- That's good.

526
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,516
Boo! Boo!

527
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,779
- I got you.
- That was a joke?

528
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,696
- Yeah.
- That was good!

529
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,155
You're a lot of fun. Try it, Scoob.

530
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,119
Boo.

531
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,663
It needs work.

532
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,833
Look, Patrick...

533
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,880
we could stay here, do this all night,
and something tells me you would...

534
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:09,376
but we gotta make
like your personality and split.

535
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,970
- Yeah.
- Okay.

536
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,304
Scooby-Doo. Scoob!

537
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,378
Hello?

538
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,418
Scooby-Doo, can you hear me?

539
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,262
Hello, Shaggy.

540
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,757
Wickles has led us
into a terrifying ghost town!

541
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,811
- Ghost town?
- Yes, a ghost town!

542
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,188
Darn bushes yowling at me again.

543
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,736
- Keep quiet, Scoob.
- Okay, Shaggy.

544
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:28,206
Like, where did Old Man
Nutjob go? Through here, Scoob?

545
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,629
I don't know.

546
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,761
Oh, boy.

547
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,986
Run, Scoob! It's a "skelly" thingy!

548
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,014
Elevator.

549
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,126
Good work, pal!

550
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,763
Like, let's skedaddle.

551
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,518
So, what's your assessment, Velmster?

552
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,187
This place seems harmless enough.

553
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:33,278
I mean, whether the Evil Masked
Figure could've gotten his randamonium...

554
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,494
- from here at the mine?
- Oh, sorry.

555
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,704
I was just thinking about Patrick.

556
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,197
He seemed so upset when he left.

557
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,615
- Right. So...
- And...

558
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,167
he doesn't like me.

559
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,343
Okay. So your assessment is?

560
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,671
- Love stinks.
- Fred?

561
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,882
Do you think I'm just a pretty face?

562
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,131
No.

563
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,429
I mean, yes.

564
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,389
I mean, not fat!

565
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,806
Definitely not fat.
Is this sort of what you're looking for?

566
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,556
Fat? Why would you even use that word?

567
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,568
Never again will they
underestimate us. That's right.

568
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,744
I've gathered you here today
for something big.

569
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,571
At last.

570
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,489
All these years of careful planning...

571
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,039
have culminated
in this one glorious moment.

572
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,834
Aha!

573
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:31,417
Old Man Wickles, caught red-handed
in your foul monster-making scheme.

574
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,335
With your ugly, evil henchmen.

575
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,963
Henchmen?

576
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,836
Young man, we're investors,
and we're listening to his pitch. Shh.

577
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,062
So as I was saying...

578
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,023
the Old Tyme Mining Town,
a summer camp for kids...

579
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,984
where they can have
an authentic mining experience.

580
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:55,274
They can dig for 18 hours straight,
just like in the golden days of yore.

581
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:59,284
They have the time of their lives,
and we get free miners!

582
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,534
Mr. Wickles, we need to ask you about...

583
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,950
- your ties to recent monster attacks.
- I don't know nothing about no monsters.

584
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,581
Then how come there was randamonium
on the floor of your mansion?

585
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:14,959
There's randamonium all over the place.
I come home with it in my shorts.

586
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,625
Are you continuing the work
of your old pal Jonathan Jacobo?

587
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,129
Old pal? Jacobo?

588
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,141
We hated each other.

589
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,473
In the prison cafeteria,
he used to steal my Tater Tots!

590
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,810
And he got the lead in My Fair Lady.

591
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,807
Then why did we find the monster book
in your library?

592
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,150
Wait a second. You're the runts
what vandalized my home.

593
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,817
Which one of you stole my toilet brush?

594
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,397
Um... Gentlemen. Hmm?

595
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,823
I'm sorry, Jeremiah.

596
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,162
What happened? I haven't finished!
Wait, fellas!

597
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,828
Wowee, Scooby-Doo!
I think we're onto something.

598
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,254
It's like a huge laboratory.

599
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,054
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

600
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,598
- This place is like Clue-topia, Scoob.
- Yeah.

601
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,192
Refrigerator!

602
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,277
Mmm, lemonade!

603
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,461
Check it out.
Look at those weird letters, Scoob.

604
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,083
Shaggy?

605
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:44,048
Scooby-Doo,
you turned into a freaky monster.

606
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,394
You don't eat stuff that glows.

607
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,715
There's got to be an antidote
in here somewhere.

608
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,562
Try this, Scoob. It looks medicinal.

609
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,567
Tastes like...

610
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,818
Strawberries.

611
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,829
I'm okay, Scoob.

612
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,917
I've got a chick's body!

613
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,666
I'm the Tasmanian Devil!

614
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,151
Check it out, dude!

615
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,949
I'm buff.

616
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,275
My God.

617
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,374
It seems as if I've become
ludicrously intelligent.

618
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,868
It's awful! I long for the blissful
ignorance of my former self.

619
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,291
Chasing cats, licking my own rear end,
eating my own vomit.

620
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,051
Those were wonderful times.

621
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,974
Check out my pecs, little man!

622
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,969
Hush now, buffoon.
This is a highly combustible synthesis.

623
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,140
A what?

624
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,308
I'm going to transform us back!

625
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,806
- No way, geek!
- What?

626
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,189
I'm gonna stay this way forever!

627
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,823
No!

628
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,197
Let's go!

629
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,493
Careful, gang.

630
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,501
This "Schwarzeneggian" oaf
almost destroyed us.

631
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,214
Go boom.

632
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,005
You are embarrassing.

633
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,192
That was almost exactly like
my freshman year in college.

634
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,781
What are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be sick, Scooby.

635
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,368
I invented a potion.

636
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,366
You lied to us. We're a team.

637
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,624
You don't just go off half-cocked
doing whatever you want.

638
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,038
Hey, gang.

639
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,670
"Beware who enters the Monster Hive.

640
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,554
Inside your fears will come alive."

641
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,893
Oh, my.

642
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:41,516
Look! It's the costumes
from the museum!

643
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,397
- Zombie.
- Miner 49er.

644
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,784
- Captain Cutler.
- I bet they're all here.

645
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:52,815
He must have used the costumes
to make real monsters, which implies...

646
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,330
He needs the costumes to make
the monsters, which implies...

647
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:01,793
He already had a Pterodactyl Ghost
costume somehow, which implies...

648
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,248
Patrick's the one.

649
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,921
Velm♪s in love.

650
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,589
No, I mean the one.

651
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,586
The bad guy.

652
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,511
That's why he wanted to go out with me.

653
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,927
To see what we knew.

654
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,941
We just saw Patrick
at the bad guys' hangout.

655
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,274
He was working both sides
of Psycho Street.

656
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,111
I don't know who's behind this,
but we don't need him...

657
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,608
transforming more costumes.

658
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,780
Let's find a way to shut down
this monster-maker for good.

659
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,278
Guys? What's over here?

660
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,621
This light is strange.

661
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,623
Psst. Scooby-Doo.

662
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,962
We're the ones that found this place.

663
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,464
- Score one for the big guys!
- Yay!

664
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,546
Now we need to keep acting
like mondo-groovy detectives.

665
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,593
- Come on.
- Okay.

666
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,346
Like, wowee.

667
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,146
Cool! Like, "tuneage."

668
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,885
Like, what's that weird sound?

669
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,347
Captain Cutler!

670
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,522
Miner 49er!

671
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,364
The Tar Monster!

672
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,531
We have...

673
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,033
to remain...

674
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,532
- calm.
- Ahh!

675
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,120
Calm, Scooby-Doo!
You're not being calm!

676
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,372
I needed that.
I needed that too.

677
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,711
You're pushing your luck, Scoob!

678
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,216
You girls find anything?

679
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,560
- He did it.
- Scoob!

680
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,221
Fred, disconnect that control panel!

681
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,733
Maybe it'll stop the machine!

682
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,925
Come on, this way! Quick, the elevator!

683
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,967
- Like, The 10,000 Volt Ghost!
- Come on, Scoob!

684
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,596
We're gonna die!

685
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,099
- Think positive!
- We're gonna die quickly!

686
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,692
Wait for me!

687
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,037
Come on, girls!

688
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,795
- An exit!
- Run, Shaggy!

689
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,017
Stop them!

690
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:57,896
Destroy the city if you have to,
but get me that control panel!

691
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:02,818
With it, they can destroy everything
I've set out to do.

692
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,659
Hurry up, gang.
We need to find Shaggy and Scooby.

693
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,735
End of the line, Mystery Inc.!

694
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,830
Die!

695
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,011
Let's book, Scoob.

696
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,845
Oh, boy.

697
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,425
Let's rip it, Scoob!

698
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,347
Zoinks!

699
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,866
I don't know.

700
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,039
- Banzai!
- Woo-hoo!

701
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,878
We're getting rad!

702
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,594
Like, this pipe's ripping, Scoob!
Zoinks!

703
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,659
Hello.

704
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,343
Scooby!

705
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,639
Are you guys okay?

706
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:02,936
Sure. As long as you define "okay"
as "in massive agony."

707
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,399
Yeah.

708
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,451
We should get back to headquarters.

709
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,284
No! That'll be the first place
they'll look for us.

710
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,029
I think I know where to go.

711
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,622
Move that worthless piece of tin!

712
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,665
Unlike some of you,
I have a very important meeting!

713
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:35,221
Citizens! Turn in Mystery lnc.

714
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:40,062
Your reward: We'll let you live.

715
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:47,402
My monsters can make life
very unpleasant.

716
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:02,837
Find me Mystery lnc., now.

717
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:07,506
Heather Jasper-Howe with an emergency
update for lnvestigative Probe.

718
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,335
A monster army has invaded Coolsville.

719
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,350
Angry citizens have gathered
outside Mystery lnc.'s offices in protest.

720
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:18,524
They're insisting the gang cooperate
with the Evil Masked Figure's demands.

721
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,845
Mystery Stink! Mystery Stink!

722
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,028
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

723
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,446
I beg you, Mystery lnc.

724
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,041
If you can hear me, turn yourselves in.

725
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,710
If we do, he'll get the control panel back,
and the city will be in worse shape.

726
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,720
We'd be playing right into his hands.

727
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,973
Please. For our city's sake.

728
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,903
Sorry. You're cancelled.

729
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,260
The old high-school clubhouse.

730
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,758
We should be safe here.

731
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,561
We haven't been here in years.

732
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,437
Freddy, are you okay?

733
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,738
- Do you wanna talk?
- Talking's for wimps.

734
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,704
It's time for action.

735
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,786
You know, Scoob...

736
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,550
this Evil Masked Figure
is turning Coolsville into Ghoulsville.

737
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,048
And the gang is totally
taking a hit for it.

738
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,627
Yeah.

739
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:20,104
Like, this is the most "our-faultiest"
screwup ever, Scoob.

740
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,598
Still works.

741
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,944
Look, all my old tools.

742
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,151
After all our so-called success...

743
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,492
we're back in this old firetrap.

744
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,590
Hit me, Fred.

745
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,176
Oh, Shaggy.

746
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,773
Good throw, Velm!

747
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,305
- Gotcha!
- Hey!

748
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,443
Shaggy, throw it to me!

749
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,191
- Go long!
- Okay.

750
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,320
- Go, Scooby!
- Go, Scooby-Doo!

751
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,658
Dude!

752
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,424
It all seemed so easy back then.

753
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,785
Yeah.

754
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:37,011
We solved mysteries for the love of them,
not to prove anything to anyone.

755
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:42,886
Yeah. And the mysteries all seemed
to unravel themselves.

756
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,886
Sometimes, the answers
would just appear like magic.

757
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,813
Hey.

758
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,900
My first multiple-resonance
imaging device.

759
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:56,025
Made out of a crystal radio
and old video games.

760
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,454
Wait a minute.

761
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:04,737
Randamonium has an algorithmic
cross-currency of negative 4.121.

762
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,414
With it, maybe...
Well, just maybe...

763
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,080
We could reverse the current
and reverse the monster-making process!

764
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,920
Yes. All we need to do
is rewire the control panel...

765
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,757
Bring it back to the Monster Hive
and plug it into the base.

766
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,513
- Right. Push the button...
- And instead of creating monsters...

767
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,757
all the monsters will be destroyed.

768
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,956
Like, they're totally having
a montage in there without us.

769
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,631
Yeah.

770
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:04,969
I'll tell you one thing for sure.
They don't need our help to figure it out.

771
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,808
- We're screwups.
- Yeah.

772
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,814
The only time we do anything right...

773
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,725
is when we accidentally plow
into the Snow Ghost...

774
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:16,114
because we've accidentally glued our
feet to rocket-powered roller-skates.

775
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:19,154
Yeah. Eight stupid times.

776
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,153
Face it, Scoob.

777
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,661
We'll never be anything
but our old goofy selves.

778
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,494
I wish once...

779
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,501
just once...

780
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,540
I could do the right thing on purpose.

781
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,168
- You know, Scoob?
- Yeah.

782
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,336
Like, be a hero...

783
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,054
and save the day.

784
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,553
But who are we kidding, right?

785
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,322
Captain Cutler's Ghost.

786
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,320
Captain Cutler's Ghost!

787
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,830
They found us. Finish that in the van
when we get to the Monster Hive.

788
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:16,210
- Come on, guys! In the van!
- Hurry!

789
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,212
Go, Fred! Hit it!

790
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,385
Yikes!

791
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,680
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

792
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,602
Fine. Let's go back!

793
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,864
That's the wrong way!

794
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,749
Shaggy! Give me a hand.

795
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,584
This is tied for
the most terrifying day of my life.

796
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:01,040
- Tied with what?
- Every other freaking day of my life!

797
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,252
It's done!

798
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,099
Jinkies! Tweety's back.

799
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,517
- Shaggy!
- Yeah?

800
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,395
I'm putting her in cruise.
Take the wheel.

801
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,153
Go!

802
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,282
Take this!

803
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:38,254
- This is bad.
- No doubt.

804
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,628
- Shaggy?
- Yeah.

805
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,293
- Who's driving?
- Uh...

806
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:44,961
Hello.

807
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,421
- Scoob.
- What?

808
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,399
- Scooby, turn the wheel!
- Wheel?

809
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,487
- Scooby, turn the wheel!
- The round thing, Scoob!

810
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,488
- Scooby!
- Okay.

811
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,672
Yahoo!

812
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:26,502
I'm driving!

813
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:35,853
Watch out, Scoob!

814
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,226
Scooby-doo!

815
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,360
You did it, Scoob!

816
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,156
All right, gang.
The Monster Hive is right over there.

817
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,453
Let's get this control panel
and plug her in.

818
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,511
You go nowhere, knave.

819
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,892
You guys take the long way around.

820
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,675
And I'll hold him off.

821
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,399
- Come on.
- Go get him, Fred.

822
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,587
- Come on, Daph!
- I'm coming!

823
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:42,467
Not so fast!

824
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:48,983
You guys go. I'll take care of Sparky.
Just get that control panel to the Hive.

825
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,358
- Go!
- We've got it, Daph!

826
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,790
Ooh, scary.

827
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:07,365
Taste the pain, Mr. Glowy Ugly Thing.

828
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:25,182
Daph?

829
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:28,352
- Daph, are you okay?
- I think so.

830
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,395
Guess this is it, huh?

831
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,357
Oh, baby.

832
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,195
I'm afraid.

833
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,195
What a wimp, huh?

834
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,502
That doesn't make you a wimp.

835
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,746
Makes you human.

836
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:57,723
The Skeleton Men.

837
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,717
- He does that when he gets nerous.
- Sorry.

838
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:20,025
- Here, Shaggy, take this.
- Why are you giving this to me?

839
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:22,367
I'll distract those skeletal screwballs.

840
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,873
- Get this to the Monster Hive.
- Us?

841
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,075
Yes. You're faster than me.

842
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:30,746
Once there, just plug it into the base.
Push this button.

843
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,708
I fixed it so it will destroy
all the monsters.

844
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,958
But... But...

845
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:39,513
- we can't.
- We're screwups.

846
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,335
We tried to be heroes like you guys,
but we're not.

847
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,261
- We're just not.
- No.

848
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:45,931
Like me?

849
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:52,941
That's funny.
I always wanted to be like you guys.

850
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:58,606
You guys are so free. You're never afraid
to be who you really are.

851
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:03,783
Whether you're fearful or joyful or hungry.

852
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,492
I think you've been heroes all along.

853
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,245
You just haven't known it.

854
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:14,792
Here I go.

855
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:23,013
Heroes.

856
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,642
On your knees, knave.

857
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,474
Can't you see we're talking?

858
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,021
Talking is for wimps.

859
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,112
You can't fool me
with that macho façade.

860
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:40,029
You're just afraid to show
your sensitive side.

861
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,446
Ooh, you've touched my inner child.

862
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,317
And he's really mad!

863
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,657
- Come on, Scoob.
- Okay.

864
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:57,672
- Miner 49er!
- Uh-oh.

865
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:05,761
Eh?

866
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:15,189
I'll get you, you varmints!

867
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,483
Hey!

868
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:30,953
Jinkies.

869
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,881
Dead end.

870
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:50,596
Remember when we were young
and you used to wear that jumper?

871
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:55,564
- What? Me? In a jumper?
- And we used to watch cable?

872
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:03,744
Do it!

873
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,526
Lights out.

874
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,914
Blackout! Blackout!

875
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,259
Oh, crap.

876
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:51,947
Take this, daddy-o. It's a real gas.

877
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:05,301
Come on. Let's go, Scoob!

878
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,130
Ow-wee.

879
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,130
My glasses.

880
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,466
Oh, brother. Not again.

881
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,811
I've got to consider contact lenses.

882
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:18,683
What?

883
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:39,998
Some kind of scary bat.

884
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,334
Wait a minute.

885
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:47,836
That's the pterodactyl.

886
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,633
The Pterodactyl Ghost.

887
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:56,513
What's this?

888
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,372
A shrine!

889
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:19,869
To Jonathan Jacobo?

890
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,250
But who would be so obsessed with him?

891
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:31,383
Velma.

892
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:33,507
Lose something?

893
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,062
Patrick.

894
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:50,902
Uh, what are you doing here?

895
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:54,574
I'm trying to solve this mystery.
Same as you.

896
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:59,914
That is what you're doing, right?
Trying to solve this mystery?

897
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,498
Yes.

898
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,580
Why are you so obsessed
with Jonathan Jacobo?

899
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:11,712
- What are you talking about?
- No way, Jose.

900
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,300
Velma.

901
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,590
Velma! Velma!

902
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,559
Stay away from me.

903
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,104
I know who you are.

904
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:34,609
- Velma, let go of the grate.
- So I can fall to my death?

905
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:36,451
No, so I can pull you up.

906
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:43,446
- You gotta trust me.
- No. I only trust the facts.

907
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,922
And all the facts say
that you're the Evil Masked Figure.

908
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,285
What does your heart say?

909
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:54,632
I don't know.
It's beating too loud for me to hear.

910
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:58,472
Look deeper. You gotta trust me.

911
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:14,775
You saved my life.

912
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,446
Patrick!

913
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,159
Velma!

914
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,331
That thing just flew off with Patrick!

915
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:30,668
The best we can do for him is get
that control panel back where it belongs.

916
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:33,632
Where is it?

917
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,514
I, uh...

918
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,634
gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.

919
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:43,806
That's weird. It sounded like you just said
you gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.

920
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,860
I think we lost them.

921
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,990
Scoob, we made it.

922
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,330
You should never have locked those locks.

923
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:08,035
Now you're stuck in here with me!

924
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:11,036
The Cotton Candy Glob.

925
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,503
- Cotton Candy Glob?
- Cotton Candy Glob?

926
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:17,207
Yes.

927
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,724
No! I'll give you cavities!

928
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,852
I don't see Shaggy and Scooby anywhere.

929
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:32,229
Poor guys are probably running around
helpless and terrified.

930
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,824
This is like the greatest day...

931
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,566
- of our lives, Scoob.
- Yeah.

932
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,738
Finally, a monster
we could sink our teeth into.

933
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:47,748
I'm kind of thirsty. I wonder if there's
a Liter-sized Soda Glob anywhere?

934
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:51,254
- Come on, guys. We have to hurry.
- Come on.

935
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,208
We have to get this
control panel back before...

936
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,180
Before exactly that happens.

937
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:07,095
At last I have you, Mystery lnc.

938
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:11,854
You'll never make it past my monsters.

939
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,360
We've taken these jerks before, gang.
Let's do it again.

940
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:24,121
- Fred!
- It's not them you need to worry about.

941
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,493
Now you are stuck in my trap.

942
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:30,867
Daphne!

943
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,132
Daph!

944
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:42,092
Gotcha!

945
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,302
Go! Daphne!

946
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:49,522
Run, Velma.
Run, Velma!

947
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,523
Shaggy! Here!

948
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,021
Come on!

949
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:03,737
Soon your friends will be dead...

950
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,775
and Coolsville destroyed.

951
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:08,623
My revenge will be final...

952
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:12,656
and there's nothing you can do about it.

953
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,415
Help, Velma!

954
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:18,542
Daphne?

955
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:23,627
- Shaggy?
- Scoob...

956
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:33,101
Hmm.

957
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:40,565
Dude.

958
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:51,195
- Like, frostbite never felt so good!
- Stop them!

959
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:55,829
- Go long, Scoob!
- Okay.

960
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,667
Here, doggy-doggy.

961
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:03,962
Rail glide!

962
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:07,222
- Watch this!
- Roll barrel!

963
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:16,733
Hang time!

964
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:22,903
End of the line, Doo!

965
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:26,235
Come here, you worthless mutt!

966
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:54,219
Scoob!

967
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:02,187
You can do it, buddy!

968
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,617
You can't do this to me!

969
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,460
Who do you think you are?

970
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,714
Scooby...

971
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,089
Dooby...

972
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,295
Doo!

973
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,972
No!

974
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,199
My monsters!

975
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:09,174
You did it! You saved us all!

976
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,631
I know.

977
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:24,359
Do you know the identity
of the Evil Masked Figure behind it all?

978
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:27,862
If our hunch is correct,
the Evil Masked Figure is...

979
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,226
No!

980
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:35,195
Heather Jasper-Howe.

981
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,197
Yeah. Huh?

982
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,996
But she was at the museum
when the Masked Figure was on the roof.

983
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:43,044
You almost had me there, didn't you?

984
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:46,789
Lucky for her, she had an assistant
helping her with her evil plans.

985
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:49,546
Ned.

986
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,140
When I realized
she was the Evil Masked Figure...

987
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,643
he quickly changed into her costume.

988
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:58,966
But why did she do it?

989
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:03,520
Because Heather Jasper-Howe
is actually...

990
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:10,232
Doctor Jonathan Jacobo.

991
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:13,322
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

992
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,068
But how do you know this?

993
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:19,581
A photo, taken of Jacobo
in front of the Coolsonian.

994
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:23,084
Jacobo supposedly died
a year before construction even began.

995
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:26,789
So Jacobo survived that fall
off the prison wall.

996
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:29,923
He adapted the false
Heather Jasper-Howe persona...

997
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,668
to turn the press against us.

998
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,590
Then he framed Old Man Wickles...

999
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:37,218
by putting that book and
The Black Knight Ghost in his mansion.

1000
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:40,597
As if you getting the lead
in My Fair Lady wasn't enough!

1001
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:44,685
I was an excellent Eliza!
You were too act-y.

1002
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,773
And stealing my Tater Tots!

1003
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,018
You kept saying you felt puffy!

1004
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:53,186
And the real identity of Ned is...

1005
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:55,275
Ow.

1006
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:57,696
Ned.

1007
01:23:57,907 --> 01:23:59,197
Huh?

1008
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:04,248
I would have gotten away with it
if it weren't for those meddling punks...

1009
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,964
and their dumb dog!

1010
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:15,129
- You were a dude this whole time?
- Of course, dummkopf.

1011
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:17,627
But we cuddled.

1012
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,725
- Hi.
- Hi.

1013
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:30,398
Listen, Velma, I know
that must have seemed very suspicious...

1014
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:31,895
- but you've...
- No.

1015
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,647
Got to believe me that
I had nothing to do with...

1016
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:36,361
I trust you.

1017
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:38,735
Listen, Patrick.

1018
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:43,831
I'm not glamorous or mysterious.

1019
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,246
But one thing that's true is...

1020
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,250
that I like you.

1021
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,843
Very much.

1022
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:58,089
And I would like
to go out with you again.

1023
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,177
But this time, I will go as myself.

1024
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:08,807
Yeah, I'd like that, more than anything.

1025
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:11,398
Okay.

1026
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:18,611
Mystery Inc.! Mystery Inc.!

1027
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:22,410
Hey. They're cheering for us again.

1028
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:27,037
Yep. I always thought that was
the best thing in the world.

1029
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,705
I guess I found something
a little bit better.

1030
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,706
- Okay.
- Shaggy...

1031
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:35,497
- can we get your photo in this?
- Yes.

1032
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:46,312
Yikes! A monster!

1033
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:55,571
- Like, Scoob, it's me, man!
- Shaggy!

1034
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:08,083
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

1035
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,245
Sing it up, Ruben.

1036
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:17,961
Everybody.

1037
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:41,404
Come on, Shaggy.

1038
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:45,865
Get down.

1039
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,208
Game Boy Advance secret code.

1040
01:32:27,305 --> 01:33:27,930
