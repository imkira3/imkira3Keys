1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,093
(lively African tribal theme plays)

2
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,541
(elephant trumpets)

3
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,546
(Skipper) OK. Wind her up, boys!

4
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,382
It's Monte Carlo or bust.

5
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,800
- Struts.
(Rico) Check.

6
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:51,926
(Skipper) Flaps.
(Kowalski) Check.

7
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,302
(Skipper) Diamonds and gold.
(Kowalski) Check.

8
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,387
(chitters)

9
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,890
(Skipper) We'll be back from our
gambling spree in a couple weeks.

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,976
(all) Bye!
(Skipper) Or whenever the gold runs out.

11
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,102
- Buh-bye!
- Good-bye.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,937
All right! We'll be waiting for you!

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,107
Just kidding!
We're never coming back!

14
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,567
Sorry! What was that?

15
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,360
(Skipper) Initiate warp drive.
(whirring)

16
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,242
Did they just say
they were never coming back?

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,995
Guys?

18
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,415
(squeaking)

19
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,209
- Marty?
- Oh, goody, you're here!

20
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,503
(shrieks)
- Why don't you just chew on this?

21
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,756
I'm hungry. (smacking)

22
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,883
(screams)

23
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,718
(Melman) Ow!

24
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,095
I'm just messing with you.

25
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,056
I lost all feeling
in this thing years ago.

26
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,352
(cackles, snores)
- Melman? Why do you look like that?

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,396
(shouts)
- Ooh, look who's talking.

28
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,566
Gloria? Why are you guys so... elderly?

29
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,486
Now, when was the last time
you looked in the mirror?

30
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,154
- What?
(Gloria) Hmm?

31
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,866
- No!
- Wake up! Wake up, Ally-Al!

32
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,618
- Wake up!
- Marty! (gasps)

33
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,370
- Marty, it was horrible.
- That same nightmare again, huh?

34
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,624
We were stuck here in Africa,
and we were all super-old and wrinkly...

35
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,251
Well, I aged well,
but the rest of you looked terrible!

36
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,421
Relax, Alex.
'Cause I got a surprise for you!

37
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,049
(gasps) Is it the penguins?
Have they come to take us home?

38
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,885
Nope. But it's the next best thing.

39
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,971
(sighs) Another day bites the dust.
- Come on, now!

40
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,890
- Watch it. Watch yourself. Small divots!
(grunts)

41
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,143
Sorry, little incline there.
Back up this hill.

42
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,353
Ow!

43
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:29,315
A low-hanging branch,
then just over this bluff and voilà!

44
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,567
(grunting, groaning)

45
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,612
Happy birthday, pal!

46
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,782
(sighs) Whoa.
(siren wails, horns honk)

47
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,330
Wow! New York City.

48
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,499
(Gloria, Melman) Surprise!

49
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,961
Gloria! You're the Statue of Liberty!

50
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,088
Bring me your huddled masses, baby!

51
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,632
And, Melman, you're the Brooklyn Bridge!

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,425
Actually, I'm the Triboro Bridge.

53
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,345
Wow! You guys made this?

54
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,266
Yeah. From memory!
From crazy, obsessive memory.

55
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,895
(laughing) Hey!
Fifth Avenue... with no traffic!

56
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:12,066
There's Times Square, with its
modern-day corporate lack of character.

57
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,944
Nine Duane Reades on the same street!

58
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,365
And the zoo.

59
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,534
Wow, our home.

60
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,286
Look! There's a little me.

61
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,038
And little all of us-es!

62
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,880
(chanting) Alex! Alex! Alex!

63
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,426
(chanting continues)
(roars)

64
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,553
(cheering)

65
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,313
(laughing)

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,148
Oh, no!

67
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,485
(sobbing)

68
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,700
(blows nose, groans)

69
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,787
You guys.
You've both made and ruined my day.

70
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,956
Make a wish, sweetheart.

71
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,252
Ta-da!

72
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,004
Your wish has come true!

73
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,923
Oh, yay!
(stomach growls)

74
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,425
My tummy is speaking to me!

75
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,093
(Alex) Oh, gross!

76
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,930
Uh... I wouldn't eat
that side of the cake if I were you.

77
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,139
(lemurs shout)

78
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,974
Alex, what was your wish?

79
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,894
I wished we could go home.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

80
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,605
I love this.
But it's not the real thing.

81
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,358
That's because it's a mud model, Alex.

82
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,110
It's not actually New York.
I hope that was clear.

83
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,528
What are we doing?

84
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,531
Here we are relying on the penguins
to come back for us.

85
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,202
But... we should just go to Monte Carlo
and get them.

86
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,082
How do a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a
hippo walk into a casino in Monte Carlo?

87
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,335
- I don't know. Ask the rabbi!
- Hey, I'm serious.

88
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,421
Come on! We can do it!
We can do anything! It's us!

89
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,422
We're us!

90
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,925
Yeah, that's right.
We've gone halfway around the world!

91
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,929
Compared with that, Monte Carlo's
just a hop, skip and a swim away!

92
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,056
- Yeah.
- To home.

93
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,265
(Marty) Home!
(Melman) Home.

94
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,101
(Gloria) Home.
(Julien) Cheeseburger.

95
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,229
Tell you what, bet those penguins
will be glad to see us.

96
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,148
Yeah, they're probably
bored out of their minds!

97
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,611
(screeches)

98
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,992
(penguins grunting)

99
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,035
(pops, screeches)

100
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,040
You pillow fight
like a bunch of little girls!

101
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,333
Yah!

102
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:39,171
Chimichanga! These pillows
are filled with baby birds!

103
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,716
(rousing orchestral music plays)

104
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,862
(electronic beeping)

105
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,700
(mumbling)

106
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,911
- What?
- There it is. The casino!

107
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,165
(mumbling)
- What?

108
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,834
I said, "Perfect.
That's where we'll find the penguins."

109
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,086
(mumbling)

110
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,714
- What?
(gibbering)

111
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,591
Shh! Come on, guys.

112
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,135
Operation Penguin Extraction
does not include levity.

113
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,262
We can't draw attention to ourselves.

114
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,681
(whispering) We're invisible!

115
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,100
I'm talking really, really quiet.

<i>♪ Everybody dance now!</i>

00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,780
<i>♪ Yeah!</i>

120
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,035
(Alex) OK. Phase One: We break
into the casino, grab the penguins,

121
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,163
and get them to take us back to New York
in the Monkey-Powered Super Plane!

122
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,164
(Marty) Check.

123
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,375
Phase Two: We chew out the penguins
for abandoning us in Africa.

124
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,543
(Melman) Check.

125
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,254
Phase Three:
We apologize to the penguins

126
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,759
for overly harsh chewing outing,
but we've gotten our point across.

127
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,804
Phase Four: Back to New York City.

128
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,846
- Yes!
- I like it!

129
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,767
(grunts) All right, we take
these ventilation ducts

130
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,311
to the crawlspace above the casino
where we find the penguins.

131
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,315
I just need to figure out
which duct each of us should take.

132
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,109

Uh-oh.

Oh, no!

145
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,772

- OK, OK. I got you. I got you, honey.

146
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,609
(Gloria laughs)

147
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,615
Now, they're not gonna let
animals on to the casino floor,

148
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,451
so expect some kind of disguise.

149
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,206
(Marty) Whoa! Look at that!
That is one ugly, mug-ugly lady!

150
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,500
That is roach-killing ugly!

151
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,794
(Alex, whispering) That's not a lady.
That's the King of Versailles.

152
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,754
And that's not the King of Versailles.

153
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,174
That's the chimps.
And the chimps are like smoke.

154
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,969
And where there's smoke, there's fire.
And by fire, I mean the penguins!

155
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,805
(man) King of Versailles wins again.
- I say we let it ride.

(thuds)
(screeches)

157
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,311
Then we'll pick up the hippies
and fly back to New York in style.

158
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,687
Can we buy an Airbus A-380?

159
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,606
Solid gold, baby!

160
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,025
Sir! A solid gold plane
wouldn't be able to fly.

161
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,153
Kowalski, we'll be rich!
The rules of physics don't apply to us.

162
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,280
- Let it ride!
- Right-o!

163
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,073
(Gloria and Melman straining)

164
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:58,120
OK. In exactly two minutes and 17
seconds, the lemurs will cut the power.

165
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,288
- Now?
- No.

166
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,331
- OK?
- No.

167
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,332
- Now?
- No.

168
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,793
I drop down, grab the penguins.
You crank me up, and we are out of here.

169
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,338
Oh! Oh! Oh! Let me drop down!
I'll grab the penguins!

170
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,672
You don't have fingers, Marty.

171
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,466
- Now? Do it?
- No. No!

172
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,967
These are things a leader
has to think of.

173
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,220
Why should you be the leader?
Why not me?

174
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,888
'Cause I'm the phase tracker!

175
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,515
(man) The king is letting it ride.

176
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,435
(Marty) How did I get phased out?
(Alex) You're part of a phase.

177
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,562
A phase isn't something you own,
it's something you're in.

178
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,563
That's it.

179
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,900
Who voted you
Grand Phase Master anyway?

180
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,443
Me! I voted me!
'Cause I'm the leader!

181
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,528
(man) Black!
- That's it, baby!

182
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,529
- Now?
- No!

183
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,574
(man) The King of Versailles
wins it all!

184
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,201
- Maybe I should be in charge.
- Melman!

185
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,619
I am a doctor.

186
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,662
- Now!
- No.

187
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,829
Why can't we all be leaders?

188
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,165
Enough! I'm gonna lead.

189
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,334
(loud crashing)

190
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,675
(rope creaking)

191
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,595
(chuckles)
(screaming)

192
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,976
(Alex) Aha!
- What's new, pussycat?

193
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,435
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

194
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,231
- Marty, what phase are we at?
- Uh... Phase Three: Apologize!

195
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,400
Right. Oh, man, we are so sorry.

196
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,111
Apology accepted. Let's roll!

197
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,281
Marty! We skipped Phase Two!
We didn't chew them out!

198
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,658
Don't look at me.
I'm just following the leader!

199
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:18,909
(alarm rings)
(shudders)

200
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,412
- Now!
- I'm a bit busy right now.

201
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,038
Just pull the switch!

202
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,332
OK, fine.

203
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,835
(people screaming)

204
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,590
What the heck is going on
with the lights?

205
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,427
<i>♪ Yo, tell me what you want
What you really, really want</i>

206
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,595
<i>♪ I'll tell you what I want
What I really, really want...</i>

207
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,932
What are you doing?! Come on!

208
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,685
(screaming continuing)

209
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,355
Initiate lockdown!

210
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,817
And get me Captain Dubois
from Animal Control!

211
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,861
(phone ringing)

212
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,031
(woman singing
"Non je ne regrette rien")

213
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,491
(handset clicks)
(woman) Speak.

214
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,786
(man chattering excitedly)
(woman) <i>Oui.</i>

215
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,288
A zebra?

216
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,873
A hippo?

217
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,124
A giraffe?

218
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,126
A lion?!

219
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,963
When I was seven,
I strangled my first parrot,

220
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,759
flushed my first goldfish,
punched my first snake.

221
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:21,764
Now I have finally reached the moment
I have been preparing for my entire life.

222
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,266
The pinnacle of my career:

223
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,561
to hunt the king of the beasts!

224
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,777
- Ah!
(engines revving)

225
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,033
(woman screams)

226
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,494
- Oh, no.
- Lockdown, eh?

227
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,495
What do we do?

228
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,248
All right, everybody, stand back.
I got this one.

229
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,751
(thudding)

230
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,046
Never mind.

231
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,715
Well, you only get one chance
at a first impression.

232
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,883
(whistles)

233
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,469
(tires screech)
(engine rumbles)

234
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,929
(shouting)

235
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,350
- What just happened?
- Where are we? What is this?

236
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,144
We call it
the Luxury Assault Recreational Vehicle.

237
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,938
(computerized female voice)
<i>The car goes vroom-vroom!</i>

238
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,856
- Step on it, boys!
(engine revving)

239
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,692
(Melman screams)

240
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,615
(crowd screaming)

241
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,850
(engine races)

242
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,810
(dramatic music plays)

243
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,313
Captain Dubois, I am so happy
to see you! You will not believe...

244
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,609
Get back, you fool! Your cheap cologne
is obscuring the animal musk!

245
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,986
Oh, my face!

246
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:04,950
(sniffing)

247
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,088
(Dubois) Poor, poor animals.

248
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:22,176
You should never have left the forest.
Now you deal with me.

249
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,181
Kowalski, signal the chimps to meet us

250
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,391
at the rendezvous point
with the Super Plane.

251
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,602
- Hotel Ambassador. Let's move it!
(honking)

252
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,770
Whoo-hoo!

253
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,023
Ow! Huh?

254
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,983
(sirens wailing)

255
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,402
Voilá. Giraffe at twelve o'clock.

256
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,863
Guys, we've got a tail.

257
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,615
Paparazzi!

258
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,034
Pedal to the metal, Private.

259
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,994
(Julien) Don't take any photos, please!

260
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,245
- Hi!
(grunts)

261
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,122
Here I am!

262
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,043
Don't take... (in slow motion)
any... photos. (chuckles)

263
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,004
(Mort) No more pictures!
(Skipper) Medic!

264
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,598
- ETA to rendezvous point?
- Two minutes, 37 seconds, sir.

265
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,849
Man your battle stations!

266
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,937
Hey! Wait! Nobody's at the wheel!

267
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,815
Get back there! Negative on the driver!
There's no driver!

268
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,236
(Gloria) Help! Nobody's driving!
Oh, no! We're going to die!

269
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,947
Don't just sit there, fancy pants.
Grab the wheel!

270
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,865
Are you kidding?
I don't drive. I'm a New Yorker!

271
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,116
Move over, Miss Daisy!

272
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,703
What are you doing? Zebras can't drive!
Only penguins and people can drive.

273
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,957
- What do all these buttons do?
("Any Way You Want lt" plays over stereo)

274
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,710
(Melman) Help me!
(Skipper) Nice one, Stripes!

275
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,719
Crazy woman gaining!

276
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,180
Our Omega-3 slick will take them down.

277
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,974
Private, activate!

278
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,655
She's good!

279
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,407
Kowalski, intel.

280
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,867
(Kowalski) Sir.
We have a serious problem.

281
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,327
Captain Chantal Dubois.

282
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,497
Monaco Animal Control.
Perfect case record.

283
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,499
(shouting)

284
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,631
- You're going the wrong way, Marty!
- Just call me Marty-o Andretti.

285
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,509
- No. You're Sucky-o Andretti!
(Marty) Stop backseat driving!

286
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,761
(Alex) I'm passenger-seat driving.
Give me the wheel.

287
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,346
(Marty) It's not a wheel, it's my baby!

288
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,140
Your hoofs aren't meant to be on a wheel!

289
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,267
- Hey! Too late for you to drive!
(Alex) Don't look at me!

290
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,352
Don't look at me when we argue!
Look at the road!

291
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,895
- Be cool, be cool!
(turns off stereo)

292
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,523
Hi, Officer. Is there a problem?

293
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,941
Hi.

294
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,110
(gun cocks)
(tires screech)

295
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,279
(Melman) Oh! Watch out!

296
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,452
(shrieking)
- We need more power.

297
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,830
Time to fire up
Kowalski's nucular reactor.

298
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,875
- That's a nuclear reactor?
- Nucular.

299
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,085
She's on the roof!

300
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,880
(Kowalski) But, sir, it's not ready.
The control rods'll have to be calibrated.

301
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,882
And don't even ask me
about the Uranium-238 blanket.

302
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,216
OK.

303
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,136
(screaming)

304
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,934
OK, Marty, we lost her!
Maybe you can slow down now.

305
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,478
I can't! There's no brakes!

306
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:23,106
No brakes?
Way to commit, soldier.

307
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,193
(screaming)
(Mort giggling)

308
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,624
(metal grinding)
(Melman whimpering)

309
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,047
Let's get out of here!

310
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,924
(Gloria) Go, go, go! Move! Now!

311
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,261
Hey, where's everybody going? (laughs)

312
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,055
(screaming)

313
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,264
Oh!

314
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,773
(wind gusting)
- I'm flying!

00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:09,444
I'm flying!
I'm the first flying monkey!

316
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,489
(Gloria cheers)
- Oh, yay!

317
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,032
That's our ticket out of here!

318
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,536
(Julien moaning)
- Yeah, baby!

319

Everybody!
On the monkey chain!

322
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,023
Deploy banana gun!

323

324
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,668
(Alex) Grab the little guys!
Toss them up! Let's go! Go, go, go! Go!

325

(Marty) Faster! Faster! Faster! Come on!

326

- Come on, Melman!

327
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,307
- Whoo! Yeah! (grunts)
- Melman!

328
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,267

330
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,693
Put your backs into it!
Double banana overtime!

331

332

333
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,369
Serpentine! Serpentine!

(Melman choking)

337
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,771
Hey, this lady's
really starting to freak me out.

338
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,899
(Dubois growls)
- Fix it, Mort.

339
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,109

340
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,779
(Dubois grunting)

341
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,031
Hold this.

342
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,368
Alex, be careful! She's crazy!

343
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,786
You think, Marty?!

344
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,121
(moaning)

345
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,958
Ah!

346
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,841
That's right! Home free, baby!

347
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,509
(Melman) I can breathe!

Get back here! We have a contract!

375
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,089
Yes. Well, I'm afraid labor laws
are slightly more lenient in France.

376
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,884
You see, they only have to work
two weeks a year.

377
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,720
Well, someone else
has the Canadian work ethic!

But you penguins,
you can still fix it, right? Right?

Yeah, yeah. You're
a little crackerjack, can-do team.

You want me to give it to you straight?

Yes! Yes! No.

Bend it a little?

00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:18,068
Well, the plane's totaled.
Kaput, blammo, busted!

Never to fly again.

385

So that's it? That's it then,
we're never gonna get home?

386
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,116
No! We've got to get home!

Yeah, guys, come on, we'll fix it!

Marty! Drag that thingy over here.

It's the fuzz!

What are we gonna do?
We can't hide forever!

398
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,325
And we can't just blend!
You know this ain't Africa.

399
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,327
Oh, what's the point?

400
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,998
Tell me one conceivable way
that extra-large animals like us

401
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,669
are gonna be able to move through Europe
without attracting unwanted attention.

405
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,014
Please, you got to hide us.
Just until the heat dies down.

406

Absolut no outsiders.

So wipe that Smirnoff your face

one cat a solid. Cat to cat.

409
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,441
Do a solid here, buddy. Come on.

They sound like they be in trouble.

412
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:50,618
(tiger) Stefano, we do not invite trouble
into our circus. I don't trust lion.

413
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,038
Hair too big and glossy!

414
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,123
(Stefano) Aw, come on, Vitaly,
you're being mean.

415
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,294
(Vitaly) He not lion.
He lioness... with a beehive. (chortles)

416
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,338
This is awkward.
We can hear everything they're saying.

Eh... Just give us a minute.
He's on the phone and... can't get him off!

Wait, listen! We are circus animals.
You got to let us in!

423
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,695
You are really circus?

Yes. Full circus!

- Yeah, we...
- Absolutely.

435
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:24,129
- We're relatively well known...
- But Alex is really the star.

436
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,299
Well, I'm not... I wouldn't say "star."
More like... well, star.

437
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,467
What is your act, Alice?

438
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,304
Well... I basically,
uh, I jump up on my rock...

439
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,932
- Rock?
- Yeah. It's a very high... rock.

440
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,934
- A really high rock!
- And then?

441
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:42,730
And then, well, I roar like...
like a serious "Rawrrr!"

442
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,316
- And then?
- And then I jump off the rock.

443
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,861
- And then?!
- And then... And then what?

444
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,279
- That is all?
- Into a pool!

445
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,322
- Full of water!
- Full of cobras!

446
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,158
Actually, it appears
like I'm jumping in to a pool...

447
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,160
- With cobras!
- Aquatic cobras.

448
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,412
For effect. But I actually pull up
at the last second.

449
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,454
- Pull up?
- Yeah.

450
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,373
- How do you do that?!
- Wire harness!

451
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,708
- Balloons!
- Jet pack!

452
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,085
(stammering)

453
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,882
(chuckles) I flip off the wire harness,
ignite my jet pack,

454
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,676
and then toss balloons
to the children of the world.

455
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,303
Kids love it. Kids always love that.

456
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,514
(Vitaly scoffs)
- Is this like the trapeze?

457
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,850
Yes! Trapeze! Exactly!

458

Wow! Trapeze <i>americano!</i>

Maybe you come with us to Roma!

461

Hey, Vitaly is just playing around.
He is good, no?

462

Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

That is such a coincidence!

- What?!
- America?

469
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,212
- Going to America?
- What?

00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,652
I just wanted to thank you
for letting us get on the train back there.

628
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,988
(in Russian accent) I know the big cat
with the accent... (chuckles)

629
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,199
...wasn't so excited about us getting on.

630
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,867
Look, lion guy.

631
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,953
This circus means everything to us.

632
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,582
And if you do anything
that threatens this circus,

633
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,711
you will have to answer to me. <i>Capisce?</i>

634
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,131
I <i>capisce</i>, cool. Trust me, we're cool.

635
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,051
(shouting)

636
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,976
You call this laying low?

637
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,562
(Julien) Whoo-hoo!

638
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,190
(shouting)

639
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,900
(train horn blares)

640
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,653
(squeaking)

641
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,409
(Julien) Faster! Faster!

642
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,912
Whoa, whoa, whoa! (laughing)

643
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,916
Where there is circus, there is lion.

644
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,961
(chuckling) And when in Rome...

645
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,005
<i>Vive la France!</i>
(engine revving)

646
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,928
(whistle trills)
- Halt!

647
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,514
(shrieks)

648
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,936
Come on, my hairy queen.
We'll do doughnuts in the Pantheon.

649
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,982
(cheering)

650
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,363
(gasps)
- You're in big trouble. (grunts)

651
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,448
Now you're really
in big troub... (grunts)

652
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,201
Now you're really, really in big tro...

653
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,705
- I'm new!
(gun clicking)

654
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,667
OK! Strike up the band!

655
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,043
You have a band?

656
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,005
("Sabre Dance" plays)

657
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,882
Prepare to be blown away!

658
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,301
- Blow me away!
- Here we go!

659
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,344
(laughs)

660
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,929
(cheering)

661
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,806
Look at this. Whoa! Hey!

662
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,684
It's nice to be... Ah! (screams)

663
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,561
Yay...

664
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,231
Hey!

665
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,111
Whoa! How do dogs do that?

666
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,905
(man) Get on with it!

667
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,075
(crowd booing)
<i>Stupido!</i>

668
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,493
Uh-oh.

669
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,956
(booing continues)

670
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:36,211
(trumpets)

671
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,255
(crowd gasps)

672
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,049
(Stefano shrieks)

673
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,762
Well, that was worth
the price of admission.

674
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,514
(whinnies)

675
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,478
- Watch it, mate!
(screams)

676
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,438
Who's from Cincinnati?

677
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,358
Stefano, you know
"blown away" means good, right?

678
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,027
Don't worry.
The big finale is coming up!

679
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,155
- Give me a downbeat! Look at this!
(playing off-key)

680
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:07,868
(groaning)
- Oh, no. No, this is not happening.

681
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,162
You have a deal, <i>mi amigo.</i>

682
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,705
(Stefano) It's good, no?

683
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,376
Yes, go out and get food and come back!

684
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,337
(crickets chirping)
(chuckles, hiccups)

685
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,547
(clamoring)

686
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,885
Deep breaths.
You're in a happy place. It's all good.

687
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,681
There's an angry mob outside,
and they're demanding their money back!

688
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,934
I think we all know the right thing to do.

689
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,728
("Sabre Dance" resumes)
(shouting)

690
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,649
Come on, come on!

691
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,234
(Marty) Come on! Hurry up!

692
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,320
- Hop on the train!
(gasps)

693
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,365
(angry shouting)

694
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,908
(babbles, shrieks)

695
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,743
(Gloria) Come on, guys!

696
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,663
<i>Mamma mia!</i>
(Gloria) Hurry up!

697
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,417
<i>Grazie</i>, Alice.

698
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,754
Just throw us the money!

699
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,466
Ah!

700
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,885
(excited chattering)

701
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,351
Captain Chantal Dubois. Get up.

702
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,689
I'm going to have to send you
back to Monaco under maximum security.

703
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,485
What?!

704
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,653
(gasps)

705
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,822
It's just a pillow!

706
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,491
Eh, that's the oldest trick
in the book, Comandante.

707
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,286
Every <i>bambino</i> in Italy knows that one.

708
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:36,373
Maybe, but do they know
about the old escape hole

709
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,084
behind the innocent-looking poster?

710
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,295
(groans)

711
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:46,425
Or the really old "I'm gonna
hide up on the ceiling" trick!

712
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:51,597
(clears throat)

713
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:52,765
(whistles)

714
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,018
Of course.
The secret tunnel under the bed!

715
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,561
Get this thing out of the way.

716
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,146
(policemen straining)

717
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,356
Let's go!

718
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,862
This secret tunnel is a dead end!

719
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,783
(policeman) There's nothing but bedsprings
and mattress stuffing down here!

720
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,787
(Comandante) Was that the sound
of a cell door closing?

721
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,128
(computer beeps)

722
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:24,922
Voilá!

723
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,341
(printer buzzing)

724
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,803
(Comandante) Was that the sound
of my HP printer printing?

725
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,814
(Alex groans) This is a disaster!

726
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,941
(Gloria) We blow all
our money on a bad circus,

727
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:47,736
- and we're not any closer to New York!
- If anything, we're further away!

728
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:51,073
We could have at least bought a circus
that knew how to circ!

729
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,660
I don't even know why we bought
a circus in the first place.

730
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,787
We had enough dough for a plane!

731
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,456
- Are you kidding me?
- You must have some money left over.

732
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,835
I used it to buy teeth
and then have them capped in gold.

733
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,170
Now I can eat apples!

734
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,966
Sadly, I discovered I don't like apples.

735
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:13,428
(Marty) No promoter is sending this show
to America. It's toe up!

736
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,473
(Gloria) Now it makes sense. No wonder
the circus master was so happy to sell.

737
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,933
Shh!

738
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,936
(Marty) He was happy, all right.
Happy about ripping us off!

739
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,146
(Alex shrieks)

740
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,609
- Where did Alex go?
- I don't know.

741
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,403
(screaming)

742
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,705
Come on! This way!

743
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,207
No, no, no. You come this way!

744
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,418
Alice, watch your head!

745
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,837
(train whistle blows)

746
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,338
Yah!

747
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,221
(gasps)

748
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,224
Alice!

749
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,483
Alice! (shrieks)

750
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,402
(Alex) I'm fine!
(shrieks)

751
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,653
Fantastic!

752
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,572
(train whistle blows)

753
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,783
Was that trapeze<i> americano?</i>

754
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,994
- Uh, yeah. Sort of.
- Incredible!

755
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,164
- I hope this is important.
- Come this way, Alice!

756
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,085
By the way, it's "icks" not "iss."
Alex. Like New York Knicks.

757
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:31,465
I know. New York Kniss. Is not hard.

758
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,217
Whoa.

759
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,519
What is this place?

760
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,397
I know you think we are
a stinky, poopy circus,

761
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,276
but there is something you must know.

762
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,821
There was a time
when Circus Zaragoza,

763
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,615
we were a great circus!

764
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,284
<i>Numero uno</i> in all the <i>Europa!</i>

765
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:04,122
And Vitaly...
he was the biggest star of us all.

766
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,293
He was fearless.
Taking risks. Always new.

767
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,546
He jump through the hoop
like he could fly!

768
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,597
(cheering)

769
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,852
Stefano!

770
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,938
Make the hoop smaller.

771
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,565
- Like this?
- Smaller.

772
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,985
- Like this?
- Good!

773
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,244
(squeals)

774
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,830
(growls)

775
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,999
(pops)
(crowd roaring)

776
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:52,170
(Stefano) <i>It had never been done before
because it was physically impossible!</i>

777
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:56,049
<i>And the people... they loved it!</i>

778
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,551
(female) <i>Viva</i> Vitaly!

779
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,969
Smaller!

780
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,518
Ha!

781
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,480
(pops)
(cheering)

782
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,858
(Stefano) <i>And the hoop, she got smaller!</i>

783
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,067
<i>Like the ring</i>

784
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:18,780
<i>on a finger of the tiniest lady
with the slimmest of fingers.</i>

785
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,657
Bravo, Vitaly!

786
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,704
(Stefano) <i>He would not stop pushing.</i>

787
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,123
<i>And one fateful day...</i>

788
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,792
<i>...he push too far!</i>

789
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,795
Light the hoop on fire!

790
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,380
(gasps)

791
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:47,392
(cheering)

792
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:59,071
(Stefano) <i>He fly too close to the sun...
and he got burned.</i>

793
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:04,409
<i>Literally. The extra virgin olive oil
is extra flammable.</i>

794
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,411
<i>And he lost everything.</i>

795
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,790
<i>His wife, she run off with a musician.</i>

796
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,335
<i>He lost his dignity... his fame...</i>

797
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:17,089
<i>...his passion... and his fur.</i>

798
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:22,094
<i>And when it grow back, it is less soft.
More like a prickly beard.</i>

799
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,262
<i>Scusí.</i> Vitaly!

800
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,932
(growls)
(shrieks) Nothing!

801
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,936
<i>His only passion now is the borscht.</i>

802
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,650
- Whoa.
- He was our inspiration.

803
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:38,527
So when he lost his passion,

804
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,780
well... as Vitaly goes,
so goes the circus.

805
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,450
- This is why we need your help.
- What sort of help?

806
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:49,579
You can teach us to do new circus.
<i>Americano</i> style!

807
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,039
We find a new passion.

808
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:56,128
Make a new show.
And we go all the way to US and A!

809
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,296
(chair squeaking)

810
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:01,675
A!

811
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,764
I know. It is <i>stupido</i> idea.

812
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,808
We are a lost cause.

813
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,688
No, no, this isn't <i>stupido.</i>
This could work!

814
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,566
- What?
- What you just said.

815
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,777
(gasps) What?
- The idea you said. Two seconds ago.

816
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,904
- What?
- Your <i>stupido</i> idea!

817
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,949
- It could?
- Stefano, you're a genius!

818
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,244
No, no, no, no.
I am only average intelligence.

819
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,956
Some say I'm even slightly below.

820
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,543
We are gonna rethink everything
anybody's ever known about circus!

821
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:41,214
I call it Phase 4-7B,
wherein, in order to get home,

822
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:45,510
we will come up with something fresh,
something amazing, something brand-new!

823
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,930
Fresh, never before seen!
Off the chain!

824
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,808
Something that'll blow
that circus promoter away!

825
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,561
(angry shouting)
- I missed.

826
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,606
- Off with your head!
- I'm gonna chew his leg off!

827
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,192
Circus has been same for generations!

828
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,360
We make good,
classic family entertainment.

829
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,197
Aha! But last few generations,

830
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,533
families... not so entertained.

831
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,203
(clears throat)

832
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,705
That's right.
Families not so entertained

833
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,416
because you're just going
through the motions out there.

834
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,502
It's missing passion.

835
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,297
How one to have passion
for stool poked in face?

836
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:26,092
Exactly! And by stool
you mean chair, right?

837
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,221
The fact is, you guys,
you got stuck in a rut.

838
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,182
You stopped pushing,
you stopped taking risks.

839
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,934
But those days are over.

840
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,145
Because now we're going
to completely change the show.

841
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,940
Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?

842
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,943
Circus is not about the acts you do.

843
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,654
Circus is in here.

844
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,073
How come Freddie
gets all the circus?

845
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:52,827
Circus is about following your passions,
wherever they take you!

846
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:57,207
(scoffs) You cannot change circus.
There is long tradition!

847
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:01,545
That's what everybody thought, Vitaly,
until those French Canadians came along,

848
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,756
drunk off their maple syrup
and cheap pharmaceuticals,

849
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,092
and completely flipped the paradigm.

850
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,430
Now they play Vegas.
Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.

851
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,683
And one of them
completely in the nude.

852
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,726
Yeah, that's right.
And you know how they did it?

853
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,853
Take off their clothes?

854
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,691
- No. They got rid of the animals.
(Stefano) What?

855
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,193
- Say it ain't so!
(Gia) <i>Che stupida!</i> No animals...

856
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,405
- How could they?!
- Well, you know what I say to that!

857
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,824
I say they can take
the animals out of the circus,

858
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:36,830
but they cannot take
the animals out of the circus!

859
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,084
I mean, they cannot... (clears throat)

860
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,461
I think you understand what I'm saying!

861
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,380
- Yeah!
- Yes!

862
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,548
Uh... No!

863
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:49,968
We don't need humans
because we've got passion.

864
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,845
What does a human say
when he's passionate?

865
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,306
He says, "I'm an animal!"
Well, we are animals!

866
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,474
(cheering)
(roaring)

867
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,352
We'll make an all-animal circus!

868
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,772
Because if we follow our passion,
we can go anywhere.

869
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,066
- Anywhere!
- We can do anything!

870
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,902
- Anything!
- If we do it together!

871
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,740
- All of us!
- Yeah... Yeah, yeah!

872
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,659
- Our circus!
- Yeah!

873
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,662
- We're in! We'll have some of that!
- Can I hear you say "fur power"?

874
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,414
Fur power!

875
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,208
Take our circus back,
and we'll do it together!

876
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,919
You and me, baby! An act together!

877
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:25,920
I love it!

878
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,214
We can do
that funk and groove dance thing!

879
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,425
- Uh, dance?
- This thing right here. Look.

880
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,511
(humming) Me and you! We got this!

881
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,805
(stammering) But I can't dance.

882
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,768
(chanting) Fur power!
- Chanting is fun! Chanting is fun!

883
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,939
Ah! I do not trust this lion.

884
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,609
Vitaly, I may not trust him, either,

885
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:51,946
but I am tired of sitting
and standing and rolling over.

886
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,825
It is great tradition
of sitting, standing, rolling over.

887
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,286
You know our circus is in trouble.

888
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:03,708
This could be our last chance.
But we will not do this without you.

889
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,836
Circus always stay together.

890
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,971
(sighs) OK. I do one hoop.

891
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,057
(squeals)

892
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,892
I want a hug, too!

893
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,311
- Oh!
(chuckles)

894
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,647
(laughing)

895
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,825
(engine rumbling)

896
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,244
(tires squeal)

897
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:44,249
<i>Attention!</i> I have found our lion!
He is hiding with the circus!

898
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,710
(monitors beeping rhythmically)

899
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,592
(slow instrumental intro begins)

900
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,979
(singing "Non je ne regrette rien")

901
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,805
(man shrieks)

902
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,189
(music slows, softens)

903
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,942
(singing finale)

904
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,988
(music crescendos)

905
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,366
(song ends)

906
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,661
(yodeling)

907
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,539
(Mort giggling)
Come on, Maurice, give it to me!

908
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,542
(Stefano) More boomstick, Rico!
I really want to fly!

909
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,378
Are you really going
to shoot yourself out of that thing?

910
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,425
I've always dreamed of doing this,
from time I was a little pup,

911
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,928
to be a human cannonball!

912
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,765
Except, you know...
a sea lion cannonball.

913
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,099
Is it dangerous?

914
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:28,853
Is it dangerous?
Yes, of course it's dangerous!

915
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,564
- Now, are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

916
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,609
'Cause if blowing up is your thing,
then you in the right place.

917
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,694
<i>Sí.</i> That's means yes!

918
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,154
Ready for launch?

919
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,073
Ready for launch!

920
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,910
Fire in the hole!

921
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,663
Wait!

922
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,584
(screaming)

923
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,466
(groans)

924
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,635
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

925
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,178
Help me!

926
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,388
(Stefano's voice echoing)

927
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:06,182
Rico! Get the cannon ready!
Same charge!

928
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,228
(Skipper) Fire in the hole!
- Oh!

929
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,691
(screaming)

930
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:23,616
Oh, oh! (shouting gleefully)

931
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,412
("Born Free" playing)
- All right! (laughs)

932
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,624
Oh! Whoo!

933
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,675
Yeah!

934
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:44,345
(howling)

935
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,641
Marty! I'm so glad you're here.

936
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,478
Whoo! I was flying! I was effin'-L-Y-in'!

937
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,480
I'm proud of you, but... (whimpers)

938
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,358
...I don't think
I can hold on much longer!

939
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,403
Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry about my enthusiasm.

940
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,989
Here, wrap this around you.

941
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,496
All right, I got you! I got you!

942
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,541
(shouts happily)
(howling)

943
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:23,176
Forget about being part of the herd!
I'm gonna be part of the flock!

944
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:27,847
- I'm going to fly, baby!
- Oh, yes! What a triumph!

945
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,225
- Hand over that circus, Freddie!
- I'll have your guts for garters!

946
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,102
Hey, hey, put your weapons down.

947
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,189
Guys, chill out. Cute and cuddly's
obviously not your thing.

948
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:37,649
He's got us pegged.

949
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,567
I got a better idea. Show 'em, Rico.

950
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,153
(buzzes)
(screams)

951
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,823
Oh, that was great!

952
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,786
- Flippin' 'eck!
- Rocket shoes!

953
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,956
(Freddie) I want to try that!
- Jonesy! Jonesy!

954
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,999
Whoo! Hey. Hi.

955
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,377
I admire how you
have inspired these animals.

956
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,461
Oh, thanks.

957
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,839
And what you said about passion,
it was like poetry.

958
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,841
I love passion and poetry.
They go together, really.

959
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,761
- I know they don't rhyme.
- Trapeze is my passion!

960
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,429
Terrific. I look forward
to seeing you up there.

961
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,056
You can teach me!

962
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,516
- What?
- Teach me.

963
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,434
Well, I've always
been kind of a solo act.

964
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,186
So that kind of rules that out.

965
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,272
I wonder if you actually do trapeze.

966
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,359
- Oh, I actually do do trapeze.
- Show me!

967
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,695
"Show me"? What are we, five?

968
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,613
I am five, yes.

969
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,657
(stammering, sighs)

970
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,367
(dance music plays)
(Melman) Dancing.

971
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,245
All you're doing is moving
and not getting anywhere.

972
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,956
I mean, the music
totally throws off my timing.

973
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,833
You want excitement? Ha-ha!

974
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:39,460
Check it out.
Who's on a tightrope, huh? Huh?

975
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,628
Who's on a...

976
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,630
(screams)
(Gloria humming)

977
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,383
- I'm on a tightrope! I'm on a tightrope!
(gasps)

978
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,843
Melman! Oh, my gosh!

979
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,636
- Help me!
- Baby, hold on. Hold on.

980
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,472
- I'm coming right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

981
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,728
- Melman?!
(yelling)

982
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,980
Ah! Ah! Ah!

983
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,314
Calm down, Melman.

984
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,650
I'm going to fall
and break all of my neck! Ah!

985
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,403
Just look at me. Look at me.

986
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,572
- All eyes on me.
- OK.

987
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,657
- Come to me.
(stammering) I can't.

988
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:13,745
It's just like dancing, Melman.
Two steps forward, one step back.

989
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,331
I can't dance, OK? There, I said it.

990
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,042
Maybe because you've never tried.

991
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,335
No, I have tried.

992
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,547
I practiced in private
because you dance so well.

993
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,341
You practiced? For me?

994
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,302
Yes, but it's no use.

995
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,054
I never know
what to do with my arms.

996
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,223
(shouting)
- Hold it.

997
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,893
That part is so easy, Melman. OK?

998
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:40,021
'Cause all you have to do
is put them around your partner.

999
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,357
See? Two steps forward.

1000
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,193
One step back.

1001
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,029
- I'm dancing. I'm dancing!
- Two steps forward...

1002
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:50,990
- We're dancing on a tightrope!
- You're great.

1003
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,618
- Whoo-hoo! I'm dancing!
(Gloria laughing)

1004
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:55,620
(Stefano screaming)

1005
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:59,874
OK. (exhales) Whoo! All right.

1006
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:03,127
So when do we get
the jet packs and aquatic cobras?

1007
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:06,255
Uh, this is a beginners' class,
and that's a pretty advanced maneuver.

1008
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,590
OK, how do we begin?

1009
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,926
It's a bit complicated
unless you understand

1010
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:13,471
the whole pitch and yaw...
arc and gravity.

1011
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:17,725
All that stuff,
which I won't bore you with. OK.

1012
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,602
- Do you need a push?
- No.

1013
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,979
Just watch and learn!

1014
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,149
(♪ Peter Asher:
"Love Always Comes as a Surprise")

1015
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,701
- Like that?
- That's one way of doing it, sure.

1016
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,955
(shouting)

1017
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,629
Wow! You use a net!

1018
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,507
Yes! Trapeze <i>americano.</i> We use the net.

1019
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,551
(squeals)

1020
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,305
Trapeze<i> americano!</i>

00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,851
(grunts)

1022
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,438
Whoa! (chuckling)

1023
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,447
Look at him go!

1024
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:17,618
(laughs) Whoa!

1025
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,714
Wow!

1026
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,300
(Marty howling)

1027
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,635

<i>É bravo! Bravissima!</i>

1030
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:44,061
Hey, Vitaly,
maybe you even do two hoops, no?

1031
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,067
Psst. <i>Señorita</i> Bell-bottoms.

1032

<i>Tenemos una problema grande.</i>

00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,989
<i>¿Qué? ¿Qué grande problema?</i>

1034
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,120
Oh, no! She's onto us!

1035
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,748
Shh! Don't make it
any easier on the psycho.

1036
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,626
- What are we gonna do?
- We'd better vamoose... pronto.

1037
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,920
But we're not ready.
We're in the middle of rehearsals.

1038
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,379
Then why don't you lilt over,

1039
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,674
grab your peduncle,
and kiss New York good-bye?

1040
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,927
Are you sure we are ready?

1041
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,763
Of course we're ready! Born ready!
Ready steady! Come on, let's go!

1042
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,181
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1043
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:24,101
(Skipper) All right, you heard the cat.
Move it! Come on! All aboard!

1044
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,229
Grab your luggage
and drain your bladders.

1045
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,439
It's going to be a long ride!

1046
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,316
(Julien) Whoa!

1047
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,866
All right, everybody,
let's blow that promoter away!

1048
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:43,287
(Melman) London, here we come!
(Marty) Sunshiny London, yes!

1049
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,845

(bells chiming)

1053
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:37,383
(Skipper) Come on, come on, come on.
Where is he?

1054
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,052
Bingo!

1055
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,806
If that's not a red-blooded
American promoter, I don't know what is.

1056
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:47,476
We need to get this show on the road.
Private! Tell them the eagle has landed.

1057
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,978
The eagle has landed!

1058
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,647
Roger that.
Oh, and keep an eye out for Dubois.

1059
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:52,648
Aye, aye, guvnor!

1060
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,233
The promoter is in the house!

1061
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,111
- New York is closer than ever!
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1062
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,488
First, we got a circus to do.
We're on, folks!

1063
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,074
- Do we go on before or after the dogs?
- Yes.

1064
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,993
- What?
- Overlap, your acts overlap.

1065
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,746
- Where's Vitaly? He opens.
- I don't know.

1066
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,541
Stefano! Hey, Stefano!
Have you seen Vitaly?

1067
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,710
(Stefano weeping)
- Hey.

1068
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,422
Stefano, why the sad little face?

1069
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,300
Vitaly... he will not go on!

1070
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:22,386
- What?
- I tried everything I could.

1071
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,430
(weeping)
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1072
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:27,099
Wipe away the tears. Calm down.

1073
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:30,686
Where is he?
I'm sure I can reason with him.

1074
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,941
- Vitaly, what are you doing?
- You missed.

1075
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,236
You're leaving? You're just gonna
walk out on everybody?

1076
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,113
They have good show without me.

1077
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,450
Look, I got a good left foot,
but without my right foot, I can't walk.

1078
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,118
You get fake foot, then you walk.

1079
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,704
- I don't want fake foot! OK?
(groans)

1080
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,375
What happened to "circus stick together,"
huh? "The show must go on."

1081
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,876
Clichés.

1082
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,213
Come on, man.
Stop being this guy! Be the other guy!

1083
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,547
What other guy?

1084
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,759
The guy who was all circus!
The guy who jumped through hoops!

1085
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,428
Give me that!
The guy everybody looked up to.

1086
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:10,643
Come on. Where's that Vitaly?

1087
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,980
That Vitaly is no more.

1088
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:18,818
Listen, man.
You may have given up on yourself,

1089
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,404
but your friends
haven't given up on you.

1090
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,989
Are you just going
to turn your back on them,

1091
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,742
and sit and eat borscht
the rest of your life?

1092
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,455
Or are you gonna get out there
and jump through that tiny little hoop?

1093
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,376
(groans) It is impossible.

1094
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:37,002
(sighs)

1095
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:42,466
It was always impossible, Vitaly.
That's why the people loved it.

1096
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,014
That is why I loved it.

1097
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:53,519
Because I did the impossible!

1098
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:57,189
I was once a brave tiger.

1099
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,360
And if I go down in flames... (laughs)

1100
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:02,778
...so be it!

1101
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:07,575
You know, I think
l might have an idea for you.

1102
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:22,047
Light the hoop on fire!

1103
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,973
(pounding heartbeat)

1104
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,851
(growls)

1105
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,482

<i>Mamma Maria, mia Santa,
Santa</i> Mia Farrow...

1108
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:54,705
Come on, you got it.

1109
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,791
(pops)
(gasps)

1110
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:02,046
(cheering)

1111
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,675
(laughing) Yes!

1112
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,644
All right, what are you waiting for?
We got a show to put on.

1113
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,562
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go!

1114
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:21,482
(♪ Katy Perry: "Firework")

1115
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:30,950
(excited chattering)

1116
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:36,830
Look!

1117
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,981
(laughing)

1118
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,318
We're going to America! Whoo!

1119
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:30,694
Today!

1120
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,530
That's what I call crack-a-lackin'
to the mack-a-lackin'!

1121
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,199
- We did it, Alice!
- Yeah!

1122
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,534
Maybe I am
average intelligence after all!

1123
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,828
Perhaps even slightly above.

1124
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,373
No, I don't think so.

1125
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,043
Ha! Hair conditioner.
Great idea, my friend!

1126
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,712
Feel. Go ahead. Soft like kitten, no?

1127
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,465
- Look at that.
- Slippery but not flammable.

1128
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:53,717
You smell like peaches and herb!

1129
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,678
(squeals)
- Wow!

1130
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,556
Gia and Alex, the trapezing cats!

1131
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,016
We did pretty good.

1132
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,810
You will flip, and I will catch.

1133
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,104
And sometimes I will flip,
and you will catch.

1134
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:09,817
And then we will both flip,
and we'll travel the whole world!

1135
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,820
Flipping and catching,
and I will flip you...

1136
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,029
(harmonizing)

1137
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,490
(Gia continues indistinctly)

1138
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,535
Uh... You know, the thing is...

1139
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,415
- I may not always be around.
- Where are you going?

1140
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,835
- Well, I'm... I'm... I'm...
(horn honking)

1141
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:31,088
Bravo, bravo!

1142
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:35,259
What a heartwarming performance,
<i>Monsieur</i> Circus Master.

1143
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,428
It brought tears to my eyes.

1144
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,596
(chuckling) No, not really.

1145
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:44,017
(over phone) <i>Monsieur, we both know
the lion does not belong to you.</i>

1146
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,769
(gasps) It's that horrid woman!

1147
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:48,689
He is a fugitive from justice.

1148
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:50,524
You will turn the lion over to me

1149
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:53,277
so that I may put him where he belongs.

1150
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:57,823
(shouts)
- On my wall.

1151
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,951
(chuckles)

1152
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,786
(officers grunt)

1153
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,538
- What?
(Skipper) Incoming!

1154
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,838
- Whoo!
(Skipper) Outgoing!

1155
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:13,839
Wait!

1156
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,759
(screaming)

1157
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,636
(Skipper) Up high! Whoo-ha!

1158
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,305
Down low. Too slow.

1159
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:23,056
- Well done, Private.
- Did I do good?

1160
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,767
(Skipper) Nah, not really.

1161
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,311
Man, that was close!

1162
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:28,812
(Gia) Alex?

1163
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,315
You are from a zoo?

1164
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:39,531
Yes. Yes. But wait, there's more.

1165
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,366
- More?
- Or less. There's less.

1166
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,494
You were never circus?

1167
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,579
We had to say we were circus.

1168
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,372
Or you'd never have let us on the train!

1169
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,001
After all we have
been through together...

1170
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:53,670
...you want to go live in a zoo?

1171
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,714
- Gia, I...
- You used us.

1172
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,257
No, no, no. I mean, yes, but...

1173
01:08:57,425 --> 01:08:59,802
Trapeze<i> americano,</i>
you make that up, too?

1174
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,429
It didn't exactly exist
when I taught it to you.

1175
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:06,934
Jet packs and aquatic cobras!
I should have known.

1176
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:11,188
Balloons to the children of the world
was not real, either?

1177
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,482
Yeah, that's not real.
But look at what we did.

1178
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,694
I was shot out of a cannon!
I could have died!

1179
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,364
But I thought it was
your lifelong dream.

1180
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:25,285
For all I know,
your name is not even Alice.

1181
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:29,248
No, Stefano, but it never really was.

1182
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,750
I don't feel safe! (whimpering)

1183
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,462
Gia, I...

1184
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,382
We trusted you.

1185
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,303
My tears are real!

1186
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,805
You are not!

1187
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:52,062
I can't believe you lied
to all us circus folk.

1188
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,067
(Julien) Me? Stay with the circus?
(Sonya roars)

1189
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:02,322
I am a king! I want to rule New York!
We should talk.

1190
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:04,700
Whoa!

1191
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,746
Stop it! No means no!
Or in your language... Aah!

1192
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,081
(growls)

1193
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:14,084
Not everything
is solved that way, you know.

1194
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,466
Sonya? Are you listening to me?

1195
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:24,761
Now I'm getting
the silent treatment, am l?

1196
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,097
Come over here right now!

1197
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,184
Don't shut me out, baby!

1198
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,020
What is wrong with you? Speak!

1199
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,230
(roars)

1200
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:40,736
OK... if these are your feelings,
I understand now.

1201
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:42,571
And I'm going!

1202
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,367
It's obvious I'm just an emotional
whoopee cushion for you to sit on!

1203
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,495
When you look for where I am,

1204
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,623
I won't be there!

1205
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,626
(Julien sobbing)
(growls)

1206
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,295
(whimpers)

1207
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,692
Come, everybody.
We have show to do.

1208
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,071
But how do I go on without Marty? (sobs)

1209
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,073
- Stefano.
- I don't know what to do.

1210
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,533
You can still do cannon solo.

1211
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:33,246
But... I want to do solo act with Marty!

1212
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,457
And what do I do?

1213
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,419
Go back to sitting
and standing and rolling over?

1214
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,588
No.

1215
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:45,175
We can do impossible!

1216
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:48,553
And we never go back
to way we used to be.

1217
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,057
The way it used to be
isn't the way it was.

1218
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:57,562
And it won't be the same without them,
whatever way it is.

1219
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,731
(bells chiming)

1220
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,793
Well... we're here.

1221
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,632
- Home.
- Huh.

1222
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,635
My rock looks smaller
than I remember it.

1223
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,304
Look at the mural.

1224
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,308
Doesn't actually capture
the real thing, does it?

1225
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,644
Wow.

1226
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,524
I forgot about that wall
in between us, Melman.

1227
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:45,360
- Mm-hmm.
- Was that always there?

1228
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:55,328
Guys, I'm sorry
I ever left the zoo in the first place.

1229
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,997
What do you mean?

1230
01:12:57,165 --> 01:13:00,000
I mean, if I had just stayed put,

1231
01:13:00,168 --> 01:13:03,086
we wouldn't have
anything to be sad about right now.

1232
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:09,760
Leaving the zoo was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1233
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,679
Really?

1234
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:16,892
Yeah. Out there, in the world,
we were really living.

1235
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,435
(Julien) Yeah!
- It was exciting!

1236
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,729
- It was romantic.
- It was dangerous.

1237
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,397
I never felt so alive!

1238
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:25,859
When we were with the circus,
we were already home.

1239
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,362
I only wish we'd realized that sooner.

1240
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,991
I'm really going to miss those guys.

1241
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,703
What do you say we go back?

1242
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:37,704
Really?

1243
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,122
- I'm with you!
- I'm in!

1244
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,791
But what do we tell them?

1245
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,919
We make it right by telling them
how wrong we were.

1246
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:44,920
It's worth a shot.

1247
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:48,298
(in Russian accent)
And if we go down in flames, so be it!

1248
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:49,966
(Gloria) Yes, let's do this!
(Julien) I like it!

1249
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,218
(Marty) Yeah, yeah!

1250
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,762
Is my neck getting longer?

1251
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,889
Feel my fur. It's so soft.

1252
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,641
