<i>One small fact.</i>

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
<i>You are going to die.</i>

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,246
<i>Despite every effort,
no one lives forever.</i>

5
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,959
<i>Sorry to be such a spoiler.</i>

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,599
<i>My advice is, when the time comes,
don't panic.</i>

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,962
<i>It doesn't seem to help.</i>

8
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,199
<i>I guess I should introduce myself properly.</i>

9
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,199
<i>But then again,
you'll meet me soon enough.</i>

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,839
<i>Not before your time, of course.</i>

11
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,931
<i>I make it a policy to avoid the living.</i>

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,679
<i>Well, except sometimes.</i>

13
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,168
<i>Once in a very long time...</i>

14
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,487
<i>I can't help myself.</i>

15
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,999
<i>I get interested.</i>

16
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,442
<i>I don't know exactly what it was
about Liesel Meminger.</i>

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,568
<i>But she caught me.</i>

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,411
<i>And I cared.</i>

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,444
Do you want to say a few words?

20
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,848
Goodbye my darling.

21
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,010
She would have kept you
if she could have.

22
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,320
You know that, don't you?

23
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,890
Here we are. Come, Liesel.

24
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,362
Meet your new parents.

25
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,245
Come.

26
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,159
Hans Hubermann.

27
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,441
Heinrich.

28
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,605
Heinrich.

29
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,525
Where is the boy?

30
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,526
He died.

31
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,399
What do you mean?

32
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,879
On the way here.

33
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,799
They had to bury him by the tracks.

34
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,639
They promised us two children,
with two allowances.

35
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,879
Rosa, you cannot blame the boy for dying.

36
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,159
No, I blame his mother.

37
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,679
Dragging them across the country
unfed, unwashed!

38
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,079
She was running for her life.

39
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,406
Have you seen that girl?

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,279
Filthy.

41
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,599
Everything they say about communists is true.
Dirty and stupid.

42
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,246
I'll speak as loud as I want.

43
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,921
Come.

44
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,606
Come!

45
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,724
What is the matter with her?

46
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,603
Your Majesty.

47
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,800
What are you brats looking at?

48
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,888
This is Heaven Street, your new home.

49
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,930
Hey, lover boy!
Can we get on with the game now?

50
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,803
Please, go in.

51
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,804
Well, go on.

52
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,441
What do you say?

53
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,326
They have given us a mute.

54
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,929
Go upstairs.

55
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,886
Where is it?

56
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,160
That one.

57
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,850
It's for you.

58
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,999
Hans!

59
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,964
<i>Ja,</i> my sunshine?

60
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,970
Good morning, Your Majesty.

61
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,526
Would you stop that racket?

62
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,082
What do you say?

63
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,439
Thank you.

64
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,766
It speaks?

65
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,884
Now, listen, from now on
you call me "Mama," <i>ja?</i>

66
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,966
Say it.

67
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,919
Mama.

68
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,201
Good.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,528
And that <i>Saukerl,</i>
that lazy pig over there...

70
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,002
you call him "Papa." Understood?

71
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,241
Papa.

72
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,279
Who is that?

73
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,891
Who is it?

74
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,599
Rudy Steiner, <i>Frau</i> Hubermann.

75
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,006
What do you want?

76
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,162
My mother says you've got a daughter now.

77
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,005
What's it to you?

78
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,161
I'm here to take her to school.

79
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,888
Why can't people ever mind
their own business?

80
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,999
Hello, Rudy.

81
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,281
Hello!

82
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,319
And what makes you think
you are good enough for my daughter?

83
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,521
Rudy.

84
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,530
I'm almost 12.

85
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,759
Liesel, eat your soup and go
and get dressed.

86
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,725
Stay outside, you filthy <i>Saukerl.</i>

87
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,131
Hurry up, Liesel.

88
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,840
Do you like to run?

89
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,883
I bet I could beat you.

90
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,727
No one has ever beaten me in a race.

91
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,968
You don't say much, do you?

92
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,729
Is that one spit, "Yes,"
and two spits, "No"?

93
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,405
I'm glad we understand each other.

94
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,440
My mother didn't really tell me
to come and get you.

95
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,407
I just thought you might need a friend.

96
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,762
- <i>Danke schön!</i>
- Rudy!

97
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,211
What are you up to?

98
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,599
Nothing, Papa.

99
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,119
Then get to school.

100
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,211
Come on.

101
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,326
You are?

102
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,444
<i>Frau</i> Hubermann's new daughter.

103
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,763
I was not addressing you, Steiner.

104
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,289
Girl, speak.

105
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,566
Liesel Meminger.

106
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,810
Chalk, board, name.

107
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,006
Come, girl. We don't have all day.

108
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,091
Write it.

109
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,041
Silence.

110
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,365
Silence!

111
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,251
Back to your seat, now.

112
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,725
Silence.

113
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,683
<i>Dummkopf! Dummkopf! Dummkopf!</i>

114
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,119
Hey, <i>Dummkopf.</i>
Can't you even read yet?

115
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,999
Go on. Read one word. Read something.

116
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,361
<i>Dummkopf.</i>

117
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,041
She's killing him!

118
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,649
I bet that wasn't your first fight.

119
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,479
Franz Deutscher hasn't been hit like that...

120
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,199
since he peed in Tommy Müller's lunchbox.

121
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,279
Franz Deutscher doesn't sound very smart.

122
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,608
He's the dumbest kid in school.

123
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,327
But he shaves.

124
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,879
You remember how to get home?

125
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,879
Just because I can't read
doesn't make me stupid.

126
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,321
All right. I'll follow you, then.

127
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,439
You could join our soccer team, you know?

128
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,725
Look, you should probably just stop
trying to be my friend...

129
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,839
because I won't be here long enough.

130
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,280
Why not?

131
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,239
I'm running away. That's why not.

132
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,719
Where to?

133
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,684
None of your business.

134
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,399
Well, let me know when.

135
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,761
Why?

136
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,209
So I can come with you.

137
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,559
You don't understand. I'm serious.

138
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,279
I have to find my mother.

139
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,519
<i>Frau</i> Hubermann?

140
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,599
<i>Nein, Dummkopf.</i> My real mother.

141
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,719
Great.

142
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,968
I'd like to meet her.

143
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,679
What are you doing now?

144
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,006
Racing you.

145
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,685
I'll bet you a kiss I can beat you.

146
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,441
Why would I want to kiss you?

147
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,839
I don't know. What does that matter?

148
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,769
I'm the one who's going to win.

149
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,641
Just to the end of the street.

150
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,131
And what if I win?

151
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,006
You don't have to kiss me.

152
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,605
Ever?

153
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,759
What do you care?

154
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,361
You're not sticking around, right?

155
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,249
Hey! <i>Saumensch!</i>

156
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,887
You cheated.

157
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,441
So what?

158
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,451
- I beat you.
- Did not.

159
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,161
It was a draw.

160
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,079
Draw means I get the kiss.

161
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,725
You can stick your kiss.

162
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,081
Oh, my God.

163
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,244
She's going to kill you.

164
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,321
Who?

165
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,886
If you think that I am
some kind of pushover...

166
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,039
you are very much mistaken.

167
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,605
Do you hear?

168
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,971
I have just come to say good night.

169
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,971
What is this?

170
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,081
Is it yours?

171
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,802
Why would a nice girl like you
want to read such a thing?

172
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,602
Are you sure this is yours?

173
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,287
It wasn't always mine.

174
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,959
It belonged to my brother.

175
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,207
I see.

176
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,239
Your brother...

177
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,444
his name was Pieter Strauss?

178
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,325
Do you know what this says?

179
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,680
Do you want to know what it says?

180
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,641
I'm not such a good reader myself, you know.

181
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,646
We will have to help each other out.

182
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,641
<i>Ja?</i>

183
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,040
We better get started.

184
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,043
<i>"The Gravedigger's Handbook."</i>

185
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,846
<i>Raise the red flags for German effort</i>

186
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,445
<i>we want to pave the way to freedom.</i>

187
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,811
<i>For German effort</i>

<i>we want to pave the way to freedom.</i>

189
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,686
<i>We do not create a brother pact</i>

190
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,561
<i>with Jews or non-Germanics.</i>

191
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,050
<i>Because they falsify the liberty certificate</i>

192
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,969
<i>of Germany's people.</i>

193
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,839
Walter.

194
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,281
Listen, he told me he can only take one.

195
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,679
- Take Max.
- No, Mama.

196
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,879
Take him! Go!

197
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,119
I won't leave without you.

198
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,321
Yes, you will.

199
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,319
Upon your father's grave, you will.

200
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,759
There's no time for heroics, Max.

201
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,291
One or none.

202
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,760
Come.

203
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,239
The papers are inside.

204
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,727
They don't look great,
but they'll have to do.

205
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,086
Go find him.

206
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,010
Forgive me.

207
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,402
<i>When I finally caught up
with Max Vandenberg's soul...</i>

208
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,766
<i>it was this moment
that haunted him the most.</i>

209
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,159
<i>For leaving his mother.</i>

210
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,081
<i>For feeling that awful,
light-headed relief...</i>

211
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,047
<i>that he would live.</i>

212
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,159
Jesse Owens is the fastest man on earth.

213
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,328
Hey, watch out, you two.

214
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,810
What are you doing, Papa?

215
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,321
Working, for once.

216
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,810
I thought you painted signs,
not scraped them off.

217
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,970
Well, the scraping-off business
is picking up, Rudy.

218
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,281
What can you do?

219
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,484
"Accountant."

220
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,884
You make me proud, girl.
She's clever, Rudy.

221
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,686
<i>Ja,</i> sir.

222
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,366
What's an accountant?

223
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,809
Something we will never need.

224
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,039
"We wish you...

We made it. Your first book.

232
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,769
Congratulations.

233
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,239
So, promise me one thing, Liesel.

234
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,206
If I die anytime soon,
make sure they bury me right.

235
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,641
- <i>Ja?</i>
- <i>Ja.</i>

236
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,486
No skipping chapter six.

237
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,090
Can we start again?

238
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,890
Tomorrow.

239
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,679
But it is tomorrow.

240
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,166
You sleep now.

241
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,929
His name was Werner.

242
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,762
Come. I have a surprise for you.

243
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,959
It's very dark here.

244
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,844
We had better turn on the light.

245
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,965
It's a dictionary.

246
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,522
Some of the words we have learned.

247
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,522
Add as many as you like.

248
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,484
It's yours.

249
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,883
Thank you, Papa.

250
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,119
He's done it! He's made history!

251
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,559
Jesse Owens...

252
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,125
the fastest man alive!

253
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,319
Hey!

254
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,250
What is this?

255
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,529
You want to remain a member?
Teach your son!

256
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,079
Why?

257
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,399
Why Jesse Owens?

258
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,679
Why?

259
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,199
He's the fastest man on earth.

260
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,999
The fastest man on earth!

261
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,039
The boy is crazy.

262
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,607
- That hurts.
- Sit still, Rudy.

263
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,759
It's even in his earholes.

264
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,246
Barbra...

265
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,170
Fine, you deal with him.

266
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,879
Son...

267
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,199
you can't go around
painting ourself black, you hear?

268
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,561
Why not?

269
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,726
Because you shouldn't want to be black people.

270
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,766
Why?

271
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,764
Because I say so. <i>Ja?</i>

272
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,604
<i>"Dear Mama, today is the</i>
Fuhrer's <i>birthday.</i>

Hans, where did you put the flag?

280
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,839
If we don't find it,
it's going to look like we're saying something.

281
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,079
All right, all right, all right.

282
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,044
I'm going to look in the basement.

283
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,285
God in Heaven.

284
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,599
Liesel, I know you like it down here...

285
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,079
but don't you think
you should be outside a bit?

286
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,799
I'm writing Mama a letter.

287
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
Well, that's very good.

288
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,639
Please tell her, from me,
I could do without all the nagging.

289
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,490
Not that mama.

290
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,926
I see.

291
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,041
What are you telling her?

292
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,799
Everything.

293
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,322
About you <i>und</i> Mama <i>und</i> Rudy.

294
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,047
Can you send it for me?

295
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,959
Well...

296
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,288
You could give it to the woman
who brought me here.

297
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,689
<i>Frau</i> Heinrich? <i>Ja.</i>

298
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,002
I'm sure she would do her best
to pass it on.

299
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,127
Ah, found it.

300
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,719
What is she doing writing to her mother, anyway?

301
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,319
She's her mother.

302
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,959
I'm not going to waste good money...

303
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,799
on a stamp for a letter
that's never going to be answered.

304
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,479
What was I to say?

305
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,524
- Hans?
- Alex.

306
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,839
Good man. Are you ready to go?

307
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,479
Of course he is.

308
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,519
Liesel!

309
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,051
Come on, Liesel, we'll miss the parade.

310
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,771
Right.

311
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,439
Come on, let's go.

312
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,404
- <i>Saumensch.</i>
- Hello, Rudy.

313
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,008
During this National Socialist revolution

314
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,247
as much as our nation prospers,
we should not decrease

315
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,724
our determination to cleanse ourselves morally

316
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,883
and intellectually from within.

317
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,607
Education, theater, films, literature, the press

318
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,639
these are the supporting pillars

319
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,039
which shape the unique personality of our nation.

320
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,731
And that is why we have gathered here tonight

321
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,246
to free ourselves from any intellectual dirt.

322
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,327
We will exterminate the illness

323
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,770
that infected Germany for the last twenty years.

324
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,208
We will completely destroy the chains

325
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,047
that were forged to enslave us.

326
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,690
We will fight our enemies
and if that means war

327
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,643
then we will stand by our <i>Führer</i>
until the final victory.

328
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,841
Such a war will see our nation restored

329
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,127
and bring an end to our enemies.

330
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,451
The end of plutocrats.

331
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,482
The end of communists.

332
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,645
And the end of Jews.

333
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,767
To our great German Empire

334
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,529
and to our beloved <i>Führer</i>, Adolf Hitler

335
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,639
- <i>Sieg!</i>
- <i>Heil!</i>

336
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,209
Hey, Jesse Owens.

337
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,641
Push off, Franz.

338
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,159
Leave him alone.

339
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,399
Did you like the speech, <i>Dummkopf?</i>
Were you listening?

340
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,679
What about it?

341
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,439
Your mother was one, wasn't she?

342
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,768
A communist?
That's what they say.

343
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,279
Who's "they"?

344
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,720
You even look like one.

345
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,399
What are you talking about?

346
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,439
I'm not talking to you, Steiner.

347
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,005
She knows.

348
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,251
Burn a book.

349
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,969
Go on, burn a book.

350
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,403
Go on! I'll be watching.
Both of you.

351
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,039
What was that about?

352
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,765
Nothing.

353
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,521
Liesel.

354
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,199
Where have you been?
I said to meet me at the church.

355
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,799
Sorry, Papa.

356
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,240
Let's go now.

357
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,885
What is it?

358
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,771
Nothing.

359
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,319
Are you sick?

360
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,522
<i>Nein.</i> I'm fine.

361
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,239
Tell me, what is the matter with you?

362
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,204
What the hell is this?

363
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,001
You stole it?

364
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,081
Sorry, Papa.

365
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,202
Are you going to tell Mama?

366
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,966
Papa?

367
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,204
Did anyone see you?

368
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,770
I'll tell you what.

369
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,771
Let's make this our secret.

370
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,209
We'll read it like the other book.

371
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,519
In the basement.

372
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,245
Thank you, Papa.

373
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,400
Good, now.

374
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,562
We better get back before Mama worries.
We don't want that.

375
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,324
Liesel, come.

376
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,084
What is it?

377
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,164
Liesel?

378
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,847
My mother isn't coming back, is she?

379
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,721
Is she a communist?

380
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,569
- Who told you that?
- Is she?

381
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,604
Did the <i>Führer</i> take her away?

382
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,399
Then I hate the <i>Führer.</i>

383
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,806
<i>Nein.</i>

384
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,123
You can't say that.

385
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,603
Don't ever say that.

386
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,161
Understand?

387
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,241
Come.

388
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,959
<i>"The Invisible Man</i> by H.G. Wells."

389
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,810
Sounds good.

390
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,490
"Chapter one.

391
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,884
"The Strange Man's Arrival.

392
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,725
"The stranger came early in Feb..."

393
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,766
"February."

394
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,640
Good girl.

395
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,999
Who's that?

396
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,166
Papa, who is it?

397
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,363
- Hans Hubermann?
- <i>Ja.</i>

398
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,884
Do you still play the accordion?

399
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,567
Quickly.

400
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,091
- Papa!
- Liesel, go to bed!

401
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,200
What is this?

402
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,619
Max.

403
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,645
No. No.

404
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,051
Help me.

405
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,365
We'll put him upstairs.

406
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,288
Liesel, everything is fine.

407
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,326
Here we go.

408
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,002
I'll warm him some soup.

409
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,124
Who is he, Papa?

410
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,003
I have something very important
to tell you, Liesel.

411
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,208
You must listen.

412
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,208
That is not my accordion.

413
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,490
The man who owns that accordion
is this boy's father.

414
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,559
You stole it?

415
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,921
<i>Nein.</i>

416
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,089
I've been looking after it.

417
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,244
Did he die?

418
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,806
<i>Ja.</i>

419
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,409
Many years ago.

420
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,127
Before you were born.

421
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,003
I saw him die.

422
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,570
In a war.

423
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,359
You were in a war?

424
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,561
<i>Ja.</i>

425
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,927
His father gave up his life...

426
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,885
for me.

427
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,599
And I made a promise to the family...

428
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,441
if ever I could help them, I would.
I gave them my word.

429
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,926
Now, I need you to promise me.

430
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
I need you to give me your word

431
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,644
that you will not tell anyone
about our visitor.

432
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,844
Nobody. Not a soul.

433
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,283
Not even Rudy.

434
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,690
I mean it, Liesel.

435
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,128
Not a soul.

436
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,569
Understand?

437
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,959
<i>Ja.</i>

438
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,131
A person is only as good
as their word, Liesel.

439
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,321
Do I have yours?

440
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,645
<i>Ja,</i> Papa.

441
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,841
I promise.

442
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,519
Did you talk to her?

443
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,801
<i>Ja.</i>

444
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,799
She can't tell a soul.

445
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,411
She knows.

446
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,729
- Can we trust her?
- She's our daughter.

447
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,689
- She's a child!
- Rosa.

448
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,003
We have no choice.

449
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,724
He looks like death.

450
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,799
He's probably forgotten
what food tastes like.

451
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,039
What are we going to feed him on?

452
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,601
We barely have enough to feed ourselves!

453
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,921
We will make do.

454
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,168
"We will make do."

455
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,847
We have always known
that one day this may happen.

456
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,442
We could turn him in tomorrow.

457
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,399
The authorities would understand.

458
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,839
We could say that it was late at night...

459
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,039
Rosa.

460
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,322
- I know.
- He came to us.

461
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,567
- I owe his family everything.
- I know.

462
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,604
Then, that's all.

463
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,401
We'll just go about things
as normally as possible.

464
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,247
Hello.

465
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,166
Hello.

466
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,088
What were you dreaming about?

467
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,130
My mother.

468
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,324
Is that your book?

469
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,521
<i>Ja.</i>

470
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,726
<i>Nein</i>, it...

471
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,328
it wasn't always mine.

472
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,530
Did you steal it?

473
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,206
<i>Nein.</i>

474
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,168
- Can I see it?
- It's...

475
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,599
It's not for children.

476
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,123
Good morning, Max.

477
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,966
You have met Liesel?

478
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,801
Liesel.

479
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,125
Don't worry.

480
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,530
She's a good girl.

481
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,368
Not a word.

482
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,361
Good, <i>Saumensch.</i>

483
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,079
What's the rush?

484
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,930
I have to get home.

485
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,565
Race you.

486
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,004
I have to go inside.

487
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,763
What do you want? My permission?

488
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,879
<i>Nein.</i> I'm just telling you.

489
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,206
Fine.

490
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,045
See you, <i>Saumensch.</i>

491
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,839
Where have you been? You're late.

492
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,042
I ran as fast as I could.

493
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,239
And you mentioned nothing to no one?

494
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,204
- <i>Nein,</i> Mama.
- Rosa...

495
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,282
Liesel! He's asleep.

496
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,007
At least someone knows
how to appreciate my cooking.

497
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,405
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

498
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,847
Is he going to be all right?

499
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,250
Of course.

500
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,803
You're a curious girl.

501
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,039
I didn't mean to.

502
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,764
It's all right.

503
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,241
What is it about?

504
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,881
Hitler.

505
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,164
Are you hiding from Hitler?

506
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,607
<i>Ja.</i>

507
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,931
Are you a communist?

508
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,361
I'm a Jew.

509
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,889
Did he take away your mother?

510
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,090
Probably.

511
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,125
Don't worry.

512
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,046
I cried a lot when I first came, too.

513
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,921
The soup is terrible, isn't it?

514
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,731
You may find this hard to believe, but...

515
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,410
it's the best thing I've ever thrown up.

516
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,525
Liesel!

517
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,168
I have a job for you.

518
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,441
And don't forget to count the money.

519
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,439
Come back with the right amount

520
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,927
or don't bother coming back at all.

521
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,767
The <i>Bürgermeister's</i> house.

522
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,008
Are you sure?

523
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,849
Do you see any other houses
looking like this?

524
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,523
He had dinner with the <i>Führer</i> once.

525
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,411
Laundry.

526
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,241
Come in.

527
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,567
Go on.

528
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,645
Wait.

529
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,281
<i>Danke schön.</i>

530
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,886
So, you like books?

531
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,121
Come.

532
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,247
<i>"The Dream Carrier."</i>

533
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,326
Rudy.

534
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,967
I have to go.

535
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,719
You can come back whenever you want.

536
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,763
It will be here.

537
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,250
<i>Ja, Frau</i> Hermann.

538
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,599
Call me "Ilsa."

539
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,609
What shall I call you?

540
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,201
Liesel.

541
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,647
You are a brave girl, Liesel.

542
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,645
<i>Come back,</i> Saumensch!

543
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,325
Catch me!

544
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,162
Hey, <i>Dummkopf!</i> Did you hear?
England declared war on us!

545
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,679
We're at war with England!

546
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,491
We're at war!

547
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,319
England declared war!

548
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:23,799
<i>It's always been the same,
the excitement and rush to war.</i>

549
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,479
<i>I've met so many young men over the years...</i>

550
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,639
<i>who have thought they were
running at their enemy.</i>

551
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,526
<i>When the truth was,
they were running to me.</i>

552
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,526
<i>Ja!</i>

553
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,521
Excellent.

554
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,761
You should look where you're going next time.

555
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,125
Drop dead, Franz.

556
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,008
What's up, Jesse Owens?
I thought you liked being black.

557
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,725
Who is Johann?

558
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,810
He used to love to read.

559
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,686
And he was brave. Just like you.

560
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,085
This is all him. Everything he knew.

561
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,411
All here.

562
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,361
All in its place.

563
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,649
They never found his body.

564
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,121
If they could have shown me his body,
I would have believed them.

565
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,841
But how can a mother give up?

566
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,604
A mother never gives up on her child.

567
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,089
I have to go.

568
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,161
Do you think my mother really loved me?

569
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,369
Of course.

570
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,047
Every mother loves her child.

571
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,449
Even Hitler's.

572
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,204
Do you think she writes to him?

573
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,521
"Dear <i>Führer</i>...

574
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,359
"just wait until your father gets home.

575
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,369
"Love, Mama."

576
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,479
"Dear <i>Führer</i>, clean up your mess."

577
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,842
"Dear <i>Führer</i>, who cut your hair?"

578
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,929
"You're not going out in that, are you?"

579
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,159
"What's that growing on your lip?"

580
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,169
"Don't raise your voice at me."

581
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,210
"Stop spitting when you yell."

582
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,561
Hans...

583
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,050
he's getting bedsores.

584
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,962
Then he needs to get up
and move about.

585
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,039
He can't just walk around.

586
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,199
Why not?

587
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,119
Because people will see in.

588
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,242
He can't lay still forever.
He needs to be moved.

589
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,721
Why?

590
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,039
The mouth on it! Because I say so.

591
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,199
Rosa.

592
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,925
And what do you propose?

593
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,761
"Propose"? Listen to this one.

594
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,601
I propose that we put him downstairs.

595
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,648
It's not good, we know that.

596
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,559
I'm sorry.

597
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,399
Please don't apologize.
I've put you all in such danger.

598
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,931
It's more than I deserve.

599
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,451
Liesel's lessons. It is a dictionary.

600
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,407
I tried to make it
as comfortable as I could.

601
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,250
I'm sorry, there's no bed.

602
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,848
If anyone saw, you know?

603
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,119
You feel free to do your lessons
whenever you want.

604
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,561
Make sure you knock first.

605
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,282
I'm just downstairs. I'm not going anywhere.

606
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,686
Promise.

607
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,045
Don't give me that look.

608
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,364
"Jellyfish."

609
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,439
"Jellyfish."

610
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,641
Jellyfish.

611
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,410
Tell me, where do you get these words?

612
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,166
It's a secret.

613
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,763
And who would I tell?

614
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,201
The <i>Bürgermeister's</i> wife.

615
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,407
She lets me read her books.

616
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,803
I memorize them.

617
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,371
"Memory is the scribe of the soul."

618
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,000
Do you know who said that?

619
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,966
A man called Aristotle.

620
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,244
Can you do me a favor?

621
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,206
Can you describe the day for me?

622
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,802
What's it like outside?

623
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,479
It's cloudy.

624
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,841
No, no, no.

625
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,129
Make the words yours.

626
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,562
If your eyes could speak...

627
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,765
what would they say?

628
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,609
It's a pale day.

629
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,241
"Pale." Good. Go on.

630
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,083
Everything's stuck behind a cloud.

631
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,447
<i>Und</i> the sun...

632
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,729
doesn't look like the sun.

633
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,970
What does it look like?

634
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,482
Like a silver oyster?

635
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,441
Thank you. I saw that.

636
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,849
We're hiding a Jew.

637
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,162
Johann?

638
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,966
<i>Nein.</i>

639
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,006
It's Liesel.

640
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,008
What's the meaning of this?

641
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,361
<i>Und</i> he didn't say why?

642
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,079
I don't understand it.

643
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,359
I've always ironed his shirts
in exactly the same way.

644
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,559
Maybe they can't afford it any longer.

645
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,330
They can't afford it?

646
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,730
We can't afford it.

647
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,519
It's another customer gone.

648
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,079
And four mouths to feed.

649
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,846
Well.

650
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,321
It's two meals a day from now on, not three.

651
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,571
That's all there is to it.

652
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,525
I've made you a suit.

653
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,050
I want you to wear it
on your 14th birthday.

654
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,599
You'll be back then, Papa.

655
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,404
Won't you?

656
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,166
Hans!

657
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,959
Rosa...

658
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,119
I'm asking you, I'm begging you...

659
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:04,689
would you please keep your mouth shut
for five minutes?

660
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,479
I brought you something.

661
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,519
- Is this today's?
- <i>Ja.</i>

662
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,839
A gift from Franz Deutscher.

663
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,884
That boy doesn't know how generous he is.

664
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,321
"Hitler poised to take Moscow."

665
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,762
The world has turned mad.

666
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,686
But...

667
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,730
aren't we winning the war?

668
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,287
Max?

669
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,922
Where's my weather report?

670
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,085
You're full of wonders.

671
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,366
I've got an idea.

672
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,961
What on earth are you doing?

673
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,885
Go, go, go!

674
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:20,841
Max.

675
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,241
I have no more snow!

676
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,119
Get him, Max!

677
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,239
What in God's name are you <i>Saukerle</i>
doing down here?

678
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,441
Rosa!

679
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,769
- There's a madwoman on the battlefield!
- <i>Nein, nein!</i>

680
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,284
I'm unarmed!

681
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,799
This is the stupidest thing
that I have ever done.

682
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,048
<i>Und</i> look how happy you are.

683
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,599
What do we do when it melts?

684
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,199
You mop it up, <i>Saumensch.</i>

685
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,880
It won't melt. It's freezing down here.

686
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,359
I don't know how you do it every night.

687
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,159
Please, don't think about me.

688
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,328
Nonsense. We all think about you.

689
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,721
This is the best Christmas.

690
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,729
This is my first Christmas.

691
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,808
Now you know what you've been missing out on.

692
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,039
We should call it a night.

693
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,199
<i>Nein,</i> Papa. Please.

694
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,561
Listen to your father.

695
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,639
You can stay a little longer.

696
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,047
Oh, you're too soft on that girl.

697
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,009
I've made you a Christmas gift.

698
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,570
It's all I had.

699
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,399
But...

700
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,601
Open it.

701
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,121
"For Liesel...

702
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,450
"from Max."

703
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,849
What does it say?

704
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,891
"Write."

705
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,799
In my religion...

706
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,083
we're taught that every living thing...

707
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,879
every leaf, every bird...

708
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:57,130
is only alive because it contains
the secret word for life.

709
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:03,849
That's the only difference between us
and a lump of clay. A word.

710
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,847
Words are life, Liesel.

711
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,489
All those blank pages...

712
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,366
they're for you to fill.

713
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,884
My God.

714
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,799
Is he going to die?

715
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,319
Shut up!

716
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,410
I won't have that talk in this house.
Do you understand?

717
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,199
I haven't starved us all
for the better part of two years...

718
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,051
just so that he could die.

719
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,681
It's my fault.

720
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,049
Why is it your fault?

721
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,006
It was my idea to build that snowman.

722
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,889
Why did we build it?

723
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,402
Because we had to.

724
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,363
You said you weren't going anywhere, Max.

725
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,769
You promised.

726
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,839
<i>"The Invisible Man...</i>

727
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,281

728
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,770

"Chapter One."

737
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,721

744
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:33,560
<i>"the feeling that the clothes

745
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:39,240
"and the sudden realization

746
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,962
- Did you lose something?
- Rudy!

747
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,200
What are you doing?

748
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,408
Spying on you, obviously.

749
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,091
Give me that!

750
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:56,250
So, let me guess.
You forgot where the front door was.

751
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,483
I've got to hand it to you, <i>Saumensch,</i>
you've got guts...

752
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,599
stealing from the <i>Bürgermeister.</i>

753
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,279
Keep it down.

754
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,926
I'm not stealing. I'm borrowing.

755
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,559
Whatever you are "borrowing"...

756
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,239
I just wish you let me in on it.

757
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,639
It's not what you think.

758
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,119
Then...

759
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,651
what is it?

760
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,964
I'm borrowing books. That's all.

761
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,559
Books? Are you nuts?

762
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,919
We are starving out here
and you're stealing books?

763
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,326
Stop using that word.

764
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,079
How about food? Did you ever even think
of looking in the kitchen?

765
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,281
<i>Nein.</i>

766
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,642
We could have planned this better
if you told me.

767
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,799
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

768
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,721
You know, for a best friend,
you keep a lot to yourself.

769
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,844
What's that supposed to mean?

770
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,091
Who's Max?

771
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,441
Who is he?

772
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,441
Liesel!

773
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,168
Tell me what's going on!

774
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,684
Tell me, <i>Saumensch,</i> who is he?

775
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,488
Is he your boyfriend?

776
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,171
What?

777
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,360
Is that what you think?

778
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,091
Then what?

779
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,891
Tell me, who is he?

780
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,679
I can't.

781
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,120
Why not?

782
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,041
It's a secret.

783
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,211
You don't trust me?

784
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,201
It's not like that, Rudy. I can't.

785
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,885
If I...

786
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,326
If I told you, I'd have to go away.

787
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,891
Papa would have to go away.

788
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,721
God knows what would happen to him.

789
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,165
"Him"?

790
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,768
You're hiding someone?

791
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,165
You're hiding someone, aren't you?

792
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,721
Liesel!

793
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,128
One spit, "Yes." Two spits, "No."

794
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,441
I knew it.

795
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,842
No one can know, Rudy.

796
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,479
I mean it.

797
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,364
You can trust me.

798
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,925
Don't worry.

799
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,204
I won't tell anybody.

800
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,329
You won't tell anyone what?

801
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,206
Hello, Steiner. Hello, <i>Dummkopf.</i>

802
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,604
What's that behind your back?

803
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,280
Give it to me.

804
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,799
Leave him alone!

805
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,161
I said, give it to me!

806
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,761
Give it to me!

807
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,239
What was that? What was it?

808
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,647
None of your business, Deutscher.

809
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,527
Leave him!

810
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,565
You're done for, Steiner.

811
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,279
I'm reporting you.

812
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,290
For what? Having a diary?

813
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,207
I know you're up to something.

814
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,601
Come on!

815
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,841
Come on!

816
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,639
What are you doing?

817
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,684
I know where it is! I watched it!

818
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,527
It's freezing, Rudy.
You'll die in there.

819
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,966
Rudy!

820
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,486
Rudy?

821
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,201
Rudy!

822
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,361
Rudy?

823
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,122
Rudy, I can't swim!

824
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,280
Rudy!

825
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,440
Please!

826
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,245
I got it!

827
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,566
Rudy!

828
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,725
I thought you were...

829
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,561
Never mind.

830
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,804
Trust me now?

831
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,999
<i>Ja.</i>

832
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,799
Then, how about that kiss?

833
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,401
Come on. You're going to freeze.

834
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,839
Good night...

835
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,644
book thief.

836
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,805
Good night, fish.

837
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,529
I told Rudy.

838
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,929
- Here, come on!
- I'm here!

839
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,571
Look!

840
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,086
What are they doing?

841
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,290
Checking basements.
They checked my cousin's last night.

842
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,001
For what?

843
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,568
Can we get on with it now?

844
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,246
Come on!

845
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,129
Here! Pass it!

846
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,641
Are you nuts?

847
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,161
I have to go inside.

848
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,639
Oh, great.

849
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,841
She's hurt.

850
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,286
Never stopped her before.

851
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,086
I'm fine.

852
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,479
- Mama!
- Why are you shouting?

853
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,639
They're coming.

854
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,799
Who?

855
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,525
They're checking basements.

856
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,685
Hans, come quickly!

857
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,639
- What is it?
- Somebody is coming.

858
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,604
They are checking basements.

859
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,799
We have to hide him.

860
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,048
Get him up here, under the bed.

861
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,459
Max!

862
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,207
Max!

863
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,691
Come on. Come on.

864
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,009
So, do they give you a gun
when you join the army?

865
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,487
Mama!

866
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,726
Oh, my God.

867
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,209
Hans, leave that!

868
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,563
Wolfy. What a surprise.
How are you?

869
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,199
You want Hans?

870
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,479
Hans!

871
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,199
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i>
We're just checking people's basements.

872
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,879
Oh, Liesel, will you get <i>Herr</i> Edel...

873
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,879
- a glass of water?
- No need.

874
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,320
This shouldn't take a second.

875
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,159
You should bandage that.

876
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,039
Oh, my God, Liesel! <i>Ja!</i>
Oh, would you do me a favor...

877
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,799
and get me the medicine chest?
It's just on that...

878
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,161
Where is the man trap?

879
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,439
The what?

880
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,846
The door to your basement.

881
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,159
Wolfa.

882
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,362
I heard you were coming.
I've been working, tidying up.

883
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,726
Heard from who?

884
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,889
Who was it collecting our washing?

885
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,239
<i>Frau</i> Schneider.

886
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,079
<i>Frau</i> Schneider, <i>ja.</i>
She mentioned it.

887
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,327
Come.

888
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,359
Is there a light in here?

889
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,130
<i>Ja,</i> of course.

890
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,371
I should probably throw
most of this stuff out.

891
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,919
You wouldn't believe what we find
in some people's basements.

892
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,088
Oh, it wouldn't surprise me.

893
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,719
Liesel, she is always playing down here.

894
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,526
I keep telling her to get out
in the fresh air.

895
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,167
What is this about, anyway?

896
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,321
What's this?

897
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,921
My brushes.

898
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,082
You should look after them better.

899
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,159
Liesel, you know, she never listens to me.

900
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,960
Still no work, eh, Hans?

901
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,930
Not a lot.

902
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,842
You should have taken my advice
and joined the party.

903
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,999
Then your wife wouldn't have
to break her back...

904
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,851
washing people's underwear to feed you.

905
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,042
Isn't that right, Rosa?

906
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,326
<i>Ja.</i>

907
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,724
What's wrong with you?

908
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,679
I've never heard you
turn down an opportunity...

909
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,484
to give this one some lip.

910
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,241
Well...

911
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,568
if the <i>Saukerl</i> would get off
his lazy backside and help...

912
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,519
then maybe I would have the energy

913
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,200
to give him all the lip that he deserves.

914
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,768
I don't know how you live with her.

915
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,560
Neither do I.

916
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,842
Never too late to join, Hans.

917
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,039
So, how's our basement?

918
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,639
Perfectly useless. The ceiling is too low.

919
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,039
What for?

920
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,925
Air raid shelters.
Every street has to have one.

921
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,479
You should be more careful.

922
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,011
<i>Ja, Herr</i> Edel.

923
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,405
Hans...

924
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,971
What if he does die?

925
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,404
We can't just leave him there.

926
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,050
The smell will give us away.

927
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,486
Hans, I'm afraid.

928
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,928
Look, if it happens...

929
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,768
if he dies...

930
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,166
we'll simply have to find a way.

931
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,129
He's not dead yet.

932
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,725
All right?

933
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,319
<i>Frau</i> Hubermann?

934
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,409
I need to speak to Liesel.

935
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,562
Of course. Liesel?

936
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,959
What did you do with it,
you little thief?

937
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:15,999
What, Mama?

938
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,359
Don't "what" me.

939
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,999
I have told you a hundred times

940
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,248
to leave that thing alone,
but do you listen?

941
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,167
Back to work.

942
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,725
I'm sorry.

943
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,403
Mama, what is it?

944
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,565
It's Max, isn't it?

945
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,767
He said that this belongs to you.

946
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,560
Who said?

947
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,519
He woke up.

948
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,719
He's going to live!

949
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,967
Mama!

950
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:09,761
Careful.

951
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,928
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

952
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,039
I couldn't think of any other way
to tell you.

953
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,239
I know it's silly of me. I know.

954
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,319
<i>Nein,</i> Mama, it's not.

955
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,567
Thank you.

956
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,250
Well, you'd better wipe
that smile off your face.

957
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,679
Just go back in there...

958
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,566
and act like I'm the witch,
you know? <i>Ja?</i>

959
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,491
<i>Ja.</i>

960
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,965
Just know that...

961
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,964
that I...

962
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,046
Go on.

963
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,327
Do you need a bit of help
with that smile?

964
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,799
If I ever catch you...

965
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,479
doing that sort of thing again,
so help me...

966
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,039
I will string you up by your toes.

967
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,319
Do you hear me, <i>Saumensch?</i>

968
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,806
Understood?

969
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,446
Max!

970
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:47,727
I knew you'd live.

971
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,560
With all that reading,
you wouldn't leave me in peace.

972
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,679
You heard me?

973
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,086
Of course.

974
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,281
Thank you.

975
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,200
So...

976
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,810
How's Rudy?

977
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,319
I don't know.

978
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,727
Rudy's a pain in the neck.

979
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,525
The only thing worse than a boy you hate
is a boy you like, right?

980
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,283
Liesel, it's an air raid!

981
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,721
Go on, then.

982
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,639
What about you?

983
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,159
I'm here. I'll be fine.

984
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,999
It's a basement, isn't it?

985
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,439
Did you hear me, <i>Saumensch?</i>

986
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,766
<i>Ja,</i> Mama.

987
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:22,283
<i>While 10,000 souls hid their heads
in fear and trembled...</i>

988
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:26,844
<i>one Jew thanked God
for the stars that blessed his eyes.</i>

989
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,799
It's all I have.

990
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,126
I'm sorry.

991
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:00,331
I was saving it for my husband's return, but...

992
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,648
Thank you. Very much.

993
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,879
He's a Jew.

994
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,279
They found his birth certificate.

995
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,642
He's a "Lehman" with one "N", not two.

996
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,681
Please!

997
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,444
My son is in the army!

998
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,241
He's fighting on the front!

999
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,199
- Please.
- In the car!

1000
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:37,566
Please!

1001
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,161
You know me.

1002
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:44,801
Please!

1003
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,799
You know me! Please!

1004
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,365
I'm German!

1005
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,761
Please...

1006
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,606
I've known this man my whole life.
We all have.

1007
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,371
He's a good person.

1008
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,767
What's your name?

1009
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,283
Hans Hubermann.

1010
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,968
- Please! He's a good man.
- Get back!

1011
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,441
Papa!

1012
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,601
Papa!

1013
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,001
Liesel!

1014
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,926
Rudy!

1015
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,961
Rudy.

1016
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,919
Keep still.

1017
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,122
What was I thinking?

1018
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,288
He took my name.

1019
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,919
Christ on the cross, what have I done?

1020
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,443
I've ruined us! I've ruined us!

1021
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,399
I'm sorry, Rosa.

1022
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,489
I'm sorry.

1023
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,364
I don't understand.

1024
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,721
What did he do so wrong?

1025
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,644
He reminded people of their humanity.

1026
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,724
Can't he apologize?

1027
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,445
To who?

1028
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,441
Hitler?

1029
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,799
Will they take him away?

1030
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,047
I don't know.

1031
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,286
But...

1032
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,961
if they come and find me here...

1033
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,844
they'll take all of you away.

1034
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,404
No, Max.

1035
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,844
I have to, Liesel.

1036
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,286
I'm sorry.

1037
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,890
But you promised.

1038
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,044
It's for your own good.

1039
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,411
For your family.

1040
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,728
But you're my family.

1041
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,767
You've kept me alive, Liesel.

1042
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,519
Don't ever forget that.

1043
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,879
I can't lose someone else.

1044
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,287
I'm not lost to you, Liesel.

1045
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,723
You'll always be able
to find me in your words.

1046
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,448
That's where I'll live on.

1047
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,486
Max...

1048
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,290
please.

1049
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:02,810
Thank you.

1050
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,600
Here.

1051
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:15,489
It's two blankets and a pair of socks.

1052
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,799
And a nice piece of cheese
that I've been saving.

1053
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,286
Rosa...

1054
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,721
It's yours.

1055
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,399
Come. Liesel.

1056
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,170
Leave her.

1057
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,721
Hans?

1058
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,644
I'll get my coat.

1059
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,243
You are <i>Herr</i> Steiner?

1060
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,686
What?

1061
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,247
I'm here to talk about your son, Rudy.

1062
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,160
Rudy Steiner.

1063
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,528
He lives next door.

1064
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,009
What do you want with him?

1065
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,721
He's been selected for elite training.

1066
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,284
He starts in the summer.

1067
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,211
I'm sorry, Barbra.

1068
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,010
Hans Hubermann?

1069
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,851
What's "conscripted"?

1070
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,159
Look how you've grown.

1071
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,203
I had not noticed.

1072
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,999
I will miss you.

1073
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,159
Everyone's leaving.

1074
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,479
Even Rudy.

1075
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:26,999
Rudy is going to be fine.

1076
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,639
Look after your Mama, <i>ja?</i>
She's not as strong as she makes out.

1077
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:31,999
I know.

1078
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,531
Good girl.

1079
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,890
Papa?

1080
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,165
Come home.

1081
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,921
What do you think?

1082
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:01,884
The shoes let you down.

1083
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,325
And the face.

1084
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,161
Coming?

1085
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,325
Where are you going?

1086
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,806
Isn't it obvious? I'm running away.

1087
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,359
Have you thought this through?

1088
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,925
<i>Ja.</i>

1089
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,319
I don't want to die.

1090
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,410
There. All thought through.

1091
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,759
Rudy, where are you going to stay?

1092
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,725
"You"? What about "we"?

1093
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,679
I didn't think you were this serious.

1094
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,006
What do you call this?

1095
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,290
Packed lunch?

1096
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,249
Is there anything in there
besides your soccer ball?

1097
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,442
I miss my dad.

1098
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,971
I don't even know if he's alive.

1099
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,323
I'm not ready.

1100
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,444
I want to grow up before I die.

1101
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,046
So did my brother.

1102
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,726
I'm sorry.

1103
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,639
I didn't ask for this.

1104
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,410
Who would?

1105
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,242
I hate Hitler.

1106
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,806
Me, too.

1107
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,162
I hate Hitler!

1108
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,288
I hate Hitler!

1109
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:49,079
- I hate Hitler!
- Hitler is a monkey's ass!

1110
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,770
Stick you, Hitler!

1111
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,443
You're all I've got, Rudy.

1112
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,566
Let's go home.

1113
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,239
<i>The bombs were coming thicker now.</i>

1114
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,119
<i>It's probably fair to say...</i>

1115
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,689
<i>that no one was able to serve the</i> Führer
<i>as loyally as me.</i>

1116
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:50,682
There once was a ghost of a boy...

1117
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:54,405
who liked to live in the shadows of things...

1118
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:57,399
so he wouldn't frighten people.

1119
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,523
- What was that?
- Who's speaking?

1120
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:02,959
What are you doing?

1121
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,879
Telling a story.

1122
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,159
Why?

1123
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,407
Whose boy?

1124
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,519
She's telling a story.

1125
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,721
Speak up.

1126
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,447
Start again.

1127
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,999
There once was a ghost of a boy...

1128
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,359
who liked to live in the shadows,

1129
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:23,767
so he wouldn't frighten people.

1130
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:30,202
His job was to wait for his sister,
who was still alive.

1131
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,319
She wasn't afraid of the dark...

1132
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,241
because she knew that's
where her brother was.

1133
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,805
Go on.

1134
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:46,890
At night, when darkness came to her room...

1135
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:50,359
she would tell her brother about the day.

1136
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:55,039
She would remind him
how the sun felt on his skin...

1137
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,559
and what the air felt like to breathe...

1138
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:05,564
Or how snow felt on his tongue.
And that reminded her...

1139
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,281
that she was still alive.

1140
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,640
Gentlemen...

1141
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,965
how is everybody?

1142
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,359
Look at this one.
They are starting to conscript grandfathers.

1143
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:36,044
Hey, old man.
Old man, are they your own teeth?

1144
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,959
Together, they sat in the forest...

1145
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:09,279
and watched the sun rise.

1146
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,679
And as he disappeared back into the shadows...

1147
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,362
she waved goodbye for the last time.

1148
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,524
Oh, Liesel.

1149
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:05,761
Max?

1150
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,041
Max?

1151
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,006
Max!

1152
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,287
Max!

1153
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:18,719
<i>Saumensch!</i>

1154
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,639
What are you up to?

1155
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:21,887
Max?

1156
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,769
- Liesel!
- Max?

1157
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,444
- Do you know Max?
- Liesel!

1158
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,121
Do you know Max?

1159
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,211
Max?

1160
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,890
Do you know Max?

1161
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,283
Get out of here, you stupid girl!

1162
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:50,647
Liesel!

1163
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,601
I won't forget you.
I won't forget you.

1164
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,359
I won't forget you.

1165
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,449
I won't forget you, Max.

1166
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,367
Liesel!

1167
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,647
Go out!

1168
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,441
Liesel!

1169
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,531
You're too much like your father,
you know that?

1170
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,841
What's wrong with that?

1171
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,765
Nothing.

1172
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,239
Hey, <i>Saumensch,</i> want to play?

1173
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:44,568
<i>Nein,</i> not today.

1174
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,439
Then let's steal something.

1175
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:50,041
I don't steal. I borrow.

1176
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:55,527
Then let's go borrow Franz Deutscher's bike
<i>und</i> get out of here.

1177
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,761
Can't you see I'm reading?

1178
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,491
Are you still angry with me?

1179
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,560
For what?

1180
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,204
Saving you.

1181
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,330
<i>Nein,</i> Rudy.

1182
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,800
You're very brave.

1183
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,331
Papa!

1184
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:31,891
You're home!

1185
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,164
What is it, my girl?

1186
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,405
My girl.

1187
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,645
My girl.

1188
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,367
It's nice to hear you play.

1189
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,449
I can't hear properly.

1190
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,124
I'm going to bed.

1191
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,447
Don't stay up too late, you two.

1192
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:41,561
Your mama told me what you did.

1193
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:46,810
I shouldn't have.

1194
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:49,003
Maybe you had to.

1195
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,841
I keep thinking about Max.

1196
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,000
Wondering where he is.

1197
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,010
Me, too.

1198
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:04,008
I'm not sure what it all meant.

1199
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,602
Everything he went through.

1200
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,288
Everything we did.

1201
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,766
We were just being people.

1202
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,331
That's what people do.

1203
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,566
Liesel...

1204
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:25,648
you are all grown up.

1205
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:35,639
<i>All I have learned is that
life makes no promises.</i>

1206
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,808
<i>So I had better get started.</i>

1207
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,006
<i>I have always tried to ignore it...</i>

1208
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:44,529
<i>but I know this all started with a train...</i>

1209
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,049
<i>and some snow...</i>

1210
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,685
<i>and my brother.</i>

1211
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:57,601
<i>Outside the car, the world was
thrown inside a snow-shaker.</i>

1212
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:59,919
Und <i>on a place called Heaven Street...</i>

1213
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:03,839
<i>a man with an accordion heart</i>
und <i>a woman cloaked in thunder...</i>

1214
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,644
<i>waited for their new daughter.</i>

1215
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:17,199
<i>He lived under our stairs
like a quiet owl with no wings...</i>

1216
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:20,404
<i>until the sun forgot
what his face was.</i>

1217
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,079
<i>The book floated down the river...</i>

1218
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:33,046
<i>like a red fish being chased
by a yellow-haired boy.</i>

1219
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,051
<i>For Max, who gave me eyes.</i>

1220
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,887
Good night, Your Majesty.

1221
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:30,279
<i>I've always quite liked
the image of me with a sickle and cape.</i>

1222
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:32,999
<i>Dark and formidable.</i>

1223
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:37,444
<i>Unfortunately, I'm far more
ordinary and commonplace.</i>

1224
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:43,325
<i>No one intended to destroy a street
named after Heaven.</i>

1225
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,559
<i>It was a misread on a map.</i>

1226
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:49,081
<i>No sirens that evening.</i>

1227
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:52,807
<i>First were Rudy's brothers.</i>

1228
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:59,171
<i>I read their simple dreams.</i>

1229
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,886
<i>Then, I kissed his mother.</i>

1230
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:12,405
<i>And stole the meanness
from Franz Deutscher's heart.</i>

1231
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,285
<i>Rosa, I caught mid-snore.</i>

1232
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:24,519
<i>I could swear I heard her
call me a</i> Saukerl.

1233
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:30,409
<i>Then I felt her regrets for not
sharing more of her very big heart.</i>

1234
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:36,246
<i>As for Hans, his soul was lighter
than a child's.</i>

1235
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,485
<i>I felt his itch for one last tune
on his accordion...</i>

1236
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,520
<i>and heard his final thought...</i>

1237
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,124
<i>"Liesel."</i>

1238
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:41,526
Over here!

1239
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,045
Just over.

1240
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,167
Your hand.

1241
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:13,321
Mama? Papa?

1242
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:52,611
Papa?

1243
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,765
Papa.

1244
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,326
Rudy?

1245
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,728
<i>Saumensch.</i>

1246
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,201
Liesel.

1247
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:52,959
I need to tell you...

1248
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:54,650
Don't speak.

1249
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,409
I need to say it.

1250
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,041
I...

1251
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:08,441
Rudy?

1252
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,241
Rudy, <i>nein.</i>

1253
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:13,725
Rudy, wake up.

1254
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:15,919
Rudy, <i>nein!</i>

1255
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:18,771
Wake up, Rudy! Rudy, wake up!

1256
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:21,130
Rudy, kiss me.

1257
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:31,288
<i>Rudy, his soul just rolled into my arms.</i>

1258
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:53,529
<i>In my job, I am always
finding humans at their best...</i>

1259
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,879
<i>and their worst.</i>

1260
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:59,368
<i>I see their ugliness, and their beauty...</i>

1261
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,925
<i>and I wonder how the
same thing can be both.</i>

1262
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:57,727
Liesel!

1263
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,920
Max!

1264
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:17,639
<i>I have seen a great many things.</i>

1265
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:21,159
<i>I've attended all the
world's worst disasters...</i>

1266
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:24,330
<i>and worked for the greatest of villains.</i>

1267
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,929
<i>And I've seen the greatest wonders.</i>

1268
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:31,039
<i>But it's still like I said it was.</i>

1269
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:33,971
<i>No one lives forever.</i>

1270
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:45,079
<i>When I finally came for Liesel...</i>

1271
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,679
<i>I took selfish pleasure in the knowledge</i>

1272
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:51,407
<i>that she had lived her 90 years so wisely.</i>

1273
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:02,359
<i>By then, her stories
had touched many souls.</i>

1274
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,689
<i>Some of whom I came to know in passing.</i>

1275
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:16,526
<i>Max, whose friendship lasted
almost as long as Liesel.</i>

1276
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,050
<i>Almost.</i>

1277
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,959
<i>In her final thoughts...</i>

1278
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:28,563
<i>she saw the long list of lives
that merged with hers.</i>

1279
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:30,759
<i>Her three children.</i>

1280
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,839
<i>Her grandchildren.</i>

1281
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:35,088
<i>Her husband.</i>

1282
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:38,279
<i>Among them, lit like lanterns...</i>

1283
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,679
<i>were Hans and Rosa...</i>

1284
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,239
<i>her brother...</i>

1285
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:47,480
<i>and the boy whose hair
remained the color of lemons forever.</i>

1286
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,799
<i>I wanted to tell the book thief</i>

1287
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,679
<i>she was one of the few souls...</i>

1288
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:57,680
<i>that made me wonder
what it was to live.</i>

1289
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,839
<i>But in the end, there were no words.</i>

1290
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:03,804
<i>Only peace.</i>

1291
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:07,839
<i>The only truth I truly know...</i>

1292
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:12,682
<i>is that I am haunted by humans.</i>

1293
02:05:13,305 --> 02:06:13,882
