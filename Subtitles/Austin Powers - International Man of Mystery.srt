1
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:37,208
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to my underground lair.

2
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:39,036
I have gathered here
before me...

3
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:41,959
the world's
deadliest assassins...

4
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:47,844
and yet each of you has failed
to kill Austin Powers.

5
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,615
That makes me angry,
and when Dr. Evil gets angry...

6
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:53,462
Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset.

7
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,387
And when Mr. Bigglesworth
gets upset...

8
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:58,272
people die!

9
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:07,927
Why must I be surrounded
by frickin' idiots?

10
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:17,546
Mustafa, Frau Farbissina...

11
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:20,431
I spared your lives
because I need you...

12
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:23,316
to help me rid the world
of Britain's top secret agent...

13
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,201
the only man
who can stop me now.

14
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,049
We must kill Austin Powers!

15
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:10,445
Come on, babies.
Work with me, people.

16
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,330
Show me love.

17
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,177
Great, baby!

18
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:19,063
Oh, behave.

19
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:21,948
It's Austin Powers!

20
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,069
It's Austin Powers!

21
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:36,968
Hello, Mrs. Kensington.

22
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:41,815
Why don't you ever model for me?

23
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:45,701
You know how Mr. Kensington
feels about that.

24
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,548
Oh, behave.

25
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,395
Yeah, baby!

26
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:02,013
I'm Basil Exposition
with British lntelligence.

27
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:04,898
We have just received word
that Dr. Evil...

28
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:06,783
is planning a trap for you
tonight...

29
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:10,707
at the Electric Psychedelic
Pussycat Swinger's Club...

30
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:11,555
here in swinging London.

31
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:13,516
We'll be there.

32
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,791
There you go. Come on, baby.

33
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,409
Austin, it's a swinging shindig.

34
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,294
It's my happening, baby,
and it freaks me out!

35
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,179
Yeah, man!

36
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,339
Can I get you a drink?

37
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:08,301
Sure!

38
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:11,263
Austin,
we've got to look for Dr. Evil.

39
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,110
Wait. I've got an idea.

40
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,956
Austin! Why on earth
did you hit that woman?

41
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:19,842
Let me show you, baby.

42
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,803
That ain't no woman.

43
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:24,728
It's a man, man.

44
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,536
One of Dr. Evil's assassins.

45
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:31,422
Look out! He's got a knife!

46
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:38,116
Good work, Mrs. Kensington.

47
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:39,079
Get up!

48
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:43,002
Where's Dr. Evil?

49
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:43,887
Where is he?

50
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:47,734
There's the bastard.

51
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,619
Let's go.

52
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:52,542
Coming through.

53
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,315
I've got you now, Dr. Evil.

54
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:00,238
Not this time.

55
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,161
Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!

56
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:06,085
See you in the future,
Mr. Powers.

57
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,779
My God! He's freezing himself.

58
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,671
And so Dr. Evil escaped...

59
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:43,594
and had himself
cryogenically frozen...

60
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,480
to return when free love
no longer reigned...

61
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,366
and greed and corruption
ruled again.

62
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,640
Commander Gilmour?

63
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,601
Speaking.

64
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:09,525
This is Ritter in
Sou-west Com Three.

65
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,449
We have a potential bogey
with erratic vectoring...

66
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:13,373
and an unorthodox entry angle.

67
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,296
What are you saying, son?

68
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,220
It appears to be
in the shape of a Big Boy.

69
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:21,067
Good God. He's back.

70
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,991
In many ways,
the Big Boy never left, sir.

71
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,876
He's always offered
the same high-quality meals...

72
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:27,761
at competitive prices.

73
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:28,723
Shut up.

74
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:30,684
Shall I scramble Tac HQ
for an intercept?

75
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,608
What's its current position?

76
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,531
I'm presently tracking it
over Nevada.

77
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:37,418
Oh, my God! The Big Boy's gone.

78
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,342
Listen, son...

79
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:42,265
I want you to forget
what you saw here today.

80
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,150
Phillips, call the President.

81
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:49,997
Prepare the jet,
bring my overnight bag...

82
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,844
and feed my fish.

83
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,730
Not too much.

84
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:58,615
I'm off to London, England.

85
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,310
Powers volunteered
to have himself frozen...

86
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,233
in case Dr. Evil
should ever return.

87
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,118
I hope your boy's up to it.

88
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:15,043
We don't want to have to bail
you out again like after WW ll.

89
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:18,774
This is our celebrity vault.

90
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,279
Please.

91
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:33,202
Who is this Austin Powers?

92
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,125
The ultimate gentleman spy--
irresistible to women...

93
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:42,011
deadly to his enemies,
a legend in his own time.

94
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:45,782
Attention. Stage one:
laser cutting begins.

95
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:49,552
Laser cutting complete.

96
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:05,056
Stage two: warm liquid
goo phase beginning.

97
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,750
Warm liquid goo phase complete.

98
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:15,635
Stage three:
reanimation beginning.

99
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:19,369
Reanimation complete.

100
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:27,177
Stage four:
cleansing beginning.

101
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,833
Cleansing complete.

102
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:59,878
Stage five:
evacuation beginning.

103
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,579
Evacuation comp--

104
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:57,432
Where am l?

105
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:01,395
In the Ministry of Defense.

106
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,243
It's 1997.

107
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,166
You've been cryogenically frozen
for 30 years.

108
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:08,051
Who are these people?

109
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:08,975
The shouting
is a temporary side effect...

110
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,936
of the unfreezing process.

111
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,860
Yes. I'm having
difficulty controlling...

112
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:15,746
the volume of my voice!

113
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,669
This is Commander Gilmour,
U.S. Strategic Command...

114
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,554
and General Borschevsky,
Russian lntelligence.

115
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:25,401
Are you mad?

116
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:27,287
A lot's happened
since you were frozen.

117
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:29,211
The cold war's over.

118
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:33,135
Finally, those capitalist pigs
will pay for their crimes.

119
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:34,982
Eh, comrades?

120
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:36,905
Austin, we won.

121
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,829
Groovy. Smashing.
Yay, capitalism.

122
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,599
Mr. Powers,
the president's quite concerned.

123
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,484
We've got a madman on the loose
in Nevada.

124
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,293
When do I begin?

125
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:52,256
Immediately.

126
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,218
You'll be working
with Miss Kensington.

127
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,141
Mrs. Kensington!

128
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:01,026
Austin, Mrs. Kensington
has long since retired.

129
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:04,873
Miss Kensington is her daughter.

130
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:05,721
Here she is.

131
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:12,568
Vanessa
is one of our top agents.

132
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:21,224
My God,
Vanessa's got a fabulous body...

133
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:24,072
and I bet she shags like a minx.

134
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,919
How do I tell them that because
of the unfreezing process...

135
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:29,804
I have no inner monologue?

136
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:36,651
I hope I didn't say that
out loud just now.

137
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:43,345
Mr. Powers, my job is to
acclimatize you to the nineties.

138
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:46,193
A lot's changed since 1967.

139
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:49,078
No doubt, luv,
but as long as people...

140
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:50,963
are still having promiscuous sex
with many anonymous partners...

141
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:51,887
without protection...

142
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,811
while experimenting
with mind-expanding drugs...

143
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:57,696
in a consequence-free
environment...

144
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,620
I'll be sound as a pound.

145
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,390
Danger Powers' personal effects.

146
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:09,275
Actually,
my name is Austin Powers.

147
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:11,161
It says here
Name--Danger Powers."

148
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:15,971
Danger's my middle name.

149
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:19,856
Austin Danger Powers--

150
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:22,741
one blue crushed velvet suit...

151
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:23,626
Hey, all right.

152
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,588
One frilly lace cravat...

153
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:26,511
There it is.

154
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,474
One silver medallion
with male" symbol...

155
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,320
one pair of ltalian boots...

156
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:34,244
Buon giorno, boys.

157
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:35,168
One vinyl record album...

158
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,130
Burt Bacharach
plays his hits...

159
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:43,977
one Swedish-made
penis enlarger pump...

160
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,710
That's not mine.

161
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:51,671
One credit card receipt for
Swedish-made penis enlarger...

162
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,480
signed by Austin Powers.

163
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:55,403
I'm telling you, baby,
that's not mine.

164
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:58,327
One warranty card for Swedish-
made penis enlarger pump...

165
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,212
filled out by Austin Powers.

166
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,061
I don't even know what this is.

167
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:05,984
This sort of thing
ain't my bag, baby.

168
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:09,907
One book: Swedish-made
Penis Enlarger Pumps And Me...

169
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:12,754
(This sort of thing
is my bag, baby)...

170
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,639
by Austin Powers.

171
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,563
Just sign the form.

172
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:19,448
Don't get heavy, man.

173
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,372
I'll sign it,
just to get things moving.

174
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:24,257
You're all right, baby.

175
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:26,181
Listen, Mr. Powers.

176
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,105
I look forward
to working with you...

177
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,029
but do me a favor
and stop calling me baby.

178
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:33,914
You can address me as...
Agent Kensington.

179
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,799
Oh, come on.

180
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,685
All right, then...Vanessa.

181
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,608
Was that so hard?

182
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,493
Come along.
We have to leave immediately.

183
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,417
We preserved your private jet
just as you left it.

184
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,302
It's waiting
at Heathrow Airport.

185
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:51,225
My jumbo jet! Smashing, baby!

186
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:53,113
Sorry.

187
00:14:59,306 --> 00:14:59,806
Quickly.

188
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:01,768
Come on, lad. Let's go.

189
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:19,119
Gentlemen,
welcome to my underground lair.

190
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:22,004
It's been 30 years,
but I'm back.

191
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,889
Everything's gone perfectly
to plan...

192
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:26,775
except for one small flaw--

193
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,698
due to a technical error
by my henchman Mustafa...

194
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:33,584
complications arose
in the unfreezing process.

195
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,430
But my design was perfect.

196
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,316
Look what you did
to Mr. Bigglesworth!

197
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:43,162
But, Dr. Evil, we were unable
to anticipate...

198
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:46,049
feline complications
to the reanimation process--

199
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:47,896
Silence!

200
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:57,552
Let this be
a reminder to you all...

201
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:01,476
that this organization
will not tolerate failure.

202
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,170
Let's get down to business.

203
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,864
We've got a lot of work to do.

204
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:16,788
Somebody help me!

205
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:20,712
I'm still alive,
only I'm very badly burned.

206
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,482
Some of you I know...

207
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,444
some of you I'm meeting
for the first time.

208
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,329
Hello up there! Anyone!

209
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:33,214
Could someone call an ambulance?
I'm in quite a lot of pain.

210
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:36,063
You've all been gathered here
to form--

211
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:38,948
Excuse me.

212
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:39,833
He's down there.

213
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:43,795
No, not dead--burned. Badly.

214
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,450
If somebody could open
the retrieval hatch down here...

215
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,336
I could get out.

216
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,260
I designed this device myself--

217
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:59,183
Good. I'm glad you found me.
Listen...

218
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:03,031
I'm very badly burned,
so if you could just--

219
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:04,878
You shot me!

220
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:05,801
Moving on--

221
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:08,764
You shot me right in the arm!

222
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:24,151
Let me go around the table
and introduce everyone.

223
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:25,038
Frau Farbissina--

224
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,000
founder of the militant wing
of the Salvation Army.

225
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:35,847
Random Task--Korean ex-wrestler,
evil handyman extraordinaire.

226
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,579
Show them what you do.

227
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,930
Patty O'Brien--
ex-lrish assassin.

228
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,815
His trademark--
a superstitious man...

229
00:17:57,238 --> 00:18:00,739
he leaves a tiny keepsake
from his good luck bracelet...

230
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:02,586
on every victim he kills.

231
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:04,509
Scotland Yard
would love to get their hands...

232
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,433
on that piece of evidence.

233
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:10,356
They're always
after me lucky charms.

234
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,051
Why does everyone always laugh
when I say that?

235
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,899
They are after me lucky charms!

236
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:22,784
What?

237
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,707
It's a television commercial...

238
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,592
with this cartoon leprechaun...

239
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,477
and all of these children
are trying to chase him--

240
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,402
Hey, leprechaun man!

241
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:35,325
Won't you give
your Lucky Charms?"

242
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,210
And there's all these
tiny bits of marshmallows...

243
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,095
stuck right in the cereal...

244
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,019
so that when the kids eat them,
they think...

245
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:43,943
Oh, this is candy.
I'm having fun!"

246
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,753
Finally,
we come to my number-two man.

247
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:51,638
His name...

248
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:52,561
Number Two.

249
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,523
For 30 years,
Number Two has run Virtucon...

250
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,408
the legitimate face
of my evil empire.

251
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:03,216
Dr. Evil,
over the last 30 years...

252
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,103
Virtucon has grown
by leaps and bounds.

253
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:10,989
About 15 years ago, we changed
from volatile chemicals...

254
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:13,797
to the communications industry.

255
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:16,682
We own cable companies
in 38 states.

256
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,567
We own a steel mill
in Cleveland...

257
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:22,454
shipping in Texas,
oil refineries in Seattle...

258
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,339
and a factory in Chicago...

259
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:27,262
that makes miniature models
of factories.

260
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,147
Naturally.

261
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:30,071
Gentlemen...

262
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:33,918
I have a plan.

263
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:45,498
It's called blackmail.

264
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:48,421
As you know, the royal family
of Britain...

265
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:51,307
are the wealthiest landowners
in the world.

266
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,192
Either the royal family
pays us...

267
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:55,115
an exorbitant amount of money...

268
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,039
or we make it seem
that Prince Charles...

269
00:19:58,426 --> 00:19:59,926
has had an affair
outside of marriage...

270
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,849
and therefore,
would have to divorce.

271
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,619
Prince Charles
did have an affair...

272
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:10,543
he admitted it,
and they are now divorced.

273
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:14,429
OK, people, you have to tell me
these things.

274
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:18,276
I've been frozen for 30 years.

275
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:20,122
Throw me a frickin' bone here.

276
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:24,046
I'm the boss. Need the info.

277
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:25,894
No problem.

278
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:27,817
Here's my second plan.

279
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,741
In the sixties, I developed
a weather-changing machine...

280
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:34,626
a sophisticated heat beam
which we called a laser."

281
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:37,473
Using these lasers,"
we punch a hole...

282
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,320
in the protective layer
around the world...

283
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:43,244
which we call the ozone" layer.

284
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,130
Slowly, ultraviolet rays
would pour in...

285
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:49,976
increasing
the risk of skin cancer.

286
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:56,863
That is, unless the world
pays us a hefty ransom.

287
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:04,442
That also already has happened.

288
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,289
Shit.

289
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,136
Hell, let's just do
what we always do--

290
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,059
hijack some nuclear weapons
and hold the world hostage.

291
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,907
Gentlemen,
it's come to my attention...

292
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:17,831
a breakaway Russian republic,
Kreplachistan...

293
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,755
is about to transfer
a nuclear warhead...

294
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,640
to the United Nations
in a few days.

295
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:24,563
Here's the plan.

296
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:29,487
We get the warhead
and hold the world ransom for...

297
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:32,295
one million dollars!

298
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:38,067
Don't you think
we should maybe ask...

299
00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:39,952
for more
than a million dollars?

300
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:43,876
A million dollars isn't exactly
a lot of money these days.

301
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:46,723
Virtucon alone
makes over $9 billion a year.

302
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:48,608
Really?

303
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,531
That's a lot more.

304
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:51,455
OK, then.

305
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:55,418
We hold the world ransom for...

306
00:21:55,764 --> 00:22:00,264
one hundred billion dollars!

307
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,920
Pretty groovy jumbo jet, eh?

308
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:07,844
When you see this jet
a-rockin'...

309
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:09,768
don't come a-knockin', baby!

310
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:12,654
I'm going to need you to sign
these release forms.

311
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:13,577
Release forms?

312
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,539
You're not officially working
for Ministry of Defense...

313
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:19,424
and these forms indemnify
the ministry against...

314
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,309
any mishaps that may occur
in the line of duty.

315
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:23,232
Mishaps?
But isn't that what being...

316
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:27,157
an international
man of mystery's all about?

317
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:32,003
Name--Austin...Danger Powers.

318
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:34,813
Sex--yes, please!

319
00:22:35,198 --> 00:22:36,698
How does a hot chick like you...

320
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,622
end up working
at the Ministry of Defense?

321
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:41,507
Well, I went to Oxford...

322
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:44,393
where I excelled
in several subjects...

323
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:47,316
but I ended up specializing
in foreign languages.

324
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:48,201
I really wanted to travel.

325
00:22:48,663 --> 00:22:50,163
You know,
sort of see the world?

326
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:51,086
That's fascinating.

327
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,010
Why don't we go in the back
and shag?

328
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:54,933
What?

329
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:55,895
I've been frozen for 30 years.

330
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:58,857
I've gotta see if my bits
and pieces are still working.

331
00:22:59,243 --> 00:22:59,743
Excuse me?

332
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:01,705
My wedding tackle.

333
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:02,629
I'm sorry--

334
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,590
My meat and two veg,
my twig and berries.

335
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:06,514
Hello, lads, you still awake?

336
00:23:06,937 --> 00:23:08,437
Mr. Powers, please.

337
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:11,361
I'd appreciate it if you could
concentrate on our mission...

338
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:14,246
and give your libido a rest.

339
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:19,017
Can I show you something?

340
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:36,406
I won't bite...hard.

341
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:42,062
All right.

342
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:46,947
Let me ask you a question,
and be honest.

343
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:50,757
Do I make you horny?

344
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:51,681
Randy?

345
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:58,527
I hope this is part
of the unfreezing process.

346
00:23:58,874 --> 00:24:00,374
Oh, turbulence! Look at that!

347
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,298
I've gone over!

348
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:05,183
Oh, I fell over again!

349
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,031
I will never
have sex with you, ever!

350
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:10,916
If you were
the last man on Earth...

351
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:12,839
and I was
the last woman on Earth...

352
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:14,763
and the future
of the human race...

353
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:17,725
depended on our having sex
simply for procreation...

354
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,610
I still would not
have sex with you.

355
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:22,534
What's your point?

356
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:41,732
Remember when we froze
your semen?

357
00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:44,656
You said if it didn't look
like you were coming back...

358
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,541
we should try
to make you a son...

359
00:24:46,964 --> 00:24:48,464
so that a part of you
could live forever.

360
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:49,388
Sure.

361
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:55,349
After a couple of years,
we got a little impatient.

362
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,121
Dr. Evil,
I want you to meet your son.

363
00:24:59,467 --> 00:24:59,967
My son?

364
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,853
Scott!

365
00:25:14,857 --> 00:25:16,357
I'm your father.

366
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,050
I haven't seen you
my whole life...

367
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:27,974
and now you come back
and just expect a relationship?

368
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:29,821
I hate you.

369
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:33,631
What?

370
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:35,593
Could I have a hug?

371
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,440
-Give me a hug.
-No way.

372
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:40,363
I'm not coming over there.

373
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:42,286
-Let's go.
-Forget it.

374
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:44,248
-Pronto.
-What are you doing?

375
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:47,172
I'm with it. I'm hip.

376
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:03,522
Don't look at me
like I'm frickin' Frankenstein.

377
00:26:03,908 --> 00:26:04,408
Give your father a hug.

378
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,370
Hey, don't touch me!

379
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:09,294
Hug...

380
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,179
Get away from me,
you lazy-eyed psycho!

381
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:30,491
Viva Las Vegas, baby!

382
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:42,918
Welcome to Las Vegas, sir.

383
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:49,726
So, which side of the bed
do you want?

384
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:51,574
You're sleeping on the sofa.

385
00:26:51,998 --> 00:26:54,498
In fact,
I'd like to remind you...

386
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:56,345
that the only reason
we're sharing a room...

387
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:58,269
is to keep up the context...

388
00:26:58,731 --> 00:26:59,231
that we're
a married couple on vacation.

389
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:04,154
Shall we shag now,
or shall we shag later?

390
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:05,001
How do you like to do it?

391
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:05,963
Do you like to wash up first...

392
00:27:07,386 --> 00:27:08,886
you know, top and tails,
whore's bath?

393
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:11,772
Before I'm on the job, I like
to give my undercarriage...

394
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,695
a bit of a how's-your-father.

395
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:16,543
I'm just joking.

396
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:19,505
I'm just trying
to get a rise out of you...

397
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,390
for shits and giggles.

398
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,313
Let's unpack.

399
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,008
Blimey...

400
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:31,931
nerd alert!

401
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:47,321
How did this get in here?

402
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:50,282
Somebody's
playing a prank on me.

403
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,168
Honestly, it's not mine.

404
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:55,091
Hey, Americans!

405
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:55,976
Enjoy that wine.

406
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:57,899
There you are.

407
00:27:58,361 --> 00:27:58,861
Do I know you?

408
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:00,823
No, but that's where you are.
You're there.

409
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,747
Viva Las Vegas, baby.

410
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:08,557
There's a company
in Las Vegas called Virtucon...

411
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:10,442
which we think may be linked
to Dr. Evil.

412
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:14,365
Plenty of Virtucon executives
are gambling in this casino.

413
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:16,212
Smashing. Let's go.

414
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:18,136
There's one over there.

415
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,060
Changing a thousand.

416
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:21,945
Excuse me.

417
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:27,754
Do you mind if I join you?

418
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:28,677
Not at all.

419
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:31,563
The game is blackjack,
gentlemen.

420
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:34,525
Ten thousand dollars
minimum bet.

421
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,411
King for you, sir,
and a three for you.

422
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,219
Seventeen?

423
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:48,875
Hit me.

424
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:51,798
You have 17, sir.

425
00:28:52,222 --> 00:28:53,723
I like to live dangerously.

426
00:28:57,994 --> 00:28:59,494
Four. Twenty-one.

427
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:07,149
Five.

428
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:12,035
I'll stay.

429
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,920
I suggest you hit, sir.

430
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:19,729
I also like to live dangerously.

431
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:21,614
As you wish, sir.

432
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:26,424
Twenty beats your five.

433
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,348
I'm sorry, sir.

434
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:30,271
I won't lie to you.

435
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:33,156
Cards are not my bag, baby.

436
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,080
Allow myself to introduce...

437
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:39,927
myself.

438
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:44,813
My name is Richie Cunningham,
and this is my wife Oprah.

439
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:48,546
My name is Number Two.

440
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:50,469
This is my ltalian
confidential secretary.

441
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:52,392
Her name is Alotta...

442
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:55,316
Alotta Fagina.

443
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:57,163
Come again?

444
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,049
I'm just not getting it.

445
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,010
It sounded like you said
your name was a lot of...

446
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:05,819
Never mind.

447
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,666
What exactly do you do,
Mr. Number Two?

448
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:13,552
That's my business.

449
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:17,476
If you'll excuse me, I have
to go to the little boys' room.

450
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:20,285
You keep your eye
on the ltalian bird.

451
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:23,208
We'll rendezvous
back at the hotel suite.

452
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:40,482
You didn't happen to see...

453
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,406
anything at all?

454
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:45,329
Sorry.

455
00:30:59,179 --> 00:30:59,679
Howdy.

456
00:31:05,912 --> 00:31:08,413
That is one crazy getup
you got there, fella.

457
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:09,298
Thank you.

458
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:11,222
Are you in the show?

459
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,183
No, actually, I'm English.

460
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:16,107
I'm sorry.

461
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:28,572
Hey, partner?

462
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:30,496
Have a good one.

463
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,501
Partner, relax. Don't force it.

464
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:58,388
Gonna blow out your o-ring,
drop a lung.

465
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:15,815
Who does Number Two work for?

466
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,471
That's right, buddy.
You show that turd who's boss.

467
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:30,241
Grab ahold of something,
bite your lip, and give it hell.

468
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,051
We're gonna get through this.

469
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,821
That sounds pretty nasty.

470
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:39,745
How about
a courtesy flush over there?

471
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:49,364
Jesus Christ, boy.

472
00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:52,287
What did you eat?

473
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,789
Gentlemen...

474
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:05,714
the warhead is ours.

475
00:33:06,137 --> 00:33:07,637
Patch me through...

476
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,560
to the United Nations
security secret meeting room.

477
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:14,408
Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.

478
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,293
In a while you'll notice...

479
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:19,217
the Kreplachistani warhead
has gone missing.

480
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:24,103
If you want it back, you're
going to have to pay me...

481
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:26,911
one million dollars!

482
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:34,528
Sorry.

483
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,415
One hundred billion dollars.

484
00:33:40,762 --> 00:33:42,262
Gentlemen, silence.

485
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:44,186
Now, Mr. Evil--

486
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:46,109
Dr. Evil.

487
00:33:46,532 --> 00:33:48,032
I didn't spend six years
in evil medical school...

488
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:50,956
to be called mister,
thank you very much.

489
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:52,841
It is the policy
of the United Nations...

490
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,765
not to negotiate
with terrorists.

491
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,650
Really?

492
00:33:59,036 --> 00:33:59,536
So long.

493
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:13,231
Gentlemen, in exactly five days,
we will be $100 billion richer.

494
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:52,473
How's Austin?

495
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:54,396
He's asleep.

496
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,320
You didn't.

497
00:34:57,705 --> 00:34:59,205
I made him sleep on the sofa.

498
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:02,130
Vanessa, I'm proud of you.

499
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:03,015
Why?

500
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:07,977
Because you've managed to

501
00:35:08,285 --> 00:35:09,785
God knows he tried, mummy.

502
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,709
I actually had to end up
being rather firm with him.

503
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,594
What about his teeth?
It's really bizarre.

504
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:19,480
You have to understand,
in Britain in the sixties...

505
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:23,328
you could be a sex symbol
and still have bad teeth.

506
00:35:23,674 --> 00:35:24,174
It didn't matter.

507
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:25,136
Did you ever?

508
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:28,098
Me? No, of course not.

509
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:29,983
I was married to your father.

510
00:35:30,406 --> 00:35:31,906
Did you ever want to?

511
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,830
Austin is very charming...

512
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:36,716
very debonair.

513
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:38,639
He's handsome, witty...

514
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:40,563
has a knowledge of fine wines.

515
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:44,486
Women want him,
and men want to be him.

516
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:48,334
He's every bit an international
man of mystery.

517
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:50,181
You didn't answer my question.

518
00:35:50,604 --> 00:35:52,104
I know.

519
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:55,028
Let me just say this--

520
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:59,914
Austin was the most loyal

521
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:02,684
I will always love him.

522
00:36:05,992 --> 00:36:06,492
Do you want to speak to him?

523
00:36:06,954 --> 00:36:08,454
No. It's been too long.

524
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:11,378
I'm going to have to go,
but I love you.

525
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:12,265
Ciao, darling.

526
00:36:18,496 --> 00:36:20,996
A limo's just pulled up.

527
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:21,882
Let me see.

528
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,768
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

529
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:26,691
How can you tell?

530
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:28,653
I never forget a pussy...

531
00:36:29,076 --> 00:36:29,576
cat.

532
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:35,423
Oh, no. He's gone away.

533
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:41,233
My God, Vanessa,
you are so incredibly beautiful.

534
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:44,004
That's it.

535
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:46,889
Come on, darling...

536
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:50,851
I'm gonna take you out
for a night on the town.

537
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:03,315
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Bacharach.

538
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:06,201
What the world...

539
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:08,087
Needs now...

540
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,010
Is love...

541
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,933
Sweet love.

542
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,857
No, not just for some...

543
00:37:15,242 --> 00:37:17,743
But everyone.

544
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:06,756
Austin, get on with it.

545
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,680
I'm going to do it.

546
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:14,412
Right hand green!

547
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:21,183
You all right?

548
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:22,106
You know what?

549
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:25,069
Wait a tick.
I forgot something in the lobby.

550
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:28,916
Why don't I take the stairs?

551
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:36,648
Why take the stairs
when I could take the escalator?

552
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:48,342
Why take the escalator when
I've got a perfectly good canoe?

553
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:51,037
I know what--
I'll take the elevator.

554
00:38:57,193 --> 00:38:59,693
Come have some champagne
with me.

555
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,502
Oh, I tripped.

556
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,425
I haven't had
this much fun since college.

557
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,310
I'm sorry.

558
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:09,272
Why?

559
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:12,197
I'm sorry that bug up your ass
had to die.

560
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:18,968
Always wanting to have fun,
that's you in a nutshell.

561
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:19,815
No, this is me in a nutshell.

562
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,776
Help! I'm in a nutshell!

563
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,700
How did I get
into this nutshell?

564
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:25,623
Look at the size
of this bloody great big--

565
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:28,546
What sort of shell
has a nut like this?

566
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:30,433
This is crazy.

567
00:39:30,856 --> 00:39:33,356
Look at you.

568
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:34,241
You're smashed.

569
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,165
Yes, you are.

570
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:38,127
No, I'm the sensible one.

571
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:40,051
I'm always
the designated driver.

572
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:43,859
Kiss me.

573
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:45,821
I can't, darling.

574
00:39:46,244 --> 00:39:46,744
You're drunk. It's not right.

575
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:47,707
I'm not drunk.

576
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:49,630
I'm just beginning to see...

577
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:51,592
what my mummy was talking about
all those years ago.

578
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:52,515
I can't.

579
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:57,362
Tell me all about my mummy
in the sixties.

580
00:39:57,786 --> 00:39:59,286
I'm dying to know
what she was like.

581
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:02,172
She was very groovy.

582
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:07,981
Your dad loved her very much.

583
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,790
If there was one other cat
in this world...

584
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,713
that could have loved her...

585
00:40:15,098 --> 00:40:18,598
and treated her as well
as your dad it was me.

586
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:22,446
But unfortunately
for yours truly...

587
00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:27,178
that train has sailed.

588
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:37,759
Come on, roll over.

589
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:39,682
Sleepytime.

590
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:46,414
Austin needs his hand back.

591
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,880
This is Basil Exposition
from British lntelligence.

592
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:03,765
I want you to find out
what part Virtucon plays...

593
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,650
in something called
Project Vulcan.

594
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:10,535
Go to Alotta Fagina's
penthouse immediately.

595
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,085
Great.

596
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:54,702
Cheeky, huh?

597
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:55,625
Come on, baby, give it to me.

598
00:42:05,705 --> 00:42:09,205
You seem surprised to see me,
Miss Fagina.

599
00:42:09,553 --> 00:42:14,053
What do you want...
Mr. Cunningham, was it?

600
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:16,861
Your boss, Number Two...

601
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:21,748
I understand that cat's involved
in big underground drills.

602
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:23,556
How did you know?

603
00:42:23,979 --> 00:42:25,479
I didn't, baby.

604
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:27,403
You just told me.

605
00:42:27,826 --> 00:42:30,326
We can talk
about business later.

606
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:33,211
Let me slip
into something more comfortable.

607
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,097
Oh, behave.

608
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:47,601
Good God.

609
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:24,110
Come in...

610
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:27,073
and I'll show you
everything you need to know.

611
00:43:57,274 --> 00:43:59,775
May I wash you?

612
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,660
Groovy, baby.

613
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,086
That feels yummy.

614
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:28,704
In Japan, men come first,
and women come second.

615
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:30,513
Or sometimes not at all.

616
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:36,322
Care for some saké?

617
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,207
Saké it to me, baby.

618
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,979
Kinky.

619
00:44:44,402 --> 00:44:44,902
Klinky.

620
00:44:54,982 --> 00:44:57,482
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

621
00:44:57,867 --> 00:45:01,367
I feel extreme relaxation.

622
00:45:07,486 --> 00:45:08,986
How dare you
break wind before me?

623
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,909
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was your turn.

624
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:16,641
Pardon me for being rude.

625
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:18,565
It was my food.

626
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:20,526
It just popped up
to say hello...

627
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,450
and now it's gone
back down below.

628
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:24,374
That's beautiful.

629
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:25,297
Thank you.

630
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,183
Let's make love...

631
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:33,144
you silly hairy little man.

632
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:34,954
I say! Hello, vicar.

633
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,802
That's the spot, all right.

634
00:45:41,148 --> 00:45:43,648
That's the spot right there.
Look at that, now.

635
00:45:48,842 --> 00:45:51,342
Austin Powers
is getting too close.

636
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:53,227
Any suggestions?

637
00:45:55,574 --> 00:46:00,075
I have created the ultimate
weapon to defeat Austin Powers.

638
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:03,846
Bring in the fembots!

639
00:46:18,658 --> 00:46:19,158
Go, fembots!

640
00:46:22,505 --> 00:46:26,005
These are the latest word
in android replicant technology.

641
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:29,852
Lethal, efficient, brutal.

642
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,700
No man can resist their charm.

643
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:34,585
Send in the guards!

644
00:46:38,856 --> 00:46:41,356
Kill these women.

645
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,325
Quite impressive.

646
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:09,248
Thank you, herr doctor.

647
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:13,133
I like to see girls
of that...caliber.

648
00:47:17,328 --> 00:47:18,828
By caliber, of course...

649
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:20,752
I mean both the size
of their gun barrels...

650
00:47:21,176 --> 00:47:22,676
and the high quality
of their character.

651
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,599
It's two meanings.
Caliber--it's a homonym.

652
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:31,293
Forget it.

653
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:36,101
At ease, boys.

654
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:41,987
I want to show you something.

655
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,835
We're going
to outfit you with this.

656
00:47:44,258 --> 00:47:45,758
It looks like a watch,
but, in fact...

657
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:48,682
it's a geosynchronous
positioning device.

658
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:49,567
Very shagadelic.

659
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:52,529
And then there's this.

660
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:54,415
Let me guess.

661
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:55,338
The floss is garrote wire...

662
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,300
the toothpaste
is plastic explosives...

663
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:02,185
and the toothbrush
is the detonation device.

664
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:03,032
No, actually.

665
00:48:03,493 --> 00:48:06,993
Since you've been frozen, there
have been fabulous advances...

666
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:07,841
in the field of dentistry.

667
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:09,803
What do you mean?

668
00:48:10,226 --> 00:48:10,726
Nothing.

669
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:13,689
Here's Basil.

670
00:48:15,998 --> 00:48:17,498
Let me bring you up to speed.

671
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:20,421
Dr. Evil has hijacked
a nuclear warhead...

672
00:48:20,806 --> 00:48:21,306
from Kreplachistan.

673
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:26,268
Only two things scare me,
and one is nuclear war.

674
00:48:26,576 --> 00:48:27,076
What's the other?

675
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:28,039
Excuse me?

676
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:29,001
What's the other thing
that scares you?

677
00:48:30,424 --> 00:48:31,924
Carnies.

678
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:33,810
Circus folk.

679
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:35,772
Nomads, you know.

680
00:48:36,195 --> 00:48:37,695
Smell like cabbage.

681
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:38,619
Small hands.

682
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,580
Indeed.

683
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:44,467
Perhaps these photographs are
the last piece of the puzzle.

684
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:47,352
I've uncovered the details
of Project Vulcan.

685
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:50,237
Oh, good God.
An underground missile?

686
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:52,122
Where did you find these?

687
00:48:52,545 --> 00:48:54,045
Austin did some reconnaissance
work last night...

688
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:57,969
at Alotta Fagina's penthouse.

689
00:48:58,316 --> 00:49:00,816
Our next move
is to infiltrate Virtucon.

690
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:02,703
Any ideas?

691
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:07,549
Virtucon runs a tour
of its facility every hour.

692
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:10,434
I thought we could disguise
ourselves as tourists...

693
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,320
and do some
on-site reconnaissance.

694
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:14,243
Top drawer, Kensington.

695
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:18,167
Austin,
I'd like you to meet somebody.

696
00:49:18,514 --> 00:49:21,014
This is my mother--
Mrs. Exposition.

697
00:49:21,399 --> 00:49:22,899
How do you do?

698
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:27,709
My God, man, what have you done?

699
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,632
That's not your mother.
It's a man, baby!

700
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:32,517
Get off! Come on!

701
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:35,442
Why won't this wig come off?

702
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,250
Hold on one second.

703
00:49:39,674 --> 00:49:41,174
Let go of my mother!

704
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,059
Are you all right?

705
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,982
Austin, have you gone mad?

706
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:49,867
You have
a lot of explaining to do.

707
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,754
I'm sorry.
I thought she was a man.

708
00:49:52,178 --> 00:49:54,678
Damn it,
you're talking about my mother!

709
00:49:55,063 --> 00:49:56,563
You have to admit,
she is rather mannish.

710
00:49:57,948 --> 00:49:59,448
No offense,
but if that is a woman...

711
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:03,333
it does look like she was beaten
with an ugly stick.

712
00:50:03,718 --> 00:50:04,218
Really, Austin.

713
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:14,951
Give in to the beauty of
your feelings and say the words.

714
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:15,761
Come on.

715
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:19,722
I love you, Dad.

716
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:22,569
I love you, too, son.

717
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:30,264
Group, we have some newcomers
here today with us.

718
00:50:30,649 --> 00:50:35,149
Say hello to Scott
and his father Mr...Avil?

719
00:50:35,457 --> 00:50:37,957
Evil, actually.

720
00:50:46,038 --> 00:50:47,538
Hello, everybody.

721
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:49,423
Scott,
why don't we start with you?

722
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:52,385
What brings you here
with us today?

723
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:56,270
I just really met my dad
for the first time 5 days ago.

724
00:50:56,617 --> 00:50:58,117
I was partially frozen
his whole life.

725
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:03,003
That is beautiful
that you can admit to that.

726
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,850
He comes back and wants me to
take over the family business.

727
00:51:06,236 --> 00:51:09,736
But, Scott, who's going to
take over the world when I die?

728
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:10,583
Listen to the words he used--

729
00:51:11,044 --> 00:51:13,544
Who's going to take over
the world when I die?"

730
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:18,431
It feels like that to some of us
sometimes, doesn't it?

731
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:20,239
What do you want to do, Scott?

732
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:24,124
I don't know.
I was thinking I like animals.

733
00:51:24,509 --> 00:51:25,009
Maybe I'd be a vet.

734
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:26,971
An evil vet?

735
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:29,894
No.
Maybe work in a petting zoo.

736
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:31,779
An evil petting zoo?

737
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:32,705
You always do that!

738
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:37,552
I think he hates me.

739
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:39,475
I really think
he wants to kill me.

740
00:51:39,898 --> 00:51:43,398
Scott, we don't want
to kill each other in here.

741
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:45,245
We might say
that we do sometimes...

742
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:47,169
but we really don't.

743
00:51:47,592 --> 00:51:49,093
Actually,
the boy's quite astute.

744
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:53,017
I really am trying to kill him,
but, so far, unsuccessfully.

745
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:55,863
He's quite wily,
like his old man.

746
00:51:58,173 --> 00:51:59,673
This is what I'm talking about.

747
00:52:00,096 --> 00:52:03,596
We've heard from you, Scott.

748
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:06,444
Now you tell us something
about yourself.

749
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:10,329
The details of my life
are quite inconsequential.

750
00:52:10,676 --> 00:52:13,176
Please.
Let's hear about your childhood.

751
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:14,061
-Yeah.
-Come on.

752
00:52:17,408 --> 00:52:20,908
Very well. Where do I begin?

753
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:23,756
My father was
a relentlessly self-improving...

754
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,642
boulangerie owner
from Belgium...

755
00:52:26,065 --> 00:52:28,565
with low-grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery.

756
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,450
My mother was a 15-year-old
French prostitute named Chloe...

757
00:52:32,797 --> 00:52:34,297
with webbed feet.

758
00:52:34,721 --> 00:52:37,221
My father would womanize, drink.

759
00:52:37,606 --> 00:52:39,106
He would make
outrageous claims...

760
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,030
Iike he invented
the question mark.

761
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:44,953
Sometimes he would accuse
chestnuts of being lazy...

762
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,800
the sort of general malaise...

763
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:50,686
that only the genius possess
and the insane lament.

764
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,571
My childhood was typical--

765
00:52:53,957 --> 00:52:57,458
summers in Rangoon,
luge lessons.

766
00:52:57,804 --> 00:53:00,304
In the spring,
we'd make meat helmets.

767
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:02,190
When I was insolent...

768
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:06,113
I was placed in a burlap bag
and beaten with reeds.

769
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,960
Pretty standard, really.

770
00:53:08,383 --> 00:53:09,883
At the age of 12,
I received my first scribe.

771
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:12,807
At the age of 14,
a Zoroastrian named Vilma...

772
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:15,693
ritualistically
shaved my testicles.

773
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,579
There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum.

774
00:53:18,964 --> 00:53:21,464
It's breathtaking.
I suggest you try it.

775
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:24,349
You know, we have to stop.

776
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,234
Austin,
can I have a word with you?

777
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:29,119
Of course you may, luv.

778
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:33,967
I know I'm being neurotic,
but I can't shake off...

779
00:53:34,352 --> 00:53:37,852
this suspicious feeling
about that ltalian secretary.

780
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:38,699
You know, Miss Fagina.

781
00:53:39,161 --> 00:53:40,661
I don't want
to sound paranoid...

782
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:43,585
but I've had some
bad relationships in the past...

783
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,470
and I have been known
to be jealous.

784
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:47,356
I'm sorry.

785
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:49,318
Don't be sorry, baby.

786
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:51,241
You're right to be suspicious.

787
00:53:51,665 --> 00:53:52,165
I shagged her.

788
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:54,126
What?

789
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,050
I shagged her rotten, baby!

790
00:53:56,473 --> 00:53:59,973
I don't believe you.
She was repellent.

791
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,820
Saucer of milk, table two.

792
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:03,706
But did you use protection?

793
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:06,631
Of course. I had
my nine-millimeter automatic.

794
00:54:07,054 --> 00:54:10,554
I meant did you use a condom?

795
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:13,401
Only sailors use condoms, baby.

796
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:15,248
Not in the nineties.

797
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:17,209
Well, they should,
those filthy beggars.

798
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:18,133
They go from port to port.

799
00:54:18,594 --> 00:54:21,095
Don't have a thrombo.

800
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:23,981
Alotta meant nothing to me.

801
00:54:24,366 --> 00:54:24,866
It means something to me.

802
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:27,827
If you want us
to have a relationship...

803
00:54:28,212 --> 00:54:30,712
get it into your head
that times have changed.

804
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:32,599
You can't just go off
shagging anybody anymore.

805
00:54:33,022 --> 00:54:35,522
And if you could, I wouldn't,
because I'm not like that.

806
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:41,255
You're everything to me.

807
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,178
You just don't get it, do you?

808
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:46,987
Good night, Austin.

809
00:54:47,448 --> 00:54:48,948
Welcome to the nineties.

810
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:51,872
You're going to be very lonely.

811
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:13,917
Check this guy out.

812
00:55:16,303 --> 00:55:17,803
Peace.

813
00:55:23,997 --> 00:55:26,497
Jimi Hendrix--deceased.

814
00:55:29,768 --> 00:55:30,268
Janis Joplin.

815
00:55:31,692 --> 00:55:33,192
Deceased, alcohol.

816
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:34,115
Mama Cass.

817
00:55:34,577 --> 00:55:38,077
Deceased, ham sandwich.

818
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:06,893
That's great.
Is the lighting halfway decent?

819
00:56:07,278 --> 00:56:07,778
Yes, indeed.
They got the flag up now.

820
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,740
You can see
the stars and stripes.

821
00:56:10,163 --> 00:56:11,663
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

822
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:18,397
Good morning, Austin.

823
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,320
I sometimes forget...

824
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:24,244
you've missed out
on the last 30 years.

825
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,090
Fall of the Berlin Wall...

826
00:56:26,514 --> 00:56:28,014
the first female
British Prime Minister...

827
00:56:28,437 --> 00:56:29,937
end of apartheid.

828
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:32,861
Yeah, and I can't believe
Liberace was gay.

829
00:56:33,246 --> 00:56:34,747
I mean, women loved him.

830
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,670
I didn't see that one coming.

831
00:56:38,055 --> 00:56:39,555
The tour is about to begin...

832
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,480
so if you'll please
take your seats...

833
00:56:41,903 --> 00:56:44,403
Welcome to Virtucon,
company of the future.

834
00:56:44,788 --> 00:56:46,288
Virtucon is a leading
manufacturer of many items...

835
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:49,212
you can find
right in your very own home.

836
00:56:49,597 --> 00:56:51,097
Do you think
she's prettier than me?

837
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:52,021
Who?

838
00:56:52,483 --> 00:56:52,983
You know who.

839
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:54,945
Oh, the ltalian bird.

840
00:56:55,368 --> 00:56:56,868
No, baby. She's rancid.

841
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:59,791
I think you're shagadelic, baby.

842
00:57:00,176 --> 00:57:01,676
You're switched on.
You're smashing.

843
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,600
We make steel,
petroleum products...

844
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:05,524
and volatile chemicals.

845
00:57:05,948 --> 00:57:09,449
But don't worry
about the ltalian bird.

846
00:57:09,795 --> 00:57:11,295
She's the village bicycle.

847
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,219
Everyone's had a ride.

848
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:17,104
On your right,
you'll notice a door...

849
00:57:17,489 --> 00:57:18,989
Ieading to a restricted area.

850
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:20,913
Only authorized
personnel are allowed...

851
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:21,836
I'll take him.

852
00:57:22,298 --> 00:57:23,798
You take her.

853
00:57:38,649 --> 00:57:39,149
Let's go.

854
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,111
It's Bolton.
We've got a problem.

855
00:57:42,496 --> 00:57:43,996
Intruders in the complex.

856
00:57:46,343 --> 00:57:46,843
Watch out.

857
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:49,728
-Halt.
-This way.

858
00:57:51,152 --> 00:57:51,652
Judo chop!

859
00:57:54,998 --> 00:57:56,498
They're coming!

860
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:58,424
Hang on. I'm going to floor it.

861
00:57:58,847 --> 00:57:59,347
Watch out. Move!

862
00:58:03,656 --> 00:58:05,156
Careful, Austin.

863
00:58:09,426 --> 00:58:10,926
Watch out!

864
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:22,468
Come on, let's go.

865
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:27,315
Thank goodness we made it.

866
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,200
Stay very cool, baby.

867
00:58:55,593 --> 00:58:58,093
Welcome to my underground lair.

868
00:58:58,478 --> 00:58:59,978
You're just in time.

869
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:01,901
Enjoy the show.

870
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:11,596
Gentlemen,
I give you the Vulcan...

871
00:59:11,943 --> 00:59:15,443
the world's most powerful
subterranean drill.

872
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,291
Does that make you horny?

873
00:59:17,714 --> 00:59:19,214
Not now, Austin.

874
00:59:19,637 --> 00:59:22,137
So powerful, it can penetrate
the earth's crust...

875
00:59:22,523 --> 00:59:24,023
delivering
a 50-kiloton nuclear warhead...

876
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:26,947
deep into the liquid
hot core of the planet.

877
00:59:27,332 --> 00:59:31,832
Upon detonation, every volcano
on earth will erupt.

878
00:59:35,026 --> 00:59:38,526
It seems we have no choice
but to pay your ransom.

879
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:40,374
You have my instructions.
Bye-bye.

880
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:46,183
Check it out, butt-head.
This chick has three boobs.

881
00:59:48,491 --> 00:59:49,991
How many butts does she have?

882
00:59:57,148 --> 00:59:59,648
Do you like
your quasi-futuristic clothes?

883
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:02,533
I designed them myself.

884
01:00:17,345 --> 01:00:19,845
Scott, my boy, how are you?

885
01:00:20,231 --> 01:00:21,731
How was your day?

886
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:24,654
My friend Sweet Jay took me
to that video arcade in town.

887
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:25,539
They don't speak English,
so Jay got into a fight...

888
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:29,501
and he's all, Quit hassling me
'cause I don't speak French."

889
01:00:30,811 --> 01:00:31,311
And then the guy
says something in Paris talk...

890
01:00:31,773 --> 01:00:33,273
and I'm like, Just back off."

891
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:34,196
And they're all, Get out."

892
01:00:34,658 --> 01:00:36,158
And we're like, Make me."

893
01:00:36,582 --> 01:00:37,082
It was cool.

894
01:00:38,505 --> 01:00:40,005
Fascinating.

895
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,928
What are your plans
for this evening?

896
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:43,852
I thought I'd stay in.

897
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:44,775
There's a good titty movie
on Skinimax.

898
01:00:45,237 --> 01:00:48,738
And that's how you'd like
to live your life?

899
01:00:51,008 --> 01:00:51,508
Pretty much.

900
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,470
What?

901
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:05,165
Scott, I want you to meet
Daddy's nemesis Austin Powers.

902
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:07,897
Are you feeding him?
Why don't you just kill him?

903
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:11,782
I have an even better idea.

904
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,668
I'm going to place him in
an easily escapable situation...

905
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:17,514
involving an overly
elaborate and exotic death.

906
01:01:19,862 --> 01:01:20,362
Why don't you
just shoot him now?

907
01:01:21,787 --> 01:01:23,287
I'll go get a gun.
We'll shoot him together.

908
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,210
It'll be fun. Bang!
Dead. Done.

909
01:01:25,633 --> 01:01:28,133
One more peep out of you
and you are grounded, mister...

910
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,018
and I am not joking.

911
01:01:32,365 --> 01:01:33,865
All right. Let's begin.

912
01:01:36,212 --> 01:01:37,713
You really expect them to pay?

913
01:01:41,022 --> 01:01:43,522
I expect them to die.

914
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,368
Even after they pay me
the money...

915
01:01:46,793 --> 01:01:48,293
I'm still going to melt
every city on the planet...

916
01:01:48,716 --> 01:01:51,216
with liquid hot magma.

917
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:54,026
Release the sharks!

918
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:56,949
You'll notice
that all the sharks...

919
01:01:57,373 --> 01:01:58,873
have laser beams
attached to their heads.

920
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:02,796
I figure every creature
deserves a warm meal.

921
01:02:05,066 --> 01:02:07,566
Dr. Evil, it's about the sharks.

922
01:02:07,951 --> 01:02:09,451
When you were frozen...

923
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,376
they were put
on the endangered species list.

924
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,300
We tried to get some...

925
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:16,223
but it would've taken months
to clear up the red tape.

926
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:20,109
I have one simple request...

927
01:02:20,455 --> 01:02:22,955
and that is to have sharks...

928
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:25,841
with frickin' laser beams
attached to their heads!

929
01:02:26,226 --> 01:02:28,727
Evidently, my cycloptic
colleague informs me...

930
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,612
that that can't be done.

931
01:02:31,035 --> 01:02:33,535
Can you remind me
what I pay you people for?

932
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,420
Honestly, throw me a bone here.

933
01:02:35,844 --> 01:02:37,344
What do we have?

934
01:02:37,768 --> 01:02:39,268
Sea bass.

935
01:02:45,463 --> 01:02:47,963
They are mutated sea bass.

936
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,848
Really? Are they ill-tempered?

937
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:51,733
Absolutely.

938
01:02:52,195 --> 01:02:53,695
That's a start.

939
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:54,618
All right, guard...

940
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:58,541
begin the unnecessarily
slow-moving dipping mechanism.

941
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:02,351
Close the tank!

942
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:05,237
Aren't you even
going to watch them?

943
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,160
They could get away.

944
01:03:08,546 --> 01:03:10,046
I'm going to leave them alone...

945
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:11,969
and not actually witness
them dying.

946
01:03:12,392 --> 01:03:13,892
I'm just going to assume
it all went to plan.

947
01:03:14,316 --> 01:03:15,816
I have a gun in my room.

948
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:17,740
You give me five seconds,
I'll get it.

949
01:03:18,164 --> 01:03:20,664
I'll come back, boom!
I'll blow their brains out.

950
01:03:22,972 --> 01:03:26,472
You just don't get it, do you?

951
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:27,319
You don't.

952
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:30,243
It's no hassle.

953
01:03:39,323 --> 01:03:39,823
-Knock knock.
-Who's there?

954
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,670
Let me tell you a little story
about a man named shh!"

955
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:49,555
Even before you start,
that was a preemptive shh!"

956
01:03:49,902 --> 01:03:54,403
Just know I have a whole bag
of shh" with your name on it.

957
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,059
What's your plan?

958
01:04:00,482 --> 01:04:02,982
First, I plan to soil myself...

959
01:04:03,368 --> 01:04:05,868
then I'm going to regroup
and come up with a new plan.

960
01:04:06,253 --> 01:04:07,754
Any thoughts?

961
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:08,677
Wait a minute.

962
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,600
I always have this with me,
just in case.

963
01:04:12,986 --> 01:04:15,486
I get it. I have bad teeth.

964
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:20,371
No, Austin. The floss is to
swing ourselves onto the ledge.

965
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:22,142
All right. Hold on.

966
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,990
Got it. OK. Toothpaste.

967
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:33,683
Judo chop!

968
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:37,568
Hang on!

969
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:47,149
Judo trip.

970
01:05:02,037 --> 01:05:04,537
Not a good time
to lose one's head.

971
01:05:05,884 --> 01:05:06,384
Indeed.

972
01:05:07,808 --> 01:05:09,308
That's not the way
to get ahead in life.

973
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:15,118
It's a shame
he wasn't more headstrong.

974
01:05:16,465 --> 01:05:18,965
He'll never be
the head of a major corporation.

975
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:19,850
That'll do.

976
01:05:26,082 --> 01:05:28,582
What are we going to do?

977
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,467
There's an emergency exit.
Go get help.

978
01:05:30,891 --> 01:05:32,392
I'm going to stay here
and keep an eye on Dr. Evil.

979
01:05:33,777 --> 01:05:35,277
I'll hurry back.

980
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,971
Whatever happens,
I want you to know...

981
01:05:44,356 --> 01:05:47,856
that I feel really bad
about that ltalian bird.

982
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:50,666
What I'm trying to say is...

983
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:54,589
that if you want me
to be a one-woman man...

984
01:05:54,936 --> 01:05:56,436
that's just groovy, baby.

985
01:05:56,859 --> 01:05:59,359
Behave.

986
01:06:35,332 --> 01:06:36,832
Come, everyone.

987
01:06:37,255 --> 01:06:39,756
Let us repair
to the main chamber.

988
01:06:40,141 --> 01:06:42,641
Project Vulcan
is about to begin.

989
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:49,411
Scott, don't you want to see
what Daddy does for a living?

990
01:06:49,758 --> 01:06:50,258
Blow me.

991
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,220
Excuse me?

992
01:06:52,644 --> 01:06:53,144
Show me.

993
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,609
Position the Vulcan.

994
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,960
Bring in the warhead.

995
01:07:57,084 --> 01:07:59,584
Care to have a little fun?

996
01:07:59,969 --> 01:08:03,470
No, actually...
I have to save the world.

997
01:08:13,435 --> 01:08:15,935
Is it cold in here?

998
01:08:31,709 --> 01:08:33,209
Arm the probe.

999
01:08:51,906 --> 01:08:52,406
I've got to get Dr. Evil.

1000
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:58,254
Baseball, cold showers.

1001
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:01,101
Give it up, Mr. Powers.

1002
01:09:01,525 --> 01:09:04,025
Margaret Thatcher
naked on a cold day.

1003
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:08,796
Gentlemen.

1004
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:13,567
Let's lock and load.

1005
01:09:14,028 --> 01:09:15,528
Right, lads.

1006
01:09:16,914 --> 01:09:19,414
-Don't go.
-Stay with us.

1007
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:20,299
Please don't go.

1008
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,260
You can't resist us.

1009
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:27,070
Au contraire, baby.

1010
01:09:27,494 --> 01:09:29,994
I think you can't resist me.

1011
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,517
It's not what it seems.

1012
01:10:59,826 --> 01:11:00,326
At ease, boys.

1013
01:11:00,787 --> 01:11:01,287
Likewise.

1014
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:04,173
Vanessa, I can explain.

1015
01:11:04,634 --> 01:11:07,134
What happened was I broke in
trying to get to Dr. Evil.

1016
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,020
Then all of a sudden,
the fembots came by...

1017
01:11:10,406 --> 01:11:10,906
and smoke started to come
out of their jumblies.

1018
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:14,830
So I thought I'd work my mojo
to counter their mojo.

1019
01:11:15,215 --> 01:11:17,715
We got cross-mojonations, and
their heads started exploding.

1020
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,600
You know, that thing, and I
ended up in my knickers here...

1021
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:24,410
I believe you.

1022
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:26,333
Now get dressed.

1023
01:11:26,756 --> 01:11:28,256
Smashing, baby.

1024
01:11:29,642 --> 01:11:30,142
Onward, boys.

1025
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:37,951
Launching
the subterranean probe.

1026
01:11:41,184 --> 01:11:44,684
Begin initial
surface penetration.

1027
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:52,416
Subterranean nuclear detonation
in three minutes and counting.

1028
01:12:01,382 --> 01:12:02,882
Watch out!

1029
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,575
Right front!

1030
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:14,499
Subterranean nuclear detonation
in three minutes and counting.

1031
01:12:24,464 --> 01:12:24,964
Oh, I tripped!

1032
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:28,850
Open the frickin' door!

1033
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:34,621
Probe destruction
beginning in...

1034
01:12:35,044 --> 01:12:35,544
Judo!

1035
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:57,665
Abort.

1036
01:13:05,822 --> 01:13:06,322
Now to Dr. Evil.

1037
01:13:07,745 --> 01:13:10,245
Din-din.

1038
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:13,130
I want chicken, I want liver.

1039
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:15,015
Meow Mix, Meow Mix,
please deliver.

1040
01:13:16,401 --> 01:13:18,901
I've got you now, Dr. Evil.

1041
01:13:20,248 --> 01:13:22,749
Well done, Mr. Powers.

1042
01:13:23,134 --> 01:13:26,634
We're not so different,
you and l.

1043
01:13:26,981 --> 01:13:31,481
However, isn't it ironic,
the very things you stand for...

1044
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:38,290
free love, swinging parties,
are all now in the nineties...

1045
01:13:38,523 --> 01:13:43,023
considered to be...evil?

1046
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:46,832
What we swingers
were rebelling against...

1047
01:13:47,179 --> 01:13:48,679
is uptight squares like you...

1048
01:13:49,102 --> 01:13:51,602
whose bag
was money and world domination.

1049
01:13:51,988 --> 01:13:52,488
We were innocent, man.

1050
01:13:52,949 --> 01:13:56,450
If we'd known the consequences
of our sexual liberation...

1051
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:58,297
we would have done things
differently...

1052
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,220
but the spirit
would've remained the same.

1053
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:03,144
It's freedom, baby.

1054
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:04,029
Face it.

1055
01:14:05,452 --> 01:14:05,952
Freedom failed.

1056
01:14:06,414 --> 01:14:08,914
No, man, freedom didn't fail.

1057
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,801
Right now, we've got freedom
and responsibility.

1058
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:14,648
It's a very groovy time.

1059
01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:17,571
There's nothing more pathetic
than an aging hipster.

1060
01:14:17,956 --> 01:14:20,456
All right, baldy.
Shut your cakehole.

1061
01:14:20,842 --> 01:14:23,342
Come on. Let's go.
On your bike.

1062
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:25,227
Not so fast.

1063
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:29,151
It seems the tables have turned,
Mr. Powers.

1064
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:30,998
Go ahead, Austin.
Don't worry about me.

1065
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:33,921
I can take my Sega, right, Dad?

1066
01:14:34,307 --> 01:14:37,807
It seems the tables
have turned again, Dr. Evil.

1067
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:39,654
Not really.
Kill the little bastard.

1068
01:14:40,078 --> 01:14:40,578
See what I care.

1069
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:42,539
But, Dad, we just had
a breakthrough in group.

1070
01:14:42,963 --> 01:14:45,463
I had the group liquidated,
you little shit.

1071
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:46,349
They were insolent.

1072
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:49,311
I hate you!

1073
01:14:49,696 --> 01:14:51,196
I wish I was never
artificially created in a lab.

1074
01:14:51,619 --> 01:14:54,119
Scott, that hurts Daddy
when you say that, honestly.

1075
01:14:58,351 --> 01:14:58,851
Your timing is impeccable.

1076
01:14:59,314 --> 01:15:00,814
Go ahead. Take Mr. Powers away.

1077
01:15:03,161 --> 01:15:04,661
What?

1078
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:07,585
Dr. Evil, I've spent
30 years of my life...

1079
01:15:08,932 --> 01:15:10,432
turning this two-bit
evil empire...

1080
01:15:10,855 --> 01:15:13,355
into a world-class
multinational.

1081
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,240
I was going to have
a cover story in Forbes.

1082
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:20,126
But, you, like an idiot,
wanted to take over the world...

1083
01:15:20,473 --> 01:15:21,973
and you don't realize
there is no world anymore.

1084
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:23,897
It's only corporations.

1085
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,820
Silence, Number Two!

1086
01:15:27,206 --> 01:15:29,706
I've had enough of you
pushing me around.

1087
01:15:33,938 --> 01:15:37,439
I have a business proposition
you might find very interesting.

1088
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:41,247
All right. I've had enough.

1089
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:46,979
Judo chop!

1090
01:15:50,289 --> 01:15:51,789
The complex will self-destruct.

1091
01:15:57,022 --> 01:15:58,522
Let's split! Let's go!

1092
01:16:00,869 --> 01:16:03,369
This place is going to blow!

1093
01:16:08,562 --> 01:16:11,063
The complex will self-destruct.

1094
01:16:21,066 --> 01:16:21,566
This way, Austin.

1095
01:16:22,028 --> 01:16:23,528
Come on, baby! It's gonna blow!

1096
01:16:23,952 --> 01:16:25,452
Let's go. Move it!

1097
01:17:02,424 --> 01:17:03,924
I love you, Mr. Powers.

1098
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:07,847
And I love you, Mrs. Powers.

1099
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:11,580
That'll be Basil Exposition.

1100
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:14,503
Ignore it, Austin.
Come back to bed.

1101
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:16,427
Duty calls, baby.

1102
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:25,160
I hope I'm not interrupting
your honeymoon.

1103
01:17:25,506 --> 01:17:27,006
No, not at all, Basil.

1104
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:29,930
Did you get that fruit basket
I sent you?

1105
01:17:30,315 --> 01:17:31,815
Yes, we did, Basil,
but you sent too much.

1106
01:17:33,201 --> 01:17:34,702
I'm gonna have
to send some to my mother.

1107
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,625
Don't forget these.

1108
01:17:37,049 --> 01:17:37,549
Thanks.

1109
01:17:38,011 --> 01:17:38,511
There you go.

1110
01:17:38,972 --> 01:17:40,472
Did you get my other gift?

1111
01:17:40,896 --> 01:17:41,396
We did.

1112
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:45,357
Yes, Basil, nice rack.

1113
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:48,204
But who in the world
gave us this drawing?

1114
01:17:48,589 --> 01:17:49,089
It's bizarre.

1115
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:53,052
As you know, Dr. Evil
has escaped in his rocket...

1116
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:55,899
which has disappeared
from our tracking system.

1117
01:17:56,284 --> 01:17:57,784
Hold on. Coffee?

1118
01:18:00,132 --> 01:18:04,632
And, Vanessa, by the way,
you have been made a full agent.

1119
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,440
That's fantastic! Thanks.

1120
01:18:06,864 --> 01:18:09,365
Milk?

1121
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,250
And, Austin, Her Majesty
the Queen informs me...

1122
01:18:11,673 --> 01:18:13,173
that you are to be knighted.

1123
01:18:13,597 --> 01:18:15,097
Very shagadelic!

1124
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,020
The best of luck
to both of you!

1125
01:18:18,405 --> 01:18:18,905
Thanks, Basil.

1126
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:21,790
You know, Vanessa...

1127
01:18:22,252 --> 01:18:25,753
I'll never forget
the first time I saw you.

1128
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:27,601
You were so
incredibly beautiful...

1129
01:18:28,986 --> 01:18:31,486
so incredibly sexy...

1130
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,333
I knew I had to have you...

1131
01:18:35,718 --> 01:18:37,218
right then and there.

1132
01:18:39,565 --> 01:18:41,066
Did you feel the same way?

1133
01:18:41,489 --> 01:18:43,989
Actually, I couldn't stop
staring at your teeth.

1134
01:18:47,259 --> 01:18:49,759
I ordered some champagne.
Come in!

1135
01:18:50,145 --> 01:18:51,645
Lovely, Austin.

1136
01:18:52,069 --> 01:18:52,569
Right over there's fine.
Thank you.

1137
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,530
Let's go out on the terrace.
It's a beautiful night.

1138
01:18:54,954 --> 01:18:56,454
We can look at the stars.

1139
01:18:56,877 --> 01:18:59,378
Smashing idea, baby.

1140
01:18:59,763 --> 01:19:00,263
Look at you.

1141
01:19:02,648 --> 01:19:04,148
Look out!

1142
01:19:07,457 --> 01:19:09,957
That really hurt!

1143
01:19:10,342 --> 01:19:11,842
I'm going to have a lump there,
you idiot.

1144
01:19:12,265 --> 01:19:15,766
Who throws a shoe? Honestly.

1145
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:17,576
You fight like a woman.

1146
01:19:35,349 --> 01:19:37,849
Honestly, it's not mine.

1147
01:19:38,234 --> 01:19:38,734
No, use it.

1148
01:20:04,202 --> 01:20:05,703
Look how beautiful
the night sky is.

1149
01:20:06,128 --> 01:20:08,628
Isn't that the Big Dipper?

1150
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,513
Yeah, and that looks
just like Uranus.

1151
01:20:14,783 --> 01:20:16,283
I've never seen
that big star before.

1152
01:20:16,707 --> 01:20:17,207
What is that?

1153
01:20:20,553 --> 01:20:22,054
Good God.

1154
01:20:27,286 --> 01:20:29,786
I'm gonna get you,
Austin Powers.

1155
01:20:30,171 --> 01:20:33,671
It's frickin' freezing
in here, Mr. Bigglesworth.

1156
01:21:02,873 --> 01:21:03,373
Darling, you look fabulous.

1157
01:21:03,835 --> 01:21:07,335
All right. There we go.

1158
01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:09,182
Look at that face.
Show me. Come on.

1159
01:21:09,605 --> 01:21:10,105
There. Bit of hair.

1160
01:21:10,567 --> 01:21:12,068
Smashing.

1161
01:21:12,491 --> 01:21:14,991
It's coming around now.

1162
01:21:19,223 --> 01:21:20,723
It's not working!

1163
01:21:21,147 --> 01:21:21,647
Go change. There you go.

1164
01:21:22,108 --> 01:21:23,608
Can you change her?
ls that all right?

1165
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:25,533
Very good.

1166
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:30,419
And right here.
Looking right there.

1167
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:31,266
I'm not even looking.

1168
01:21:31,727 --> 01:21:33,227
You're wicked!

1169
01:21:33,651 --> 01:21:36,151
You got your mojo
working overtime, darling.

1170
01:21:36,536 --> 01:21:38,036
I'm not even shooting it.
It's insane.

1171
01:21:38,459 --> 01:21:39,959
Smashing.

1172
01:21:40,383 --> 01:21:41,883
Can I get a smile?

1173
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:45,730
Come on, you boys.
Get together.

1174
01:21:47,116 --> 01:21:48,616
Good. Lovin' it.

1175
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,540
Let's make a Vanessa sandwich.

1176
01:21:50,963 --> 01:21:51,463
The winged horn.

1177
01:21:51,925 --> 01:21:54,425
Come on, Austin.
Give it to me.

1178
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,310
Oh, behave.

1179
01:21:56,734 --> 01:21:58,234
You're an animal!

1180
01:22:04,428 --> 01:22:04,928
That's it.

1181
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:08,813
Just the top of the hair.

1182
01:22:09,237 --> 01:22:10,737
Born and shoot.

1183
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,660
Try it one more time.

1184
01:22:12,122 --> 01:22:13,622
And born and shoot.

1185
01:22:14,046 --> 01:22:15,546
That's it.

1186
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:18,470
Let's go. Come on.

1187
01:22:18,855 --> 01:22:20,356
Ignore this.

1188
01:22:20,779 --> 01:22:21,279
Ignore me doing this.

1189
01:22:25,588 --> 01:22:27,088
Fabulous, darling.

1190
01:22:43,862 --> 01:22:45,362
Show me the eye.

1191
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:52,132
Never get up. I'm spent!

1192
01:22:52,518 --> 01:22:55,018
We'll take you,
and we'll go out on the town...

1193
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:56,903
and swing, baby.
