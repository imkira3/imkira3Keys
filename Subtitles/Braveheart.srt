1
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,685
<i>[Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce:]</i>
"I shall tell you of William Wallace.

2
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,189
Historians from England
will say I am a liar,

3
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,360
but history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.

4
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,948
The king of Scotland
had died without a son,

5
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,699
and the king of England,

6
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,370
a cruel pagan known
as "Edward the Longshanks",

7
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,540
claimed the throne of Scotland
for himself.

8
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,543
Scotland's nobles fought him

9
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,004
and fought each other over the crown.

10
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,175
So "Longshanks" invited them
to talks of truce,

11
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,428
no weapons, one page only.

12
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,602
Among the farmers of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace,

13
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,479
a commoner with his own lands.

14
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,232
He had two sons, John and William."

15
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,491
I told you to stay.

16
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,036
Well, I finished my work.

17
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,204
Where are we going?

18
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,499
MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit
when the gathering was over.

19
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,710
- Can I come?
- No. Go home, boy.

20
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,170
But I want to go.

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,922
Go home, William,
or you'll feel the back of my hand.

22
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,175
Go you home, William.

23
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:28,290
MacAndrews!

24
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,091
Holy Jesus.

25
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,055
- It's all right!
- William! William!

26
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,184
William! William, it's all right.

27
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,687
It's all right. Easy, lad.

28
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,204
William.

29
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,209
And I say we hit back now!

30
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,087
- We cannot fight them! It's suicide!
- Something's got to be done.

31
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,881
Wallace is right! We fight them!

32
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,676
Every nobleman who had a will to fight
was at that meeting.

33
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,969
We cannot beat an army.

34
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,804
Not with 50 farmers.

35
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,099
We do not have to beat them,
just fight them.

36
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,643
Now, who's with me?

37
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,687
I am, Wallace.

38
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,647
All right, all right.

39
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,898
Ready.

40
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,165
Where do you think you're going?

41
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,624
I'm going with you.

42
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,918
You're going with me, are you?

43
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,339
- And what are you going to do?
- I'm gonna help.

44
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,674
And a good help you'd be, too,

45
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,596
but I need you to stay here
and look after the place for me

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,097
while I'm away.

47
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,768
l can fight.

48
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,732
I know. I know you can fight.

49
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,782
But it's our wits that make us men.

50
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,288
See you tomorrow.

51
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,071
- English.
- Get down.

52
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:51,243
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

53
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,745
It's up to us, Hamish.

54
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,223
Nah.

55
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:07,986
Da?

56
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,269
William.

57
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,399
Come here, lad.

58
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,907
Amen.

59
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,700
- Amen.
- Amen.

60
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,440
William.

61
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,903
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

62
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,502
You have the look of your mother.

63
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,515
We'll stay here tonight.

64
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,975
Tomorrow you'll come home with me.

65
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,936
I don't want to leave.

66
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,315
You didn't want your father to die either,
did you?

67
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,025
But it happened.

68
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,573
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

69
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,867
"The Lord bless thee and keep thee"?

70
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,828
It was in Latin.

71
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,496
You don't speak Latin?

72
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,668
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

73
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,757
The Lord bless thee and keep thee.

74
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,512
The Lord cause his light
to shine on thee.

75
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,765
The Lord lift up
his countenance upon thee

76
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,934
and give thee peace.

77
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,311
Amen.

78
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,444
Your heart is free.

79
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,490
Have the courage to follow it.

80
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,936
What are they doing?

81
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,231
Saying goodbye in their own way.

82
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,818
Playing outlawed tunes
on outlawed pipes.

83
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:18,166
It was the same for me and your daddy
when our father was killed.

84
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:50,239
First, learn to use this.

85
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,162
Then l'll teach you to use this.

86
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,111
Many years later,

87
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,155
Edward the Longshanks,
King of England,

88
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,992
supervised the wedding
of his eldest son,

89
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,661
who would succeed him to the throne.

90
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,707
Amen.

91
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,005
As bride for his son,

92
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,508
Longshanks had chosen the daughter
of his rival,

93
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,385
the King of France.

94
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,704
It was widely whispered
that for the princess to conceive,

95
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,874
Longshanks would have to do
the honors himself.

96
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,878
That may have been
what he had in mind all along.

97
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,927
Scotland. My land.

98
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:41,559
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength,

99
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,645
but how will they believe our strength

100
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,857
when we cannot rule
the whole of our own island?

101
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,328
Where is my son?

102
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,998
Your pardon, milord.
He asked me to come in his stead.

103
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,834
I sent for him, and he sends you.

104
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,670
Shall I leave, milord?

105
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,425
If he wants his queen
to rule when I am gone,

106
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,595
then, by all means, stay and learn how.

107
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,180
Please.

108
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,685
Nobles.

109
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,689
Nobles are the key
to the door of Scotland.

110
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,443
Grant our nobles lands in the north,

111
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,405
give their nobles
estates here in England,

112
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,783
and make them too greedy
to oppose us.

113
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,953
But, sire,
our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.

114
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,413
New lands mean new taxes,

115
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,499
and they're aIready taxed
for the war in France.

116
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,753
Are they?

117
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,943
The trouble with Scotland
is that it's full of Scots.

118
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,244
Perhaps the time has come
to reinstitute an old custom.

119
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,956
Grant them "Prima Nocte"

120
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,002
"First night".

121
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,922
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

122
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:41,345
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding.

123
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:47,977
If we can't get them out,
we'll breed them out.

124
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,399
That should fetch just the kind of lords
we want to Scotland,

125
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,276
taxes or no taxes.

126
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,363
- A most excellent idea, sire.
- Is it?

127
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,581
Now in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.

128
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:13,085
Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce,

129
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,964
a leading contender for the crown
of Scotland.

130
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,599
I hear that Longshanks
has granted "Prima Nocte".

131
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,770
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

132
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,067
My father believes that we must
lull Longshanks into our confidence

133
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,152
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

134
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,820
A wise plan.

135
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,073
And how is your father?
We missed him at the council.

136
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,034
His affairs in France
keep him long overdue.

137
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,416
But he sends his greetings,

138
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,462
and he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces and for Scotland.

139
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,553
It's all over now.

140
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,555
You've dropped your rock.

141
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,099
Test of manhood.

142
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,435
You win.

143
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,731
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

144
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,234
The English won't let us train
with weapons,

145
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,735
so we train with stones.

146
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,656
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

147
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,741
No. It's here.

148
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,958
Hamish?

149
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,056
Here you go, Son.

150
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,141
Show him how.

151
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,559
Come on, Hamish!

152
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,020
You'll never beat Hamish.

153
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,148
Come on there, boy!

154
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,452
My boy!

155
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,662
That's a good throw.

156
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,414
Aye. Aye, it was.

157
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,668
I was wondering if you could do that
when it matters.

158
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,298
As it matters in battle.

159
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,802
Could you crush a man with that throw?

160
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,430
I could crush you like a worm.

161
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,018
- You could?
- Aye.

162
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,978
Well, then, do it.

163
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,813
Would you like to see him crush me
like a worm?

164
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,898
Aye.

165
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,653
- Come do it.
- You'll move.

166
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,113
I will not.

167
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,157
Right.

168
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,325
He'll move.

169
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,410
Come on, Hamish.

170
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,455
Come on there, boy!

171
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,256
Well done!

172
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,272
Fine display, young Wallace.

173
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,941
Are you all right?

174
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,068
You look a wee bit shaky.

175
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,239
- I should have remembered the rocks.
- Aye, you should have.

176
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,871
Get up, you big heap.

177
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,373
It's good to see you again.

178
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,208
Aye. Welcome home.

179
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,837
- Got my head.
- Well, you should have moved.

180
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,726
William, will you dance with me?

181
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,771
Of course I will.

182
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,924
I've come to claim the right
of "Prima Nocte".

183
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,137
As lord of these lands,
I will bless this marriage

184
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:43,267
by taking the bride into my bed
on the first night of her union.

185
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,185
By God, you will not!

186
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,025
It is my noble right.

187
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,064
Good evening, sir.

188
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,691
Young Wallace.

189
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,028
- Grand soft evening, huh?
- Aye, it's that.

190
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,782
I was wondering if I might have a word
with your daughter.

191
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,827
What do you want
to have a word with her about?

192
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,911
Well...

193
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,666
Murron, would you like to come
and ride with me on this fine evening?

194
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,171
ln this? You're out of your mind.

195
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,424
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling straight down.

196
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,009
Slightly to the side, like.

197
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,762
- She can't go with you.
- No?

198
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,139
No the now, anyway.

199
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,224
- No the now.
- No the now?

200
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,392
We'll see you later.

201
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,519
The weather's just fine.
It's hardly raining.

202
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,938
Did you not hear what I said?

203
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,775
- Murron!
- Murron! Get...

204
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,695
It's you she takes after.

205
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,977
How did you know me after so long?

206
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,521
I didn't.

207
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,941
It's just... I saw you staring at me,
and I didn't know who you were.

208
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,151
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

209
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,907
Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?

210
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,327
It was the best way to make you leave.

211
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,207
If I can ever work up the courage
to ask you again,

212
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,708
l'll send you a written warning first.

213
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,794
That wouldn't do you much good.
I can't read.

214
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,921
- Can you not?
- No.

215
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,343
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

216
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,221
- You're going to teach me to read, then?
- If you like.

217
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,099
- Aye.
- ln what language?

218
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,269
You're showing off now.

219
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,355
- That's right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. Why? Should I be?

220
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,200
Do that standing on your head,
and l'll be impressed.

221
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,536
My kilt will fly up, but l'll try it.

222
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,913
God, you certainly didn't learn
any manners on your travels.

223
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,749
The French and the Romans
have far worse manners than l.

224
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,044
- You've been to Rome?
- Aye, Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.

225
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,796
What was it like?

226
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,095
What does that mean?

227
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,555
Beautiful.

228
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,560
But I belong here.

229
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,678
Murron? Come in now.

230
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,294
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night,

231
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,337
but I assure you...

232
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,215
MacClannough's daughter
is another matter.

233
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,010
I've come to fetch you to our meeting.

234
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,096
- What kind of meeting?
- The secret kind.

235
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,099
Your meetings are a waste of time,
Campbell.

236
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,229
Your father was a fighter and a patriot.

237
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,151
I know who my father was.

238
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,239
I came back home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

239
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,660
- If I can live in peace, I will.
- Go on.

240
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,704
You say you want to stay out
of the troubles?

241
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,872
Aye.

242
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,541
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

243
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,085
Until you prove it, my answer's no.

244
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,378
No?

245
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,088
No, Wallace. No.

246
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,841
- Didn't I just prove it?
- No!

247
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,760
- No?
- No!

248
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,930
Of course,
running a farm's a lot of work,

249
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,974
but that will all change
when my sons arrive.

250
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,061
So you've got children?

251
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,856
Not yet, but I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

252
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,484
So you want me to marry you, then?

253
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,945
It's a bit sudden, but all right.

254
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,447
Is that what you call a proposal?

255
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,326
I love you. Always have.

256
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,413
I want to marry you.

257
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,052
Is that a yes?

258
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,304
- Aye, that's a yes.
- It is?

259
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,349
We best hurry. He'll be waiting.

260
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,602
- Wait.
- Where are you going?

261
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,027
- What's that?
- You'll see.

262
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,422
Father.

263
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,479
I will love you my whole life,

264
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,440
you and no other.

265
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,197
And I you,

266
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,158
you and no other, forever.

267
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,452
When am I going to see you again?

268
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,953
Tonight?

269
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,122
- I can't.
- Why not?

270
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,290
My dad's growing suspicious.

271
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,541
Growing suspicious, is he?

272
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,376
Wouldn't have anything to do with that,
would it?

273
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,211
When? When? When?

274
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,756
- When?
- Tonight.

275
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,050
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

276
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,101
Look lively, Sergeant.

277
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,156
Where are you going, lassie?

278
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,324
That looks heavy.

279
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,701
- Let me help you with it.
- No. It's fine.

280
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,245
I'm not going to steal it.

281
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,542
You remind me
of my daughter back home.

282
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,640
Hello, lassie.

283
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,365
No! No!

284
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,620
Keep it quiet, Smythe.

285
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:34,592
You bitch!

286
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,269
Are you all right?

287
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,271
All right? Come on.

288
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,899
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

289
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,693
Are you all right?

290
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,620
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

291
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,128
Come back here, you bastard!

292
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,338
Raise the alarm!

293
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,840
Help!

294
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,593
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

295
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,970
They're getting away!

296
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,811
Go round back!

297
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,704
Get her!

298
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,915
Come on!

299
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
You bitch!

300
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,206
Murron?

301
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,048
Murron!

302
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,142
All of you know full well

303
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,645
the great pains I've always taken

304
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:56,067
never to be too strict, too rigid
with the application of our laws.

305
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,945
And as a consequence,

306
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,198
have we not learned to live together

307
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,575
in relative peace and harmony?

308
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:16,045
And this day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency!

309
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,807
Well, you leave me with little choice.

310
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,151
An assault on the king's soldiers

311
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,530
is the same as an assault
on the king himself.

312
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,757
Now,

313
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,509
let this scrapper come to me.

314
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,973
Sir!

315
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,733
There.

316
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,607
Corporal.

317
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,068
Some archers on the tower. Now!

318
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,621
Hold still, Father.

319
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,332
You're an idiot, boy!

320
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,210
Father, you all right?

321
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:39,673
MacAulish.

322
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,302
MacAulish!

323
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,473
MacAulish! MacAulish!

324
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:52,144
- MacAulish! MacAulish!
- Wallace! Wallace!

325
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,396
Wallace! Wallace!

326
00:53:54,481 --> 00:54:01,028
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

327
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,665
What you waiting for, boy?

328
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:22,753
Here. You can do it. l'll hold him down.

329
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,590
Here. You can do it.

330
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,717
l'll hold him down.

331
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,469
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

332
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,638
I know it seems like a waste
of good whiskey.

333
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,139
lndulge me.

334
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,186
Hold him. Hold him.

335
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,147
Hold him. Now let him go.

336
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,234
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

337
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,782
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

338
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,492
There's somebody coming!

339
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,369
Arm yourselves!

340
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,210
There's somebody coming.

341
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,505
MacGregors, from the next glen.

342
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,763
We heard about what was happening.

343
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:18,475
We don't want you amadans thinking
you can have your fun without us.

344
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,977
- That's right.
- Aye.

345
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,104
Go home.

346
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,190
Some of us are in this.

347
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,818
Can't help that now.

348
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,447
But you can help yourselves. Go home.

349
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,283
We'll have no homes left when
the English garrison from the castle

350
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,119
comes through and burns us out.

351
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,705
- And they will.
- Aye.

352
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,083
Welcome.

353
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,199
Patrol returning, milord!

354
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,728
So what news?

355
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,284
I have dispatched
100 soldiers to Lanark.

356
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,578
They will be returning now!

357
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,122
Were they dressed like this?

358
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,501
Actually, it was more like 50.

359
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,086
Make it quick.

360
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,465
You remember me?

361
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,302
I never did her any harm.
It was my right.

362
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,428
Your right?

363
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,306
Well, I'm here to claim the right
of a husband!

364
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,357
I am William Wallace,

365
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,404
and the rest of you will be spared.

366
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,282
Go back to England and tell them there

367
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,703
that Scotland's daughters
and her sons are yours no more.

368
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,374
Tell them Scotland is free.

369
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,715
Burn it.

370
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,230
Good job, milord.

371
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:33,045
Scottish rebels have routed
one of my garrisons

372
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,380
and murdered the noble lord.

373
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,923
I heard.

374
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,718
This Wallace is a brigand,
nothing more.

375
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,929
And how would you deal
with this brigand?

376
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,431
Like any common thief.

377
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:48,268
Have the local magistrate arrest him
and punish him accordingly.

378
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,147
Leave us.

379
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,911
Wallace has aIready killed
the magistrate

380
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,163
and taken control of the town.

381
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,958
Stand up.

382
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,753
ln the morning,

383
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,924
I depart for France
to press our rights there,

384
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:22,302
and I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

385
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,096
Understood? Is it?

386
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,602
One day, you will be a king,

387
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,606
at least try to act like one.

388
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,112
Get away from me!

389
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,989
Convene my military council.

390
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,824
There!

391
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,953
After them.

392
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,398
No point resisting.

393
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,358
You're outnumbered and trapped.

394
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,570
Now, where are the rest of you?
Where's Wallace?

395
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,042
Father?

396
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,127
Come in. Come in.

397
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,005
A rebellion has begun.

398
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:29,971
Under whom?

399
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,225
A commoner named William Wallace.

400
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,571
You will embrace this rebellion.

401
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,783
Support it from our lands in the north.

402
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,452
I will gain English favor

403
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:57,541
by condemning it and ordering it
opposed from our lands in the south.

404
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,419
Sit down. Stay awhile.

405
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,470
This Wallace,

406
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:16,476
he doesn't even have a knighthood,
but he fights with passion,

407
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,144
and he inspires.

408
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,815
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

409
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,818
So would l.

410
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,403
Well, maybe it's time.

411
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:29,447
It is time to survive.

412
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,534
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

413
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,957
The 16 before you passed you land
and title because they didn't charge in.

414
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,795
- Call a meeting of the nobles.
- They do nothing but talk.

415
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,046
Rightly so.

416
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,008
They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish.

417
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,551
Just as we are.

418
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:52,596
You admire this man,
this William Wallace.

419
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,307
Uncompromising men
are easy to admire.

420
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,143
He has courage, so does a dog.

421
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,271
But it is exactly
the ability to compromise

422
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,356
that makes a man noble.

423
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,609
And understand this,

424
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,278
Edward Longshanks
is the most ruthless king

425
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:11,072
ever to sit on the throne of England,

426
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:17,704
and none of us and nothing of Scotland
will remain unless we are as ruthless.

427
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,333
Give ear to our nobles.

428
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,796
Knowing their minds
is the key to the throne.

429
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,107
Wait. Wait. Look.

430
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:49,152
- This is out, and this is left.
- Of course.

431
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,528
Carry on.

432
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,113
Carry on!

433
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:35,884
You know,

434
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:39,137
eventually, Longshanks will send
his whole northern army against us.

435
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,556
Heavy cavalry, armored horse.

436
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,975
Shake the very ground.

437
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,686
They'll ride right over us.

438
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,314
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it,

439
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,776
how no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

440
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,488
- So what do we do?
- Hit, run, hide, the Highland way.

441
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,247
We'll make spears.

442
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,917
Hundreds of them.

443
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,920
Long spears, twice as long as a man.

444
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,047
- That long?
- Aye.

445
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,258
Some men are longer than others.

446
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,678
Your mother been telling you stories
about me again.

447
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,516
Volunteers coming in!

448
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,812
William Wallace,

449
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,397
we've come to fight and to die for you.

450
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:34,275
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

451
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,237
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

452
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,363
I brought you this.

453
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,490
We checked them for arms.

454
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,243
I brought you this.

455
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:46,412
- My wife made it for you.
- Thank you.

456
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,795
Him? That can't be William Wallace.

457
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,089
I'm prettier than this man.

458
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:01,719
All right, Father. l'll ask him.

459
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,978
If I risk my neck for you,
will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?

460
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:13,606
Is your father a ghost,
or do you converse with the Almighty?

461
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,860
ln order to find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

462
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:17,986
Yes, Father?

463
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,155
The Almighty says
don't change the subject,

464
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,823
just answer the fucking question.

465
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:22,866
Mind your tongue.

466
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,450
Insane Irish.

467
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:32,292
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

468
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:35,211
That's my friend, Irishman,

469
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,338
and the answer to your question is yes.

470
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,341
You fight for me,
you get to kill the English.

471
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,010
Excellent!

472
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:44,220
Stephen is my name.

473
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:49,517
I'm the most wanted man on my island,
except I'm not on my island, of course.

474
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,019
More's the pity.

475
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,354
Your island? You mean "Ireland"?

476
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,023
Yeah. It's mine.

477
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,279
You're a madman.

478
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:11,039
I've come to the right place, then.

479
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:34,664
Sure didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

480
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,293
I didn't like him anyway.

481
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,672
He wasn't right in the head.

482
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,228
William!

483
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,147
It's several runners!

484
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:13,786
The English are advancing
an army toward Stirling.

485
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:14,996
Do the nobles rally?

486
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,499
Robert the Bruce and most of the others
will not commit to battle,

487
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,917
but word has spread,

488
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,836
and the Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

489
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,256
Aye, in droves of hundreds
and thousands.

490
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,009
Are you ready for a war?

491
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,068
- Well, what news?
- We're outnumbered,

492
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,361
at least three to one.

493
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,905
- How many horse, then?
- Three hundred. Maybe more.

494
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,365
Three hundred heavy horse?

495
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,826
- We must try to negotiate.
- Well, who is in command?

496
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,497
- Did he have a scarlet chevron?
- Aye, he did.

497
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,958
We can still negotiate.

498
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,672
What are they talking about?

499
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,467
I can't hear, but it doesn't look good.

500
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,511
The nobles will negotiate.

501
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:14,013
They'll do a deal, then we go home.

502
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:17,058
If not, we charge.

503
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:20,019
Three hundred heavy horse,
we've no chance.

504
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,038
So many.

505
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,754
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

506
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,257
Then l'll have to work for them.

507
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,508
Nor me.

508
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:37,930
All right, lads!
I'm not dying for these bastards.

509
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,599
Let's go home!

510
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,828
Stop, men! Do not flee!

511
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,456
Wait until we've negotiated!

512
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,135
William Wallace.

513
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,304
Can't be. Not tall enough.

514
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,786
The Almighty says
this must be a fashionable fight.

515
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:25,663
It's drawn the finest people.

516
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,331
Where is thy salute?

517
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:31,210
For presenting yourselves
on this battlefield, I give you thanks.

518
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,837
This is our army.

519
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,463
To join it, you give homage.

520
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,008
I give homage to Scotland,

521
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,844
and if this is your army

522
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,513
why does it go?

523
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,308
We didn't come here to fight for them!

524
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,188
Home! The English are too many.

525
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,991
Sons of Scotland,

526
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,869
I am William Wallace.

527
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,121
William Wallace is seven feet tall.

528
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:09,165
Yes, I've heard.

529
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:11,542
He kills men by the hundreds,

530
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,295
and if he were here,
he'd consume the English

531
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:19,008
with fireballs from his eyes
and bolts of lightning from his arse.

532
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,013
I am William Wallace,

533
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:29,685
and I see a whole army
of my countrymen

534
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,480
here in defiance of tyranny.

535
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,569
You've come to fight as free men.

536
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,406
And free men you are.

537
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:48,037
What will you do with that freedom?

538
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,791
Will you fight?

539
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,835
No! No! No!

540
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,129
Fight? Against that? No!

541
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,799
We will run, and we will live.

542
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,093
Aye.

543
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,220
Fight, and you may die.

544
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,263
Run, and you'll live.

545
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:09,016
At least awhile.

546
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:15,648
And dying in your beds
many years from now,

547
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:22,238
would you be willing to trade
all the days from this day to that

548
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:28,160
for one chance, just one chance,
to come back here and tell our enemies

549
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:30,705
that they may take our lives,

550
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,625
but they'll never take our freedom?

551
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:03,904
They seem quite optimistic to me.

552
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,197
Maybe they do want to fight.

553
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:08,868
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion, milord,

554
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:12,079
but, nonetheless, I think
we should deliver the king's terms.

555
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:15,416
The king's terms?
He'll never live up to them.

556
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,001
Milord, I think...

557
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,670
All right. Offer them the terms.

558
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,967
They're coming out.
Shall we go and meet them?

559
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:27,386
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?
- Agreed.

560
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:35,770
Fine speech.

561
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:37,605
Now what do we do?

562
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,192
Just be yourselves.

563
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,402
Where are you going?

564
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,529
I'm going to pick a fight.

565
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,539
Well, we didn't get dressed up
for nothing.

566
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,127
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

567
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,301
Here are the king's terms.

568
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,554
Lead this army off the field,

569
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:17,812
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,

570
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,106
including hereditary title,

571
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,692
from which you will pay...

572
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,861
From which you will pay him
an annual duty...

573
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,404
I have an offer for you.

574
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,990
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

575
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:34,036
From which you will pay the king
an annual duty...

576
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,496
I said I have an offer for you.

577
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,206
You disrespect a banner of truce?

578
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,375
From his king? Absolutely.

579
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,628
Here are Scotland's terms.

580
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,590
Lower your flags
and march straight back to England,

581
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,301
stopping at every home you pass by
to beg forgiveness

582
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,263
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

583
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,683
Do that and your men shall live.

584
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,936
Do it not
and every one of you will die today.

585
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:07,987
You are outmatched.

586
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:09,864
You have no heavy cavalry.

587
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:12,324
ln two centuries, no army has won...

588
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,034
I'm not finished!

589
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,330
Before we let you leave,

590
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:23,711
your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army,

591
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,838
put his head between his legs,

592
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:27,798
and kiss his own arse.

593
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,936
l'd say that was rather less cordial
than he was used to.

594
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,314
You be ready and do exactly as I say.

595
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:44,440
On my signal,

596
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:47,568
ride round behind our position
and flank them.

597
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:49,153
We must not divide our forces.

598
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:52,114
Do it and let the English see you do it.

599
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,534
They'll think we run away.

600
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,412
Take out their archers.
l'll meet you in the middle.

601
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,039
Right. Come on.

602
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:26,357
Insolent bastard.

603
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:29,276
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.

604
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,736
Archers.

605
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,489
- Archers! Archers!
- Archers!

606
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:43,165
- Archers, forward!
- Archers, forward!

607
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,597
You bastards!

608
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,592
Loose!

609
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,406
The Lord tells me he can get me
out of this mess,

610
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:42,034
but he's pretty sure you're fucked.

611
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:04,848
- Ready!
- Loose!

612
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,243
Ride!

613
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:31,416
See, every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

614
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:34,545
Our cavalry will ride them down
like grass.

615
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,130
Send the horse.

616
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,881
Full attack.

617
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,999
Steady!

618
01:26:55,293 --> 01:27:12,100
Hold!

619
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:27,115
Now!

620
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,954
Send the infantry.

621
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:16,081
- Milord...
- You lead them!

622
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:36,888
Retreat!

623
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:14,426
Bastard!

624
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:58,595
All right.

625
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:31,670
- Wallace!
- Wallace!

626
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:59,114
Wallace! Wallace!

627
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:14,212
I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

628
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:21,011
Sir William, in the name of God,

629
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:24,764
we declare and appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland

630
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,976
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

631
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,228
Stand and be recognized.

632
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:43,992
Does anyone know his politics?

633
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:47,704
No, but his weight with the commoners
could unbalance everything.

634
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:51,374
The BallioIs will kiss his arse,
and so we must.

635
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,550
Sir William.

636
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,598
Sir William,

637
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:10,685
inasmuch as you and your captains hail
from a region

638
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,647
long known to support the Balliol clan,

639
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:16,524
may we invite you
to continue your support

640
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:19,361
and uphold our rightful claim?

641
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,321
Damn the Balliol clan!

642
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:23,907
They're all Longshanks' men!

643
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:28,203
Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

644
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:31,164
- Now is the time to declare a king.
- Wait!

645
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:34,209
And you're prepared to recognize
our legitimate succession, I take it.

646
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,169
You're the ones who won't
support the rightful king.

647
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:38,004
Those were lies
when you first wrote them.

648
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,756
- No.
- That's the truth.

649
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,008
I demand recognition
of these documents!

650
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,095
These documents were lies
when you wrote them!

651
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:49,391
Gentlemen, please! Gentlemen!

652
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,101
Please, gentlemen!

653
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:53,978
Wait! Sir William, where are you going?

654
01:34:56,273 --> 01:35:00,735
We have beaten the English,
but they'll come back

655
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,530
because you won't stand together.

656
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:04,823
What will you do?

657
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:06,783
I will invade England

658
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:09,703
and defeat the English
on their own ground.

659
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:14,124
Invade? That's impossible.

660
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:15,625
Why?

661
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,711
Why is that impossible?

662
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:22,590
You're so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from Longshanks' table

663
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:26,845
that you've missed your God-given right
to something better.

664
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:29,389
There's a difference between us.

665
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:31,099
You think the people
of this country exist

666
01:35:31,183 --> 01:35:33,893
to provide you with position.

667
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:38,064
I think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom,

668
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:42,110
and I go to make sure that they have it.

669
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,499
Wait!

670
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,463
I respect what you said,

671
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:05,008
but remember that these men
have lands and castles.

672
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:06,843
It's much to risk.

673
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:08,803
And the common man that bleeds
on the battlefield,

674
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:10,638
does he risk less?

675
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:16,811
No.

676
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:20,440
But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.

677
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:23,693
Its nobles share allegiance
with England.

678
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,487
Its clans war with each other.

679
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,030
- Aye.
- Aye.

680
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:30,950
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border,

681
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,452
you'll end up dead.

682
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:35,163
We all end up dead.
It's just a question of how and why.

683
01:36:35,247 --> 01:36:39,292
I'm not a coward. I want what you want,
but we need the nobles.

684
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:41,085
- We need them?
- Aye.

685
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,378
Nobles.

686
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:46,299
Now, tell me, what does that mean,
to be noble?

687
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:49,052
Your title gives you claim
to the throne of our country,

688
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,638
but men don't follow titles.

689
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:53,431
They follow courage.

690
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,391
Now, our people know you.

691
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,101
Noble and common, they respect you,

692
01:36:57,186 --> 01:37:00,814
and if you would
just lead them to freedom,

693
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,901
they'd follow you.

694
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,613
And so would l.

695
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,011
Damn it!

696
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:35,014
My sodomite cousin the prince
tells me he has no troops to lend,

697
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:38,643
and every town in northern England
is begging for help.

698
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:41,729
- He advances!
- To which town?

699
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,606
To here, milord.

700
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,859
Bring the food and provisions inside.

701
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:48,444
Double the wall guards, seal the gate.
Now!

702
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:52,156
Bring in the provisions!

703
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:24,105
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

704
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:25,690
I'm not about to tell my uncle

705
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:29,110
I've lost him the greatest city
in northern England.

706
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:10,443
Come on!

707
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:47,397
Make way for the king!

708
01:39:56,573 --> 01:39:58,408
It's not your fault.

709
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:00,535
Stand up to him!

710
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:03,287
I will stand up to him and more.

711
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,994
What news of the north?

712
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:46,247
Nothing new, Your Majesty.

713
01:40:46,331 --> 01:40:48,666
We've sent riders to speed any word.

714
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,543
I heard the word in France,

715
01:40:50,627 --> 01:40:54,005
where I was fighting
to expand your future kingdom.

716
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:55,882
The word, my son,

717
01:40:55,966 --> 01:41:00,136
is that our entire
northern army is annihilated,

718
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:03,931
and you have done nothing.

719
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:06,684
I have ordered conscriptions, sir.

720
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:09,645
They're assembled and ready to depart.

721
01:41:11,106 --> 01:41:14,400
Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.

722
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,985
Come.

723
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:26,412
- Leave us.
- Thank you, sire.

724
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,335
- Wallace has sacked York.
- What?

725
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,629
Wallace has sacked York!

726
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:52,855
Sire, thy own nephew.

727
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:56,734
What beast could do such a thing?

728
01:41:58,445 --> 01:42:00,363
If he can sack York,

729
01:42:03,158 --> 01:42:05,118
he can invade lower England.

730
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:07,036
We would stop him!

731
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:14,127
Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?

732
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:18,631
I have declared Phillip
my high counselor.

733
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:20,216
Is he qualified?

734
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:24,595
I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.

735
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:26,722
Are you?

736
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:31,602
Then tell me,
what advice would you offer

737
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:34,939
on the present situation?

738
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,930
I shall offer a truce

739
01:43:09,474 --> 01:43:11,434
and buy him off.

740
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,606
But who will go to him? Not l.

741
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:23,237
If I fell under the sword of that murderer,
it might be my head in a basket.

742
01:43:24,406 --> 01:43:27,783
And not my gentle son.

743
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,410
The mere sight of him

744
01:43:29,494 --> 01:43:33,372
would only encourage an enemy
to take over the whole country.

745
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,711
So whom do I send?

746
01:43:43,133 --> 01:43:44,467
Whom do I send?

747
01:45:07,759 --> 01:45:09,218
I'm dreaming.

748
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:11,345
Yes, you are.

749
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,890
And you must wake.

750
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:25,526
I don't want to wake.

751
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,697
I want to stay here with you.

752
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,700
And I with you,

753
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:35,328
but you must wake now.

754
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:40,583
Wake up, William.

755
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:42,293
Wake up.

756
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,547
William, wake up, wake up.

757
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48,341
William!

758
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:52,094
A royal entourage comes,
flying banners of truce

759
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:54,930
and the standards
of Longshanks himself!

760
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:40,935
I am the Princess of Wales.

761
01:46:41,019 --> 01:46:44,021
I come as the king's servant
and with his authority.

762
01:46:45,023 --> 01:46:46,524
To do what?

763
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,860
To discuss the king's proposals.

764
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,989
Will you speak with a woman?

765
01:47:14,344 --> 01:47:17,388
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

766
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:19,682
I have been given nothing.

767
01:47:20,058 --> 01:47:22,268
God makes men what they are.

768
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:25,604
Did God make you the sacker
of peaceful cities,

769
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:29,483
the executioner of the king's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

770
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:34,488
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country,

771
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:37,283
and that royal cousin
hanged innocent Scots,

772
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:40,369
even women and children,
from the city walls.

773
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:47,626
Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.

774
01:48:07,522 --> 01:48:09,773
You ask your king to his face.

775
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:11,108
Ask him.

776
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:17,031
You see if his eyes can convince you
of the truth.

777
01:48:24,789 --> 01:48:26,916
Hamilton, leave us.

778
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:31,545
- Milady...
-Leave us. Now.

779
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,309
Let us talk plainly.

780
01:48:45,393 --> 01:48:47,728
You invade England,

781
01:48:47,812 --> 01:48:51,899
but you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your sheIter and supply.

782
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:55,444
The king desires peace.

783
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:57,988
Longshanks desires peace?

784
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:00,533
He declares it to me. I swear it.

785
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:02,910
He proposes that
you withdraw your attack.

786
01:49:02,994 --> 01:49:06,038
ln return, he grants you title, estates,

787
01:49:06,122 --> 01:49:10,209
and this chest of gold,
which I am to pay to you personally.

788
01:49:10,293 --> 01:49:12,253
A lordship and titles.

789
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:13,337
Gold.

790
01:49:13,421 --> 01:49:15,089
That I should become Judas?

791
01:49:15,173 --> 01:49:16,715
Peace is made in such ways.

792
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,093
Slaves are made in such ways!

793
01:49:21,846 --> 01:49:25,558
The last time Longshanks spoke
of peace, I was a boy,

794
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:28,018
and many Scottish nobles,
who would not be slaves,

795
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:30,187
were lured by him, under a flag of truce,

796
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:33,482
to a barn where he had them hanged.

797
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:36,819
I was very young,

798
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:40,364
but I remember Longshanks' notion
of peace.

799
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:46,912
I understand you have suffered.

800
01:49:47,872 --> 01:49:50,374
I know about your woman.

801
01:50:01,886 --> 01:50:03,887
She was my wife.

802
01:50:06,391 --> 01:50:07,474
We married in secret

803
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:10,894
because I would not share her
with an English lord.

804
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:14,898
They killed her to get to me.

805
01:50:20,363 --> 01:50:22,489
I have never spoken of it.

806
01:50:24,117 --> 01:50:27,036
I don't know why I tell you now,

807
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:32,374
except I see her strength in you.

808
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:40,466
One day, you'll be a queen,

809
01:50:42,844 --> 01:50:45,012
and you must open your eyes.

810
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:57,316
You tell your king that William Wallace
will not be ruled,

811
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:00,569
and nor will any Scot while I live.

812
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:38,607
My son's loyal wife returns un-killed
by the heathen.

813
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:40,109
So he accepted our bribe?

814
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:41,777
No, he did not.

815
01:51:43,613 --> 01:51:45,489
Then why does he stay?

816
01:51:45,573 --> 01:51:48,742
My scouts tell me
that he has not advanced.

817
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:50,911
He waits for you at York.

818
01:51:50,995 --> 01:51:53,747
He says he will attack
no more towns or cities

819
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:56,542
if you are man enough
to come and face him.

820
01:51:56,626 --> 01:51:57,918
Did he?

821
01:51:59,003 --> 01:52:02,840
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

822
01:52:02,924 --> 01:52:07,010
arriving so far around his flank.

823
01:52:07,637 --> 01:52:11,724
The main force of our armies
from France will land here

824
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:13,809
to the north of Edinburgh.

825
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:19,690
Conscripts from Ireland will approach
from the southwest to here.

826
01:52:19,774 --> 01:52:23,485
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
Irish conscripts?

827
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:26,905
Even if you dispatch them today,
they'd take weeks to assemble.

828
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,617
I dispatched them
before I sent your wife.

829
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:37,791
So our little ruse succeeded.

830
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,918
Thank you.

831
01:52:40,003 --> 01:52:43,797
And while this upstart awaits
my arrival in York,

832
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:47,676
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh behind him.

833
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:55,434
You spoke with this Wallace in private.

834
01:52:56,394 --> 01:52:57,853
Tell me,

835
01:52:59,647 --> 01:53:01,565
what kind of man is he?

836
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:04,860
A mindless barbarian.

837
01:53:06,112 --> 01:53:08,280
Not a king like you, milord.

838
01:53:10,533 --> 01:53:12,951
You may return to your embroidery.

839
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,537
Humbly, milord.

840
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:18,290
You brought back the money, of course.

841
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:26,465
No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

842
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,637
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

843
01:53:33,515 --> 01:53:35,182
Forgive me, sire.

844
01:53:35,266 --> 01:53:39,311
I thought that generosity
might demonstrate your greatness

845
01:53:39,395 --> 01:53:41,730
to those you mean to rule.

846
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:47,778
My greatness will be
better demonstrated

847
01:53:47,862 --> 01:53:53,242
when Wallace returns to Scotland
and finds his country in ashes.

848
01:53:58,039 --> 01:53:59,456
William!

849
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:01,542
There's riders approaching!

850
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,802
Personal escort of the princess.

851
01:54:11,886 --> 01:54:13,387
Aye.

852
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,431
Must have made an impression.

853
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:18,350
Aye.

854
01:54:18,434 --> 01:54:21,436
I didn't think you were
in the tent that long.

855
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:26,608
Mademoiselle.

856
01:54:56,723 --> 01:54:59,600
It's true! English ships are moving
up from the south!

857
01:54:59,684 --> 01:55:02,769
I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed!

858
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:05,898
I had to see it with me own eyes
before I could believe it.

859
01:55:05,982 --> 01:55:08,317
What the hell are the Irish doing
fighting with the English?

860
01:55:08,401 --> 01:55:10,068
I wouldn't worry about them.

861
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:14,281
Didn't I tell you before? It's my island.

862
01:55:14,365 --> 01:55:17,951
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council.

863
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:19,745
- Order it.
-Aye.

864
01:55:24,334 --> 01:55:27,294
-Your island?
- My island! Yup!

865
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:30,047
You want to negotiate?

866
01:55:30,131 --> 01:55:31,465
No, please, gentlemen!

867
01:55:31,549 --> 01:55:33,926
Lords, Craig is right!

868
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:37,179
This time,
our only option is to negotiate.

869
01:55:37,263 --> 01:55:40,766
Now, unless you want to see Edinburgh
razed to the ground...

870
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:50,567
My army has marched for more days
than I can remember

871
01:55:50,652 --> 01:55:52,444
and we still have preparations to make,

872
01:55:52,528 --> 01:55:54,696
so l'll make this plain.

873
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:58,367
We require every soldier
you can summon.

874
01:55:58,451 --> 01:56:01,370
Your personal escorts, even yourselves,

875
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:03,622
and we need them now.

876
01:56:05,166 --> 01:56:08,543
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

877
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,212
Other options?

878
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:15,634
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men onto the field

879
01:56:15,718 --> 01:56:18,095
and barter a better deal
with Longshanks

880
01:56:18,179 --> 01:56:19,972
before you tuck tail and run?

881
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,932
- Sir William...
-We can't defeat this army!

882
01:56:22,016 --> 01:56:23,809
- We can! And we will!
- Sir William!

883
01:56:27,271 --> 01:56:30,107
We won at Stirling,
and still you quibble!

884
01:56:31,985 --> 01:56:34,820
We won at York,
and you would not support us.

885
01:56:35,363 --> 01:56:39,282
If you'll not stand up with us now,
then I say you're cowards.

886
01:56:44,914 --> 01:56:48,750
And if you are Scotsmen,
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

887
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:52,295
Please, Sir William,
speak with me alone.

888
01:56:54,507 --> 01:56:55,966
I beg you.

889
01:56:59,345 --> 01:57:02,014
Now, you've achieved more
than anyone ever dreamed,

890
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:05,851
but fighting these odds,
it looks like rage, not courage.

891
01:57:05,935 --> 01:57:07,894
It's well beyond rage.

892
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:11,440
Help me.

893
01:57:13,067 --> 01:57:16,236
ln the name of Christ, help yourselves!

894
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,280
Now is our chance. Now.

895
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:20,449
If we join, we can win.

896
01:57:20,533 --> 01:57:24,661
If we win, well, then we'll have
what none of us have ever had before.

897
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:27,122
A country of our own.

898
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:31,501
You're the rightful leader,

899
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:33,628
and there is strength in you. I see it.

900
01:57:39,135 --> 01:57:40,469
Unite us.

901
01:57:43,973 --> 01:57:45,140
Unite us!

902
01:57:45,224 --> 01:57:47,100
Unite the clans.

903
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:54,858
All right.

904
01:57:54,942 --> 01:57:56,443
Right.

905
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:03,533
This cannot be the way.

906
01:58:04,243 --> 01:58:08,663
You said yourself,
the nobles will not support Wallace.

907
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:14,503
So how does it help us
to join the side that is slaughtered?

908
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:17,339
I gave him my word.

909
01:58:25,723 --> 01:58:27,516
I know it is hard.

910
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:30,018
Being a leader is.

911
01:58:31,312 --> 01:58:32,646
Now, Son...

912
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:36,483
Son, look at me.

913
01:58:44,158 --> 01:58:45,867
I cannot be king.

914
01:58:46,744 --> 01:58:49,830
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

915
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:52,999
What I tell you, you must do.

916
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:55,752
Not for me, not for yourself,

917
01:58:55,837 --> 01:58:57,838
for your country.

918
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:15,313
Lads, make way.

919
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:16,565
Coming through you.

920
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:25,240
Make way, lads.

921
01:59:25,324 --> 01:59:26,825
Make...

922
01:59:30,538 --> 01:59:33,123
The Bruce is not coming, William.

923
01:59:33,749 --> 01:59:35,584
He'll come.

924
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:39,045
Mornay and Lochlan have come,

925
01:59:40,756 --> 01:59:42,507
so will the Bruce.

926
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:49,264
Quite a lovely gathering.

927
01:59:50,349 --> 01:59:52,184
Wouldn't you agree?

928
01:59:55,730 --> 01:59:57,147
The archers are ready, sire.

929
01:59:57,231 --> 01:59:58,857
Not the archers.

930
01:59:58,941 --> 02:00:00,984
My scouts tell me
their archers are miles away

931
02:00:01,068 --> 02:00:02,444
and no threat to us.

932
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:06,907
Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish.
The dead cost nothing.

933
02:00:06,991 --> 02:00:10,118
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

934
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,620
Infantry!

935
02:00:11,996 --> 02:00:13,371
- Infantry!
- Infantry!

936
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:14,664
Cavalry!

937
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:18,001
- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!

938
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:19,836
Advance!

939
02:00:20,087 --> 02:00:22,255
- Advance!
- Advance!

940
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:49,551
- Good to see you this morning!
- Hi. How are you?

941
02:01:51,387 --> 02:01:53,305
Irish.

942
02:01:53,389 --> 02:01:54,639
Glad to have you with us.

943
02:01:54,724 --> 02:01:56,141
Watch this.

944
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:09,107
Mornay? Lochlan?

945
02:04:09,191 --> 02:04:11,901
I gave Mornay double his lands
in Scotland

946
02:04:11,986 --> 02:04:14,195
with matching estates in England.

947
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,699
Lochlan turned for much less.

948
02:04:18,492 --> 02:04:19,742
Archers.

949
02:04:19,827 --> 02:04:21,244
I beg pardon, sire.

950
02:04:21,328 --> 02:04:23,538
Won't we hit our own troops?

951
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:27,041
Yes,

952
02:04:27,126 --> 02:04:29,169
but we'll hit theirs as well.

953
02:04:29,253 --> 02:04:30,920
We have reserves.

954
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:33,840
Attack.

955
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:36,217
Archers!

956
02:04:37,219 --> 02:04:39,220
- Archers.
- Archers.

957
02:04:43,976 --> 02:04:53,610
Loose!

958
02:05:14,131 --> 02:05:16,549
Send in our reinforcements.

959
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:18,551
Send in the rest!

960
02:05:29,021 --> 02:05:30,730
Bring me Wallace.

961
02:05:31,565 --> 02:05:32,774
Alive, if possible.

962
02:05:32,858 --> 02:05:35,109
Dead, just as good.

963
02:05:36,278 --> 02:05:38,404
Send us news of our victory.

964
02:05:38,489 --> 02:05:40,532
Shall we retire?

965
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:06,826
Protect the king.

966
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:14,162
Get up!

967
02:09:15,664 --> 02:09:16,914
Up!

968
02:09:16,999 --> 02:09:18,332
Get up!

969
02:09:18,834 --> 02:09:20,710
- Get him out of here!
- Jesus!

970
02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:27,550
Go!

971
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,070
I'm dying.

972
02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:34,242
Let me be.

973
02:10:40,123 --> 02:10:41,249
No.

974
02:10:42,626 --> 02:10:44,585
You're going to live.

975
02:10:46,338 --> 02:10:49,382
I've lived long enough to live free.

976
02:10:49,925 --> 02:10:54,136
Proud to see you become
the man you are.

977
02:10:59,643 --> 02:11:01,769
I'm a happy man.

978
02:12:50,754 --> 02:12:53,839
I'm the one who's rotting,

979
02:12:53,924 --> 02:12:57,802
but I think your face looks graver
than mine.

980
02:13:02,057 --> 02:13:03,599
Son,

981
02:13:09,648 --> 02:13:13,275
we must have alliance with England
to prevail here.

982
02:13:14,194 --> 02:13:16,195
You achieved that.

983
02:13:16,279 --> 02:13:20,074
You saved your family,
increased your land.

984
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:24,787
ln time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

985
02:13:25,664 --> 02:13:31,252
Lands, titles, men, power, nothing.

986
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,630
- Nothing?
- I have nothing.

987
02:13:35,966 --> 02:13:37,425
Men fight for me

988
02:13:38,051 --> 02:13:40,428
because if they do not,
I throw them off my land

989
02:13:40,512 --> 02:13:43,723
and I starve their wives
and their children.

990
02:13:43,807 --> 02:13:48,978
Those men who bled the ground red
at Falkirk,

991
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:51,564
they fought for William Wallace,

992
02:13:51,648 --> 02:13:55,443
and he fights for something
that I've never had.

993
02:13:58,447 --> 02:14:00,823
And I took it from him
when I betrayed him,

994
02:14:00,907 --> 02:14:04,368
and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield,

995
02:14:04,453 --> 02:14:06,537
and it's tearing me apart!

996
02:14:07,372 --> 02:14:10,332
All men betray, all lose heart.

997
02:14:10,417 --> 02:14:13,210
I don't want to lose heart!

998
02:14:17,215 --> 02:14:20,760
I want to believe, as he does.

999
02:14:27,809 --> 02:14:30,644
I will never be on the wrong side again.

1000
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,321
No, please!

1001
02:15:48,056 --> 02:15:49,723
There he is! After him!

1002
02:16:19,045 --> 02:16:22,256
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

1003
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:23,465
Aye.

1004
02:16:24,759 --> 02:16:27,469
Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

1005
02:16:27,554 --> 02:16:30,514
More a liability now than ever he was.

1006
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:33,434
And there's no telling who'll be next.

1007
02:16:35,478 --> 02:16:37,104
Maybe you.

1008
02:16:39,232 --> 02:16:40,816
Maybe me.

1009
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:48,115
It doesn't matter.

1010
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:52,912
- I'm serious, Robert.
- So am l!

1011
02:17:06,134 --> 02:17:08,302
Christ! Shit!

1012
02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:11,138
Search the place!

1013
02:17:13,475 --> 02:17:14,642
Lochlan.

1014
02:17:21,316 --> 02:17:24,151
William Wallace killed 50 men.

1015
02:17:24,903 --> 02:17:26,820
Fifty if it was one.

1016
02:17:26,905 --> 02:17:30,241
A hundred men with his own sword.

1017
02:17:30,325 --> 02:17:31,825
Cut through them like...

1018
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:35,162
Moses through the Red Sea.

1019
02:18:07,237 --> 02:18:11,282
His legend grows.
It will be worse than before.

1020
02:18:11,366 --> 02:18:14,618
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town,

1021
02:18:15,787 --> 02:18:17,079
and when he replenishes his numbers...

1022
02:18:17,163 --> 02:18:19,790
They're sheep, mere sheep!

1023
02:18:22,294 --> 02:18:25,421
Easily dispersed
if we strike the shepherd.

1024
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:27,339
Very well.

1025
02:18:28,216 --> 02:18:32,720
Pick a flock of your finest assassins
and set a meeting.

1026
02:18:32,804 --> 02:18:36,807
Milord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.

1027
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:44,398
If what Lord Hamilton tells me
is correct,

1028
02:18:44,733 --> 02:18:48,277
he warmed to our future queen
and would trust her.

1029
02:18:49,946 --> 02:18:53,615
So we'll dispatch her with the notion
that she comes in peace.

1030
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:56,535
Milord,
the princess might be taken hostage

1031
02:18:56,619 --> 02:18:58,662
or her life be put in jeopardy.

1032
02:18:58,747 --> 02:19:02,374
My son would be
most distressed by that.

1033
02:19:03,418 --> 02:19:06,545
But in truth, if she were to be killed,

1034
02:19:07,172 --> 02:19:11,925
we would soon find the king of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

1035
02:19:14,429 --> 02:19:17,806
You see, as king,

1036
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:21,060
you must find the good in any situation.

1037
02:19:48,004 --> 02:19:50,422
It's William Wallace, sure.

1038
02:19:51,216 --> 02:19:54,051
He's given up his sword.

1039
02:19:54,135 --> 02:19:55,761
Be ready.

1040
02:21:34,694 --> 02:21:36,195
Milady,

1041
02:21:40,074 --> 02:21:42,159
I received your message.

1042
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:59,134
This is the second time
you have warned me of danger.

1043
02:22:01,429 --> 02:22:02,846
Why?

1044
02:22:03,515 --> 02:22:05,057
There will be a new shipment
of supplies

1045
02:22:05,141 --> 02:22:08,268
coming north next month.
Foods and weapons. They won't...

1046
02:22:08,937 --> 02:22:10,270
No, stop.

1047
02:22:12,607 --> 02:22:22,658
Why do you help me?

1048
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:27,120
Because of the way
you are looking at me now.

1049
02:24:19,317 --> 02:24:24,863
Just when we thought all hope was lost,
our noble saviors have arrived.

1050
02:24:27,575 --> 02:24:30,077
Off with their hoods.

1051
02:24:34,248 --> 02:24:37,000
Sir William,
we've come to seek a meeting.

1052
02:24:37,585 --> 02:24:40,212
Well, what's the point?

1053
02:24:40,296 --> 02:24:42,631
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1054
02:24:42,715 --> 02:24:45,050
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1055
02:24:45,134 --> 02:24:47,761
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1056
02:24:47,845 --> 02:24:50,305
So let the council swear publicly.

1057
02:24:50,390 --> 02:24:53,767
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1058
02:24:53,851 --> 02:24:56,895
Others think you'll pay them
Mornay's wages.

1059
02:24:56,979 --> 02:24:58,689
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1060
02:24:58,773 --> 02:24:59,773
Meet us two days from now.

1061
02:24:59,857 --> 02:25:02,442
Pledge us your pardon,
and we'll unite behind you.

1062
02:25:02,527 --> 02:25:03,694
Scotland will be one.

1063
02:25:03,778 --> 02:25:07,572
- One? You mean us and you.
- No.

1064
02:25:09,283 --> 02:25:11,118
I mean this.

1065
02:25:13,121 --> 02:25:15,706
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1066
02:25:25,133 --> 02:25:27,676
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

1067
02:25:27,802 --> 02:25:31,430
I think if the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it aIready at Falkirk.

1068
02:25:31,514 --> 02:25:34,224
- Aye.
- I know. I saw.

1069
02:25:34,308 --> 02:25:37,060
Leaving him aside,
what about the others?

1070
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:39,438
Nest of scheming bastards!

1071
02:25:39,522 --> 02:25:41,481
They couldn't even agree
on the color of shite!

1072
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:42,941
It's a trap. Are you blind?

1073
02:25:43,025 --> 02:25:44,401
Look at us.

1074
02:25:45,903 --> 02:25:49,322
We've got to try. We can't do this alone.

1075
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:52,743
Joining the nobles is the only hope
for our people.

1076
02:25:52,827 --> 02:25:54,286
You know what happens
if we don't take that chance?

1077
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:55,495
What?

1078
02:25:56,164 --> 02:25:57,456
Nothing.

1079
02:25:59,292 --> 02:26:01,418
I don't want to be a martyr.

1080
02:26:01,878 --> 02:26:03,837
Nor l. I want to live.

1081
02:26:05,089 --> 02:26:07,883
I want a home and children and peace.

1082
02:26:07,967 --> 02:26:09,843
- Do you?
- Aye, I do.

1083
02:26:09,927 --> 02:26:12,220
I've asked God for those things.

1084
02:26:12,847 --> 02:26:14,681
It's all for nothing
if you don't have freedom.

1085
02:26:14,766 --> 02:26:17,684
 - That's just a dream, William.
- A dream? Just a...

1086
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:23,023
Then what have we been doing
all this time?

1087
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:25,108
We've lived that dream.

1088
02:26:25,193 --> 02:26:28,862
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron.

1089
02:26:28,946 --> 02:26:31,865
You're doing this to be a hero
'cause you think she sees you.

1090
02:26:31,949 --> 02:26:34,868
I don't think she sees me.
I know she does.

1091
02:26:35,703 --> 02:26:38,038
And your father sees you, too.

1092
02:26:47,924 --> 02:26:49,090
Jesus.

1093
02:26:51,385 --> 02:26:53,553
Get up. Give us your hand.

1094
02:26:56,891 --> 02:26:58,767
Shall I come with you?

1095
02:27:00,019 --> 02:27:02,395
No. l'll go alone.

1096
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:06,191
l'll see you after.

1097
02:27:07,068 --> 02:27:08,235
Right.

1098
02:27:12,615 --> 02:27:15,116
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1099
02:27:21,457 --> 02:27:23,750
- He won't come.
- He will.

1100
02:27:24,919 --> 02:27:26,503
I know he will.

1101
02:27:40,643 --> 02:27:42,519
Milord, he approaches!

1102
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:28,189
No!

1103
02:28:32,820 --> 02:28:34,779
Stay out of it, Robert!

1104
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:38,742
You lied! You lied!

1105
02:28:42,121 --> 02:28:45,498
Bruce is not to be hurt!
That's the arrangement!

1106
02:28:53,299 --> 02:28:54,925
Father!

1107
02:29:00,932 --> 02:29:03,808
You rotting bastard!

1108
02:29:04,352 --> 02:29:06,311
Why? Why?

1109
02:29:10,983 --> 02:29:13,818
Longshanks required Wallace.

1110
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,029
So did our nobles.

1111
02:29:16,614 --> 02:29:19,658
That was the price of your crown.

1112
02:29:19,742 --> 02:29:20,867
Die!

1113
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:24,412
I want you to die!

1114
02:29:24,497 --> 02:29:28,875
Soon enough, l'll be dead
and you'll be king.

1115
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:31,294
I don't want anything from you.

1116
02:29:31,837 --> 02:29:33,463
You're not a man!

1117
02:29:34,298 --> 02:29:36,383
And you're not my father.

1118
02:29:40,429 --> 02:29:45,100
You're my son,
and you have always known my mind.

1119
02:29:47,186 --> 02:29:48,478
You deceived me.

1120
02:29:48,562 --> 02:29:51,064
You let yourself be deceived.

1121
02:29:51,148 --> 02:29:54,693
ln your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

1122
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:01,866
At last, you know what it means to hate.

1123
02:30:06,247 --> 02:30:08,498
Now you're ready to be a king.

1124
02:30:10,418 --> 02:30:14,546
My hate will die with you.

1125
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:21,511
William Wallace,

1126
02:30:21,595 --> 02:30:24,305
you stand in taint of high treason.

1127
02:30:25,307 --> 02:30:26,558
Against whom?

1128
02:30:26,642 --> 02:30:28,351
Against your king.

1129
02:30:29,770 --> 02:30:31,771
Have you anything to say?

1130
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:34,733
Never in my whole life

1131
02:30:36,402 --> 02:30:38,695
did I swear allegiance to him.

1132
02:30:39,947 --> 02:30:42,824
It matters not. He is your king.

1133
02:30:45,703 --> 02:30:48,621
Confess, and you may
receive a quick death.

1134
02:30:49,582 --> 02:30:52,333
Deny, and you must be purified by pain.

1135
02:30:52,418 --> 02:30:59,382
Do you confess?

1136
02:31:05,264 --> 02:31:08,808
Then on the morrow,
you shall receive your purification.

1137
02:31:20,988 --> 02:31:22,697
- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.

1138
02:31:22,782 --> 02:31:24,115
We've got orders
from the king that nobody...

1139
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:26,576
The king will be dead in a month
and his son is a weakling.

1140
02:31:26,660 --> 02:31:29,120
Who do you think
will rule this kingdom?

1141
02:31:29,205 --> 02:31:30,997
Now open this door.

1142
02:31:32,958 --> 02:31:34,250
Majesty.

1143
02:31:40,925 --> 02:31:42,926
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

1144
02:31:43,010 --> 02:31:44,427
Stop it!

1145
02:31:45,262 --> 02:31:46,596
Leave me.

1146
02:31:47,473 --> 02:31:49,140
I said leave me!

1147
02:32:02,238 --> 02:32:03,571
Milady.

1148
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:09,077
Sir, I come to beg you

1149
02:32:11,122 --> 02:32:13,581
to confess all
and swear allegiance to the king

1150
02:32:13,666 --> 02:32:15,875
that he might show you mercy.

1151
02:32:16,752 --> 02:32:19,212
Will he show mercy to my country?

1152
02:32:20,005 --> 02:32:24,300
Mercy is to die quickly,
perhaps even live in a tower.

1153
02:32:24,385 --> 02:32:26,886
ln time, who knows what can happen

1154
02:32:28,514 --> 02:32:30,723
if you can only live.

1155
02:32:35,187 --> 02:32:37,021
If I swear to him,

1156
02:32:37,815 --> 02:32:40,984
then all that I am is dead aIready.

1157
02:32:50,411 --> 02:32:52,996
You will die. It will be awful.

1158
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:55,081
Every man dies.

1159
02:32:57,751 --> 02:32:59,878
Not every man really lives.

1160
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:07,719
Drink this.

1161
02:33:09,054 --> 02:33:11,264
It will dull your pain.

1162
02:33:11,348 --> 02:33:15,226
No. It will numb my wits,
and I must have them all.

1163
02:33:16,478 --> 02:33:18,771
For if I'm senseless, or if I wail,

1164
02:33:19,273 --> 02:33:21,983
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1165
02:33:22,067 --> 02:33:24,944
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1166
02:33:25,487 --> 02:33:26,779
Take it.

1167
02:33:31,619 --> 02:33:33,286
All right.

1168
02:34:20,668 --> 02:34:25,171
I have come to beg for the life
of William Wallace.

1169
02:34:27,466 --> 02:34:29,926
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1170
02:34:30,427 --> 02:34:32,095
I respect him.

1171
02:34:33,764 --> 02:34:35,556
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1172
02:34:35,641 --> 02:34:40,478
Show mercy, O thou great king,
and win the respect of your own people.

1173
02:34:50,114 --> 02:34:55,034
Even now, you are incapable of mercy.

1174
02:35:01,834 --> 02:35:03,334
And you...

1175
02:35:07,506 --> 02:35:10,633
To you,
that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1176
02:35:11,343 --> 02:35:15,763
Before he lost his powers of speech,
he told me his one comfort was

1177
02:35:15,848 --> 02:35:18,933
that he would live
to know Wallace was dead.

1178
02:35:37,286 --> 02:35:38,703
You see,

1179
02:35:40,622 --> 02:35:43,124
death comes to us all.

1180
02:35:52,551 --> 02:35:58,014
But before it comes to you, know this.

1181
02:35:58,098 --> 02:36:00,224
Your blood dies with you.

1182
02:36:02,895 --> 02:36:06,105
A child who is not of your line grows
in my belly.

1183
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:13,071
Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.

1184
02:36:50,818 --> 02:36:52,819
I'm so afraid.

1185
02:37:00,828 --> 02:37:04,705
Give me the strength to die well.

1186
02:37:28,939 --> 02:37:30,648
Here he comes!

1187
02:38:59,655 --> 02:39:02,657
Now behold the awful price of treason!

1188
02:39:09,456 --> 02:39:11,791
You will fall to your knees now,

1189
02:39:13,710 --> 02:39:16,629
declare yourself the king's loyal subject

1190
02:39:17,464 --> 02:39:19,465
and beg his mercy.

1191
02:39:26,473 --> 02:39:28,349
And you shall have it.

1192
02:39:39,820 --> 02:39:41,237
Rope!

1193
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:04,719
Stretch him!

1194
02:40:07,014 --> 02:40:10,182
That's it! Stretch him!

1195
02:40:25,907 --> 02:40:27,825
Shame! Shame!

1196
02:40:47,638 --> 02:40:49,847
Pleasant, yes?

1197
02:40:52,893 --> 02:40:54,810
Rise to your knees,

1198
02:40:54,895 --> 02:40:57,647
kiss the royal emblem on my cloak,

1199
02:40:57,731 --> 02:40:59,899
and you will feel no more.

1200
02:41:41,525 --> 02:41:42,858
Rack him!

1201
02:42:37,372 --> 02:42:38,873
Enough?

1202
02:43:31,635 --> 02:43:35,054
It can all end right now.

1203
02:43:36,389 --> 02:43:37,932
Peace.

1204
02:43:39,184 --> 02:43:42,353
Please, just say it.

1205
02:43:43,438 --> 02:43:46,148
Cry out, "Mercy."

1206
02:43:56,827 --> 02:43:58,285
Mercy!

1207
02:43:58,370 --> 02:44:01,914
- Mercy!
- Mercy!

1208
02:44:05,877 --> 02:44:07,169
Cry out.

1209
02:44:07,546 --> 02:44:10,756
Mercy! Mercy!

1210
02:44:13,635 --> 02:44:15,219
Just say it.

1211
02:44:15,554 --> 02:44:18,138
Mercy.

1212
02:44:18,223 --> 02:44:21,433
Mercy! Mercy!

1213
02:44:40,579 --> 02:44:42,705
Mercy, William.

1214
02:44:42,789 --> 02:44:44,999
- Mercy.
- Jesus, now say it.

1215
02:44:51,131 --> 02:44:54,592
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1216
02:44:55,010 --> 02:44:57,553
Mercy! Mercy!

1217
02:44:57,637 --> 02:44:59,638
Mercy!

1218
02:45:14,404 --> 02:45:21,410
Freedom!

1219
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:12,396
After the beheading,

1220
02:47:12,480 --> 02:47:15,691
William Wallace's body
was torn to pieces.

1221
02:47:18,611 --> 02:47:21,572
His head was set on London Bridge,

1222
02:47:23,116 --> 02:47:28,704
his arms and legs sent
to the four corners of Britain

1223
02:47:28,788 --> 02:47:30,706


as a warning.

1224
02:47:30,790 --> 02:47:35,711
It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.

1225
02:47:36,546 --> 02:47:39,673
And I, Robert the Bruce,

1226
02:47:39,758 --> 02:47:44,762
rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the EngIish king

1227
02:47:44,846 --> 02:47:48,140
and accept his endorsement
of my crown.

1228
02:47:48,933 --> 02:47:51,643
I hope you've washed your arse
this morning.

1229
02:47:51,728 --> 02:47:54,188
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1230
02:48:23,468 --> 02:48:25,886
Come. Let's get it over with.

1231
02:48:38,358 --> 02:48:39,483
Stop!

1232
02:48:57,710 --> 02:48:59,878
You have bled with Wallace!

1233
02:49:05,844 --> 02:49:07,553
Now bleed with me.

1234
02:49:48,511 --> 02:49:50,762
Wallace! Wallace!

1235
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:56,018
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Wallace! Wallace!

1236
02:50:14,954 --> 02:50:18,706
<i>[Voice of William Wallace:]</i>
"In the year of our Lord, 1314,

1237
02:50:18,917 --> 02:50:22,294
patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,

1238
02:50:22,670 --> 02:50:26,089
charged the fields of Bannockburn.

1239
02:50:26,174 --> 02:50:29,134
They fought Iike warrior poets.

1240
02:50:29,219 --> 02:50:31,303
They fought like Scotsmen,

1241
02:50:32,430 --> 02:50:34,306
and won their freedom."
