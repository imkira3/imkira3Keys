1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,563
Joe, get back here!

3
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,778
- You cut me, Tracey! Stop!
- You're not leaving me!

4
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,693
- Joe, stop!
- Help! Taxi!

5
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,861
- Help!
- Joe, I love you!

6
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,530
Joe! Joe!

7
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,153
No! Help me!

8
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,779
Joe, stop!

9
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,453
- Drive! She stabbed me!
- Come back!

10
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:18,124
- Go! Drive!
- Aah! My dad will kill you!

11
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,631
Ow.

12
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,303
# There was an old woman #

13
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,179
# And she lived in the woods #

14
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,433
# Ah, weile, weile, waile #

15
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,900
# There was an old woman #

16
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,815
# And she lived in the woods #

17
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,610
# Down by the River Saile #

18
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,109
# She had a baby
three months old #

19
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,363
# Ah, weile, weile, waile #

20
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,582
- # She had a baby three months old #
- Get in. Get in there, now.

21
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,453
# Down by the River Saile #

22
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,876
# She had a penknife,
long and sharp #

23
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,796
# Ah, weile, weile, waile #

24
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,637
# She had a penknife,
long and sharp #

25
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,598
# Down by the River Saile #

26
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,679
Hey, Da.

27
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,052
Morning, lads.

28
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,523
Ripe pears, 50p a pound.

29
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,774
# She stuck the penknife
in the baby's eye #

30
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,868
# Ah, weile, weile, waile #

31
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,410
# She stuck the penknife
in the baby's eye #

32
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,749
- # Down by the River Saile... #
- Hey, Sophie.

33
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:39,665
Good morning, Joe.
How are you?

34
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,254
I'm all right. Nice day.

35
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,589
# Weile, waile #

36
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,254
# There were three loud knocks #

37
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,092
# Came knocking on the door #

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,837
# Down by the River Saile #

39
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,135
# And are you
the woman who... #

40
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:58,685
# I got love, love #

41
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:03,276
# I got love, love, love #

42
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,065
# Here's a man with money #

43
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,439
Hey, fuck off.

44
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,908
But I've got a license.

45
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,207
So have I.

46
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,833
So fuck off right now.

47
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,601
Here you are.

48
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,189
Oh, lovely.

49
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,728
Did you feed the dog?

50
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,773
Got rid of that idiot, didn't I?

51
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,816
Who?

52
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,109
The busker.

53
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,948
Showed him this.

54
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,652
Oh, my God. It's all gold?

55
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,201
Used to belong
to some Arab in Iraq.

56
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,413
- Do you want to feel it?
- Aye.

57
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,456
Not the gun.

58
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,129
The big lad.

59
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,543
That just shoots blanks.

60
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,044
Why'd you have
to go and say that?

61
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,466
Sorry, M.D.

62
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,590
When are you gonna give over
about having babies?

63
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,432
I don't give a shite
what the doctors say.

64
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,642
There's nothing wrong with me.

65
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,312
What are yous looking at?

66
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,316
Come on. Get up.

67
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,561
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,821
Place your bets.

69
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,406
50, 6, red.

70
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,866
- Come on.
- Relax.

71
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:34,984
No more bets.

72
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,945
Look, you've lost again.

73
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,164
Now can we go?

74
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,954
Annie has to get to work, Jimbo.

75
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,246
Yeah, yeah. Just one more bet.

76
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,662
That's the boss.

77
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,334
Place your bets.

78
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,252
All right, Chopper?

79
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,800
Uh, Jimbo, there's Mad Dog.
Come on. Let it go.

80
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:58,179
- 5,100, black.
- No more bets.

81
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:00,473
House pays red.

82
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,062
Can I have another 50?

83
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,649
How much is he down now?

84
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,485
- 400.
- 400.

85
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:13,281
All right, make it an even 5.

86
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:14,365
Five's not even.

87
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:15,780
What did you say?

88
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:17,198
Place your bets.

89
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,781
- Red, 100.
- No more bets.

90
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,120
- Red wins.
- Yes.

91
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,460
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

92
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:29,380
How much do you
still owe me?

93
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,626
There's, uh, 500 he
borrowed at Christmas.

94
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,674
Borrowed another 3,
interest on that.

95
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,842
600 he borrowed
at the beginning of the month.

96
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,682
- What?
- Comes to 4,900.

97
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,348
4,900?
How does it come to 4--

98
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:44,142
Money's expensive these days.

99
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:47,099
Here.

100
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,726
That'll make it
5 grand you owe me.

101
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:52,487
Is that even, smartarse?

102
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:57,026
And I want all of that
Monday morning.

103
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,402
Now get out of here.

104
00:05:58,402 --> 00:06:00,200
Come on, Jimbo.

105
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:01,617
Move it.

106
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,324
Place your bets.

107
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,123
What are you gonna do?

108
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,462
I don't know.

109
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:19,973
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.

110
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:20,966
Come again.

111
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,390
Where's the boss man,
Peter, then?

112
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:25,888
Who-What?

113
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,389
The boss man, Peter.

114
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:28,936
Peter. Oh.

115
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,775
He's not here.
He's on vacation.

116
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,566
Vacation?
What the hell is that?

117
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:35,564
You're a Yank, aren't you?

118
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,407
I'm his cousin,

119
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,528
and, uh, he's overseas right now.

120
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:41,528
He's doing some charity work.

121
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:42,825
- Ah, God bless him.
- So I...

122
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,619
We have a nice, big,
comfortable couch,

123
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,036
lovely. You'd sink into it up
to your oxters.

124
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,124
We'll leave it here,
give you a good price.

125
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,503
Excuse me?

126
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:53,631
Do you not speak English
over there?

127
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:56,547
We've a nice, big,
comfortable couch,

128
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,422
lovely. You'd sink into it
up to your oxters.

129
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:02,595
We'll bring it in for you,
give you a good price.

130
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,059
- Oh.
- What?

131
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,476
Oh, you're not gonna
sell your furniture.

132
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:10,895
Sure, it's crap.
You'd get nothing for it.

133
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:12,063
Excuse me.

134
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,810
Um, I really don't need a couch.

135
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,733
I don't have the space for it,
but, um...

136
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:16,946
We'll bring it for you, anyway,

137
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:18,110
give you a look at it.
Come on, lads.

138
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,574
Who is he?

139
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:20,863
He's somebody
I've been looking for.

140
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:21,985
Go. Go.

141
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:22,986
Hey.

142
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:26,490
Hey.

143
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:29,126
Wait up. Hey.

144
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,417
Is everything okay?

145
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:35,333
I don't know.
Do you know these guys?

146
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,884
No, but I have seen one here
a few times watching.

147
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,347
Yeah, so have I.

148
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:42,932
You think he's up to no good?

149
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:44,346
I don't know.

150
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:48,354
I'll keep a watch.

151
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,144
All right.

152
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,766
This looks fun.

153
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,768
Some local musicians.

154
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,270
They are very good.

155
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:00,237
Would you like to come along?

156
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,736
Uh, yes, I would like that.

157
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,033
Tonight.

158
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,406
Yes.

159
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:07,748
All right, I'll see you then.

160
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:29,891
Good morning, Daddy.

161
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,936
You want a fry?

162
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,651
Please.
You're gonna kill yourself.

163
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:37,611
I'm gonna have granola.

164
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,526
Granola? Heh.

165
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,570
I'd rather eat cow shite.

166
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,694
Sammy Weller,
mind your language.

167
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,661
Would you like
some granola, Mommy?

168
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:47,075
That would be lovely, Randall.

169
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:51,500
Ulstermen fought two world wars

170
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:53,586
eating Ulster fries.

171
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:54,579
Fucking granola.

172
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,622
What did you say?

173
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:57,794
Hmm?

174
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,918
Oh, I--I said I'm grand.

175
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:10,394
Hey.

176
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,931
What do you want?

177
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,398
I'm looking for Jimbo Regan.

178
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,391
He's not here.

179
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,690
Shh.

180
00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:19,812
There, there, dear.

181
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,195
Is that a boy or a girl?

182
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,407
Boy.

183
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,902
What age is he?

184
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,198
Six months.

185
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,741
Are you sure
Jim's not in there?

186
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:31,741
What?

187
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,459
I told you he's not.

188
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,044
And don't come back here.

189
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:45,547
Are you still baby-sitting
them tinker brats

190
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:46,968
up at the camp on the hill?

191
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:48,841
It's called community relations.

192
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:51,685
Yeah, well, keep your eyes
open when you're up there.

193
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,600
Their das are robbing shops.

194
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:55,143
We don't know how
the hell they're doing it.

195
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,437
Remember, you're a policeman,

196
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:58,685
not a social worker.

197
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,482
- I'm both.
- Bollocks.

198
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:04,946
If he ever found out about you,

199
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,443
I think he'd kill himself.

200
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,954
God will guide us, Mommy.

201
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:19,877
Where were you?

202
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:22,547
I got a day's work at the bakery.

203
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,007
For you.

204
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:26,095
Take it.

205
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:27,305
Mwah.

206
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,470
I'm late. I need to go.

207
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:31,514
Okay. Look.

208
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,727
Got your favorite.

209
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:36,936
Hello. Hello, wee one.

210
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:38,149
All right, I've got to go.

211
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:40,064
Um, okay.

212
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,403
Bye, love.

213
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:42,612
Sorry I was late.

214
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,037
Hey, quick. Go, lads.

215
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,497
Hey, Mary Ellen!

216
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:54,082
The bloody peelers is here again.

217
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:56,452
Will you get rid of them quick,
before you get us all arrested?

218
00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:00,213
Sure, it's only
the wee community man.

219
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:03,505
He's a lovely wee boy,
wouldn't harm a fly.

220
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,592
Good morning, officer.

221
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,430
- Good morning.
- Where are you taking them today, then?

222
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:11,221
We're taking them to the track.

223
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:13,890
Oh, they need a wee bit of money,
you know, for a wee bet.

224
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,138
No, not the horse track, ma'am.

225
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:17,139
Track and field.

226
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,356
For athletics.

227
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,694
Jesus.

228
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,484
And here was me thinking

229
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:26,322
you were taking them
to the races.

230
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,611
Hurry! Come on, boys!

231
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,453
Come on!

232
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:35,746
Don't make
the nice policeman wait.

233
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:37,334
Hey, Ma,
give us some money.

234
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:38,668
Sure, I've no money on me.

235
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,833
It's all free, anyway. Go on.

236
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:43,506
Get in there.

237
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:45,296
Have a lovely day.

238
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,509
See ya.

239
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,502
Let's go, lads.

240
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:50,176
Community, me arse.
They're only up here snooping.

241
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:51,173
Shut you up.

242
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,646
Where am I going to get five grand
by the weekend?

243
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,904
I know where
you'll get it, easy.

244
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:11,777
Where?

245
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,821
Whole Lotta Sole.

246
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:17,415
The fish market tomorrow.

247
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:18,659
They'll have a fortune.

248
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,044
What, rob the fish market?

249
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:22,208
Yeah.

250
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,423
How do you know?

251
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:27,133
I used to work there.

252
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,129
I mean, everybody knows fish shops
in Catholic districts

253
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,222
make a fortune on a Friday.

254
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,717
They have tons of money
in the office

255
00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:37,390
with just one guard working.

256
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:40,060
Yeah, but there'll be a lot
of people working there as well.

257
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,524
You can't exactly rob
somewhere like that

258
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,564
with a knife or a hammer.

259
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,277
I have what you need.

260
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,270
Like what?

261
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,316
The heavy gear.

262
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:50,362
Bollocks.

263
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:57,411
You ever done
any welding, Jimbo?

264
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:03,750
I used to be a spot-welder
at the shipyard.

265
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,306
Wonderful thing,

266
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:16,175
will cut through anything.

267
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:21,731
Where's my five grand, Jimbo?

268
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,144
I don't have it,
but I swear I'll get it to you.

269
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,984
Fuck off.
You couldn't get £10 to me.

270
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:29,605
You do have something that I want.

271
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:32,449
Not want, Jimbo.
Have to have.

272
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,239
What? What is it?

273
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,613
I want that wee boy of yours.

274
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,330
My son?

275
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:42,247
Aye. You see,
I need a child for my Doris.

276
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:44,712
She has a woman's thing,
and I've...

277
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:48,458
What the fuck
am I telling you for?

278
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:51,506
She needs a child.
You have a child.

279
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:52,799
I want that child.

280
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:55,799
So you and
that skinny girlfriend of yours,

281
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:57,892
you can barely
look after yourselves,

282
00:13:57,884 --> 00:13:59,477
never mind him.

283
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:01,846
So you bring that child to me

284
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,519
before the weekend's out,

285
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:05,232
and I'll write off your debt.

286
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:07,568
Otherwise,
I'll bury the both of you,

287
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,607
and I'll take him anyway.

288
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:10,071
I'm not giving you my son.

289
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:11,530
Is that right?

290
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:14,116
He's my son.
I can't give you my son.

291
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:17,198
Aah! Mad Dog, stop!

292
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,465
Let him down.

293
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:35,930
Bring me that child.

294
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,515
- Please.
- Come on.

295
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:38,723
Please, I'll get you the money.

296
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:49,568
Ready for a sing-song?

297
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,667
# Well, let me see the girl
I want to go with #

298
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,957
# Let me see the eyes... #

299
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,375
- Cranberry juice for you.
- Thank you.

300
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:09,543
# That lit up for me #

301
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:13,089
# Hold me in your arms... #

302
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:15,759
- This guy's incredible.
- Yeah.

303
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:18,803
# Hold in your arms, baby #

304
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,805
# And let me kiss the lips
I kissed in darkness #

305
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:28,685
# It's the only kiss
I never harnessed #

306
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:30,186
# Hold me in your arms... #

307
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,062
There's our Sean.

308
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:36,488
- Come on, wee man. Come on.
- # Hold me in your arms #

309
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:39,828
Oh. You're home.

310
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:44,870
I smell something burning.

311
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:48,166
Some kids lit a fire outside.

312
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:53,087
I thought you were gonna work
at the bakery tonight again.

313
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,884
There was no work tonight.

314
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:00,466
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,093
Don't worry.

316
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,720
I can work the weekend
at the cleaning.

317
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:10,646
Hold him. Hold him.

318
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:11,689
Hold him.

319
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:17,866
Who is it?

320
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:19,075
It's me, Sox.

321
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:20,694
It's Sox.
I have to answer it.

322
00:16:20,694 --> 00:16:21,786
I won't be long.

323
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:26,913
What happened?

324
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,172
Jesus.
Look at your sneakers.

325
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:33,507
Never mind
my fucking sneakers.

326
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:35,091
Mad Dog wants my wee lad.

327
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,427
- What wee lad?
- My son Sean.

328
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,797
Jesus Christ,
he's not gonna kill him?

329
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:41,343
No.

330
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:42,932
He wants him for his girlfriend.

331
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:44,221
She wants a child.

332
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:45,560
What?

333
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,850
W-Why doesn't he
just fuck her, then?

334
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:49,848
Do you want to go and ask him?

335
00:16:49,848 --> 00:16:52,192
Jesus, Jimbo. Look,
you'd be better going on the run.

336
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:54,482
I can't go on the run.
How could I go on the run?

337
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,446
I've no money to go on the run.

338
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:58,815
I...

339
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:05,705
You--You said
that fish shop was easy?

340
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:07,574
- Fucking right, it is.
- And you have the gear?

341
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:09,372
My grandda has it.

342
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,835
Your grandda?

343
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:13,747
Ohh.

344
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:15,124
That was great.

345
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:16,716
It's so cold.

346
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,085
Oh. Here.

347
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:20,053
Thank you.

348
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,342
Here. Here.

349
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,761
There you go.

350
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:25,475
I'm an African girl, you know.

351
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:26,764
I miss the sun.

352
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,886
You miss Africa?

353
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:30,105
- Mm, every day.
- Yeah.

354
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:33,192
It's 11 years since
I left Ethiopia after the war.

355
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,905
I mean, I'm glad to have escaped
so much sadness, but I miss it.

356
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:42,367
Heh. Refugees in Belfast.

357
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,702
Strange world.

358
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,661
You, a refugee?

359
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:47,031
No.

360
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,453
I just, uh--

361
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:50,827
I'm just taking a break
for right now.

362
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,246
You want a cup of tea?

363
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:55,961
Why not?

364
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:57,584
Yeah? Great.

365
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,217
- Well, welcome.
- Thank you.

366
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:03,760
Casa es su casa.
That's...

367
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,099
Come on.
I have to get home soon.

368
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:14,817
Who are you?

369
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:17,562
Uh, Jimbo's here
from the IRA, Grandda.

370
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:19,439
He's come to get their stuff.

371
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:21,941
Oh, we're going on an operation?

372
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,284
Indeed we are, sir.

373
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,619
- I'll drive.
- Uh, no.

374
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,283
You're not on this operation.

375
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,371
Why not?

376
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:29,115
Well, I can't tell you that.

377
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:30,492
- Security.
- Oh.

378
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:33,870
Right. Just under here.

379
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:44,631
Whoa.

380
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:47,016
It's ancient.

381
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:49,222
Where did he get this?

382
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:51,391
An IRA man hid it here
during the Troubles.

383
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:52,604
Then he got shot.

384
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,099
No one else knows it's here.

385
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:57,313
Okay-

386
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,108
- Don't do that.
- Why?

387
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,571
It has a hair trigger.

388
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:01,940
- A what?
- It went off.

389
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,071
Oh, fuck.

390
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:09,576
Okay. Um...

391
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,199
we're gonna need a car.

392
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:13,042
We'll take my grandda's.

393
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:14,627
Are we going for a drink?

394
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:19,461
You painted that?

395
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,676
At first, I did some, uh, sketches,

396
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,546
and then I switched to watercolors.

397
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:27,640
In the end, I used acrylics.

398
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,100
Much more dramatic.

399
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:31,844
The woman looks very angry.

400
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:34,722
Yeah.

401
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,475
Could say that.

402
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:40,194
But that's a whole 'nother story.

403
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:41,608
Have another drink.

404
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,612
Okay, I--I don't drink.

405
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,656
I really never drink.

406
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:48,778
We're in Ireland.

407
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:52,206
Cheers.

408
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:21,902
# You are like a garden #

409
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:28,198
# Growing in the soul #

410
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:35,331
# When I'm brokenhearted #

411
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:41,332
# You can make me whole #

412
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:46,007
# You are like a river #

413
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:52,969
# You run into the deep #

414
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:56,806
I think it's funny.

415
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,057
What, Candle in the Wind?

416
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,399
- Why is that funny?
- Yeah, it's just--

417
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,859
It's called
Candle in the Wind.

418
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:02,319
I know.

419
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:06,441
Hey! How can you run
for all that time without sweating?

420
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:10,156
How can you eat two pounds
of grease without keeling over?

421
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:14,035
Where's your ma?

422
00:21:14,031 --> 00:21:15,453
She's at chapel,

423
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:17,167
praying for our conversion.

424
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,661
Ha! Ha ha!

425
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,004
There's more chance
of the Pope getting married

426
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:23,749
than us turning Catholic, huh?
Heh heh heh.

427
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,136
Oh, by the way,
did you see anything

428
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,845
up at that gypsy
camp yesterday?

429
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:30,430
I'm not your spy.

430
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:36,804
Good morning.
Can I help you?

431
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:38,180
Where's Peter?

432
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,603
Uh, he is on vacation right now.

433
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,727
I'm--I'm his cousin.
I'm filling in for him.

434
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:44,649
I do regular business with Peter.

435
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:46,897
My name's Flynn,
Douglas Flynn.

436
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:48,319
He must have mentioned me.

437
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:49,316
Mm...

438
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:51,694
no, he didn't.

439
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,320
But maybe I can help you.

440
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,541
Okay. I have a nice
little piece for you.

441
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:59,079
I'm reluctant to part with it,

442
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:00,874
but I'll give you a good price.

443
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:05,670
Contemporary fire starter,

444
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,383
French-made.

445
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,174
This is the petite model.

446
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:11,217
I'll give it to you for £200.

447
00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:14,303
Why don't you check the till,

448
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,301
see if there's an envelope
with my name on it,

449
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,895
Douglas Flynn.

450
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,414
Sorry.

451
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:41,705
- Sure about that?
- Positive.

452
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:44,583
Why don't you call your cousin,

453
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:47,624
straighten this out
over the weekend.

454
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:48,625
Oh, Doug.

455
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,759
I don't smoke.

456
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,131
Want to bet?

457
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:04,855
Why'd you bring a child?

458
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:05,943
Annie's at work.
Here. Watch him.

459
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:07,403
Why? Where are you going?

460
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:09,113
I think I know someone
that can give me the money.

461
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:10,732
- Who?
- Never mind.

462
00:23:10,731 --> 00:23:12,904
Just--Just watch the child.

463
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,322
But...

464
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,082
Good morning, sir.

465
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:21,621
I brought you that settee.

466
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:22,914
Will I bring it right in?

467
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,958
- No.
- Ah, come on.

468
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:26,422
I don't--

469
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:28,508
Well, now, £30.

470
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:32,762
I'm selling you me own settee
for £30 to feed me children.

471
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:33,754
You gotta be kidding me.

472
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:35,973
- £30 is a disgrace.
- No.

473
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:37,933
It cost 300 barely 10 weeks ago.

474
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:39,142
I don't need it.

475
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:41,137
I don't have the room or the floor.

476
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:42,855
Have some pity. Give us 30.

477
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,645
There's no--Hey! You!

478
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,017
Come here! You!

479
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,858
Pick it up, lads.

480
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:52,490
Get back here!

481
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:55,951
Hey!

482
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,373
Oh, fuck.

483
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:08,130
Hey! Hey! Get back.

484
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:11,171
You left the child.

485
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,168
What are you running for?

486
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,761
Well, you were running, too.

487
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,430
Did you get it?

488
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,140
No. Didn't get it.

489
00:24:18,132 --> 00:24:19,679
We're gonna need a baby-sitter.

490
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:21,018
- Meet me at your grandda's.
- All right.

491
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:45,744
No, I can't do it.

492
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:47,962
- I've got a date.
- Jesus, Bridie.

493
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:49,831
How do you have a date
at 10:00 in the morning?

494
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,878
Never you mind.
I said I can't do it.

495
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:53,000
I'll give you £10.

496
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,173
- No.
- £20, Bridie.

497
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:56,921
Please. Come on.
I'll only be an hour.

498
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:59,015
- £25.
- £25?!

499
00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:00,633
And you better be an hour.

500
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:04,095
Okay. All right.

501
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:06,222
Okay.

502
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,857
I'm warning you now.

503
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,101
- An hour.
- Okay.

504
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:20,695
Oh, hi.

505
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:22,743
Hello.

506
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:26,413
Sorry for running out
so early. Uh...

507
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:27,911
That's all right.

508
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:34,300
Did I do something wrong?

509
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,670
No.

510
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:37,592
I had a clothes consignment
arrive early.

511
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:38,965
I didn't want to wake you.

512
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:40,591
Well, that's nice of you.
Thank you.

513
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:43,594
Um...

514
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:45,972
I had a beautiful evening.

515
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:47,143
Me, too.

516
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:50,480
We should, um--

517
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:51,977
Do you want to have
dinner tonight?

518
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:53,320
Yes.

519
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:54,734
'Cause I can cook.

520
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,731
Do you eat fish?

521
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:57,278
I do.

522
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,540
How come your grandda
has a brand-new Micra?

523
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,916
It's a National Health car.

524
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:15,758
He gets it for free
to go to the doctor's.

525
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:17,503
I'm a designated driver.

526
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:20,922
Oh, Jesus.

527
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:22,845
- What? What?
- It's my ma.

528
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:25,723
Ah... Fuck's sake.

529
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,141
Hey!

530
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:30,269
Where you going?

531
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:31,061
- I was just going--
- I told you.

532
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:33,152
You go anywhere in this,
you take your grandda.

533
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,395
It's his car.

534
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:36,146
If the Health Services people
see you

535
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:37,864
in it on your own,
they'll take it off him.

536
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,858
- It's Saturday, Ma.
- Doesn't matter.

537
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,952
They're everywhere,
these Health Service people.

538
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:44,617
Take him with you.
The air'll do him good.

539
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:46,990
Ba!

540
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,388
Are we going to the pub?

541
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,428
You sure you don't want
to leave it to next week?

542
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,096
You think Mad Dog's
gonna wait till next week?

543
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,309
We have to do it now.

544
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:07,302
Do these guys bite?

545
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:08,770
Aye. Watch your fingers.

546
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:10,184
I'll have a couple
of these guys in there, too.

547
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,602
- There you go, sir.
- And a pound of cod.

548
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:16,319
- That's good.
- There's your food now.

549
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:17,654
- All the best.
- Thank you.

550
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:22,659
Hey, son,
take us to the pub, huh?

551
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:24,619
I'll give you two shillings
if you'll take me.

552
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:26,284
I'm your grandson, Grandda.

553
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,407
I don't care who you are.
Take us to the pub.

554
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:29,659
Stop here.

555
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:33,329
You sure you want to do this?

556
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:34,750
Go stand on the corner
and keep watch.

557
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,959
Hey.

558
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:05,406
This is a robbery.

559
00:28:05,402 --> 00:28:06,494
Put your hands up.

560
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:08,363
Who the fuck are you?

561
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:12,626
What are you doing here?

562
00:28:12,618 --> 00:28:14,541
- Do I know you?
- Move!

563
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:15,834
Get--
Get behind the desk.

564
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:18,791
Quickly.

565
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:19,963
Okay, um,

566
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,586
all right.

567
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:26,091
Don't move.

568
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,843
Wh-Where's the money?

569
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:30,516
- What money?
- The Friday money.

570
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:32,605
That's it. It's receipts.

571
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:35,396
Everybody uses
debit cards now, son.

572
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:36,893
Nobody uses cash these days.

573
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:37,894
What?

574
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:42,861
Touch that bag,
and you are dead.

575
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:45,076
Is this it?
Are you shitting me?

576
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:47,286
I said don't touch that bag.

577
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:51,116
Okay, sit down in the corner.

578
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:53,163
Don't move.
Stay where you are.

579
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:55,585
Um...

580
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:57,421
Hey, look! It's a robber!

581
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:59,507
Just don't--don't move!

582
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:00,796
Don't move!

583
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:04,879
Oh, Jesus.

584
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:08,053
Oh, my God. It's a gunman.

585
00:29:12,678 --> 00:29:14,396
Get him!

586
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:22,063
Ah, fuck this.

587
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,487
Get out of the way!

588
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:28,820
- Grandda, what are you--
- Going to the pub.

589
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,243
Grandda, let me in. Please.

590
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,240
Oh, Jesus.

591
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:34,283
Grandda, come back!

592
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:35,830
Grandda, please come back!

593
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:37,875
Oh, please, God, no.

594
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,089
- Don't leave!
- Sox!

595
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:42,459
Come back, please! Sox!

596
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:54,804
You bloody idiot!

597
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:12,162
Hey, you!

598
00:30:12,154 --> 00:30:13,952
I told you an hour.

599
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:15,291
Bridie. I can't take him now.

600
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:16,626
I'll give you anything,
£100. Please.

601
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:18,244
No way.
We've got somewhere to be.

602
00:30:18,244 --> 00:30:20,167
Bridie! Bridie!

603
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,131
Shit.

604
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:30,047
We were robbed.

605
00:30:32,592 --> 00:30:34,094
He got the brown bag.

606
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:37,100
Yes, that brown bag.

607
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:40,562
I'm sorry, Douglas. I swear,

608
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:42,105
it wasn't my fault.

609
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:48,946
What are you looking at?

610
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,087
Gunman, shooting, robbery.

611
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:06,505
Oh, just like the old days,
Sammy, me boy.

612
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:07,844
Go talk to DCI.

613
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:08,837
Will do, boss.

614
00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:19,019
So where's this witness?

615
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,015
Here she is here.

616
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:23,978
Step this way, madam.

617
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:29,483
Ah, hello, missis.

618
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:32,783
So what can you
tell me about this boyo?

619
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,953
# If I look you in the eyes #

620
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:45,879
# And swore you my love #

621
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:52,427
# ls too strong to hold #

622
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:55,510
Thanks very much. Goodbye.

623
00:31:56,927 --> 00:32:01,524
# The way you make me feel #

624
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:04,643
- # I've just never #
- How you doing?

625
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:08,489
# Felt before #

626
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,362
# Well, I am #

627
00:32:11,358 --> 00:32:12,985
# I'm sure #

628
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:15,704
# The man of some... #

629
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:17,073
Drop the gun.

630
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:18,494
- What?
- Don't move.

631
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,958
Ahh!

632
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,372
No, wait.

633
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:22,494
Stop!

634
00:32:22,494 --> 00:32:23,837
# All you have to do... #

635
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:25,957
Stop, or I'll shoot!

636
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:27,674
Aah! Don't shoot!

637
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,714
# ...out my name #

638
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,384
Stop! Don't move!

639
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,472
Shut the door.

640
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:37,809
# My heart is true #

641
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:40,887
Get in here.

642
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:43,015
So average height, old coat.

643
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:44,016
There anything else?

644
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:46,110
He was wearing a balaclava.

645
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:48,362
I know you, don't I?

646
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:49,980
Everybody knows me.

647
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,948
- What's your name again?
- Maisie.

648
00:32:53,191 --> 00:32:55,285
Maisie Flynn,

649
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,824
Mad Dog's ma.

650
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,323
My son is no dog.
His name is Douglas,

651
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:00,995
and I'll thank you
to call him that.

652
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:03,585
What's your connection
to Whole Lotta Sole, Maisie?

653
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:04,999
Nothing.

654
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:07,498
Nothing? Then what were
you doing in the office?

655
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:09,716
- Buying fish.
- What, you don't like the retail counter?

656
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,882
I don't like seeing them
laying there dead.

657
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:14,175
So average height,

658
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:16,970
old coat,
Thompson machine gun.

659
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:19,059
Must have been Al Capone.

660
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:21,854
Did he have a Chicago accent?

661
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:24,099
Well, now that you mention it,
he could have been a Yank.

662
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:25,896
- Oh, yeah?
- He said,

663
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:27,519
"Are you shitting me?"

664
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:30,271
Are you shitting me?

665
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,450
Hey, boss, there's been another shooting,
in Scotch Street.

666
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:36,194
The gunman's run into a shop.
He's cornered.

667
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:38,663
Never rains, but it pours.

668
00:33:38,654 --> 00:33:40,827
Ah, regards
to Mad Dog, Maisie.

669
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:42,040
Douglas.

670
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:44,001
Rapid Reaction Force is on its way.

671
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:47,167
S-Sean, shush.

672
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:50,588
- Whose is this?
- He's my son.

673
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,800
Why did you bring him here?

674
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:55,304
- What is that?
- Nothing.

675
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:57,515
- Is someone else here?
- No.

676
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:58,554
Get back there.

677
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:59,721
Okay. All right.
Okay, okay.

678
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:06,732
Okay. Open this.

679
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:08,942
It's just a bathroom.

680
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:09,936
Open it.

681
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:14,281
See?

682
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:28,330
What's in there?

683
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:30,457
Nothing. I-It's just--
It's a broom closet.

684
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:32,379
It's full of junk.

685
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,377
Get out of the road. Move.

686
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:35,845
All right, all right.
All right.

687
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:39,599
# I believe it, too #

688
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,137
# It's you #

689
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:42,477
# Yes, you #

690
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,720
Okay.

691
00:34:51,435 --> 00:34:55,315
# As down in the glen
came McAlpine's men #

692
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:57,032
# With their shovels... #

693
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:59,527
- What's in there?
- Upstairs apartment. It's locked.

694
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:00,779
Push this across.

695
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:02,155
- All right.
- Push it!

696
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:07,034
Aah!

697
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:08,251
Please don't shoot.

698
00:35:08,244 --> 00:35:09,336
- Get your hands up!
- No, no, no, no.

699
00:35:09,328 --> 00:35:10,671
- Get your hands up!
- Take it easy.

700
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:11,789
Get her out of there. Move.

701
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:13,211
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- You lied to me?

702
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:14,959
- I didn't know she was--
- You lied to me?

703
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:19,263
# ...the road again
with McAlpine's fusiliers #

704
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:20,757
We'll form a barrier here.

705
00:35:20,756 --> 00:35:22,724
You'll form a barrier at the back.

706
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:23,809
Okay? Quick as you can.

707
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:29,774
# I stripped to the skin
with Darky Finn #

708
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:31,608
# Way down on the... #

709
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:32,693
All right. Okay.

710
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:34,687
- Okay. Okay.
- There, there.

711
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,234
There, Sean.

712
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,408
There. It's okay. It's okay.

713
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,619
# ...for rain #

714
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:45,206
# McAlpine's God
is a will-filled hod #

715
00:35:45,198 --> 00:35:46,666
# With your shoulde-- #

716
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:52,250
Behind the barrier.

717
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:54,214
No one comes through here.

718
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:56,757
Get back. Everybody, back.

719
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:58,962
This is mine, Stewart.

720
00:35:58,962 --> 00:36:00,134
No, no, no.

721
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,132
Rapid Reaction Unit.
It's ours.

722
00:36:02,132 --> 00:36:04,601
Active investigation. It's mine.

723
00:36:04,593 --> 00:36:06,140
Gunman robs fish market.

724
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:07,604
Gunman runs into Scotch Street.

725
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:10,475
Gunman fires
at Policewoman Gilday.

726
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:12,772
Gunman flees into antique shop.

727
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:15,863
Gunman robs fish shop
with Thompson submachine gun.

728
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:19,324
Constable Gilday sees suspect
with small pistol.

729
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:22,320
Plus suspect is carrying
a bottle of wine and a pound of cod.

730
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:25,198
Do you think he stopped off
at the wine shop

731
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:27,450
for a nice Beaujolais and
left his Thompson on the counter?

732
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:30,582
This is your small pistol?

733
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:34,127
The perpetrator fired out that door
with a Thompson.

734
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:35,715
Our robber is in there.

735
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,505
My case, my crime scene.

736
00:36:38,752 --> 00:36:40,470
You can await my instructions.

737
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:44,846
What is she doing here?

738
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:46,184
She was watching the store for me.

739
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:47,393
Oh, yeah? Is that all she was
watching for you?

740
00:36:47,386 --> 00:36:48,558
- What do you mean?
- You're a big man

741
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:49,896
with the ladies, eh, aren't you?

742
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:52,641
Hey.

743
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:54,484
Okay, pick him up.
Pick him up.

744
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:56,649
No, not you.
You, you pick him up.

745
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:58,318
Yes, you.
You're gonna learn

746
00:36:58,313 --> 00:36:59,530
a thing or two about children.
Pick him up.

747
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:00,649
- What?
- Pick him up.

748
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:01,821
All right.

749
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,197
Ah, Jesus.

750
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:09,450
He's--He's shit,

751
00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:12,248
and I don't have any nappies.

752
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:14,750
I'll find something.

753
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:17,625
Uh, wait. Over here.

754
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:19,668
- Here. Here.
- Um...

755
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:21,545
Oh, my.

756
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:23,889
No, you can't use that.
That's handmade Irish linen.

757
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,848
See, what did I tell you?
He doesn't give a shit about children.

758
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:27,718
That's not true.
You know, that feels like sandpaper.

759
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:28,765
Leave the door open so I can see.

760
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,808
No, see, he spun round.
Know what I mean?

761
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:32,522
He knocked the gun
right out of her hand.

762
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:34,437
Know what I mean?
He was very smooth.

763
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:37,562
I saw Matt Damon do
the same thing in Bourne 3.

764
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:39,313
And in 2. And in 1.

765
00:37:39,313 --> 00:37:40,485
Well, it was very smooth.

766
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,073
He looked
very professional to me.

767
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:44,067
And then he, uh--
he ran into the shop.

768
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,614
No. Now, the next thing
that happened

769
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,862
was there was a big roaring.

770
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:49,869
He must have got in that shop,

771
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:51,833
lifted the gun,
and fired it in a split-second.

772
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:53,202
Very, very professional.

773
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:54,703
Well, what do you
know about him?

774
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:55,704
Well, he's a Yank.

775
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,502
His name is Joe,
Joe Maguire.

776
00:37:57,497 --> 00:37:59,340
He's a cousin of the owner,
Peter Maguire.

777
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,176
Now, them Maguires,
they're from Peter's Hill.

778
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,920
45 years,
they've been in that shop.

779
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:05,468
But what can you tell us
about this Joe Maguire?

780
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:07,887
He showed up
a lot of weeks ago.

781
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:09,260
Not very talkative.

782
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:10,977
Keeps himself to himself.
Know what I mean?

783
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:13,973
Is Peter in there with him?

784
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,225
No, no, no.
Peter's in Africa at the moment.

785
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:19,444
Actually he's over there building
one of them concern schools.

786
00:38:19,436 --> 00:38:21,734
Uh, it's actually in Malawi.

787
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,027
Or is it Rwanda?

788
00:38:23,023 --> 00:38:24,946
Any one of them places
needs a school.

789
00:38:24,941 --> 00:38:26,693
He's very good with his hands, Peter.
Know what I mean?

790
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:28,661
Okay, thanks. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

791
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:29,654
No worries.

792
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:30,655
- We appreciate it.
- Right.

793
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:34,039
Jesus Christ.

794
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:36,955
Tell headquarters
to get on with the FBI

795
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:40,208
and give us all they have
on this Joe Maguire.

796
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:43,428
Have them check
into the Maguire family as well.

797
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:45,592
What's a concern school?

798
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:47,431
Fucked if I know.

799
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:48,970
It's a Catholic thing, you know.

800
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:50,968
Always concerned
about something.

801
00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:52,686
Uh, I forgot to mention
the young lad.

802
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:53,930
What young lad?

803
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,807
I saw a young lad
getting into the shop,

804
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:57,980
pushing a pram.
No, he was walking up and down,

805
00:38:57,975 --> 00:39:00,103
I'd say, before,
you know, with the pram,

806
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:02,276
trying to get the child to sleep,
I suppose.

807
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:03,523
And he goes into the shop.

808
00:39:03,523 --> 00:39:04,900
Then the Yank Maguire goes in,

809
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:06,822
and then--whuh--started.
Know what I mean?

810
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:09,037
Very professional.

811
00:39:13,825 --> 00:39:14,826
Boss.

812
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:18,458
I'm sorry, Douglas.

813
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:24,382
I'm not supposed to be
involved in that place, Ma.

814
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:25,879
I was there to get your cut.

815
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:29,052
I hid it from him.

816
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:32,009
Didn't recognize
his voice or anything?

817
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,262
No, Douglas.
He was wearing a balaclava.

818
00:39:34,262 --> 00:39:36,105
He put on a bit of an accent.

819
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:38,350
He nearly shit when he saw me.

820
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:41,569
But I warned him. I told him
not to take the brown bag.

821
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:43,108
I told him he would die.

822
00:39:53,906 --> 00:39:55,874
What did you tell the cops, Ma?

823
00:39:56,826 --> 00:39:58,703
I told them nothing, son.

824
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:07,136
You never, ever told anybody
what was in that bag,

825
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:08,801
did you, Ma?

826
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:09,797
No, son.

827
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:11,424
I swear.

828
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:15,811
Are you sure about that, Ma?

829
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:16,804
Yes, son.

830
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:18,181
I'm sure.

831
00:40:23,644 --> 00:40:25,442
I have to get that bag back.

832
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:27,782
- What's in it, M.D.?
- What's in it?

833
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:32,287
Trouble. Big trouble.

834
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,662
Let's give him a ring.

835
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:41,538
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

836
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,457
Answer it.

837
00:40:44,457 --> 00:40:45,800
- Okay. Okay.
- Answer it.

838
00:40:47,627 --> 00:40:49,300
Hello.

839
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:50,888
Is this Joe Maguire?

840
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,223
Yeah. Who's this?

841
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:54,309
Detective Inspector Weller.

842
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:56,678
All right, Joe.

843
00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:58,429
What's this all about?

844
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:01,774
Noth--Nothing.

845
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:03,643
Nothing.

846
00:41:03,643 --> 00:41:07,022
You could do nothing
just as well out here.

847
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:08,490
Why don't you come on out, eh?

848
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,905
Throw out the gun.
Come out with your hands up.

849
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:14,201
No.

850
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:16,699
What is it you want, Joe?
Hmm?

851
00:41:16,698 --> 00:41:19,497
- Uh...
- Just tell me what you want,

852
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:22,463
and we'll--we'll see
what we can work out.

853
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:25,503
All you have to do
is lift the phone--

854
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:27,843
What do you want?

855
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,882
Give me a minute.

856
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:30,879
Uh...

857
00:41:32,047 --> 00:41:34,095
Wait a minute.

858
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,059
Why was he asking
you what you wanted?

859
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:38,053
- What was all that shooting about

860
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:39,270
when you came running in here?

861
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,355
Were the police chasing you?

862
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,735
- Something's not right here.
- You--

863
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:47,900
Okay, you say exactly what I write.

864
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:49,068
- You hear me?
- All right, I--

865
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:50,407
- Okay.
- I swear to God

866
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:51,821
I'm gonna shoot someone.

867
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:53,615
- They're gonna ask you what you want.
- No.

868
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,863
No, I think they're
gonna ask you what you want.

869
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:57,409
Please, answer the phone.

870
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:02,962
Okay, um,
tell them you want a plane.

871
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,671
Very original. Where to?

872
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:06,586
Never you mind where to.

873
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:08,050
I'll figure that out in a minute.

874
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:11,128
- Hello.
- What happened, Maguire?

875
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:16,512
I was angry.

876
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:18,636
Angry at what?

877
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:23,978
- Me.
- You're angry at yourself? Hmm.

878
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,976
Hello?

879
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,193
Not you. The cops.

880
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:28,732
You're angry at the cops.

881
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:29,901
Hello? Hello?

882
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:31,364
What the...

883
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:32,903
Listen,
this thing has a hair trigger.

884
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:34,572
One good sneeze,
and it'll blow your head off.

885
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:35,911
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

886
00:42:35,902 --> 00:42:37,654
Don't be making me mad.

887
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:39,122
Jesus Christ.

888
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,332
All right.

889
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,292
I'm back.

890
00:42:43,285 --> 00:42:45,538
Don't get angry again, Joe.

891
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:47,210
We want a plane.

892
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:48,832
"We"?

893
00:42:52,377 --> 00:42:53,754
Who's "we"?

894
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:57,516
Uh, there's six of us,
and we're all armed,

895
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:59,680
so don't even think
about coming in here.

896
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:04,106
Well, boss?

897
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:05,724
He says there's six of 'em in there,
and they're all armed.

898
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:07,692
Six of them?

899
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:09,027
Oh, boy.

900
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:12,773
What do you really want?

901
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:14,150
Never you mind.

902
00:43:14,149 --> 00:43:15,571
He wants me.

903
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:16,944
How do you know?

904
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:18,820
Because that woman
would go to the ends

905
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,037
of the Earth to get me.

906
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,078
She's nuts.

907
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,202
Aah! Jesus!

908
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,328
Please don't shoot us, mister.

909
00:43:26,328 --> 00:43:28,547
Please, mister. Please.

910
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:30,211
What was that?

911
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,299
What are you two
doing in there?

912
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,047
We were sleeping. I swear.

913
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,015
I get it.

914
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,600
It's a Trojan horse.

915
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:41,764
No, mister. It's not a horse.

916
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,139
This is me dds couch, honest.

917
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:45,606
Get the two of them
out of there.

918
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:47,191
Get out, quickly.

919
00:43:47,183 --> 00:43:48,184
- Come here.
- Get out.

920
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:49,652
You're hiding in there,

921
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:51,237
and you wait until I close
so you can rob the place.

922
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:54,358
No, mister, I swear.
We was watching TV and fell asleep.

923
00:43:54,357 --> 00:43:56,109
Me da must have gone
and sold the couch.

924
00:43:56,109 --> 00:43:57,235
We're going home, mister.

925
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:58,407
Yeah, me ma
will have the tea made.

926
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,952
Jesus Christ, shut up.
Sit down, the pair of you.

927
00:44:00,947 --> 00:44:02,073
You're not going anywhere.

928
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,245
Go. Sit down.

929
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,993
Answer that.

930
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:07,544
- What?
- Is anybody hurt in there?

931
00:44:07,537 --> 00:44:10,086
No, it's nothing.
It was just an accident.

932
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,630
Repeat. Shots fired
in Scotch Street.

933
00:44:13,626 --> 00:44:16,675
What we have here is
a failure to communicate.

934
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:22,719
Cool Hand Luke.

935
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:23,720
Paul Newman.

936
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,899
It's only one of the best films
ever made.

937
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:38,656
Give us a look
at your gun, mister.

938
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:43,206
What?

939
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:45,575
Shut up, and sit down.

940
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:47,327
Ah, go on.
Just give us a look at the gun.

941
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:48,748
Get back in that settee.

942
00:44:48,745 --> 00:44:50,042
- Go!
- No!

943
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:52,335
Hey, I'll take your legs
at the knees

944
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:53,674
if you don't sit down now.

945
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,215
Now be quiet, or I'll put
the Curse of the Umgazi on you,

946
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,258
and your teeth will fall out.

947
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,553
So what's our next move, boss?

948
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,677
Give them time to get
tired and hungry.

949
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:05,223
Then we'll see where we're at.

950
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:06,846
Are you hungry, boss?

951
00:45:06,846 --> 00:45:09,520
I could eat a horse
between two mattresses.

952
00:45:09,515 --> 00:45:10,516
Come on.

953
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,028
- Two fish suppers, please.
- Yes, love.

954
00:45:20,693 --> 00:45:22,036
Fish and chips,

955
00:45:22,028 --> 00:45:23,871
greatest food known to man.

956
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:28,660
I mean, you got your protein,

957
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:32,630
your carbohydrates,
your omega-3 oils,

958
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:34,249
your sodium,

959
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:37,092
and all for £3.50, eh?

960
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:40,179
Plus you get to catch up
on yesterday's news.

961
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,924
Heh heh.
Now, where else in the world

962
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:44,392
would you get a bargain like that?

963
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:47,971
Expect heavy traffic buildup.

964
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,972
We require ambulance
and fire service.

965
00:45:53,976 --> 00:45:55,944
What the fuck is this?

966
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:02,701
And stand by, Sergeant.

967
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:07,577
Covering.

968
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:11,832
Who's the OSC?

969
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:13,080
OSC?

970
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,298
On-site commander.

971
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:18,214
Well, th-that's me.

972
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,427
And you are?

973
00:46:19,419 --> 00:46:21,763
Captain Thomas Farnsworth, SAS.

974
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:24,929
And what are you doing here,
Captain Farnsworth, SAS?

975
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:27,223
I didn't catch your name or position.

976
00:46:28,303 --> 00:46:29,725
I'm Detective Inspector Weller,

977
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:31,314
and I'm standing in front of you.

978
00:46:31,306 --> 00:46:32,728
What are you doing here?

979
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:34,692
I'm here to assist.

980
00:46:34,685 --> 00:46:37,234
Nobody requested the SAS.

981
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:40,153
We have direct orders
from the Ministry of Defence.

982
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,820
The war here is over.

983
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,663
Did nobody tell you?

984
00:46:46,655 --> 00:46:48,282
Those days are gone.

985
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:51,748
But I know what this is about.

986
00:46:53,495 --> 00:46:55,168
Yous are bored, aren't yous?

987
00:46:55,163 --> 00:46:56,756
Excuse me?

988
00:46:56,748 --> 00:46:59,217
Ah, you're stuck in your barracks,
nothing to do.

989
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:01,553
You have the smell of action,
and here you are.

990
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:03,923
Well, you can fuck off
back to Kabul

991
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:06,050
or Baghdad
or wherever you came from.

992
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:07,767
There's nothing for you here.

993
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:10,763
Very well. I'll pass your message
to the Home Secretary.

994
00:47:12,472 --> 00:47:15,316
I don't care if you
inform the Queen herself.

995
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:17,107
There's nothing for you here.

996
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:19,446
Now get back in that van of yours,
and clear off.

997
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:20,735
I have work to do.

998
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,237
Civilians.

999
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:24,951
Move it out, lads.

1000
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:25,990
Excuse us.
Excuse us.

1001
00:47:25,986 --> 00:47:27,738
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Excuse us.

1002
00:47:27,738 --> 00:47:28,910
Sorry. Sorry.

1003
00:47:34,578 --> 00:47:36,706
Jesus, lads.
We're in big trouble now.

1004
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:40,384
What am I going
to tell your mother?

1005
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:43,049
This just came
through via e-mail...

1006
00:47:43,045 --> 00:47:44,718
from the FBI.

1007
00:47:44,713 --> 00:47:49,890
What we have here is
a Mr. Joseph Maguire of South Boston,

1008
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:51,762
an antique supplier.

1009
00:47:51,762 --> 00:47:55,983
"You'll notice that Mr. Maguire
is married to a Tracey Barrett,

1010
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,851
"daughter of James Barrett,

1011
00:47:57,851 --> 00:47:59,728
"better known as Whitey B.,

1012
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:02,277
head of the South Boston
Irish mafia."

1013
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:03,990
Heh.

1014
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:05,359
"Mr. Maguire, it appears,

1015
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,987
"is in bad favor
at the moment with Whitey,

1016
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:10,239
"who has a hit out
on his son-in-law

1017
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:12,491
for 100,000 to whack him."

1018
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:14,960
That doesn't get out,
by the way,

1019
00:48:14,952 --> 00:48:17,375
in case one of your lads decides
to take up the offer.

1020
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:21,588
Answer it.

1021
00:48:22,626 --> 00:48:23,627
Hello.

1022
00:48:23,627 --> 00:48:24,970
You missing Boston, Joe?

1023
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:28,299
Missing the wife?

1024
00:48:28,298 --> 00:48:29,766
What?

1025
00:48:29,758 --> 00:48:30,884
Come on.
I know everything now.

1026
00:48:33,845 --> 00:48:35,973
You have a price on your head,
you come over to hide.

1027
00:48:35,973 --> 00:48:37,270
You run out of money.

1028
00:48:37,265 --> 00:48:38,983
You go back
to your robbing ways.

1029
00:48:38,976 --> 00:48:40,819
The game's up, Joe.

1030
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:43,234
Come on. Surrender now.
We can work all this out.

1031
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,948
- Mister.
Shh!

1032
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,032
- We been kidnapped!
- Shh! Wait, boys.

1033
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:48,819
- Who's that?
- Shh! Shh!

1034
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,202
You're married?

1035
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:56,623
Uh...

1036
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:58,041
You see?

1037
00:48:58,037 --> 00:49:00,540
- Look--
- He's a liar.

1038
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,258
You no-good bastard!

1039
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,173
For God's sake,
Mary Ellen, don't!

1040
00:49:04,168 --> 00:49:06,216
Run, lads!
Lads, for God's sake, run.

1041
00:49:06,212 --> 00:49:08,761
I'll fucking kill yous all!

1042
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:17,019
I'm sorry, Mary Ellen.
It was a mistake.

1043
00:49:17,015 --> 00:49:19,859
My kids are being
held hostage!

1044
00:49:19,851 --> 00:49:23,071
Help! Mister!
We've been kidnapped!

1045
00:49:23,062 --> 00:49:25,030
Shh!

1046
00:49:26,524 --> 00:49:28,071
Oh, Jesus.

1047
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:29,740
Two boys,
a woman with an accent,

1048
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:31,534
a Belfast man and a baby.

1049
00:49:31,529 --> 00:49:35,375
Makes it slightly more difficult
if we need to take Maguire out.

1050
00:49:35,366 --> 00:49:37,414
What the fuck are
you talking a--

1051
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:40,045
Why are you still here?

1052
00:49:40,038 --> 00:49:42,632
Hi. James Buckley,

1053
00:49:42,623 --> 00:49:43,920
Ministry of Defence.

1054
00:49:46,836 --> 00:49:48,588
What can I do for you, James?

1055
00:49:48,588 --> 00:49:51,762
Listen.
Uh, you're to deploy the SAS team.

1056
00:49:51,758 --> 00:49:54,307
Why? This is a police operation.

1057
00:49:54,302 --> 00:49:57,397
I know, but it's direct orders
from the Prime Minister's office.

1058
00:49:57,388 --> 00:49:59,436
This suspect, Maguire,
he's Catholic, isn't he?

1059
00:49:59,432 --> 00:50:00,729
I have no idea.

1060
00:50:00,725 --> 00:50:03,854
Well, we can't have the Police Service
of Northern Ireland shooting him.

1061
00:50:03,853 --> 00:50:05,776
It's terrible
for community relations.

1062
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:07,069
Well, what if he's a Protestant?

1063
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:08,908
Same difference.

1064
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,902
It's not in keeping
with the PSNI's new image.

1065
00:50:10,902 --> 00:50:12,370
And how about
if he's an American?

1066
00:50:12,361 --> 00:50:13,988
What?

1067
00:50:13,988 --> 00:50:17,709
The suspect has connections
with the mafia in America.

1068
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,701
He's American?

1069
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:19,702
- Yes.
- Okay.

1070
00:50:19,702 --> 00:50:22,080
Under no circumstances,
even if he comes out with guns blazing,

1071
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,378
are any of your men
to shoot an American.

1072
00:50:24,373 --> 00:50:26,046
Countries have
been bombed for less.

1073
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:28,511
Holy moley.
Can you imagine the paperwork?

1074
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:31,302
I've been on the force
for over 30 years,

1075
00:50:31,297 --> 00:50:34,016
and I've never yet
fired a shot in anger.

1076
00:50:34,008 --> 00:50:35,760
I'm hardly likely to start now.

1077
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,012
That's what I like to hear.

1078
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:38,558
However, if it does get messy,

1079
00:50:38,554 --> 00:50:40,682
then the bad boys take over.

1080
00:50:40,681 --> 00:50:42,934
And, by the way,

1081
00:50:42,934 --> 00:50:44,777
can you include
Captain Farnsworth

1082
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:46,521
in all decision-making processes?

1083
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:49,115
It's just he gets a bit sad
if he's left out.

1084
00:50:49,107 --> 00:50:50,199
Good man.

1085
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:52,410
I'll make sure there's a Queen's Medal
in this for you.

1086
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,118
Calm down, Mrs. Jones.

1087
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:58,162
We're gonna take care of this.

1088
00:50:58,157 --> 00:50:59,625
We've no need for this.

1089
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:03,087
There, now. Come on.

1090
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:04,296
Careful, lads.
Keep your heads down.

1091
00:51:04,288 --> 00:51:06,256
You know they're good boys.

1092
00:51:06,249 --> 00:51:09,924
It's just that useless gob shite
of a da of theirs.

1093
00:51:09,919 --> 00:51:12,388
Very good boys, they are.

1094
00:51:14,924 --> 00:51:17,018
I will kill you two.

1095
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:19,103
Go on. I dare you.

1096
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:21,314
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

1097
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:26,148
Yeah. Why don't you tell us
about your family in America?

1098
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:27,191
Why don't you tell her?

1099
00:51:27,186 --> 00:51:29,030
You're the one that's here
to do the dirty work.

1100
00:51:29,022 --> 00:51:30,774
What are you talking about,
"dirty work"?

1101
00:51:30,774 --> 00:51:32,117
You're a cheating,
no-good scumbug.

1102
00:51:32,109 --> 00:51:33,577
- I ought to kill you now.
- What are you--

1103
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:34,570
You have no idea, do you?

1104
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,789
Hey, calm down.
What are you talking about?

1105
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,123
You know what I'm talking about.

1106
00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:39,788
- I don't.
- My mum,

1107
00:51:39,783 --> 00:51:41,785
that's what I'm talking about.

1108
00:51:41,785 --> 00:51:43,503
What about your mom?

1109
00:51:43,495 --> 00:51:44,838
Don't tell me
you don't remember.

1110
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,127
Jesus Christ.

1111
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:47,124
You'll be the same,

1112
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:48,376
used and abandoned.

1113
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:51,178
Who--
Who is your mom?

1114
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,343
Phyllis. Phyllis Regan.

1115
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:55,557
Phyllis Regan.
I don't know her.

1116
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:57,222
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

1117
00:51:57,217 --> 00:51:58,434
Yes, you do.

1118
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,102
Is that you and her...

1119
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,601
when yous were together?

1120
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:09,029
Ph-Ph--Um...

1121
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:10,113
Okay. Phyllis. Okay.

1122
00:52:10,105 --> 00:52:11,106
Yeah, fine. It's Phyllis.

1123
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:12,198
You remember that photograph?

1124
00:52:12,191 --> 00:52:13,818
Yeah, I do.
It was at the beach.

1125
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:16,365
What beach?

1126
00:52:16,361 --> 00:52:18,659
The--At the big...

1127
00:52:20,157 --> 00:52:22,455
Coney Island?

1128
00:52:22,451 --> 00:52:24,749
You don't remember
the most famous beach in the world?

1129
00:52:27,915 --> 00:52:29,167
You don't even remember?

1130
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:32,965
- Right. Get into the toilet.
- Hey, hey.

1131
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:34,463
Move. Get into the toilet

1132
00:52:34,463 --> 00:52:36,056
till I figure out
what to do, because--

1133
00:52:36,048 --> 00:52:37,425
- Just get into the toilet!
- All right!

1134
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:38,846
Boys, come, come, come.

1135
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:42,312
Hey, into the toilet,
all of yous. Go.

1136
00:52:42,304 --> 00:52:44,306
Mister, I need to go to the toilet.

1137
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:45,649
You're going into the toilet.

1138
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:46,733
But I need to go on me own.

1139
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:48,272
Please, me first, mister.

1140
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:49,315
I said it first.

1141
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:50,654
Okay, right.
You go, quick.

1142
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:51,863
Hurry up.

1143
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:57,786
The standoff continues,

1144
00:52:57,778 --> 00:52:59,246
with police sources confirming

1145
00:52:59,238 --> 00:53:03,243
that the siege is related
to the earlier fish market robbery.

1146
00:53:03,242 --> 00:53:04,414
The PSNI...

1147
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:06,286
We pulled off a big one
today, lads.

1148
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:09,210
Big operation.
Great driver.

1149
00:53:19,091 --> 00:53:20,684
Ah, you took a shite.

1150
00:53:20,676 --> 00:53:22,929
Why'd you not let me
go first, then?

1151
00:53:22,928 --> 00:53:24,020
Get in there.

1152
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:25,434
I'm gonna take a shite,
too, then.

1153
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:45,120
Can we talk about this?

1154
00:53:45,117 --> 00:53:46,460
No, we can't. Get in there.

1155
00:53:46,451 --> 00:53:49,250
I need time to think. Go.

1156
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,642
Do you remember his mother?

1157
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:04,808
Yes, I remember Phyllis.

1158
00:54:04,804 --> 00:54:05,930
Um...

1159
00:54:08,474 --> 00:54:10,647
My father owned a bar
in the eighties.

1160
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:13,522
She came over from Belfast
to work as a cocktail waitress,

1161
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:15,523
and we dated for a few weeks.

1162
00:54:15,523 --> 00:54:19,448
We had a summer fling,
and she went back to Ireland,

1163
00:54:19,444 --> 00:54:21,492
and that was that.

1164
00:54:21,487 --> 00:54:23,455
Mister, have you got
any cigarettes?

1165
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:24,950
- Hey!
- What?

1166
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:26,166
Sit down.

1167
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:28,002
We're sorry, missis.

1168
00:54:27,994 --> 00:54:29,917
Jesus.

1169
00:54:29,912 --> 00:54:33,041
That's why he's been stalking me.

1170
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,965
Heh. I thought
Whitey had sent him.

1171
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,382
Who is Whitey?

1172
00:54:37,378 --> 00:54:39,927
Whitey Barrett is the head

1173
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:41,924
of the Irish mafia in Boston.

1174
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:44,268
Yeah, he has a daughter
named Tracey,

1175
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,513
who I'm married to.
Well...

1176
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:50,608
I'm not.
I am trying to get a divorce,

1177
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,273
and look at this.

1178
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:55,112
She took a knife.

1179
00:54:55,104 --> 00:54:59,325
She stabbed me in the arm
while I was asleep.

1180
00:54:59,317 --> 00:55:00,910
Then she goes to her daddy,

1181
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:02,654
and he sends
a hit man after me.

1182
00:55:03,488 --> 00:55:05,206
I had to get out of there.

1183
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:10,249
Boys!

1184
00:55:12,372 --> 00:55:15,125
Anyway, I came here to hide,

1185
00:55:15,124 --> 00:55:17,923
and then I see
this kid stalking me,

1186
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:19,887
and that's why I had a gun.

1187
00:55:19,879 --> 00:55:21,176
What gun?

1188
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:22,264
The gun. I had a--

1189
00:55:22,256 --> 00:55:23,803
The one that
the policewoman saw.

1190
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,393
- Policewoman?
- The--

1191
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:28,480
Oh, my God.
This is such a mess.

1192
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:31,896
You know,
he thinks you are his father.

1193
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:36,154
Man, I guess I could be.

1194
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,323
Scaling. Go. Go.

1195
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:32,001
We're in position.

1196
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:34,496
Very good. Keep 'em there
until I say otherwise.

1197
00:56:34,495 --> 00:56:35,997
- You in there!
- Very well.

1198
00:56:35,997 --> 00:56:37,840
- Let me through!
- Hey, watch it, will you?

1199
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:39,834
Don't you touch me!

1200
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:42,054
- Where the hell are they?
- Who are you?

1201
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:43,422
- Hold on there, missis.
- Hey, you.

1202
00:56:43,422 --> 00:56:44,639
Are you in charge here?

1203
00:56:44,631 --> 00:56:46,053
Just calm down. Step back.

1204
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:47,096
Who is that woman?

1205
00:56:47,092 --> 00:56:49,094
I want my children now.

1206
00:56:54,183 --> 00:56:56,106
You, get out here.

1207
00:56:56,101 --> 00:56:58,320
We have to go home, mister.
Me ma will kill us.

1208
00:56:58,312 --> 00:56:59,564
Shut up, and stay in there.

1209
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:01,190
Please, don't do anything foolish.

1210
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,487
- All right.
- Okay, now. Shh.

1211
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:05,327
Sit down,
or I'll bring those Umgazi.

1212
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:07,162
What's the Umgazi, missis?

1213
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:09,498
They are fierce,
dark, crazy spirits.

1214
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,743
They take children
in the night to the swamp.

1215
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:12,834
Okay, now sit down.

1216
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:14,578
Be quiet, or the Umgazi.

1217
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,674
So how's your mom?

1218
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:23,886
Say her name.

1219
00:57:23,879 --> 00:57:25,176
Phyllis.

1220
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:26,970
How is Phyllis?

1221
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:28,967
She died four years ago
of breast cancer.

1222
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:32,472
Oh. I'm sorry.

1223
00:57:38,977 --> 00:57:40,820
Look, I don't know your name.

1224
00:57:40,812 --> 00:57:42,735
It's Jim.

1225
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:44,028
Look, Jim,

1226
00:57:44,024 --> 00:57:46,527
- this was a long time--
- What's better,

1227
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:48,370
that your father
can't remember your mother

1228
00:57:49,196 --> 00:57:51,369
or that he decided
to pretend she doesn't exist?

1229
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:52,787
Which would you prefer?

1230
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:54,626
I'm truly sorry, Jim.

1231
00:57:54,618 --> 00:57:56,712
And what about
all the letters you wrote?

1232
00:57:56,703 --> 00:57:58,000
Were they all lies?

1233
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:59,418
What letters?

1234
00:57:59,414 --> 00:58:01,337
The letters from California,

1235
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,961
when you were a stunt man
on Raiders of the Lost Ark,

1236
00:58:03,961 --> 00:58:05,963
when you were working
on the oil rigs in Texas.

1237
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:07,306
She read them all to me.

1238
00:58:10,634 --> 00:58:12,807
Why did you stop writing?

1239
00:58:12,803 --> 00:58:13,804
I swear to God

1240
00:58:13,804 --> 00:58:16,808
I never wrote any letters.

1241
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:20,148
Your mom and I--
Phyllis...

1242
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:24,691
we were together
for a couple of weeks,

1243
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,284
and then she left,

1244
00:58:27,276 --> 00:58:29,244
and I never saw her again.

1245
00:58:29,236 --> 00:58:30,488
We were kids.

1246
00:58:32,364 --> 00:58:33,741
Uh...

1247
00:58:38,203 --> 00:58:40,626
What are you saying to me,
that she made all that up?

1248
00:58:40,622 --> 00:58:41,839
I-I...

1249
00:58:45,586 --> 00:58:46,587
Bollocks.

1250
00:58:46,587 --> 00:58:48,134
Jim, I...

1251
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,677
Bollocks.

1252
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:51,596
You're doing my head in.

1253
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:53,094
Go easy. Calm down.

1254
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:56,434
- Jim--
- Shut up.

1255
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,773
I-I...

1256
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:02,941
Look, Jim, I--I truly
do believe that--

1257
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:03,983
- Shut up.
- I do believe...

1258
00:59:03,979 --> 00:59:05,105
Shut fucking up!

1259
00:59:05,105 --> 00:59:06,402
Get down.

1260
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:07,570
- Get down on the ground.
- Don't do this.

1261
00:59:07,566 --> 00:59:09,239
Get down!

1262
00:59:09,234 --> 00:59:11,612
- Get down on the ground.
- Calm down.

1263
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,282
I can't handle this.

1264
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:17,581
It's no good. I'm sorry.

1265
00:59:22,665 --> 00:59:24,087
I'm sorry.

1266
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:28,964
Hmm.

1267
00:59:30,715 --> 00:59:32,308
Oh, my God.
Don't do that. No.

1268
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,847
Sorry. Stay away from me.

1269
00:59:33,843 --> 00:59:35,686
- Son, listen to me. Don't do that.
- Let me be.

1270
00:59:35,678 --> 00:59:37,806
Please, it's not worth it.
Don't. Just put that down.

1271
00:59:37,805 --> 00:59:39,478
It's all right.
Think of your son.

1272
00:59:40,308 --> 00:59:42,185
Whatever it is,
we can work it out.

1273
00:59:42,185 --> 00:59:43,903
Please! Help!

1274
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:45,943
I swear. I'll fix it.

1275
00:59:45,938 --> 00:59:48,987
Help! Help this child!
He'll die! He's stuck!

1276
00:59:48,983 --> 00:59:50,826
- What?
- What?

1277
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:53,071
Come on! Come on!

1278
00:59:53,071 --> 00:59:54,072
What's wrong?

1279
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:57,329
He's choking.

1280
00:59:57,325 --> 00:59:58,827
- What the...
- Help!

1281
00:59:58,826 --> 01:00:01,750
Missis! Them Umgazis
are gonna kill me!

1282
01:00:01,746 --> 01:00:03,840
Help! Help!

1283
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,549
Get away from me!

1284
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:07,134
- Get away!
- I m trying to help you.

1285
01:00:07,126 --> 01:00:08,969
Missis, them Umgazi,
they're gonna...

1286
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:11,305
Sir, it appears his head's stuck
between the bars.

1287
01:00:11,297 --> 01:00:14,267
Is he trying to escape,
or is he spying for the Yank?

1288
01:00:14,258 --> 01:00:16,260
Soap.
Quick, quick, quick.

1289
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,058
Get away!

1290
01:00:18,054 --> 01:00:19,055
Here. Put this--

1291
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:20,477
- What is that?
- Never mind.

1292
01:00:20,473 --> 01:00:21,975
There's an adult male,

1293
01:00:21,974 --> 01:00:23,692
appears to be
pulling him back now.

1294
01:00:25,269 --> 01:00:27,192
Gee.

1295
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:28,485
Ohh.

1296
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:30,028
Are you okay?

1297
01:00:32,777 --> 01:00:33,949
What was that?

1298
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:35,572
Soap.

1299
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,496
Hello.

1300
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:44,122
Listen, Maguire,

1301
01:00:44,122 --> 01:00:45,965
if you harm that child,

1302
01:00:45,957 --> 01:00:48,130
I will see to it that you rot in jail

1303
01:00:48,126 --> 01:00:50,128
for the rest of your life.
Do you hear me?

1304
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:51,721
I will call you back.

1305
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,681
What did you
see out there?

1306
01:00:53,673 --> 01:00:55,926
Shut up.
I'm trying to listen.

1307
01:00:55,925 --> 01:00:58,098
Just sit down, and behave.

1308
01:00:59,178 --> 01:01:00,725
We need to talk.

1309
01:01:11,149 --> 01:01:12,492
What are you doing here?

1310
01:01:12,483 --> 01:01:14,235
The children are my concern.

1311
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,749
And I suppose
they're not mine, eh?

1312
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:22,410
Why did you come here?

1313
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:23,457
She's their mother.

1314
01:01:23,453 --> 01:01:24,454
I thought she could help.

1315
01:01:24,454 --> 01:01:25,831
She's a madwoman.

1316
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,924
- I don't want a fucking coffee.
- Look at her.

1317
01:01:27,915 --> 01:01:29,292
I want my kids back.

1318
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:31,841
Don't suppose there's any chance
we'll get her out of here now.

1319
01:01:31,836 --> 01:01:33,133
I'll take care of her.

1320
01:01:33,129 --> 01:01:34,426
Don't worry.

1321
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:36,095
We won't be a problem.

1322
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:38,434
"We"? Oh, no, no, no.

1323
01:01:38,426 --> 01:01:39,723
You are out of here.

1324
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:41,471
This is way out of your league.

1325
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,103
What is my league, Daddy?

1326
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:47,189
You wanted me
to join the force,

1327
01:01:47,185 --> 01:01:50,064
but now I'm only good
for community relations and paperwork?

1328
01:01:51,523 --> 01:01:53,025
I want to be here.

1329
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:56,407
Please, for the first time
in your life,

1330
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:58,246
give me some respect.

1331
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,619
You think you can control
that woman without me?

1332
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:03,995
Go on ahead.

1333
01:02:03,994 --> 01:02:05,621
- ...to get off your arses...
- You go over

1334
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:06,998
- and talk to her.
- and get my kids back.

1335
01:02:06,997 --> 01:02:08,044
How long have we been here?

1336
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,838
How much time are we wasting?

1337
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:12,803
We don't know what's
happening in there. Please!

1338
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:13,796
You can stay.

1339
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,639
Just keep out of the way.

1340
01:02:16,715 --> 01:02:19,434
You came to the store
because you needed help.

1341
01:02:19,426 --> 01:02:22,270
You did what any son would do.

1342
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:23,263
You turned to your father.

1343
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:24,890
Now, I want to help you.

1344
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:26,563
But first you're gonna have
to put that thing down

1345
01:02:26,558 --> 01:02:28,481
before it goes off
and kills someone.

1346
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,034
Hey, guys,

1347
01:02:35,025 --> 01:02:36,368
knock it off.

1348
01:02:41,532 --> 01:02:42,533
Okay.

1349
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:43,955
So tell me everything.

1350
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:51,129
Last Christmas,
when Sean was born...

1351
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:56,676
I had no money, so I borrowed
some from Mad Dog Flynn.

1352
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,049
The gangster guy?

1353
01:02:58,966 --> 01:03:00,092
You know him?

1354
01:03:00,092 --> 01:03:01,719
We've met.

1355
01:03:01,718 --> 01:03:03,686
Trust me,
I know the type.

1356
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,726
Go on.

1357
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:09,772
I owe him a lot of money.

1358
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:19,571
They definitely said this American was
involved in the fish market robbery?

1359
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:21,117
That's what they
said on the news.

1360
01:03:22,614 --> 01:03:24,082
Who'd have thought it, eh?

1361
01:03:27,578 --> 01:03:32,254
It went from £500 to 2,000
in two months,

1362
01:03:32,249 --> 01:03:34,672
and that's when he gave me
an extra £1,000 in his casino

1363
01:03:34,668 --> 01:03:36,261
to win it back.

1364
01:03:36,253 --> 01:03:39,723
And I tried to win it back
by gambling...

1365
01:03:41,174 --> 01:03:43,097
and that didn't work.

1366
01:03:43,093 --> 01:03:46,267
Next thing, it's 5,000,
and he's...

1367
01:03:46,263 --> 01:03:48,982
saying he's gonna give me two days,
or he's gonna take Sean.

1368
01:03:48,974 --> 01:03:49,975
What?

1369
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:51,227
What?

1370
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:53,604
You cannot just go
and take a baby.

1371
01:03:53,604 --> 01:03:56,198
He can. Why do you think they
call him Mad Dog?

1372
01:03:56,189 --> 01:03:57,816
He's killed loads of people
during the Troubles.

1373
01:03:57,816 --> 01:03:59,068
He'd just take Sean off me,

1374
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:01,661
and if I tried to say anything to him,
he'd bury me.

1375
01:04:01,653 --> 01:04:03,075
Why didn't you
go to the police?

1376
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,369
Police have been trying to get Mad Dog
since I was a wee boy.

1377
01:04:05,365 --> 01:04:07,459
They can't touch him.

1378
01:04:08,702 --> 01:04:10,921
That's why I robbed the fish market,
to get the money back.

1379
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,962
All I got was this brown bag.

1380
01:04:13,957 --> 01:04:16,756
The tinker boys and
Maguire, we know about,

1381
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,301
but who's this mystery man
with the baby

1382
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:20,923
and the woman
with the accent?

1383
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,096
Boss, check this out.

1384
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,228
Mad Dog Flynn.

1385
01:04:29,223 --> 01:04:30,520
What's he doing here?

1386
01:04:30,516 --> 01:04:31,517
I don't know.

1387
01:04:32,894 --> 01:04:34,271
Jeez.

1388
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,817
All we need is Bono,

1389
01:04:35,813 --> 01:04:37,360
and we'd have
a fucking musical.

1390
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,987
£500, £600 at the most.

1391
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:43,829
Everybody uses
debit cards these days.

1392
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,240
What's this?

1393
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,241
I don't know.

1394
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,958
Hello.

1395
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:52,126
Passports.

1396
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:57,502
"Horace Generoux"
from Montreal.

1397
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:58,879
Horace Generoux, my arse.

1398
01:04:58,878 --> 01:05:00,676
That's Mad Dog Flynn.

1399
01:05:00,672 --> 01:05:01,844
That's what his ma
must have been talking about.

1400
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,341
This must be Mad Dog's bag.

1401
01:05:03,341 --> 01:05:05,059
He's a dual citizen apparently.

1402
01:05:05,885 --> 01:05:07,137
What's this?

1403
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,137
I don't know.

1404
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:11,767
Hang on a minute.

1405
01:05:11,766 --> 01:05:13,860
- What?
- Look...

1406
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:15,979
let's get a magnifying glass.

1407
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:18,030
There we go.

1408
01:05:24,195 --> 01:05:25,196
You see that?

1409
01:05:25,196 --> 01:05:26,448
That's Augustus.

1410
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:28,916
This is Roman Sestertius.

1411
01:05:28,908 --> 01:05:30,956
It's worth about 200 grand.

1412
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:36,170
That is a Penny Red.

1413
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,667
800 grand to start.

1414
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:38,884
Here, give us a look.

1415
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:40,674
No, no, no, no. Shh.

1416
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,013
I'm dead.

1417
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:43,552
No, you're not dead.

1418
01:05:43,548 --> 01:05:45,767
You let me
worry about Mad Dog.

1419
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:47,601
Right now,
all we gotta do is think about

1420
01:05:47,593 --> 01:05:49,015
how to get out of here safely.

1421
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:03,451
Have to get that bag back.

1422
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:05,535
How are you, M.D.?

1423
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,155
You saw all the cops
around there now.

1424
01:06:07,155 --> 01:06:08,407
Exactly.

1425
01:06:08,406 --> 01:06:09,658
My photo's in that bag,

1426
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:11,785
as well as a fortune
in stolen gear.

1427
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:13,457
How did that Yank
know about it?

1428
01:06:16,414 --> 01:06:18,508
You don't think my ma's
in on this, do you?

1429
01:06:18,499 --> 01:06:20,968
Jesus, Mad Dog, not your ma.

1430
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,553
I'll kill her if she is.

1431
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,889
No way, M.D.

1432
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:27,100
I hope the cops
don't shoot that Yank.

1433
01:06:27,091 --> 01:06:29,014
I want him tortured
when he goes to jail,

1434
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:30,933
to find out how he knew
about that bag.

1435
01:06:32,513 --> 01:06:34,481
Can't let the cops
get their hands on it.

1436
01:06:38,436 --> 01:06:39,562
Or else maybe...

1437
01:06:41,147 --> 01:06:42,444
Or else what?

1438
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,036
Blow the place up.

1439
01:06:47,028 --> 01:06:48,951
Burn it down.
Destroy the evidence.

1440
01:06:48,946 --> 01:06:50,289
Jesus Christ, M.D.

1441
01:06:50,281 --> 01:06:51,908
Half the cops in Belfast
are around it.

1442
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,537
This is the best place
for us now.

1443
01:06:56,537 --> 01:06:58,505
When are you
gonna get my boys?

1444
01:06:58,498 --> 01:07:00,546
They're all sitting
around on their arses.

1445
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,419
Don't worry, Mary Ellen.
Things are happening.

1446
01:07:03,629 --> 01:07:06,473
Can I get you a wee cup of tea
to soothe your nerves?

1447
01:07:06,465 --> 01:07:08,559
That'll be lovely, son.

1448
01:07:11,512 --> 01:07:13,606
You're awful good to me, son.

1449
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:17,355
I hope I can make you your tea.

1450
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:22,864
I'll be right back.

1451
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,953
Why don't you get off your arse?

1452
01:07:29,905 --> 01:07:32,249
This is your chance
to stand up to this thug.

1453
01:07:32,241 --> 01:07:34,494
I'm gonna get you out of this.

1454
01:07:35,327 --> 01:07:37,455
I don't know.

1455
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:39,502
You can bring this guy down.

1456
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:44,886
One of those big cranes.

1457
01:07:46,421 --> 01:07:48,799
Get a big petrol drum,
50 gallons.

1458
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,642
Swing it across.

1459
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:52,352
Drop it in the shop.

1460
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:54,221
Boom.

1461
01:07:54,221 --> 01:07:55,939
Is there a crane near there?

1462
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:57,854
I haven't seen one, Mad Dog.

1463
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,022
Have you not?

1464
01:08:01,228 --> 01:08:04,198
How 'bout we get
two big 5-gallon cans,

1465
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:05,816
strap them to you,

1466
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:07,238
give you some matches,

1467
01:08:07,234 --> 01:08:08,781
and you go in there?

1468
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,448
You up for that, Hatchet?

1469
01:08:13,448 --> 01:08:14,449
What about me?

1470
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,413
You're a fucking idiot.

1471
01:08:26,295 --> 01:08:27,842
Go and get Big Bertha.

1472
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:30,933
I thought we destroyed her
as part of the cease-fire.

1473
01:08:30,924 --> 01:08:32,517
Aye, we said we did.

1474
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:34,637
You think I'd destroy
a lovely lassie like that?

1475
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,691
This is where she is.

1476
01:08:41,977 --> 01:08:44,321
Sir, that's Maguire
calling for you.

1477
01:08:44,313 --> 01:08:46,566
Ah, tired and hungry.
Told you.

1478
01:08:49,818 --> 01:08:51,070
Hello there.

1479
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:52,070
We need to talk.

1480
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:54,323
Right. Go ahead.

1481
01:08:54,323 --> 01:08:55,666
We want no violence.

1482
01:08:55,657 --> 01:08:57,330
We end this thing peacefully.

1483
01:08:57,326 --> 01:08:58,498
I'm all for that.

1484
01:08:58,493 --> 01:09:01,087
Listen, why don't you, uh,

1485
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:03,753
send out the children
and the baby?

1486
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:06,218
You know, show of good faith.

1487
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:07,462
We're all coming out.

1488
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:09,930
You're all coming out?

1489
01:09:09,922 --> 01:09:11,549
Right now? Great.

1490
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:15,849
No. No, no, no.
We have, uh, a few preconditions first.

1491
01:09:15,844 --> 01:09:16,845
Like what?

1492
01:09:16,845 --> 01:09:18,893
I'll meet you out front.

1493
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:20,732
We do this face to face.

1494
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,444
All right.
I'm coming on my own.

1495
01:09:24,436 --> 01:09:25,437
All right.

1496
01:09:27,481 --> 01:09:28,903
Grab me a vest.

1497
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:30,947
Will do, boss.

1498
01:09:30,943 --> 01:09:32,411
All right, get the floodlights up.

1499
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:33,619
And you tell your men

1500
01:09:33,612 --> 01:09:34,784
that I'm going over there.

1501
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,032
Now, they can cover me,

1502
01:09:36,031 --> 01:09:39,662
but under no circumstances
are they to take aggressive action.

1503
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:41,871
Ah!

1504
01:09:41,871 --> 01:09:44,249
I've lost me fucking sneaker.

1505
01:09:44,249 --> 01:09:46,092
Told you you should
have brought some rope.

1506
01:09:46,084 --> 01:09:47,427
Hurry up.

1507
01:09:47,418 --> 01:09:48,965
All right.

1508
01:09:48,962 --> 01:09:51,056
Move it.

1509
01:09:51,047 --> 01:09:52,344
Boss.

1510
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,887
This woman says her husband

1511
01:09:53,883 --> 01:09:55,226
and her baby are missing.

1512
01:09:55,218 --> 01:09:57,516
Did he have the baby
in a pram?

1513
01:10:00,807 --> 01:10:02,059
Bet you I can.

1514
01:10:02,058 --> 01:10:03,184
You all right?

1515
01:10:04,143 --> 01:10:05,690
I need to pee.

1516
01:10:05,687 --> 01:10:07,360
Uh, well, go.

1517
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:10,984
You won't run away
and leave me?

1518
01:10:10,984 --> 01:10:12,327
God, no.

1519
01:10:14,946 --> 01:10:16,163
Go.

1520
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:19,371
You swear?

1521
01:10:19,367 --> 01:10:20,960
I swear.

1522
01:10:20,952 --> 01:10:22,750
You can leave that thing.

1523
01:10:22,745 --> 01:10:24,292
Just leave it.

1524
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:25,916
Let me see it.

1525
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:30,337
Okay.

1526
01:10:32,505 --> 01:10:34,303
Thanks.

1527
01:10:38,553 --> 01:10:40,351
Do you think he's your son?

1528
01:10:40,346 --> 01:10:42,849
Well, he sure has my bad luck.

1529
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,977
Wow.

1530
01:10:48,354 --> 01:10:52,109
Sophie, I am so sorry
for dragging you into all this.

1531
01:10:52,108 --> 01:10:53,451
It's not your fault.

1532
01:10:55,361 --> 01:10:57,113
Can you give me
another chance?

1533
01:10:58,323 --> 01:11:00,291
You can have your chance,
Joe Maguire.

1534
01:11:03,536 --> 01:11:06,005
Ooh! Ooh!

1535
01:11:05,997 --> 01:11:08,170
Hey! Umgazi.

1536
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,543
We're sorry, missis, honestly.

1537
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:12,091
I don't want to see
them Umgazis again.

1538
01:11:12,086 --> 01:11:13,178
Again?

1539
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:15,510
What do you mean, "again"?

1540
01:11:15,506 --> 01:11:18,476
I saw it, mister, I swear,
when me head was stuck.

1541
01:11:18,468 --> 01:11:19,560
They're out in the back.

1542
01:11:19,552 --> 01:11:22,226
Tell me everything
that you saw.

1543
01:11:22,221 --> 01:11:24,770
They were all black,
with a big mask

1544
01:11:24,766 --> 01:11:26,188
and wires coming
out of their heads

1545
01:11:26,184 --> 01:11:28,061
and guns, all sorts of guns.

1546
01:11:28,061 --> 01:11:29,563
They were scary, mister.

1547
01:11:29,562 --> 01:11:30,859
Uh...

1548
01:11:30,855 --> 01:11:32,152
come with me.

1549
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:34,947
Here. Sit down.

1550
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:35,943
You, too.

1551
01:11:37,445 --> 01:11:39,664
Stay here.

1552
01:11:40,698 --> 01:11:41,950
Jim, turn that light off.

1553
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:43,121
What's wrong?

1554
01:11:43,117 --> 01:11:44,369
There's snipers in the backyard.

1555
01:11:47,705 --> 01:11:48,752
Light 'em up.

1556
01:11:48,748 --> 01:11:50,250
What's happening, mister?

1557
01:11:50,249 --> 01:11:51,717
What are they doing?

1558
01:11:54,045 --> 01:11:55,763
6-8, position's up.

1559
01:12:03,513 --> 01:12:05,561
Maguire.

1560
01:12:09,018 --> 01:12:10,691
I'm coming out.

1561
01:12:23,242 --> 01:12:24,664
Well, Mr. Maguire,

1562
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,413
it's a fine pickle
you got yourself into.

1563
01:12:27,413 --> 01:12:28,790
This isn't what it looks like.

1564
01:12:28,789 --> 01:12:31,212
Oh, yeah? I'm all ears.

1565
01:12:35,379 --> 01:12:36,426
Here.

1566
01:12:37,714 --> 01:12:40,638
Ah, she's a beauty.

1567
01:12:40,634 --> 01:12:41,635
Here.

1568
01:12:43,137 --> 01:12:45,765
Be fuck-all left of that shop,
that's for sure.

1569
01:12:45,764 --> 01:12:46,811
Heh heh.

1570
01:12:46,807 --> 01:12:48,024
- Now you're talking.
- Right.

1571
01:12:48,016 --> 01:12:50,895
Let's get this show
on the road.

1572
01:12:50,894 --> 01:12:53,989
And, uh,
he runs inside my store.

1573
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:56,951
That's quite a yarn, very good.

1574
01:12:56,942 --> 01:13:00,947
All right, how about if I give you
something that you really want?

1575
01:13:00,946 --> 01:13:02,823
Like I said, I'm all ears.

1576
01:13:02,823 --> 01:13:04,621
Mad Dog Flynn.

1577
01:13:04,616 --> 01:13:06,459
Mad Dog Flynn?

1578
01:13:07,369 --> 01:13:08,416
He's taking too long.

1579
01:13:08,412 --> 01:13:09,504
Shh.

1580
01:13:09,496 --> 01:13:11,123
There's two fake passports.

1581
01:13:11,123 --> 01:13:14,502
There's rare coins,
very rare stamps.

1582
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:15,673
Is there a Penny Red?

1583
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:17,046
Yeah, in mint condition.

1584
01:13:17,045 --> 01:13:18,046
How did you know?

1585
01:13:18,046 --> 01:13:20,515
Big heist about a year ago
from a private collection.

1586
01:13:20,507 --> 01:13:22,225
Thought Mad Dog was behind it.

1587
01:13:22,217 --> 01:13:23,594
Now you got the evidence.

1588
01:13:23,594 --> 01:13:25,187
- It's not enough.
- I've got a witness.

1589
01:13:25,179 --> 01:13:26,977
Oh. yeah? Who?

1590
01:13:26,972 --> 01:13:29,395
The kid,
he'll testify against Mad Dog

1591
01:13:29,391 --> 01:13:33,362
for extortion, torture,
threatening to kidnap a baby.

1592
01:13:33,353 --> 01:13:34,400
He'll testify?

1593
01:13:34,396 --> 01:13:36,148
Yes, but you have to put him

1594
01:13:36,148 --> 01:13:38,242
and his family
in a witness protection program

1595
01:13:38,233 --> 01:13:39,530
somewhere abroad.

1596
01:13:39,526 --> 01:13:41,028
Look...

1597
01:13:41,028 --> 01:13:44,077
you get a major gangster
off the streets of Belfast,

1598
01:13:44,072 --> 01:13:47,997
and you resolve
a hostage situation peacefully.

1599
01:13:47,993 --> 01:13:49,415
- Get in.
- Quick, get in the back.

1600
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:50,412
- Get in.
- Here he comes.

1601
01:13:52,623 --> 01:13:53,795
What's happening?

1602
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,337
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Aye?

1603
01:13:55,334 --> 01:13:57,177
I can make a deal with him.

1604
01:13:57,169 --> 01:13:59,547
I'm gonna have to take
this little guy out with me now, okay?

1605
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:10,023
Attend your targets,
and hold your position.

1606
01:14:10,015 --> 01:14:12,188
Received. Over.

1607
01:14:12,184 --> 01:14:13,185
Hey.

1608
01:14:14,561 --> 01:14:15,904
What's going on?

1609
01:14:15,896 --> 01:14:17,273
Here he is.

1610
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:18,273
Very good.

1611
01:14:18,273 --> 01:14:19,820
That's a start.

1612
01:14:22,819 --> 01:14:25,288
Not much of a baby-sitter,
are you?

1613
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,702
Hey, you can't
come through there!

1614
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:28,416
Oi! Come back here!

1615
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:31,503
Where's my boys?!

1616
01:14:31,495 --> 01:14:32,872
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you--

1617
01:14:32,871 --> 01:14:35,215
- What the--
- Where are they?!

1618
01:14:35,207 --> 01:14:37,335
- Stop! Wait!
- Oh, fuck you.

1619
01:14:37,334 --> 01:14:38,711
- Come here, you.
- We're sorry, Ma.

1620
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,428
- Come here.
- I'm sorry.

1621
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:43,299
- Stop! Stop, or I'll shoot!
- Put that down!

1622
01:14:43,298 --> 01:14:44,925
If you don't
get out of my way,

1623
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:46,768
I'll stick that gun
up your arse!

1624
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,809
No! Come on!

1625
01:14:48,805 --> 01:14:50,102
Let her go.
Do it. Do it.

1626
01:14:50,098 --> 01:14:52,567
- Whoa!
- Down!

1627
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:55,028
Give me that thing!
What are you doing?!

1628
01:14:55,019 --> 01:14:56,236
Place yourself.

1629
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:57,856
- Get out of here!
- Joe!

1630
01:14:57,855 --> 01:15:00,199
- Come away! Get over!
- Holy shit.

1631
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:01,818
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

1632
01:15:01,818 --> 01:15:03,240
I'm all right. Get the baby.

1633
01:15:03,236 --> 01:15:04,829
Get in--Get in here!

1634
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:06,994
I'm all right.
Hold your fire.

1635
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,958
Stand down.
All units, stand down now.

1636
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,044
Nobody shoot!
Don't shoot!

1637
01:15:11,035 --> 01:15:13,003
Let it go.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1638
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:18,209
I'm sorry.

1639
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:19,381
What are you thinking?

1640
01:15:23,256 --> 01:15:25,725
Who the fuck
let that woman go?

1641
01:15:25,717 --> 01:15:28,095
What kind of a Mickey Mouse
operation is this?

1642
01:15:29,178 --> 01:15:31,727
Hey, get your boss.

1643
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:33,851
Home Secretary,
Northern Ireland Secretary,

1644
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:35,272
Queen,
I don't care who it is.

1645
01:15:35,268 --> 01:15:37,646
Get them on the phone
for me now.

1646
01:15:37,645 --> 01:15:40,194
Put me through to Deputy Secretary
Buckley at the MOD.

1647
01:15:40,189 --> 01:15:42,112
Okay, sir. Right away.

1648
01:15:42,108 --> 01:15:43,451
What did I tell you?

1649
01:15:43,443 --> 01:15:45,616
I couldn't just leave you, Dad.

1650
01:15:48,114 --> 01:15:49,582
You all right?

1651
01:15:50,867 --> 01:15:53,211
Damn knee went out again.

1652
01:15:53,202 --> 01:15:55,296
Tell me now,

1653
01:15:55,288 --> 01:15:56,710
- who told you...
- You did good, son.

1654
01:15:56,706 --> 01:15:58,458
To get in that sofa?
Was it your da?

1655
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,051
Go and pacify
that woman, will you?

1656
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:02,137
And tell her to stop
beating her children,

1657
01:16:02,128 --> 01:16:04,222
or you'll arrest her for cruelty.

1658
01:16:04,213 --> 01:16:05,339
Shut up, or I'll...

1659
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,058
We'll need the SAS for that.

1660
01:16:09,469 --> 01:16:11,187
Undersecretary Buckley.

1661
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:15,309
Hello, sir.

1662
01:16:15,308 --> 01:16:18,403
No, but everything's going
according to plan.

1663
01:16:19,562 --> 01:16:23,487
Well, I just need authority
to make a deal.

1664
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:28,655
No, I believe we can nail
a major criminal,

1665
01:16:28,655 --> 01:16:30,532
someone I've been
after for years.

1666
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,202
Okay, let's go.

1667
01:16:41,959 --> 01:16:42,960
Okay.

1668
01:16:49,634 --> 01:16:51,636
Are you trying to get somebody
killed here?

1669
01:16:52,553 --> 01:16:54,271
That was not our fault.

1670
01:16:54,263 --> 01:16:56,686
All right.
I'll see you at the door.

1671
01:16:56,683 --> 01:16:58,105
Help me up.

1672
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:03,527
Right. Right. Come on.

1673
01:17:03,523 --> 01:17:04,740
- Coming out.
- That's fine.

1674
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:11,239
All right.

1675
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:13,867
Have we got a deal?

1676
01:17:13,866 --> 01:17:16,460
Yeah. Deal.

1677
01:17:16,452 --> 01:17:18,796
But this is how we do it.

1678
01:17:18,788 --> 01:17:22,292
Bring out the woman
and the bag first.

1679
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:24,636
Then you bring the kid out
and yourself.

1680
01:17:28,507 --> 01:17:29,929
Hurry up.

1681
01:17:31,844 --> 01:17:33,437
Get that thing up and ready.

1682
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:39,644
All right, lady.

1683
01:17:39,643 --> 01:17:41,611
Shit. Fuck, Mad Dog.
That's the bag.

1684
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:44,106
I know that's the bag.
Get on with it. Now.

1685
01:17:44,106 --> 01:17:46,484
Quickly.
He's giving the evidence away.

1686
01:17:46,483 --> 01:17:47,780
Switch the safety off.

1687
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:49,494
Show me this evidence.

1688
01:17:51,822 --> 01:17:53,495
- What is this?
- What?

1689
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:54,582
Where's the passport?

1690
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:55,576
What are you talking about?

1691
01:17:55,576 --> 01:17:56,577
Where's the evidence?

1692
01:17:58,245 --> 01:17:59,622
No, this is a mistake.

1693
01:17:59,621 --> 01:18:01,248
- Ju--No, I'll--
- Don't mess with me.

1694
01:18:01,248 --> 01:18:03,592
Come on.
He's taking it back inside.

1695
01:18:03,584 --> 01:18:05,507
- Where's the stuff?
- What's wrong, Joe?!

1696
01:18:05,502 --> 01:18:06,879
- Go on. Get back. Come on.
- Perfect.

1697
01:18:06,879 --> 01:18:08,722
- The passports? The coins?
- It's in the bag.

1698
01:18:08,714 --> 01:18:10,307
No, it's not in the bag.
It's empty.

1699
01:18:10,299 --> 01:18:11,767
Hit it, boss.

1700
01:18:11,759 --> 01:18:12,851
Aah!

1701
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:19,808
Shit. I missed.

1702
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:20,855
Jesus Christ.
What was that?

1703
01:18:20,851 --> 01:18:21,852
That was an RPG.

1704
01:18:22,728 --> 01:18:25,447
- Get up, you stupid bastards.
- Ah, God.

1705
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:27,066
- Where'd it come from?
- Shoot, boss.

1706
01:18:27,065 --> 01:18:29,409
- Wait! Wait!
- Aah! Fuck!

1707
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:34,790
Joe! Ohh.

1708
01:18:34,782 --> 01:18:36,910
Come back. Come back.
You can't go in there.

1709
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:38,286
Come on. Come on.
Get back.

1710
01:18:39,703 --> 01:18:42,172
- Move! Move!
- Come on! Let's go!

1711
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:43,086
Fire at will.

1712
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:46,669
Ah, jeez.

1713
01:18:48,086 --> 01:18:49,338
Get the fire engines
in there now.

1714
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:54,886
Move it. Come on.

1715
01:19:00,057 --> 01:19:01,434
Let's go.

1716
01:19:01,433 --> 01:19:03,356
Go! Go! Go!

1717
01:19:06,772 --> 01:19:08,820
This constable's gonna
take you to the ambulance.

1718
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:37,344
Help! Hey!

1719
01:19:37,344 --> 01:19:38,846
- What the--
- Someone's in here!

1720
01:19:38,846 --> 01:19:40,473
- We got survivors here!
- Help!

1721
01:19:42,474 --> 01:19:45,694
Andy, we've got two survivors!

1722
01:19:45,686 --> 01:19:47,313
- Come over here, and give me a hand.
- Are you okay?

1723
01:19:50,357 --> 01:19:53,361
Ah, my eyes.

1724
01:19:56,113 --> 01:19:57,160
What happened?

1725
01:20:02,495 --> 01:20:03,712
Joe.

1726
01:20:05,081 --> 01:20:07,004
Joe!

1727
01:20:11,462 --> 01:20:12,964
Annie.

1728
01:20:12,964 --> 01:20:14,511
- Jim!
- Annie!

1729
01:20:17,385 --> 01:20:18,728
Am I all right?

1730
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,347
You're fine.

1731
01:20:20,346 --> 01:20:22,474
You're perfect.

1732
01:20:22,473 --> 01:20:23,770
Maguire.

1733
01:20:23,766 --> 01:20:25,018
The deal's off.

1734
01:20:26,769 --> 01:20:27,986
No evidence.

1735
01:20:27,979 --> 01:20:29,105
- What?
- Take him in.

1736
01:20:29,105 --> 01:20:31,073
Wait. Wait.
I know what happened.

1737
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:32,362
Oh. yeah?

1738
01:20:32,358 --> 01:20:33,780
Are you the Umgazi?

1739
01:20:34,903 --> 01:20:35,904
Show us your gun.

1740
01:20:35,904 --> 01:20:37,030
Just eat your chips.

1741
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,532
Go on.

1742
01:20:52,837 --> 01:20:54,555
Where is it?

1743
01:20:54,547 --> 01:20:57,801
Tell me, or I will cut the tripe
out of the both of yous.

1744
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,100
Wait. Guys, just tell us
where you put the stuff.

1745
01:21:01,095 --> 01:21:02,563
I'll buy you a new piano.

1746
01:21:02,555 --> 01:21:03,727
You will in your arse.

1747
01:21:03,723 --> 01:21:05,646
I didn't touch it, I swear.

1748
01:21:06,851 --> 01:21:08,728
But I think it fell into the pram.

1749
01:21:10,772 --> 01:21:11,773
Excuse me.

1750
01:21:12,815 --> 01:21:13,816
Yes.

1751
01:21:13,816 --> 01:21:15,443
Here you go. That's it.

1752
01:21:15,443 --> 01:21:16,740
That's what you need.

1753
01:21:18,321 --> 01:21:20,289
Perfect.

1754
01:21:20,281 --> 01:21:24,127
Right. Let's shut
this little circus down.

1755
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:26,416
I'll deal with you
in the morning.

1756
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,672
It'll be okay.

1757
01:21:28,665 --> 01:21:30,963
Thank you, son.

1758
01:21:32,043 --> 01:21:33,795
You did a great job.

1759
01:21:33,795 --> 01:21:35,297
I'm proud of you.

1760
01:21:35,296 --> 01:21:37,719
Not as proud as I am of you.

1761
01:21:37,715 --> 01:21:39,058
You're a great policeman.

1762
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,097
Ah...

1763
01:21:41,803 --> 01:21:42,804
Hey, Dad.

1764
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:49,235
I--I have a confession to make.

1765
01:21:49,227 --> 01:21:51,070
Oh, Randy,
I have a lot on my plate.

1766
01:21:51,062 --> 01:21:53,440
No, no, no, no.
I have to say it.

1767
01:21:55,274 --> 01:21:57,777
You know in the morning
when I go running?

1768
01:21:57,777 --> 01:22:00,280
Well, I don't.

1769
01:22:02,115 --> 01:22:03,788
I--l go to Mass with Mommy.

1770
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:07,753
I'm Catholic.

1771
01:22:09,831 --> 01:22:10,923
Five years now.

1772
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:13,550
I-I'm really sorry.

1773
01:22:13,543 --> 01:22:14,965
All right, all right. I...

1774
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:18,389
I suppose I'll get used to it.

1775
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:22,844
At least you didn't
tell me you're...

1776
01:22:25,388 --> 01:22:26,765
Please, son,
no more confessions.

1777
01:22:26,764 --> 01:22:27,936
Not tonight.

1778
01:22:28,766 --> 01:22:30,018
Jesus Christ.

1779
01:22:31,227 --> 01:22:32,274
Let's go.

1780
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:34,068
You better get going with them.

1781
01:22:34,063 --> 01:22:35,316
Take care.

1782
01:22:35,315 --> 01:22:37,113
Okay. Come on.

1783
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:38,281
Take care, Joe.

1784
01:22:41,113 --> 01:22:42,660
I thought you were dead.

1785
01:22:42,656 --> 01:22:44,283
You can't get rid of me that easy.

1786
01:23:01,008 --> 01:23:02,760
Did you throw Bertha
in the river?

1787
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,354
Aye. Crying shame, Mad Dog.

1788
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:08,064
- She's useless now.
- Why?

1789
01:23:08,057 --> 01:23:10,310
'Cause we've
no fucking rockets, you idiot.

1790
01:23:11,643 --> 01:23:14,396
Don't you move, sunshine!

1791
01:23:14,396 --> 01:23:15,739
Still!

1792
01:23:15,731 --> 01:23:17,779
Good evening, Inspector.

1793
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:20,119
I was just leaving, but you can
warm yourself by the fire.

1794
01:23:21,195 --> 01:23:22,321
Planning a trip, are you?

1795
01:23:22,321 --> 01:23:23,368
I might.

1796
01:23:23,363 --> 01:23:24,489
Have a nice house in Majorca.

1797
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:25,491
You should come down there.

1798
01:23:25,491 --> 01:23:27,289
The wee shed out back

1799
01:23:27,284 --> 01:23:29,252
with a nice patch
of mud that you could roll in.

1800
01:23:30,579 --> 01:23:32,707
Well, your trip's been canceled.

1801
01:23:32,706 --> 01:23:34,925
Passport's out of date.

1802
01:23:48,931 --> 01:23:50,604
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

1803
01:23:50,599 --> 01:23:52,567
- Yeah?
- Good.

1804
01:23:52,559 --> 01:23:53,560
Try this.

1805
01:23:55,771 --> 01:23:57,318
Hey, look.

1806
01:23:57,314 --> 01:23:58,907
There they are.

1807
01:24:00,818 --> 01:24:02,240
- Hey.
- Hey.

1808
01:24:02,236 --> 01:24:04,204
- Good morning.
- Here we are.

1809
01:24:04,196 --> 01:24:05,698
Come on, wee man.

1810
01:24:05,697 --> 01:24:07,324
Good morning.

1811
01:24:07,324 --> 01:24:08,997
Ah, you guys.

1812
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:13,126
Hey. Come here.

1813
01:24:13,122 --> 01:24:14,294
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

1814
01:24:14,289 --> 01:24:15,290
You okay?

1815
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:16,633
Yeah. We're all packed.

1816
01:24:18,085 --> 01:24:19,928
Well, take care
of these two guys.

1817
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,172
Yeah.

1818
01:24:23,257 --> 01:24:24,509
- Come here.
- Yeah.

1819
01:24:26,301 --> 01:24:30,351
Hey, there's that baby. Ohh.

1820
01:24:30,347 --> 01:24:32,441
Do you really think
you are my dad?

1821
01:24:35,602 --> 01:24:36,819
I'm sure of it.

1822
01:24:38,355 --> 01:24:39,948
Very good. Cool.

1823
01:24:41,191 --> 01:24:42,192
Okay, we gotta go.

1824
01:24:42,192 --> 01:24:43,193
Good luck.

1825
01:24:47,239 --> 01:24:48,741
Bye, now. Bye.

1826
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,208
- Bye, Sean.
- Bye-bye.

1827
01:24:51,076 --> 01:24:52,578
Bye!

1828
01:24:55,372 --> 01:24:56,749
Well, Mr. Maguire,

1829
01:24:56,748 --> 01:24:58,375
think you got more
than you bargained for

1830
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:59,376
hiding out in Belfast, eh?

1831
01:24:59,376 --> 01:25:01,879
Yeah. No kidding.

1832
01:25:01,879 --> 01:25:03,506
This just came in from Boston.

1833
01:25:04,715 --> 01:25:06,843
"Whitey Barrett,
FBI informant"?

1834
01:25:06,842 --> 01:25:08,560
You're kidding.

1835
01:25:08,552 --> 01:25:11,022
I think you're the least
of his problems now.

1836
01:25:12,056 --> 01:25:14,775
And, uh, about my gun?

1837
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,403
Oh, that peashooter of yours?

1838
01:25:18,563 --> 01:25:19,985
There was no firing pin in it.

1839
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,483
- No firing pin?
- No.

1840
01:25:21,482 --> 01:25:23,234
We'll call it an antique.

1841
01:25:23,234 --> 01:25:24,986
Okay.

1842
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,329
Behave yourself.

1843
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:28,244
Yes, sir.

1844
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,458
I don't know about you,
but I need some breakfast and--

1845
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:31,451
- Come.
- Yeah, come on.

1846
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:33,044
Let's eat.

1847
01:25:33,036 --> 01:25:37,587
# Well, let me kiss the lips
that whisper to me #

1848
01:25:37,582 --> 01:25:42,258
# Uttering the words
that burn right through me #

1849
01:25:42,253 --> 01:25:45,257
# Hold me in your arms #

1850
01:25:46,633 --> 01:25:49,853
# Hold me in your arms, baby #

1851
01:25:51,304 --> 01:25:53,602
# And let me hold the hands #

1852
01:25:53,598 --> 01:25:55,771
# That once caressed me #

1853
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:58,020
# Hands that made me sin #

1854
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:00,363
# But then confessed me #

1855
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:03,450
# Hold me in your arms #

1856
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:08,113
# Hold me in your arms, baby #

1857
01:26:08,988 --> 01:26:14,085
# Ah, well, you said I never
stood strong in the hard times #

1858
01:26:14,077 --> 01:26:17,877
# And maybe you're right #

1859
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:22,469
# But I swear I will tonight #

1860
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:26,886
# Yeah, when you
hold me in your arms #

1861
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:32,229
# You know I want to be the one
that stands beside you #

1862
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,100
# Baby, in your life #

1863
01:26:36,099 --> 01:26:40,400
# Baby, be with me tonight #

1864
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:45,868
# Oh, and hold me in your arms #

1865
01:26:45,858 --> 01:26:53,709
# Hold me in your arms #

1866
01:26:54,826 --> 01:27:03,007
# Hold me in your arms #

1867
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:11,936
# Hold me in your arms #

1868
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:17,927
# Hold me in your arms #

1869
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:31,451
# Well, if there's
something I can give #

1870
01:27:34,532 --> 01:27:38,082
# You need only ask me #

1871
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:45,591
# 'Cause you help me,
now I'll help you #

1872
01:27:48,505 --> 01:27:53,181
# It's the way it should be #

1873
01:27:53,177 --> 01:27:57,603
# As I walk along these streets #

1874
01:27:59,058 --> 01:28:02,437
# The ones I'd once forsaken #

1875
01:28:02,436 --> 01:28:05,986
# And people that I knew #

1876
01:28:07,316 --> 01:28:11,241
# I see a light awaking #

1877
01:28:14,156 --> 01:28:18,377
# Well, nothing much
has changed #

1878
01:28:18,369 --> 01:28:22,419
# Mostly still the same #

1879
01:28:22,414 --> 01:28:26,339
# Cold sun shines through rain #

1880
01:28:26,335 --> 01:28:30,806
# Yet Belfast is born again #

1881
01:28:37,262 --> 01:28:41,688
# Oh, nothing much has changed #

1882
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:45,438
# Mostly still the same #

1883
01:28:45,437 --> 01:28:51,865
# And the cold sun
shines through rain #

1884
01:28:55,572 --> 01:29:00,419
# Yet Belfast is born again #

1885
01:29:02,788 --> 01:29:10,343
# Mm mm, mm mmm mm, mm mm #

1886
