1
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,001
-Good night, sweetheart.
-'Night, Mom.

2
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:39,503
Sleep tight, kiddo.

3
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:12,721
Simulation terminated.

4
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:16,225
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

5
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:18,644
Simulation terminated.

6
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:23,607
-All right. Mr. Bile, is it?
-My friends call me Phlegm.

7
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,194
Mr. Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

8
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:30,614
-I fell down?
-No, no, before that.

9
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:34,117
Can anyone tell me
Mr. Bile's big mistake?

10
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,286
Anyone?

11
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,958
Let's take a look at the tape.
Here we go.

12
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,877
Right there.

13
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:46,505
See? The door.
You left it wide open.

14
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:50,550
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

15
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:53,804
any employee can make because. . .

16
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,809
-It could let in a draft?
-It could let in a child.

17
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,311
Mr. Waternoose.

18
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,233
There's nothing more toxic or deadly
than a human child.

19
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:08,694
A single touch could kill you.

20
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:13,490
Leave a door open and a child
could walk right into this factory,

21
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,242
right into the monster world.

22
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:17,786
I won't go in a kid's room.
You can't make me.

23
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,039
You're going in there
because we need this.

24
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,758
Our city is counting on you
to collect those children's screams.

25
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:34,636
Without scream we have no power.

26
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:36,805
Yes, it's dangerous work.

27
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,766
And that's why I need you
to be at your best.

28
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:43,645
I need scarers who are
confident, tenacious, tough.

29
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,480
Intimidating.

30
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:51,194
I need scarers like. . .
Like James P. Sullivan.

31
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:58,285
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis.
It's five after 6:00 a.m.

32
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:00,120
in the big Monster City.

33
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:03,915
The temperature's a balmy 65 degrees
which is good for you reptiles.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,045
And it looks like it's gonna be
a perfect day to lie in bed, sleep in,

35
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:12,674
or simply work off that flab
that's hanging over the bed !

36
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,343
Get up, Sulley!

37
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,972
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

38
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:21,641
Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

39
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:25,020
Feel the burn.
You call yourself a monster?

40
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:27,647
Scary feet, scary feet.
The kid's awake!

41
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:30,442
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.
Kid's asleep!

42
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:33,820
Twins! In a bunk bed !

43
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:37,199
I thought I had you there.

44
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:40,911
OK, Sulley, here we go.
You ready? Follow it. It's over here.

45
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:44,539
Over there. Don't let the kid touch you.
Don't let him touch you !

46
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:48,043
I don't know but it's been said
I love scarin' kids in bed

47
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:51,505
Fight that plaque.
Scary monsters don't have plaque.

48
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,924
One-eighteen. Do you have 1 1 9?

49
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:55,634
Do I see 1 20?

50
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,387
-I don't believe it.
-I'm not breaking a sweat.

51
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,847
Not you. Look!
The new commercial's on.

52
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:04,935
The future is bright
at Monsters, lncorporated.

53
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,187
-I'm in this one.
-We're part of your life.

54
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:10,065
We power your car.
We warm your home.

55
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:11,858
We light your city.

56
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:14,820
-l'm Monsters, lncorporated.
-Hey, look! Betty!

57
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:18,365
Carefully matching every child
to their ideal monster,

58
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,534
to produce superior scream.

59
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:23,453
Refined into clean,
dependable energy.

60
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:28,208
Every time you turn something on.
Monsters, lncorporated is there.

61
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:31,753
-l'm Monsters, lncorporated.
-We know the challenge.

62
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,839
The window of innocence is shrinking.

63
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:36,425
Human kids are harder to scare.

64
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,052
Of course.
Ml is prepared for the future.

65
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:41,054
With the top scarers,

66
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,806
the best refineries,

67
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,600
and research into
new energy techniques.

68
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,145
OK, here I come.

69
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,730
We're working for a better tomorrow.

70
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:54,401
-today.
-We're Monsters, lncorporated.

71
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:57,404
We're Ml. Monsters, lncorporated.

72
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:00,240
We scare because we care.

73
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,077
-I can't believe it.
-Mike.

74
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,455
I was on TV!

75
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,790
Did you see me? I'm a natural.

76
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,127
Hello?
I know! Wasn't I great?

77
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:14,754
Did the whole family see it?
It's your mom.

78
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,673
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

79
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,439
I'm telling you, you're gonna
be seeing this face on TV more often.

80
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:35,150
Yeah? On Monstropolis' Most Wanted?

81
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,237
You've been jealous of my good looks
since the fourth grade.

82
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:41,531
-Have a good day, sweetie.
-You too, hon.

83
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,619
-OK, Sulley, hop on in.
-Nope.

84
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:48,914
-Hey, where you going?
-Mikey, there's a scream shortage.

85
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:50,707
-We're walking.
-Walking?

86
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,626
-No, no.
-Come on.

87
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,211
My baby needs to be driven.

88
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,938
My baby. I'll call you.

89
00:07:58,774 --> 00:08:01,276
-You know why I bought the car?
-Not really.

90
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,571
To drive it. You know,
on the street with the honk, honk,

91
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:08,491
-no walking involved.
-Give it a rest, will ya, butterball?

92
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:11,953
-You could use the exercise.
-I could use the exercise? Look at you.

93
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:13,746
You have your own climate.

94
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:16,332
-How many tentacles jump the rope?
-How many tentacles jump the rope?

95
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,209
Morning, Mike. Morning, Sulley.

96
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:20,170
Morning, kids. How you doing?

97
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:24,174
-Hi, Mike. Bye, Sulley.
-Hey!

98
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:32,913
Nuts.

99
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,501
-Fellas.
-Hey, Tony.

100
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:40,295
Tony, Tony.

101
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:44,216
I hear somebody's close to breaking
the all-time scare record.

102
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:48,387
Just trying to make sure
there's enough scream to go around.

103
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:51,181
-Hey, on the house.
-Hey, thanks.

104
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:52,599
Bada-bing.

105
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,770
Oh, great.

106
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:00,315
Hey, Ted, good morning.

107
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:06,071
See that, Mikey?
Ted's walking to work.

108
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:08,991
Big deal.
Guy takes five steps and he's there.

109
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,833
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

110
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,961
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

111
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:22,504
-Mornin', Sulley.
-Mornin', Ricky.

112
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:24,965
-It's the Sullster.
-See you on the scare floor.

113
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:28,010
-Hey Marge. How was jury duty?
-Morning, Sulley.

114
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,219
Hey.

115
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:32,014
Hey. It's still leaning to the left.

116
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:34,850
-It is not.
-Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.

117
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:38,937
-Hey, Mr. Sullivan.
-Guys, I told you, call me Sulley.

118
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:43,317
-I don't think so.
-We want to wish you good luck today.

119
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:47,237
Hey, hey, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.

120
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,156
-Sorry.
-See you later, fellas.

121
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,866
Go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan.

122
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,368
Quiet.
You're making him lose his focus.

123
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:56,371
-Oh, no. Sorry!
-Shut up!

124
00:09:56,456 --> 00:10:00,083
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.

125
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:03,253
Miss Fearmonger is on vacation.
Would you like her voicemail?

126
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:06,882
-Schmoopsie-pooh.
-Googly bear.

127
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:11,470
-Happy birthday.
-Googly-woogly, you remembered.

128
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:15,474
-Hey, Sulley-wulley.
-Hey, Celia-wheelia.

129
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:18,143
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

130
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:21,480
So are we going
anywhere special tonight?

131
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:26,026
I just got us into a little place
called Harryhausen's.

132
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:30,364
Harryhausen's? But it's impossible
to get a reservation there.

133
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,909
Not for googly bear.
I will see you at quittin' time.

134
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:36,078
-Not a minute later.
-OK, sweetheart.

135
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:37,996
Think romantical thoughts.

136
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:41,416
You and me
Me and you

137
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:43,335
Both of us together

138
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:45,921
You know, pal, she's the one.

139
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:48,799
-That's it. She is the one.
-I'm happy for you.

140
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:51,343
Thanks for hooking me up
with those reservations.

141
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:54,513
They're under the name "googly bear."

142
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:57,599
Good. . .
You know, that wasn't very funny.

143
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,355
-What the. . .
-Wazowski.

144
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
What do you know?

145
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:09,361
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

146
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,948
I wasn't scared.
I have allergies.

147
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,327
-Sure.
-Randall, save it for the scare floor.

148
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:21,289
I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.
Gonna do serious scaring.

149
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:24,543
-Putting up some big numbers.
-Randall, that's great.

150
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:28,797
That should make it more humiliating
when we break the record first.

151
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:33,969
Do you hear that?
It's the winds of change.

152
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,723
"You hear that? It's the winds of. . ."

153
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:41,810
What a creep.
One of these days I am really

154
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,729
gonna let you
teach that guy a lesson.

155
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:53,738
Chalooby. Baby.

156
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:58,910
Good morning, Roz,
my succulent garden snail.

157
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:02,205
-Who would we be scaring today?
-Wazowski.

158
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,791
You didn't file your paperwork
last night.

159
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,710
Oh, that darn paperwork.

160
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:10,130
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

161
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:14,009
Don't let it happen again.

162
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:17,179
Yes. Well, I'll try to be less careless.

163
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:20,098
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

164
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:22,267
Always watching.

165
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:24,436
-She's nuts.
-Always.

166
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,731
All scare floors are now active.

167
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,026
Assistants, please report
to your stations.

168
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:20,867
OK, people,
Eastern Seaboard coming online.

169
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:22,994
We got scarers coming out.

170
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:40,095
They are so awesome.

171
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:29,227
Hey, may the best monster win.

172
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:31,146
I plan to.

173
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:35,817
We are on in seven, six, five,

174
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,321
four, three, two. . .

175
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:47,954
You're the boss.
You're the big hairy boss.

176
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,716
I'm feeling good today, Mikey.

177
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,137
Attaboy. Another door coming right up.

178
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:13,355
You're still behind, Randall.

179
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,524
-Maybe I should realign the scream. . .
-Get me a door.

180
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:17,942
Door, yes, door.

181
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:45,887
Well, Jerry, what's the damage so far?

182
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:49,140
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

183
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:51,309
First time in a month.

184
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,735
-What happened?
-The kid almost touched me.

185
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,947
-She got this close to me.
-She wasn't scared of you?

186
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:06,491
-She was only six.
-I could have been dead.

187
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:10,286
-I could have died.
-Keep it together, man.

188
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,623
Hey, we got a dead door over here.

189
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,000
-I'm coming.
-Look out.

190
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,294
Excuse us.

191
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:23,717
We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.

192
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,844
Kids these days.

193
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:28,138
They just don't get scared
like they used to.

194
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:30,181
Let her rip.

195
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,737
-Sir?
-What?

196
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,363
Look.

197
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:49,701
Attention.
We have a new scare leader.

198
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:51,411
Randall Boggs.

199
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:54,831
Look at those numbers.

200
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:01,713
Slumber party.

201
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,384
Never mind.

202
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:08,928
Hey, watch it.

203
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:13,850
Well, James,
that was an impressive display.

204
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:16,227
Just doing my job, Mr. Waternoose.

205
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:18,730
'Course I did learn from the best.

206
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:22,317
If I don't see a new door
in my station in five seconds,

207
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:25,487
I will personally
put you through the shredder.

208
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:30,575
Hey, Wazowski, nice job.
Those numbers are pretty sweet.

209
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:33,203
Are they?
You know, I hadn't even noticed.

210
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,997
-And how's Georgie doing?
-He's doing great.

211
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,082
I love working with that big guy.

212
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,627
Keep the doors coming.
I'm on a roll today.

213
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:44,422
George and I are like brothers. 231 9!

214
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:46,591
We have a 231 9!

215
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,347
Red alert.

216
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:55,350
Red alert, red alert.

217
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,560
-Red alert.
-George Sanderson.

218
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:01,606
Please remain motionless.
Prepare for decontamination.

219
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,691
Duck and cover, people!

220
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:09,030
Not the CDA.

221
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:19,415
-Go, go, go.
-Coming through. Stand aside.

222
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,000
Clear the contaminated area.

223
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,839
-A 231 9 in progress.
-Coming through. Watch yourself.

224
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:32,554
Stand back. Careful.

225
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:51,406
All clear. Situation is
niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.

226
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,701
-Thanks, guys, that was a close one.
-OK.

227
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:10,085
Take a break. We gotta shut down
and reset the system.

228
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,712
An entire scare floor out of commission.

229
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:14,714
What else can go wrong?

230
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:20,345
-What a day.
-We're just going through a rough time.

231
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,639
Everyone knows
you'll get us through it.

232
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:25,266
Tell that to the board of directors.

233
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:30,855
James, this company's been
in my family for three generations.

234
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,109
I would do anything
to keep it from going under.

235
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:35,957
So would I, sir.

236
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,837
-I could use your help with something.
-Anything, sir.

237
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:45,383
We've hired some new scare recruits,
and frankly, they're. . .

238
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:48,595
-Inexperienced?
-They stink.

239
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:51,348
I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

240
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:53,517
and give them a demonstration.

241
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:56,520
Show them what it takes
to be our top scarer.

242
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:59,940
I'll start out with the old
Waternoose jump and growl.

243
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,195
Now that's my boy.

244
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:14,996
Let's go, everybody.
All doors must be returned.

245
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:16,873
No exceptions.

246
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:25,507
I've never seen anything like you today.
You were on a roll.

247
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,426
Another day like this
and that scare record's in the bag.

248
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,011
That's right, baby.

249
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:37,936
As if dinner wasn't enough,
I'm taking her to a monster truck rally.

250
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,521
-Nice.
-What's on your agenda?

251
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,023
-Work out some more.
-Again?

252
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,693
There's more to life than scaring.

253
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:50,574
-Can I borrow your odorant?
-I got smelly garbage or old dumpster.

254
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:53,577
You got low tide?
How about wet dog?

255
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:55,245
Yep. Stink it up.

256
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:01,042
I am so romantic sometimes
I think I should marry myself.

257
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,129
-Give me a break.
-What a night of romance ahead of me.

258
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:07,507
Tonight is about me and Celia.

259
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,886
The love boat is about to set sail.

260
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:15,932
I gotta tell you, that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go. . .

261
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:20,270
Hello, Wazowski.
Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?

262
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:21,605
Well, as a matter of fact. . .

263
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:25,066
I'm sure you filed
your paperwork correctly,

264
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:26,818
for once.

265
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,615
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

266
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,075
My scare reports.
I left them on my desk.

267
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:37,537
If I'm not at the restaurant in five
minutes they'll give our table away.

268
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,205
-Schmoopsie-pooh.
-Googly bear.

269
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,125
-Want to get going?
-Do I ever. It's just. . .

270
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,543
-What?
-It. . .

271
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:45,795
-A small. . .
-I don't understand.

272
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,298
I forgot about some paperwork
I was supposed to file.

273
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:50,091
Mike was reminding me.

274
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,052
-Thanks, buddy.
-I was?

275
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:53,637
I mean, I was. Yeah.

276
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:55,889
-OK. Let's go.
-We're going.

277
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:57,933
The pink copies to accounting.

278
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:01,728
The fuchsia ones go to purchasing
and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.

279
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:03,313
Leave the puce.

280
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,818
Pink copies to accounting,
fuchsia ones to Roz.

281
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:10,904
The fuchsia ones go to purchasing.

282
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:12,739
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

283
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,742
Man, I have no idea what puce is.

284
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,288
Oh, that's puce.

285
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:27,253
Hello?

286
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:30,924
Anyone? There's a door here.

287
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,530
Hello? Hey.

288
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,282
Anybody scaring in here?

289
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:59,244
Hello. Yo.

290
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,148
Kitty.

291
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:54,984
No, no, stay back.

292
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:59,465
Hold it, hold it.

293
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:12,896
Michael, I've had a lot of birthdays. . .
Well, not a lot of birthdays.

294
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,273
But this is the best birthday ever.

295
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,401
What are you looking at?

296
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:21,571
I was just thinking about
the first time I laid eye on you,

297
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:24,115
-how pretty you looked.
-Stop it.

298
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,911
-Your hair was shorter.
-I'm thinking about getting it cut.

299
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:29,954
No, no, I like it this length.

300
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:31,497
I like everything about you.

301
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:35,627
Just the other day someone asked
who was the most beautiful monster.

302
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:38,630
-You know what I said?
-What did you say?

303
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:40,006
I said. . .

304
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:42,217
-Sulley?
-Sulley?

305
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,802
No, no, that's not what
I was gonna say.

306
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:45,970
You're not making sense.

307
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:49,974
-He's handsome. He's rugged.
-What a coincidence, running into you.

308
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:52,644
-I'm just gonna order something.
-Michael.

309
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:55,355
-What's good?
-You're ruining everything.

310
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:58,274
I went to get your paperwork
and there was a door.

311
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,525
What?

312
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:03,613
-A door?
-Randall was in it.

313
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:07,242
Randall? That cheater.
He's trying to boost his numbers.

314
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,952
-There's something else.
-What?

315
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:11,079
Ooklay in the agbay.

316
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,331
-What?
-Look in the bag.

317
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,541
What bag?

318
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,636
They don't have anything
I like here. Take care, Celia.

319
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,014
-What's going on?
-Celia, please try to understand.

320
00:27:30,224 --> 00:27:33,184
-I have to do something !
-Michael?

321
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:37,021
On three. One, two. . .

322
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,692
-A kid !
-Boo!

323
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:47,073
A kid !

324
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,994
There's a kid here.
A human kid !

325
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,416
Googly bear!

326
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,340
Come on.

327
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,929
Let's get out of here.

328
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:13,683
Please remain calm.
This is not a drill.

329
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:18,271
7835 in progress, please advise.

330
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:21,524
-Michael? Michael !
-Celia!

331
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:23,026
-Come with me.
-Stop pushing.

332
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,069
Get your hands off
my schmoopsie-pooh.

333
00:28:26,113 --> 00:28:27,613
Ready for decontamination.

334
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:31,367
I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

335
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:41,252
lf witnesses are to be believed,
there has been a child security breach

336
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:43,629
for the first time in monster history.

337
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:47,216
We neither confirm nor deny
the presence of a human child here.

338
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:51,512
Well. a kid flew right over me and
blasted a car with its laser vision.

339
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,807
l tried to run. but it picked me up
with its mind powers

340
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:56,184
and shook me like a doll.

341
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,478
It's true.
l saw the whole thing.

342
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:03,816
It is my professional opinion
that now is the time to panic.

343
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:10,490
It's coming. It's coming !

344
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:12,492
Boo!

345
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,833
No, no, no, no!

346
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,835
Come here, kid.

347
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:27,590
Don't touch those, you little. . .

348
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:30,051
Those were alphabetized.
It's OK.

349
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:33,554
As long as it doesn't come near us
we're gonna be OK.

350
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,441
You like this? Fetch.

351
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:50,696
Hey, hey. That's it.
No one touches Little Mikey.

352
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:55,368
Mike, give her the bear.

353
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,371
Oh, no!

354
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:14,804
Make it stop, Sulley.
Make it stop!

355
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,932
Here, look. See bear?
Nice bear.

356
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:19,559
Sulley!

357
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:23,521
Bear, he's a happy bear.

358
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:26,482
He's not crying, neither should you.
We'll be in trouble

359
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:30,486
'cause they're gonna find us,
so please stop crying now.

360
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:33,072
Good. Good, Sulley. Keep it up.
You're doing great.

361
00:30:33,157 --> 00:30:35,116
He's a happy bear.
He has no. . .

362
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,870
-It touched me.
-Sulley, the bear!

363
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:41,330
The bear. Give her the. . .

364
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:53,634
What was that?

365
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:58,848
l have no idea, but it would be
really great if it didn't do it again.

366
00:31:19,786 --> 00:31:22,330
How could I do this?
How could I be so stupid?

367
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:25,833
-This could destroy the company.
-Who cares about the company?

368
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:29,295
What about us?
That thing is a killing machine.

369
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:33,758
It's waiting for us to fall asleep
and then wham !

370
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,303
We're easy prey, my friend.
We're sitting targets.

371
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:40,223
OK, look, I think I have a plan here.

372
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:43,559
Using mainly spoons,
we dig a tunnel under the city

373
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:45,895
and release it into the wild.

374
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,480
Spoons.

375
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:51,901
That's it. I'm out of ideas.
Air balloon, too expensive.

376
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:56,113
Giant slingshot, too conspicuous.
Enormous wooden horse, too Greek.

377
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:01,744
No. Can't think. Can't think.

378
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,997
-Flatliner. Flatlining.
-Mike?

379
00:32:05,332 --> 00:32:07,458
I think she's getting tired.

380
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:11,379
Well, then why don't you
find someplace for it to sleep

381
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:13,673
while I think of a plan !

382
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:18,511
Are you sleepy? Wanna sleep?

383
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,721
Is that what you want?

384
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:37,321
OK. I'll make a nice little area
for you to. . .

385
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:41,409
No. Hey, that's my bed.
You're gonna get your germs all over it.

386
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:46,497
Fine.
My chair's more comfortable anyway.

387
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,542
What?

388
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,380
It's just a closet.
Will you go to sleep?

389
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,594
Hey, that looks like Randall.

390
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:02,471
Randall's your monster.

391
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:05,558
You think he's gonna
come through the closet and scare you.

392
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:07,602
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

393
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,061
It's empty.

394
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,563
See?

395
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,607
No monster in here.

396
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:17,612
Well, now there is.

397
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,780
But I'm not gonna scare you.

398
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:21,949
I'm off duty.

399
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:26,954
OK.

400
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:31,584
How about I sit here
until you fall asleep?

401
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,463
Go ahead. Go to sleep.

402
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,091
Now. Now go.

403
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,472
You go to sleep.

404
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:22,385
Mike, this might sound crazy,
but I don't think that kid's dangerous.

405
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:25,054
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

406
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:27,098
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

407
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:29,558
What if we just
put her back in her door?

408
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:31,352
-What?
-Mike, think about it.

409
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,064
We send her back,
everything goes back to normal.

410
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:37,900
Is that a joke?
Tell me you're joking.

411
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,569
Sulley, I think that given
the circumstance

412
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:42,446
I've been extremely forgiving till now.

413
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:44,031
But that is a horrible idea.

414
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,826
Are we gonna march in public
with that thing?

415
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,787
Then I guess we waltz
right up to the factory, right?

416
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:54,542
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

417
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,878
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights
and some chair fabric

418
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:00,631
are not gonna fool anyone.
Think about names.

419
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:03,008
Loch Ness. Bigfoot.
The Abominable Snowman.

420
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:05,803
They all got one thing in common.
Banishment!

421
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:08,556
-We could be next.
-Don't panic. We can do this.

422
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,683
-How you doing, Frank?
-Hey, guys.

423
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:13,185
Everything's going to be OK.

424
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,859
Number one wants this
dusted for prints.

425
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,570
-Careful with that.
-l got a good view.

426
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,447
A little lower.

427
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:26,782
This was recovered at the scene.

428
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,743
-Don't panic.
-Don't tell me not to.

429
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,494
-Keep it together.
-It's not OK.

430
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,830
-Boo.
-Could be contaminated.

431
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:35,499
Gentlemen, safety
is our number-one concern.

432
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:38,502
If there's anything that. . .
Not now. I'm. . .

433
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:40,379
Oh, hello, little one.

434
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:42,757
-Where did you come from?
-Mr. Waternoose!

435
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:44,925
James, is this one yours?

436
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,178
Actually, that's my cousin's sister's

437
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:49,388
-daughter, sir.
-Yeah, it's. . .

438
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:52,600
Bring an Obscure Relative
to Work Day.

439
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,978
Must have missed the memo.
Well, listen, James,

440
00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:58,397
why don't you stop by the simulator
after lunch

441
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:01,192
and give us that scare demonstration?

442
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:03,027
Yeah. Oh, sir. . .

443
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:05,488
-Mr. Waternoose?
-Yes, yes. I'm coming.

444
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:07,948
I'll see you this afternoon, James.

445
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:11,160
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

446
00:36:11,244 --> 00:36:12,995
-Oh, boy.
-A scare demo.

447
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,914
That is great.
Why am I the last to know?

448
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:18,542
We could bring your cousin's sister's
daughter. She'll be a big hit.

449
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:20,753
Halt.

450
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:23,672
Hold him down.

451
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,220
Come on. The coast is clear.

452
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:31,847
OK. All we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

453
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:33,808
So wait here while I get its card.

454
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,852
She can't stay here.
This is the men's room.

455
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:39,605
That is the weirdest thing
you've ever said.

456
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:43,317
Look. It loves it here.
It's dancing with joy.

457
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:46,737
I'll be right back with its door key.

458
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:52,159
That's a cute little dance.
It almost looks like you've got to. . .

459
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:08,843
Are you done in there?

460
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,721
Sorry, sorry.

461
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:27,862
OK. You're finished now, right?

462
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,572
Hello?

463
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,577
Boo.

464
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:46,630
Where did she go?

465
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,508
Did she disappear?

466
00:37:49,843 --> 00:37:52,261
Did she turn invisible?

467
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:55,347
I just have no idea.

468
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:57,683
Gotcha.

469
00:37:58,852 --> 00:37:59,894
Boo.

470
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:04,565
Hey, you're good.

471
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:13,115
Be relaxed. Be relaxed. Be relaxed.

472
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,286
Roz, my tender oozing blossom.
You're looking fabulous today.

473
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,623
Is that a new haircut?
Tell me, it's a new haircut.

474
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,335
New makeup. You had a lift.
You had a tuck. You had something.

475
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:28,589
Something has been inserted in
your skin that makes you look like. . .

476
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:34,011
I need a favor. Randall was working
late last night on the scare floor.

477
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:36,847
I need the key
for the door he was using.

478
00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:39,808
Well, isn't that nice?

479
00:38:39,893 --> 00:38:43,812
But guess what? You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

480
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,898
He didn't. . . No paperwork?

481
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:48,734
This office is now closed.

482
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:53,489
Ready or not, here I come.

483
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:54,907
I'm getting warmer.

484
00:38:54,991 --> 00:38:56,659
Any second now.

485
00:38:56,743 --> 00:39:00,579
-Fee, fi, fo. . .
-What are you doing?

486
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:02,748
I'm looking for the kid.

487
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:05,459
-You lost it?
-No, no. She was just. . .

488
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:08,337
Here she is.

489
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:10,005
Hey. What's the matter?

490
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,258
-I already told your buddies. . .
-All right. Carry on.

491
00:39:25,814 --> 00:39:29,566
Randall. Thank goodness.
What are we gonna do about the child?

492
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,748
It's on the front page.
The child. The one you were after.

493
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:57,210
Be quiet. Don't you think
I'm aware of the situation?

494
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,379
I was up all night trying to find it.

495
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:03,550
I did a calculation factoring in
the size of the sushi restaurant.

496
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,218
The child may have escaped !

497
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,137
Until we know for sure
we're gonna act like nothing happened.

498
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:11,703
Get the machine running.
I'll take care of the kid.

499
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:14,956
When I find whoever let it out,
they're dead.

500
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,587
Why are you still here?
Come on, go! Move! Now!

501
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:21,880
I'm not here.

502
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:24,132
They're gone.

503
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,847
This is bad, so very bad.

504
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,265
What were they talking about,
machine?

505
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:33,767
Who cares?

506
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:37,187
All we have to do
is call her door and send her home.

507
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,981
Right. We're just two regular Joes
on our way to work.

508
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:41,900
We will blend right in.

509
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:44,569
-Top of the morning.
-What's shakin', bacon?

510
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:47,030
Did you lose weight?
Or a limb?

511
00:40:47,198 --> 00:40:49,449
-You have her card key, right?
-Of course.

512
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:52,243
I told you I'd get her card key.
I went and got it.

513
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:54,287
Now I have her card key.

514
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:56,748
OK. Here we go.

515
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,419
Take care of yourself. Try not to
run through any more closets.

516
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:08,009
-Mike, that's not her door.
-Of course it's her door.

517
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:10,595
No. Her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

518
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,265
It must have been dark last night
because this is its door.

519
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:17,602
Hey, you hear that?
Sounds like fun in there.

520
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,772
Send me a postcard, kid.
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

521
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:23,608
22 Mike Wazowski,
you-got-your-life-back Lane.

522
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,736
Very good. Now bon voyage.

523
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:30,490
Bye-bye. Look at the stick.
See the stick? Go get the stick.

524
00:41:30,783 --> 00:41:33,952
-Go fetch.
-Mike, this isn't Boo's door.

525
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:37,664
-Boo? What's Boo?
-That's what I decided to call her.

526
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,790
There a problem?

527
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,333
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.

528
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:43,211
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it.

529
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:46,965
Now put that thing back
where it came from, or so help me. . .

530
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:55,431
Hey. We're rehearsing a scene for
the upcoming company play called. . .

531
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:58,685
Put That Thing Back
Where It Came From or So Help Me.

532
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,562
It's a musical.

533
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,231
Put that thing back
where it came from or so help me

534
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,524
So help me. so help me

535
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:05,692
And cut.

536
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,946
We're still working on it.
It's in progress, but we need ushers.

537
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,992
Sulley, I've had enough.
Say goodbye to. . . Where did it go?

538
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:16,578
-Where is she?
-She got away from you again?

539
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:21,166
Well, that is just. . .
Wait a minute. The sun is coming up.

540
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,876
This is perfect.

541
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,335
She's gone!

542
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,297
Where are you going?
Sulley, don't blow this.

543
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,174
We're so close to breaking the record.

544
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,926
Somebody will find the kid.
It'll be their problem.

545
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:34,179
She's out of our hair!

546
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:38,099
-What are you two doing?
-They're rehearsing a play.

547
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:40,768
She's out of our hair

548
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:44,772
Can it! So, what do you think
of that kid getting out, Sullivan?

549
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,066
-Pretty crazy?
-Oh, yeah, crazy.

550
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:49,777
Word is the kid's been traced
to this factory.

551
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:52,447
-You haven't seen anything?
-Well. . .

552
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,449
No. No way.

553
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:58,745
But if it was an inside job,
I'd put my money on Waxford.

554
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:00,788
-Waxford?
-The one at station six.

555
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:03,708
-He's got them shifty eyes.
-Hey, Waxford.

556
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:06,669
-Sulley!
-Michael Wazowski !

557
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:13,885
Last night was one of the worst nights
of my entire life, bar none!

558
00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:18,681
-I thought you cared about me.
-Honey, please.

559
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:21,935
-I thought you liked sushi.
-Sushi ! Sushi !

560
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:24,771
You think this is about sushi?

561
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:31,485
Wazowski.

562
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:33,070
Michael !

563
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:34,154
Men.

564
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:37,491
Breathe. Keep breathing.

565
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:51,004
-Where's the kid?
-Kid?

566
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:54,257
-What kid?
-It's here in the factory, isn't it?

567
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,470
It never would have gotten out
if you hadn't been cheating last night.

568
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:02,658
Cheating? Cheating. Right.

569
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:06,162
OK. I think I know
how to make this all go away.

570
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:10,625
What happens when the whistle blows
in five minutes?

571
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:14,837
-I get a timeout?
-Everyone goes to lunch.

572
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:19,258
Which means the scare floor will be. . .

573
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:22,595
-Painted?
-Empty.

574
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:24,847
It'll be empty, you idiot.

575
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,474
You see that clock?

576
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:30,895
When the big hand is pointing up
and the little hand is pointing up,

577
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:33,439
the kid's door will be in my station.

578
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:36,526
But when the big hand points down,

579
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:38,653
the door will be gone.

580
00:44:39,154 --> 00:44:41,822
You have until then to put the kid back.

581
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,158
Get the picture?

582
00:44:55,337 --> 00:44:56,462
Boo!

583
00:44:57,214 --> 00:44:59,507
-No.
-Hey. you. Halt.

584
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:01,050
He's the one.

585
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:03,636
-The one from the commercial.
-That's him.

586
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,181
-Can we get an autograph?
-Oh, sure. No problem.

587
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:09,642
Make that out to Stephanie.
my daughter.

588
00:45:09,726 --> 00:45:10,893
Yes. Let's see.

589
00:45:11,436 --> 00:45:14,480
"From your scary friend.
Best wishes. . ."

590
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:18,734
So, then I said, "If you talk to me
like that again, we're through".

591
00:45:19,236 --> 00:45:21,654
-What'd she say?
-You know my mom.

592
00:45:21,738 --> 00:45:24,574
-She sent me to my room.
-See you guys later. Take it easy.

593
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:25,992
Bottoms up.

594
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:44,552
Boo!

595
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:50,683
Hi.

596
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:55,104
Well, hello, there.
What's your name?

597
00:45:55,397 --> 00:45:57,023
Mike Wazowski.

598
00:46:35,854 --> 00:46:37,521
Sulley!

599
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:39,607
Oh, Sulley.

600
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:42,485
OK, Sulley, come on.

601
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,363
Hey! You guys seen Sulley anywhere?

602
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:47,698
-Nope, sorry.
-Sulley!

603
00:46:47,783 --> 00:46:50,493
Boy, Wazowski
looks like he's in trouble.

604
00:46:51,953 --> 00:46:54,747
231 9! We have a 231 9!

605
00:46:54,831 --> 00:46:57,041
Oh, dear.

606
00:46:57,834 --> 00:47:00,336
Sulley!

607
00:47:03,632 --> 00:47:06,092
Sulley. Great news, pal.

608
00:47:06,176 --> 00:47:08,636
I got us a way out of this mess,
but we gotta hurry.

609
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,179
Where is it?

610
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:14,266
Sull, that's a cube of garbage.

611
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,689
I can still hear her little voice.

612
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:22,108
-Mike Wazowski.
-I can hear it too.

613
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:24,944
-Mike Wazowski !
-How many kids you got in there?

614
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:26,612
Mike Wazowski !

615
00:47:28,156 --> 00:47:29,824
-Kitty!
-Boo!

616
00:47:31,743 --> 00:47:35,037
Boo, you're all right.
I was so worried. I was. . .

617
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:39,041
Don't you ever
run away from me again, young lady.

618
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:42,545
But I'm so glad you're safe.

619
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:45,756
My, what an affectionate father.

620
00:47:45,882 --> 00:47:48,718
Actually, she's my cousin's sister's. . .

621
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,303
-That's enough. Let's go.
-Mike Wazowski.

622
00:47:51,388 --> 00:47:53,889
Yeah. Step aside, kid.
We're in a. . .

623
00:48:00,939 --> 00:48:04,358
-Will you stop making Boo laugh?
-I didn't. Come on.

624
00:48:07,904 --> 00:48:10,448
I still don't understand.
You got Boo's door?

625
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:12,700
I'll explain later. Run.

626
00:48:12,784 --> 00:48:16,537
Let's move, let's move. Come on.
Please be there. Please be there.

627
00:48:16,788 --> 00:48:19,665
-There it is, just like Randall said.
-Randall?

628
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:22,168
Wait a minute. Boo, hey.

629
00:48:22,252 --> 00:48:25,004
One, two, three, four,
get the kid through the door.

630
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:29,175
-The nightmare is over.
-It's OK, Boo. What's the matter?

631
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:31,719
-It's time to move.
-Mike, what are you thinking?

632
00:48:31,803 --> 00:48:34,513
-Randall's after Boo.
-Who cares? Let's go.

633
00:48:34,598 --> 00:48:37,600
-This is a limited-time offer.
-No. I don't like this.

634
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:40,269
Sulley, you wanted her door
and there it is.

635
00:48:40,353 --> 00:48:42,855
-Now let's move.
-No, Mike.

636
00:48:43,565 --> 00:48:45,691
You want me to prove
everything's on the up and up?

637
00:48:45,776 --> 00:48:47,735
-He wants a door, I get a door.
-Wait.

638
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:49,904
Paranoid delusional furball.

639
00:48:52,115 --> 00:48:53,365
Mike!

640
00:49:52,175 --> 00:49:54,593
Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?

641
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:56,679
Sulley? Sulley!

642
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:14,989
Mike? Mike?

643
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:17,199
Where are you?

644
00:50:17,576 --> 00:50:18,909
Are you in there?

645
00:50:19,536 --> 00:50:21,036
Where are you, buddy?

646
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,830
Mike?

647
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:24,874
Where are you?

648
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:36,677
Boo, way to go.

649
00:50:44,561 --> 00:50:46,020
It's OK.

650
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:06,749
Randall, did you have to. . .

651
00:51:15,759 --> 00:51:19,053
-Yes! I got the kid.
-Oh, huzzah !

652
00:51:19,137 --> 00:51:23,098
-Great news. Not that I was concerned.
-Get over here and help me.

653
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:26,268
Come on, while we're young here,
Fungus.

654
00:51:30,357 --> 00:51:32,942
The kid needs to take off a few pounds.

655
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,366
Wazowski ! Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

656
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,452
It's cretin. If you're gonna
threaten me, do it properly.

657
00:51:43,536 --> 00:51:45,704
Second, you're nuts if you think
kidnapping me

658
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:47,623
is gonna help you cheat!

659
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,420
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

660
00:51:53,505 --> 00:51:55,089
Well, I did.

661
00:51:55,173 --> 00:52:00,010
Right up until you chuckled like that.
Now I think I should get out of here.

662
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,847
I'm about to revolutionize
the scaring industry.

663
00:52:03,932 --> 00:52:06,892
When I do,
even the great James P. Sullivan

664
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:08,727
is gonna be working for me.

665
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:11,897
Well, somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

666
00:52:11,982 --> 00:52:15,401
First I need to know where the kid is
and you're gonna tell me.

667
00:52:15,485 --> 00:52:17,277
-I don't know.
-Sure.

668
00:52:17,362 --> 00:52:19,446
I don't. I don't.

669
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:24,743
What's that? Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

670
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:27,496
Come on. No, no.
Come on. Hey, hey.

671
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,540
Hey, hey. This thing is moving.

672
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:34,503
I don't like big moving things
that are moving towards me.

673
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:36,213
No. Come on. Hey!

674
00:52:36,506 --> 00:52:41,176
-Randall !
-Say hello to the scream extractor.

675
00:52:41,886 --> 00:52:43,012
Hello.

676
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:46,348
Where you going?
We'll talk. We'll have a latte.

677
00:52:46,558 --> 00:52:49,351
Come on. We can talk about this.

678
00:52:53,523 --> 00:52:55,190
What is that thing?

679
00:52:55,608 --> 00:52:57,901
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

680
00:52:57,986 --> 00:52:59,778
No. Come on.

681
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:04,116
Help. Help! Help, help!

682
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:13,500
For. . . What did you do wrong this time?

683
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:16,879
-I don't know. I calibrated the. . .
-Go check the machine.

684
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:19,798
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

685
00:53:40,403 --> 00:53:43,572
Fungus? Fungus? You like cars?

686
00:53:44,074 --> 00:53:48,410
I got a really nice car. If you
let me go, I'll give you a ride

687
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:50,871
in the car.
Please, Fungus.

688
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:53,999
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said I'm not allowed

689
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:57,002
to fraternize with victims
of his evil plot.

690
00:54:09,265 --> 00:54:11,725
What happened?
Where's Wazowski?

691
00:54:14,938 --> 00:54:16,605
Where is he?

692
00:54:22,403 --> 00:54:25,072
-Come on.
-This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.

693
00:54:25,156 --> 00:54:26,865
That could be contaminated.

694
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,867
We gotta get out of here now!

695
00:54:28,952 --> 00:54:32,538
We could start a new life far away.
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.

696
00:54:32,622 --> 00:54:34,623
Goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.

697
00:54:34,707 --> 00:54:37,209
-No, Mike, wait.
-Hey, what are you doing?

698
00:54:37,293 --> 00:54:41,380
-Follow me. I have an idea.
-No, no, no, no, no.

699
00:54:41,965 --> 00:54:45,217
-Simulation terminated.
-No, no, no, no, no.

700
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:49,263
What was that? You're trying
to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.

701
00:54:49,347 --> 00:54:52,224
I was going for a snake/ninja approach

702
00:54:52,308 --> 00:54:54,268
with a little hissing.

703
00:54:55,228 --> 00:54:59,022
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's all about presence.

704
00:54:59,107 --> 00:55:02,442
-About how you enter the room.
-Mr. Waternoose!

705
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:04,403
James, perfect timing.

706
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:06,405
No, no, sir. You don't understand.

707
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:09,116
-Show these monsters how it's done.
-I can't.

708
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,869
-Sir, you have to listen to me.
-Pay attention.

709
00:55:11,953 --> 00:55:14,454
You're about to see
the best in the business.

710
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:17,249
-Reset the simulator.
-But sir!

711
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:19,209
-Good night, sweetheart.
-'Night, Mom.

712
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:21,253
-Kitty!
-No, Boo, no!

713
00:55:21,337 --> 00:55:25,007
-Give us a big loud roar.
-There's no time for this!

714
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:27,843
-What are you waiting for? Roar.
-But, sir. . .

715
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:29,469
Roar!

716
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:43,233
Well done. Well done, James.

717
00:55:43,526 --> 00:55:44,776
-Boo?
-All right, gentlemen.

718
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:48,197
-Right this way.
-I hope you've learned a lesson today.

719
00:55:52,702 --> 00:55:59,541
Boo.

720
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,465
Boo, it's me.

721
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:11,637
-The child !
-Sir, she isn't toxic.

722
00:56:11,721 --> 00:56:14,348
-It sounds crazy, but trust me.
-Boo?

723
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:16,558
No, no, no, no, it's OK.

724
00:56:16,643 --> 00:56:18,268
I was just. . . No.

725
00:56:18,353 --> 00:56:22,397
No, don't be scared.
That wasn't real.

726
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:25,400
It's just a. . . I was just. . .

727
00:56:39,082 --> 00:56:42,417
-Boo.
-. . .test it out on that sweet girl.

728
00:56:43,086 --> 00:56:45,545
-Boo.
-. . .have her, he is trying to kill us.

729
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:47,714
-This is Randall's fault.
-Randall?

730
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:51,343
We can take you to his secret lab
in this factory.

731
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:55,264
How could this happen?
How could this happen?

732
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:58,433
Does anyone else know about this?

733
00:56:58,518 --> 00:56:59,935
-No, sir.
-Good.

734
00:57:00,395 --> 00:57:03,605
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

735
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,400
Now, before we do anything else,

736
00:57:06,484 --> 00:57:09,611
let's take care of the child.

737
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,326
I never thought
things would come to this.

738
00:57:16,744 --> 00:57:18,453
Not in my factory.

739
00:57:19,872 --> 00:57:22,874
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this.

740
00:57:22,959 --> 00:57:24,835
Especially you, James.

741
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:27,921
But now we can
set everything straight again.

742
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:29,548
For the good of the company.

743
00:57:34,053 --> 00:57:35,887
Sir? That's not her door.

744
00:57:35,972 --> 00:57:37,806
I know, I know.

745
00:57:40,893 --> 00:57:42,394
It's yours.

746
00:57:46,774 --> 00:57:47,899
No!

747
00:57:50,278 --> 00:57:52,237
Boo!

748
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:02,122
No! No! No, no, no, no!

749
00:58:03,624 --> 00:58:06,209
It's too late.
We're banished, genius!

750
00:58:06,294 --> 00:58:08,253
We're in the human world.

751
00:58:08,338 --> 00:58:11,548
What a great idea,
going to your old pal Waternoose.

752
00:58:11,674 --> 00:58:13,925
Too bad he was in on the whole thing.

753
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,428
All you had to do was listen to me.

754
00:58:16,512 --> 00:58:20,682
Just once!
But you didn't, did you?

755
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:23,101
You're still not listening !

756
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:31,360
Take that!

757
00:58:36,908 --> 00:58:39,493
Welcome to the Himalayas.

758
00:58:42,747 --> 00:58:45,707
Abominable. Can you believe that?

759
00:58:45,792 --> 00:58:47,626
Do I look abominable to you?

760
00:58:47,794 --> 00:58:50,003
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman

761
00:58:50,088 --> 00:58:53,131
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

762
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:55,967
I'm a nice guy.
Snow cone?

763
00:58:56,928 --> 00:58:59,596
No, don't worry. It's lemon.

764
00:59:00,515 --> 00:59:03,058
How about you, big fella?
Snow cone?

765
00:59:05,728 --> 00:59:08,522
Did you see the way she looked at me?

766
00:59:11,526 --> 00:59:15,112
Poor guy. I understand.
It ain't easy being banished.

767
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:16,822
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

768
00:59:16,906 --> 00:59:21,159
When he was banished, he fashioned
an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.

769
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:23,245
Wore it on his head like a tiara.

770
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:27,207
Called himself King Itchy.
It won't be so hard for you guys.

771
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:28,708
How lucky can you get?

772
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:32,212
-Banished with your best friend.
-He is not my friend.

773
00:59:32,422 --> 00:59:36,216
I just assumed you were buddies.
When I saw you in the snow hugging. . .

774
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,344
Look at that big jerk.
Ruined my life. And for what?

775
00:59:39,429 --> 00:59:40,679
A stupid kid !

776
00:59:40,763 --> 00:59:44,015
Because of you I am now stuck
in this frozen wasteland.

777
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,394
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland.

778
00:59:47,478 --> 00:59:49,938
How about all this fabulous snow?

779
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,649
And wait till you see
the local village.

780
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:56,695
Cutest thing in the world.
I haven't mentioned the free yaks' milk.

781
00:59:57,363 --> 00:59:59,364
-What did you say?
-Yaks' milk.

782
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:01,533
Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic.

783
01:00:01,617 --> 01:00:04,035
Once you pick the hairs out
it's nutritious.

784
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,538
No, about a village.
Are there kids in it?

785
01:00:06,622 --> 01:00:09,875
Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks.

786
01:00:09,959 --> 01:00:12,419
-Where is it?
-At the bottom of the mountain.

787
01:00:12,503 --> 01:00:15,297
-A three-day hike.
-Three days?

788
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:17,382
We need to get there now.

789
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,603
You wanna go to the village?

790
01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:33,815
Rule number one out here,
always. . . No.

791
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,401
Never go out in a blizzard.

792
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:38,820
We need to get to Boo.

793
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,949
Boo? What about us?

794
01:00:44,035 --> 01:00:46,995
Ever since the kid came in,
you've ignored everything I've said,

795
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:52,250
and now look where we are!
We were about to break the record.

796
01:00:52,335 --> 01:00:55,795
-We would have had it made.
-None of that matters now.

797
01:00:56,506 --> 01:00:58,840
None of it matters?
Wait a second.

798
01:00:59,091 --> 01:01:01,092
None of it matters?

799
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:06,014
OK. No, good. Great.

800
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:09,226
So now the truth comes out, doesn't it?

801
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:14,147
Would you look at that?
We're out of snow cones.

802
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:17,025
Let me just go outside
and make some more.

803
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:21,530
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

804
01:01:22,406 --> 01:01:24,157
Does that matter?

805
01:01:25,535 --> 01:01:27,035
What about Celia?

806
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:30,372
I am never. . .
Never gonna see her again.

807
01:01:31,332 --> 01:01:33,124
Doesn't that matter?

808
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:39,673
And what about me?

809
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,051
I'm your pal. I'm your best friend.

810
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,762
Don't I matter?

811
01:01:48,933 --> 01:01:50,559
I'm sorry, Mike.

812
01:01:50,768 --> 01:01:52,727
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

813
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:55,272
I didn't mean for this to happen.

814
01:01:55,648 --> 01:01:57,524
But Boo's in trouble.

815
01:01:57,692 --> 01:02:00,777
I think there might be
a way to save her if we can just get. . .

816
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:03,363
We? Whoa. We?

817
01:02:03,573 --> 01:02:06,992
No. There's no "we" this time, pal.

818
01:02:07,368 --> 01:02:10,787
If you want to go out there
and freeze to death,

819
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,914
you be my guest.

820
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,042
Because you're on your own.

821
01:02:53,122 --> 01:02:55,290
Hey, I got more snow cones!

822
01:03:42,505 --> 01:03:45,590
Come on, George.
I know you can do this.

823
01:03:45,675 --> 01:03:47,842
I picked out an easy door for you.

824
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:51,096
In Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal.

825
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,265
You know, you're right.
Here. Take this.

826
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:56,142
Go get 'em, Georgie.

827
01:03:56,268 --> 01:03:57,727
Look out. Coming through.

828
01:03:57,812 --> 01:04:00,563
-Sorry, George.
-Hey, you can't just. . .

829
01:04:01,399 --> 01:04:02,941
Twenty-three. . .

830
01:04:08,364 --> 01:04:10,031
Out of the way!

831
01:04:15,371 --> 01:04:18,456
Finally. I never should have
trusted you with this.

832
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:21,543
Because of you,
I had to banish my top scarer.

833
01:04:21,627 --> 01:04:23,795
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

834
01:04:23,879 --> 01:04:26,047
Sullivan got what he deserved.

835
01:04:26,132 --> 01:04:29,217
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be.

836
01:04:43,149 --> 01:04:44,441
Kitty!

837
01:04:51,365 --> 01:04:53,116
-Kitty!
-Sullivan?

838
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:01,583
-Kitty!
-Sorry, Boo.

839
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:03,418
Stop him !

840
01:05:04,044 --> 01:05:05,754
Let's get you home.

841
01:05:09,383 --> 01:05:10,759
Finish him off!

842
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:22,187
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do that, Sullivan.

843
01:05:34,742 --> 01:05:35,784
Mike?

844
01:05:35,868 --> 01:05:38,369
-It's not that I don't care.
-Mike, you don't understand.

845
01:05:38,454 --> 01:05:40,580
Yes, I do.
I was just mad, that's all.

846
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:45,001
I needed some time to think, but
you shouldn't have left me out there.

847
01:05:45,628 --> 01:05:48,046
-I'm being attacked.
-I'm not attacking you.

848
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:51,633
I'm trying to be honest. Hear me out.
You and I are a team.

849
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:54,260
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

850
01:05:54,345 --> 01:05:56,471
I know. He's too sensitive.

851
01:05:58,891 --> 01:06:01,768
Come on, pal.
If you start crying, I'm gonna cry.

852
01:06:01,852 --> 01:06:04,020
And I'll never get through this.

853
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:07,148
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you,
but I am now.

854
01:06:07,233 --> 01:06:11,653
Sulley, I am baring my soul here.
The least you can do is pay attention.

855
01:06:15,825 --> 01:06:17,909
Look at that. It's Randall.

856
01:06:19,495 --> 01:06:20,703
Come on.

857
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:23,957
Get up. There can't be any witnesses.

858
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,083
There won't be.

859
01:06:25,709 --> 01:06:27,377
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

860
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:30,713
Somebody's gotta take care of you,
you big hairball.

861
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:36,427
-Schmoopsie-pooh, I can't talk.
-Come on.

862
01:06:36,512 --> 01:06:41,015
Michael, if you don't tell me what's
going on right now, we are through !

863
01:06:41,517 --> 01:06:42,559
Here's the truth.

864
01:06:42,643 --> 01:06:46,896
The kid? Sulley let her in. We tried to
send her back, Waternoose had a plot,

865
01:06:46,981 --> 01:06:49,357
and now Randall's trying to kill us!

866
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:52,819
You expect me to believe
that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?

867
01:06:52,903 --> 01:06:54,487
Mike Wazowski.

868
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:57,448
I love you, schmoopsie-pooh !

869
01:06:57,533 --> 01:07:00,618
-Hey!
-Idiots.

870
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,288
Look out. Coming through.

871
01:07:03,372 --> 01:07:06,124
Make way. Move it.
Hurry up, hurry up.

872
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:10,169
-There they are.
-Attention. employees.

873
01:07:10,254 --> 01:07:14,215
Randall Boggs has just broken
the all-time scare record.

874
01:07:14,884 --> 01:07:17,385
No, I didn't.
Get out of my way.

875
01:07:18,012 --> 01:07:19,888
Go get 'em, googly bear.

876
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,473
There it is.

877
01:07:22,558 --> 01:07:25,268
Get off my tail. Let go.

878
01:07:29,064 --> 01:07:30,565
-What are you doing?
-Grab on, Mike.

879
01:07:30,649 --> 01:07:33,610
Are you out of your mind?

880
01:07:43,495 --> 01:07:46,664
-Sulley, what are we doing?
-Get Boo's door and find a station.

881
01:07:46,749 --> 01:07:49,250
What a plan.
Simple, yet insane.

882
01:08:03,098 --> 01:08:04,641
-Whoa.
-Oh, boy.

883
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,768
Hold on !

884
01:08:15,486 --> 01:08:17,111
Don't look down !

885
01:08:32,962 --> 01:08:34,712
I'm gonna be sick.

886
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:40,218
Oh, no.

887
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:45,431
No!

888
01:08:46,809 --> 01:08:48,893
-Boo's door.
-There it is.

889
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:51,688
How are we supposed to get to it now?

890
01:08:54,984 --> 01:08:56,609
It's a dead end, Sulley.

891
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,821
-There he is.
-Make her laugh.

892
01:08:59,905 --> 01:09:01,656
-Sulley!
-Just do it!

893
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,418
-Get it open.
-Here he comes.

894
01:09:13,502 --> 01:09:15,169
Give me that kid.

895
01:09:20,217 --> 01:09:24,178
-Why couldn't we get banished here?
-We gotta find another door.

896
01:09:29,518 --> 01:09:31,310
Look! Boo's door.

897
01:09:35,941 --> 01:09:38,776
-There he is. Hurry up!
-Give me your hand.

898
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:48,327
-Come on, it slides.
-Right. Right.

899
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:54,042
Jump. I'm right behind you.

900
01:09:58,714 --> 01:10:00,173
Come on.

901
01:10:02,134 --> 01:10:03,593
Hurry up. Keep moving !

902
01:10:03,677 --> 01:10:05,386
Get inside.

903
01:10:06,263 --> 01:10:07,930
That was weird.

904
01:10:08,432 --> 01:10:09,682
Mike?

905
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:12,018
-Sorry, buddy.
-OK.

906
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,986
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.

907
01:10:26,784 --> 01:10:28,743
Great job, buddy. We lost him.

908
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:30,119
Boo!

909
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,830
No!

910
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:37,001
Nice working with you.

911
01:10:37,086 --> 01:10:38,503
-Get it open !
-I'm trying !

912
01:10:38,587 --> 01:10:41,255
-Open the door!
-Come on, get in here.

913
01:10:50,891 --> 01:10:52,100
Boo!

914
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:57,063
There they are!

915
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:03,444
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!

916
01:11:07,658 --> 01:11:10,535
-Looks like we caught the express.
-Do you see them?

917
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:12,328
Straight ahead.

918
01:11:36,061 --> 01:11:37,562
-Kitty.
-Boo.

919
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:47,738
Look at everybody's
favorite scarer now.

920
01:11:47,823 --> 01:11:50,950
You stupid, pathetic waste.

921
01:11:53,954 --> 01:11:58,166
You've been number one for too long,
Sullivan. Now your time is up.

922
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:03,588
And don't worry.
I'll take good care of the kid.

923
01:12:03,714 --> 01:12:04,881
No!

924
01:12:26,528 --> 01:12:28,905
She's not scared of you anymore.

925
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:32,491
Looks like you're out of a job.

926
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,454
OK, over the plate.
Let's see the old stuff.

927
01:12:36,538 --> 01:12:38,456
Chuck him, baby.

928
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:42,501
Here's the pitch and he is out of here.

929
01:12:43,253 --> 01:12:46,631
-Mama, another gator got in the house.
-Another gator?

930
01:12:46,715 --> 01:12:48,841
Give me that shovel. There!

931
01:12:49,426 --> 01:12:51,552
Get him, Mama. Get that gator.

932
01:12:53,513 --> 01:12:56,599
-Care to do the honors, Mikey?
-With pleasure.

933
01:13:06,193 --> 01:13:08,236
That's right, Boo. You did it.

934
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,946
You beat him.

935
01:13:10,155 --> 01:13:11,572
Come on.

936
01:13:14,576 --> 01:13:16,035
OK, Boo, it's time to go home.

937
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:19,080
Take care of yourself
and be a good girl, OK?

938
01:13:20,332 --> 01:13:23,084
-Oh, no.
-The power's out. Make her laugh.

939
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:26,254
I got a move here
that'll bring down the house.

940
01:13:30,133 --> 01:13:32,343
-Sorry. She didn't see that.
-What?

941
01:13:32,427 --> 01:13:35,554
What, did you forget to check
if her hood was up, you big dope?

942
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:38,641
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

943
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:41,435
-You know we need her to laugh.
-Right.

944
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:44,021
Hey, Boo. Just kidding. Look.

945
01:13:44,564 --> 01:13:46,565
Funny, right? See, with the. . .

946
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,111
These are the jokes, kid.
What's happening?

947
01:13:50,988 --> 01:13:52,113
Hold on.

948
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:55,700
When the door lands in the station,
cut the power.

949
01:13:55,784 --> 01:14:00,162
You'll have the child and the criminals
responsible for this whole mess.

950
01:14:01,623 --> 01:14:04,625
Great. A welcoming committee.
What are we gonna do?

951
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:21,684
This is the CDA. Come out slowly
with the child in plain sight.

952
01:14:21,768 --> 01:14:24,395
OK, OK, you got us.

953
01:14:24,688 --> 01:14:26,314
Here we are. Here's the kid.

954
01:14:26,398 --> 01:14:30,651
I'll cooperate, but before you
take us away, I have one thing to say.

955
01:14:31,862 --> 01:14:33,946
-Catch.
-231 9.

956
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:36,574
We have a toxic projectile.

957
01:14:37,284 --> 01:14:40,494
-After the suspect.
-Stop him !

958
01:14:43,749 --> 01:14:46,208
-Come on.
-Don't let them get away.

959
01:14:48,587 --> 01:14:51,130
Wait. Come back.
He has the child.

960
01:14:56,762 --> 01:14:58,888
Sullivan. Sullivan !

961
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:02,683
Give me the child. Give her to me!

962
01:15:11,693 --> 01:15:14,445
Open this door.
Open this door!

963
01:15:20,369 --> 01:15:21,619
Stop it.

964
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:23,329
Don't do it.

965
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:27,041
-Come on.
-Don't go in that room.

966
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:33,964
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You're safe now.

967
01:15:34,049 --> 01:15:35,966
You be a good girl, OK?

968
01:15:37,219 --> 01:15:40,888
-This has gone far enough, James.
-She's home. Leave her alone.

969
01:15:40,972 --> 01:15:43,557
I can't do that. She's seen too much.

970
01:15:43,725 --> 01:15:46,352
-You both have.
-It doesn't have to be this way.

971
01:15:46,436 --> 01:15:49,188
I have no choice. Times have changed.

972
01:15:49,272 --> 01:15:52,316
-Scaring isn't enough anymore.
-But kidnapping?

973
01:15:52,401 --> 01:15:55,736
I'll kidnap 1 ,000 children
before I let the company die.

974
01:15:55,821 --> 01:15:59,115
And I'll silence anyone
who gets in my way!

975
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:01,951
No!

976
01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:03,494
-Night, Mom.
-Night, sweetheart.

977
01:16:03,578 --> 01:16:05,121
-Night, Mom.
-What is this?

978
01:16:05,205 --> 01:16:08,833
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

979
01:16:09,292 --> 01:16:12,002
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys,

980
01:16:12,087 --> 01:16:14,505
but I spotted several big mistakes.

981
01:16:14,589 --> 01:16:16,507
But how did. . .

982
01:16:16,591 --> 01:16:20,010
You know what? Let's watch
my favorite part again. Shall we?

983
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:31,313
l'll kidnap 1 .000 children
before l let this company die.

984
01:16:31,982 --> 01:16:33,149
-Come with us.
-What are you doing?

985
01:16:33,233 --> 01:16:35,526
Take your hands off.
You can't arrest me.

986
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:39,113
I hope you're happy, Sullivan.
You destroyed this company.

987
01:16:39,197 --> 01:16:43,492
Monsters, Incorporated is dead !
Where will everyone get their scream?

988
01:16:43,743 --> 01:16:47,830
The energy crisis will only get worse
because of you !

989
01:16:52,711 --> 01:16:55,254
Stay where you are.
Number one wants to talk to you.

990
01:16:55,464 --> 01:16:56,922
Attention.

991
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:05,473
Hello, boys.

992
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:06,974
-Roz?
-Roz?

993
01:17:08,226 --> 01:17:12,897
Two and a half years of
undercover work were almost wasted

994
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:15,941
when you intercepted that child,
Mr. Sullivan.

995
01:17:16,776 --> 01:17:18,611
Of course, without your help,

996
01:17:18,695 --> 01:17:22,948
I never would have known that
this went all the way up to Waternoose.

997
01:17:26,912 --> 01:17:29,330
Now, about the girl.

998
01:17:29,998 --> 01:17:32,291
I just want to send her home.

999
01:17:33,168 --> 01:17:34,502
Very good.

1000
01:17:35,212 --> 01:17:38,130
-Bring me a door shredder.
-What? You mean. . .

1001
01:17:38,215 --> 01:17:40,508
You mean I can't see her again?

1002
01:17:40,926 --> 01:17:43,135
That's the way it has to be.

1003
01:17:44,638 --> 01:17:46,430
I'll give you five minutes.

1004
01:17:58,193 --> 01:18:00,694
-Well, so long, kid.
-Mike Wazowski.

1005
01:18:01,404 --> 01:18:02,530
Yeah.

1006
01:18:03,031 --> 01:18:04,198
Boo.

1007
01:18:04,282 --> 01:18:05,658
It's been fun.

1008
01:18:08,411 --> 01:18:10,579
Go ahead. Go grow up.

1009
01:18:30,725 --> 01:18:32,226
But, Boo. . .

1010
01:18:33,228 --> 01:18:34,353
Boo.

1011
01:18:35,146 --> 01:18:37,273
Look at that. You know. . .

1012
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:40,067
That's cute. Yeah.

1013
01:18:41,444 --> 01:18:42,653
Boo. . .

1014
01:18:44,197 --> 01:18:46,073
Well, that's very nice.

1015
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:49,034
Come here, you !

1016
01:18:57,002 --> 01:18:59,336
Oh. he's a happy bear

1017
01:19:05,427 --> 01:19:08,721
Nothing's coming out of your closet
to scare you anymore, right?

1018
01:19:09,472 --> 01:19:10,764
Yeah.

1019
01:19:12,809 --> 01:19:14,310
Goodbye, Boo.

1020
01:19:15,437 --> 01:19:16,604
Kitty.

1021
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:19,607
Kitty has to go.

1022
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:01,482
Boo.

1023
01:20:04,486 --> 01:20:05,694
Kitty?

1024
01:20:14,954 --> 01:20:17,998
None of this ever happened,
gentlemen.

1025
01:20:19,209 --> 01:20:23,003
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

1026
01:20:45,068 --> 01:20:46,568
Take him away.

1027
01:20:49,614 --> 01:20:51,782
I bet we get the rest of the day off.

1028
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:55,035
You idiot.
They're gonna shut down the factory.

1029
01:20:57,997 --> 01:21:00,624
When that wall went up, you should
have seen Waternoose's face.

1030
01:21:01,209 --> 01:21:03,210
I hope we get a copy of that tape.

1031
01:21:03,461 --> 01:21:04,670
Are you all right?

1032
01:21:05,088 --> 01:21:06,922
Come on, pal.
Cheer up. We did it!

1033
01:21:07,006 --> 01:21:08,465
We got Boo home.

1034
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:11,176
Sure, we put the factory
in the toilet and

1035
01:21:11,261 --> 01:21:13,429
hundreds of people
will be out of work.

1036
01:21:13,513 --> 01:21:16,390
Not to mention the mob that will
come after us when there's no power,

1037
01:21:16,474 --> 01:21:19,226
but at least we had some laughs, right?

1038
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:24,440
Laughs.

1039
01:21:44,919 --> 01:21:47,588
ls this thing on?
Hello? Hello? Testing.

1040
01:21:47,964 --> 01:21:50,340
Good evening. Nice to see you.

1041
01:21:50,425 --> 01:21:52,926
lt's great to be here in your room.

1042
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:54,762
Where are you from?

1043
01:21:56,055 --> 01:21:58,849
You're in kindergarten. right?
l love kindergarten.

1044
01:21:58,933 --> 01:22:00,893
Best three years of my life.

1045
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:04,688
Of my life.
But l love sports.

1046
01:22:04,856 --> 01:22:08,150
Dodgeball was the best.
l was the fastest one out there.

1047
01:22:08,234 --> 01:22:10,194
Of course. l was the ball.

1048
01:22:10,278 --> 01:22:12,905
l was the ball, see...

1049
01:22:13,448 --> 01:22:14,948
All right.

1050
01:22:29,589 --> 01:22:31,799
Thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.

1051
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:34,218
Remember to tip your waitresses.

1052
01:22:38,056 --> 01:22:41,225
Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota
on the first kid of the day.

1053
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:44,394
Not bad. Only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

1054
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,231
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

1055
01:22:47,357 --> 01:22:50,234
And the fact that laughter
is ten times more powerful than scream

1056
01:22:50,318 --> 01:22:51,902
had nothing to do with it?

1057
01:22:51,986 --> 01:22:55,656
Googly bear, come here, you.

1058
01:22:55,949 --> 01:22:58,283
-Schmoopsie-pooh !
-Googly.

1059
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:04,331
Girls, stop, stop, stop.

1060
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:07,274
Michael, you're such a charmer.

1061
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,859
-Did you bring the magazine?
-A whole box.

1062
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:11,653
Let me see it!

1063
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:13,822
Sulley and I made the cover, right?

1064
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,117
I don't believe it!

1065
01:23:17,535 --> 01:23:19,202
Googly bear.

1066
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:22,872
I'm on the cover of a magazine!

1067
01:23:28,998 --> 01:23:30,874
This is great.

1068
01:23:58,528 --> 01:24:00,529
-Hey, Sulley.
-Hey, Mike.

1069
01:24:00,613 --> 01:24:03,240
-I was. . .
-There's something I want to show you.

1070
01:24:03,324 --> 01:24:05,283
Close your eyes. Follow me.

1071
01:24:05,368 --> 01:24:07,953
Come on. No peeking.

1072
01:24:09,122 --> 01:24:11,081
Keep coming, keep coming.

1073
01:24:11,165 --> 01:24:12,207
-Come on.
-Mike!

1074
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:14,876
Follow the sultry sound of my voice.

1075
01:24:14,961 --> 01:24:16,086
OK, stop.

1076
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:17,462
Open 'em.

1077
01:24:20,883 --> 01:24:23,677
Mike, is that. . .

1078
01:24:23,886 --> 01:24:25,721
Sorry it took so long, pal.

1079
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:28,432
There was a lot of wood to go through.

1080
01:24:28,725 --> 01:24:31,435
It only works if you have every piece.

1081
01:24:59,338 --> 01:25:00,505
Boo?
