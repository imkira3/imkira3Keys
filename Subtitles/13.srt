1
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,667
- Mom?
- I am here.

2
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:36,833
Mom.

3
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,000
- You forgot that.
- How could I forget this.

4
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,125
Are you sure
this is the right thing?

5
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,042
It feels like it'd be better
if we thought about it.

6
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:57,833
Yeah, I do.
We don't have any other option, Clara.

7
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:01,250
We are going to be fine.

8
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,875
Okay.

9
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:16,917
If I get off early I can pick you up. Oh,
it really don't matter, I will take a bus.

10
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:22,208
I will be off early, I got a couple
of things to do for Jenny's party.

11
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't worry.

12
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,542
- Have a good day.
- You too, Mom.

13
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,500
- How you doing?
- I don't know.

14
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,458
How we're paying for all of this?

15
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,250
- We put up the house.
- I knew it.

16
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,583
It's because of you I am still alive..

17
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:17,583
- We decided it together.
- What did you all decide together?

18
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:23,375
To live on the street... for 18 years.

19
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,792
Your mother and I have been
paying on that house...

20
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,875
just to fuck it all up.

21
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,250
Next year I will be a licensed electrician.

22
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,708
So, no more illegal odd jobs.

23
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,708
Going to be fine.

24
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,167
I never wanted to be a burden.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,250
Don't say that, Dad.

26
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:53,375
I am leaving, babe.
So you got what you have been waiting for?

27
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,375
- Yeah, I got it.
- Would it be right?

28
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,917
- That's not your concern.
- You can go to hell.

29
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,583
That's exactly where I am going.

30
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,208
But if I make it back,

31
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:10,042
I going to make so much money,
you going to love me again.

32
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,583
Your brother would feel better
if family members visited more often.

33
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,583
A year is a long time
for someone in his condition.

34
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:42,583
I am the only family Ronald has.
I try to get down here as often as I can.

35
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,750
Overall, his condition is still...
borderline, Mr. Hodges.

36
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,542
To skip his medications even for a day
could be serious.

37
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,958
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,500
Sign here and here,
and Ronald is released.

39
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,417
Your brother is here, came to get you.
You have to go.

40
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,958
- They take care of you in there?
- Yeah.

41
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,292
- Good.
- It's a new car?

42
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,583
Yeah, do you like it?

43
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,000
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

44
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,667
When I turned five years old,
I got a little kitten.

45
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,917
And it was so cute that I took
them to bed with me every night.

46
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,833
I want a little lamb, and I will take
it to bed with me every night too.

47
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,167
- People don't keep sheep inside, silly.
- I will.

48
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,500
Didn't you hear?
We don't keep sheep inside...

49
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,417
and we don't take them to bed with us.

50
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:22,125
My little lamb has to be all white
with black ears.

51
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,250
Why black ears?

52
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,458
That way I won't get them mixed up
with the other sheep.

53
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:30,208
- I will be able to recognize him.
- Very clever.

54
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:32,958
Thanks, Mom.

55
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,375
What is going on, man?

56
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,458
Kico Tevero...

57
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,417
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell
you doing? Goddamn it.

58
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,958
What the fuck you doing?

59
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,750
Goddamn it.

60
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,042
Let me the fuck out of here.

61
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:23,708
Oh, shit.
Goddamn.

62
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,792
Get me the fuck out of here.

63
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,875
A lot of people would want that.

64
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,875
I am sorry.

65
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,875
Thank you.

66
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,958
That was his job, I mean
there's nothing I can do for you.

67
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,500
Maybe in a few days.

68
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:49,125
Hi, can I get you anything, coffee maybe?
I am good. No.

69
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,458
No, babe.

70
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,708
So what's this job about, man?
Dope?

71
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:01,917
No. Nothing like that.

72
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,583
- You need somebody taking care of?
- No.

73
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,333
I am just asking for a good word.

74
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,875
- What? You want to go in my place?
- Listen, I am broke.

75
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,042
I am on the street.

76
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,958
Hey, I haven't forgotten what you did
for me when I was away.

77
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,333
If this thing works out.
I will set you up. I promise.

78
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,792
- How long exactly will it take?
- One day.

79
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:32,000
Jesus. You make all that cash in one day?
If I make it.

80
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:37,458
- But you made it the last time, right?
- That was last time.

81
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,083
As long as my luck doesn't run out,
you can count on me.

82
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,083
Hey...

83
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:14,250
Vincent, do you still live at
135, Kissam Avenue, Talbot Ohio?

84
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,833
Yeah.

85
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,833
You have a phone number I can reach you
at if I have any further questions?

86
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:26,417
Sure, uh... 216-555-0145.

87
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,917
Okay Vincent, I think that about does it.
Thank you.

88
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,083
Can you recall anything else he could
have told you about this affair?

89
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:41,125
No. I already told you.
He never spoke about it.

90
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,917
- Even when he was high?
- No.

91
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:49,083
Did anyone else come into the house,
aside from the paramedics and the police?

92
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:53,833
There was an electrician.
He was the one that called 911.

93
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,333
Thank you, Mrs. Harrison.

94
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,000
Thank you.

95
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,833
Thank you.

96
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,875
- You sleep okay?
- Yeah, I feel much better now.

97
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,708
- Did you take your medication?
- No.

98
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,583
Look here...

99
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,667
you know the doctor says
that you're not supposed to skip a dose.

100
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,958
Fuck her.

101
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,750
I feel much better without it anyway.

102
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,625
Tails 40 fucking times, you know,
our luck's fucked.

103
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,333
I know, we're going to make it.
Don't pay attention to that shit.

104
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,667
You will be going for job
and nothing else.

105
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,792
- What do you think?
- You're very handsome.

106
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,542
They're going to love you.

107
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,500
Unshackle his legs.

108
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,375
Hey mister, you in charge here, you are
going to tell me what the hell's going on.

109
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,500
- How do you feel?
- How do I feel?

110
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:17,042
Hey man. I have been in this goddamn box
for two and a half days, man.

111
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:19,167
Tell me what's going on.
What do you all want from me?

112
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,667
Give him shower.
Change your clothes, something fresh.

113
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,583
Where you all taking me, man?
Fuck you.

114
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,208
- What about his stuff?
- What're you talking about?

115
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,125
Give it to him.

116
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,000
Fuck you, guys.

117
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:56,875
- Hello, Mr. Harrison?
- Yeah.

118
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:02,000
Tomorrow at noon, go to the post
next door to Grand Central.

119
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,292
- Hang on.
- 200 West 39 Street.

120
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,708
Okay.

121
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,583
With the key that you found with the
cellphone, you will open box 2-5-3.

122
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,333
Inside you will find another train ticket,
more instructions.

123
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:23,458
Your ticket will be to Macomb, but you
will get off one stop before Macomb.

124
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:28,250
- One stop "before". Is that clear?
- Yeah.

125
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,042
Ticket, please.

126
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:01,833
- He's getting off at Macomb.
- What time do we arrive?

127
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,000
Train gets in at 3:10.

128
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:09,333
Can I help you guys with anything else?
No, thank you.

129
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,833
Can I get a bottle of water
and a ham sandwich?

130
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:38,667
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
You Flink? Yeah, get in. Thanks.

131
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,042
I want to go here.

132
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,792
- You know it?
- Yeah.

133
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:01,375
- Is it far?
- No, it's right around the corner.

134
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,458
That will be $17.70.

135
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,708
- Keep the change.
- Wow, thank you.

136
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,167
Give me your phone.

137
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,542
Get in the car.

138
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:06,917
- Which number is it?
- 13.

139
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,833
Come on.

140
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,750
Stand in the middle of the carpet.

141
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,917
Take your clothes off.

142
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,750
Faster.

143
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,292
Take off the rest.

144
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:04,792
Get dressed.

145
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:11,375
You didn't find it strange dropping off
somebody in the middle of nowhere?

146
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,000
When the guy is paying me.
He's the customer.

147
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So, he can get out wherever he wants.

148
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,250
- You didn't see anything else unusual?
- No.

149
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,042
I just left him there and I left.

150
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:10,542
Follow me.

151
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,500
Have a seat.

152
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,000
Who's that?

153
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,542
I can explain.

154
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,542
- I know...
- Shut up.

155
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,500
Go get Jack.

156
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,375
You're probably wondering...

157
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,125
- what I am doing here.
- Quiet.

158
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,958
Ah, Mr. Gomer.

159
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,875
Is this young man who's playing tonight?

160
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,458
Yes, that's him.

161
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:44,625
Very couragious.

162
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,417
Two million.

163
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:16,042
Put 700 thousand, on number six.

164
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,000
What's going on?

165
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,250
Who's he?

166
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,292
What do you mean? He's the guy
I picked up at the intersection.

167
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,542
He's not who I was expecting.

168
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,542
- Well, he had the number.
- Harrison is dead.

169
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:34,042
- What are you talking about?
- He OD'th.

170
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,750
And who the fuck are you?

171
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:42,208
I am an electrician.
I was working at his house.

172
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,542
Give me your ID.

173
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,667
- Did he tell you about this?
- No, I overheard him talking.

174
00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:00,208
I knew he was waiting for a letter
and it could be a lot of money.

175
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,458
So I took it
and followed the instructions.

176
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,250
- Do you know what this is about?
- No.

177
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:09,542
No, I have no idea.

178
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,708
Follow me.

179
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,333
Do you think the cops send him?

180
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,833
Maybe we should... get out now.

181
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,833
If we leave and the cops show up...

182
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:34,375
then the others will think we ratted.
We would be dead men.

183
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,042
- Where you going?
- I should go and talk to them.

184
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,750
Excuse me, gentlemen.

185
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,167
Um...

186
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:55,583
If it's a problem... maybe, then...
then I think I should leave. I will leave.

187
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:57,917
It's too late.

188
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,583
What if I don't want to be here?

189
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,500
You have to play now.

190
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:19,833
600 thousand... on number 13.

191
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:27,500
Good luck.

192
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:44,625
Attention.
The first round is about to begin.

193
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,958
Go fuck your mother.

194
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:55,958
What's he saying?

195
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,667
Cocksucker go fuck your mother.

196
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,083
Attention.

197
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,875
You got to listen to him.

198
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:06,208
I am asking the guards
to please distribute the bullets.

199
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:09,417
One bullet to each player.

200
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:22,333
Hans, we are born only once
and we die only once.

201
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,458
You must be philosophical, huh?

202
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,958
You are the descended
of the great Schopenhauer.

203
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:01,333
I am asking all gamblers
to please step back.

204
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,083
Please, gentlemen. Back up.

205
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,833
Back up.

206
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,458
Thank you, gentlemen.

207
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,042
- Please boss.
- Have a seat.

208
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,875
Players.

209
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:30,500
Load your bullets... into their cylinders.

210
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:43,458
What's going on 13?

211
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,083
Do you have a problem number 13?

212
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:50,833
One second.

213
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:55,125
No. No. No one gets up into the ring.
I am asking you to step down immediately.

214
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,250
He doesn't know how to load his gun.

215
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,458
Do you?

216
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,375
- Pay attention.
- Open it like this.

217
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:04,333
Round.

218
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:12,125
Alright. Enough.

219
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,625
Take your places.

220
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,583
Raise your weapons.

221
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:31,917
Higher.

222
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,625
I want to see them.

223
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,958
Spin your cylinders.

224
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,833
More. More.
Keep it up.

225
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,250
Stop.

226
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:57,917
Aim.

227
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,708
Cock your hammers.

228
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,583
Number 13.
No turning around.

229
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:22,167
Players, all eyes on the bulb.

230
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:28,167
When the bulb lights up, you shoot.

231
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:23,042
Attention. Nobody move.

232
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,167
Number 13 did not shoot.

233
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,542
Mr. Joe Garver, if your man
does not shoot, we will.

234
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,167
And you will be fined.

235
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:40,042
What the fuck are you doing.
Pull the trigger.

236
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:42,583
Shoot.

237
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,375
Shoot, you son of a bitch.

238
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,792
- I am going to count, to three.
- Shoot.

239
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:50,000
- One.
- Shoot.

240
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,250
Two.

241
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,667
Everyone, out of the ring.

242
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,625
- Are you done with your little drama.
- Fuck you.

243
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,708
This is the last time you're trying
the bullshit, you get it?

244
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:41,375
Hey... how much money
they're paying you to watch my ass?

245
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,208
What the fuck is it to you.

246
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:47,875
I will give you 50 times more
what they're giving you.

247
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,125
You let me get my ass out of here.

248
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:52,750
If you got that kind of money,
why the fuck did you come here?

249
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,000
What do you think,
I just waltzed in here, huh?

250
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,833
These people kidnapped my ass.

251
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:07,167
You like money, huh?
How's two millions sound?

252
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,750
You know what you can do
with two million, huh?

253
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,292
You get all the high class pussy,

254
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:15,583
all the fancy cars, all the bubbly shit
you can drink, brother.

255
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:20,167
Well, I can't do nothing for you so,
don't even think about it.

256
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,750
What's the matter?

257
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,750
- You don't like money?
- It's impossible.

258
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,417
Come here, man.
Wait a minute.

259
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,625
Come on.
Come here, man.

260
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:51,792
- My man's out, I want to bet on yours.
- Sure.

261
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:55,042
I take 50 points of the top,
just for this round.

262
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,375
Okay.

263
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,667
- Want some morphin?
- No.

264
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,500
- They all do it...
- I said, no.

265
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,917
Hey, you lost your player, didn't you?
Son of a bitch.

266
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,375
So, you're betting on the wrong man?

267
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,542
Don't worry about him,
he has what he needs.

268
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,833
Look, I don't know
what your deal with this guy is.

269
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,542
I think I can do you one better.

270
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:37,542
60-40,
60 for you, 40 for me.

271
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:39,917
You have to bet at least 400 thousand.

272
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:42,875
Player number six,
he has the most experience.

273
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,292
- You know who I am talking about.
- I know your player.

274
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,833
Made your offer, I just made mine.

275
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,000
60-40 it is.

276
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:57,708
Place your bets, gentlemen.

277
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,042
Alright, on your feet now.

278
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,208
Move it, let's go.

279
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,042
Now.

280
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,542
- I said, move it.
- Let's go.

281
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Get him on to his feet, now.

282
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,958
You, get him on his feet.

283
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,792
On your feet, gentlemen.
On your feet.

284
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,292
Two bullets in each weapon.
Two bullets.

285
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:05,000
Players, load your bullets
into their cylinders.

286
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,875
Raise your weapons.

287
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,667
Higher.

288
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:30,542
Spin your cylinders.

289
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:41,667
- Keep it up. Keep it up.
- Faster. Faster. Faster.

290
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:50,875
Stop.

291
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,750
Aim.

292
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,542
Cock your hammers.

293
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,667
Don't look me in the eye.

294
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Eyes on the bulb.

295
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:09,250
- Out of the ring.
- Collect the weapons, now.

296
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,333
You're pretty lucky.

297
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:41,792
The bullet is in the chamber,
he didn't have time to shoot.

298
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:48,167
Lewis, one more round
and then we're through.

299
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,583
Hans.

300
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,458
Hans.

301
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,583
Bring him to me.

302
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,667
Doctor, to the ring.

303
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,000
He can not continue.

304
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:03,417
Wait, hold on. Hold on. Is this a
fucking game or a slaughterhouse?

305
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:07,500
My player didn't die in the game.
He is still alive.

306
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:13,333
- What the hell is that.
- You know the rules Mr. Taylor.

307
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:19,708
Hans.

308
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,208
Hans.

309
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,583
When you start something, you must
stay with it until the end.

310
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,333
Nobody forced you to do this.

311
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,167
You are two for two.

312
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:39,125
You are great.

313
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:41,917
You are great...

314
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:04,500
How much I win
for the first two rounds?

315
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,417
2.9 million.

316
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,667
Excuse me, sir.

317
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,208
Excuse me.

318
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,167
You need to pick your number.

319
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,667
What you got?

320
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,375
I will be standing behind Player 13.

321
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:39,083
I want to bet the 2.9 plus an
addition of 1.2.

322
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,792
If you make it to the end,
you will make a lot of money.

323
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:49,000
What the fuck do you care?

324
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,792
Just making conversation.

325
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:14,375
Three million.
Okay, three million.

326
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,625
I will give you three million dollars.

327
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:19,458
Okay, that will change your life forever.

328
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:22,000
Where you planning
on getting all this money?

329
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:23,458
Listen.

330
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:29,292
Me and a couple of my boys,
we hit this armored car in Mexico.

331
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:32,333
My two partners they got blown away.

332
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,250
I got away for about a day and a half.

333
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:38,208
I had enough time where I got rid
of the truck and I hid the money.

334
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,042
If you got that kind of money, how is
it they let you out of the prison?

335
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:45,333
You should have been a gold mine for them.

336
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:53,417
Shit man... They beat my ass in that
jail, but I didn't talk, okay?

337
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,625
I didn't say a goddamn word.
Listen, if I would have said something...

338
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:59,125
they would have smoked my ass,
and taking the money.

339
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:03,083
I got the money.
I got a lot of fucking money.

340
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:09,458
Finish the game and you will leave peacefully.
In your case there's no way you escape.

341
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:12,625
They will blow both our brains out,
before we got in to front door.

342
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,375
You have a better chance
to survive in the ring.

343
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:21,167
Please, give me something to write with it.

344
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,208
- I want my money.
- Don't worry about the money.

345
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,417
What's important,
to see you go all the way.

346
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,000
It's pretty fucked up, huh?

347
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:11,792
We two are brothers.

348
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,625
I hate that fucking number.

349
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:39,833
Bang.

350
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,917
Calm down.

351
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,208
- Just let it go.
- Calm down a little bit.

352
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:49,708
Forget about it.

353
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:06,667
Shot two already.
He shoots three, you get a bonus.

354
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:09,250
Uh-huh.
That would be wonderful.

355
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:12,792
- How much do I have?
- 1.1 million.

356
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:23,625
Listen, man...

357
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,458
I got all the details, of where I buried
all the money, there's a map here.

358
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:35,167
- Listen to me, man.
- I got a son.

359
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,542
He's doing some time.
He got another...

360
00:51:38,542 --> 00:51:41,000
I don't know 18 months to go, so...

361
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:47,500
If anything happens to me,
and I don't make it out of here...

362
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:50,333
I want you to take this note
out of my pocket,

363
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:53,500
go get that money, and I want
you to split with him.

364
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:59,667
- We got a deal?
- Okay, you got it.

365
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,667
Thirteen.

366
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,875
Number six.

367
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,792
Number three.

368
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,625
Eleven.

369
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:00,958
Eleven.

370
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,500
You can take him now.

371
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,583
You're going down.

372
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,875
What the fuck do you want?

373
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:38,375
Alright, enough.

374
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:54,833
Mr. Schlöndorf.

375
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:59,042
Why isn't your player in the ring?
He must step up immediately.

376
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:03,667
- He will be there. He will be there.
- The third round is about to begin.

377
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:08,083
- What's wrong with him?
- Just a little case of the runs.

378
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,583
Get him up there.

379
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:13,042
Come on.

380
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,667
Give him his gun.

381
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:38,625
For the third round,
I will ask the guards to distribute...

382
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:43,375
three bullets to each player.

383
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,667
Three bullets.

384
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,125
Sir, please.

385
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:09,750
Can I please have a chair for my player?
He's not feeling too well.

386
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:19,667
That guy wants a chair for Number 3.
He's got a hard time standing.

387
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:20,917
Get him a chair.

388
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:40,250
Thank you.

389
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:47,292
Players... load the bullets
in their cylinders.

390
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,750
Raise your weapons.

391
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:08,000
Spin your cylinders.

392
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,083
More.

393
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,625
Stop.

394
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,792
Aim.

395
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,083
Cock your hammers.

396
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:44,667
All players... eyes on the bulb.

397
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:19,250
- Out of the ring.
- Collect the weapons.

398
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:38,542
Gentlemen, we are at the last stage
of our game.

399
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:40,250
The duel.

400
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,917
On the table, there are five balls.

401
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:48,208
Three white, two black.

402
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:52,333
The black, will designate the duelists.

403
00:57:53,792 --> 00:58:02,458
I will now call the gamblers
representing number 6, 9, 13, 17 and 3.

404
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:14,542
I will ask that you unwrap the balls,
high above your heads...

405
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:20,458
so that everyone can see.
Gentlemen, good luck.

406
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,625
Gentlemen, place your bets.

407
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:51,917
Okay. Wait. Wait.

408
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:55,833
I am not accepting any offers
under 85 percent.

409
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,458
Nothing less than 300 thousand.

410
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:39,000
Hey. Let him go.

411
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,792
What the fuck are you doing?
Nobody touches the survivors. Nobody.

412
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,333
Fuck.

413
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:59,667
You know that story I told you about,
and all that money?

414
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:03,458
All that money I told you about. Huh?

415
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:06,458
All that money you think
you were going to be holding on to...

416
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:08,583
huh? All that money?

417
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:12,125
You think you would have been
a holding on to, Jimmy,

418
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,167
would have been your dick.
Okay, son?

419
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:19,000
Happy trails, partner.

420
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:31,833
What's going up between you two?
I just want to get the fuck out of here.

421
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,958
Well get dressed and come get your money.
You free to go.

422
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:23,750
# Happy trails to you.
Until we meet again. #

423
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:31,458
# Happy trails to you, motherfuckers,
until we meet again. #

424
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,833
# Happy trails to you. #

425
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:43,083
Mr. Gomer.

426
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:47,958
I would like to bet on your boy.

427
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:52,375
Our player has no experience, and at
this stage of the game, it's important.

428
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:58,792
- How much do you want?
- I want 80 percent.

429
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:02,000
No, no, no, no, no.
That's too much.

430
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:05,083
The two brothers they're not offering
you much better.

431
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,792
Besides we launch out at 5 to 1,
You'd make more money,

432
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,042
everyone is betting on them.

433
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:13,125
Yeah.

434
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:18,000
Alright, we will do business.

435
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,708
- It's almost time number one.
- Oh.

436
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:39,667
If this works out well, Jasper.
I want my fucking share.

437
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:46,208
Of course. But there's not a
lot of people betting on us.

438
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,292
We're not going to be able
to make that much money.

439
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,083
Shut your fucking mouth, you cunt.

440
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,667
Shut your fucking mouth.

441
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:03,292
I fucking know you.

442
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,792
I know you.

443
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:19,958
Oh, I have been, uh...
thinking a lot, lately.

444
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,333
What're you talking about?

445
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:38,208
Mummy and daddy had left you
enough money to look after me.

446
01:03:44,792 --> 01:03:48,542
You stucked me in that fucking hospital.

447
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:54,208
- That hospital cost me a lot of money.
- Hm...

448
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,250
You have earned more money on me playing
this fucking game in these past years.

449
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,417
- And you're a fucking monster.
- That's horseshit.

450
01:04:09,417 --> 01:04:13,625
When I am in that certain hell,
I want my fucking money.

451
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,125
Against the wall.

452
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:34,500
Against the wall.

453
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,000
- Shit.
- What?

454
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,583
The trigger's too fucking tight.
It's too big.

455
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:44,292
They're all the same.

456
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:56,917
Thirteen.

457
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:03,708
Six.

458
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:12,750
One.

459
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Two.

460
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:20,000
Three.

461
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,500
- Good for you?
- Okay.

462
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:53,458
Players to the center of the ring.

463
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,542
Raise your weapons.

464
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,500
Spin your cylinders.

465
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:29,708
More.

466
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:35,208
Stop.

467
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,333
Aim.

468
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,458
Cock your hammers.

469
01:06:53,958 --> 01:07:00,083
Eyes on the bulb.
When it lights up, you shoot.

470
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:59,833
Attention, gentlemen.
The duel will continue.

471
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:05,750
I will ask for an additional bullet,
in each cylinder.

472
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:12,208
One, two, three... four.

473
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:24,625
One, two, three... four bullets.

474
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:41,583
Players, please step forward.

475
01:08:51,042 --> 01:08:52,583
Raise your weapons.

476
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,042
Spin your cylinders.

477
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,000
More.

478
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:20,958
Stop.

479
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,417
Aim.

480
01:09:28,792 --> 01:09:30,292
Cock your hammers.

481
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:37,750
When the bulb lights up, you shoot.

482
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:09,542
I win my bets,
when the odds are against me.

483
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,500
- Gentlemen.
- The game is over.

484
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:26,083
It's finished.

485
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:36,625
And the winner... is Number 13.

486
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:43,417
Congratulations, 13.
Congratulations.

487
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:56,750
Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck it.

488
01:11:12,542 --> 01:11:17,167
Well done, young man.
Well done.

489
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:27,792
Have a seat.

490
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:51,750
...Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

491
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:59,083
Congratulations.
1 million 850 thousand dollars.

492
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:03,125
You realize how lucky you are?

493
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:06,583
Your opponent won his last three duels.

494
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
- Are you satisfied?
- Yeah.

495
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,708
If you want we can give you a ride.

496
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:31,750
- Where?
- It doesn't matter.

497
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:35,542
We can drop you off to the nearest
train station if... you like.

498
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:41,958
Yeah, I will get my things
I meet you downstairs.

499
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:47,083
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

500
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:55,167
- Where you going?
- I am going with him.

501
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:03,333
Why don't you go to the room,
get our coats.

502
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,042
I couldn't find him.

503
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:36,333
Get in the car.

504
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,208
Sir, your total is going to be 38.

505
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:11,167
Thank you.

506
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,000
Hi.

507
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:42,542
Hi, Officer Stellar. This is Claudio,
the cab driver from yesterday.

508
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:44,042
Yeah.

509
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,708
Yeah, I just saw your guy.
Yeah, at the station.

510
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:51,500
Huh? Yeah, he's here now.

511
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:19,750
That's him, right there.

512
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,042
- He's on your side.
- That's your guy. That's him.

513
01:17:23,042 --> 01:17:24,292
Blue jacket, seated.

514
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:32,958
Excuse me, sir,
come with us, please.

515
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:48,167
- You want him uncuffed?
- Uncuff him.

516
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,708
Leave us alone.
Thank you.

517
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:16,167
Where did you hide the money?

518
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,292
I don't know what you're talking about?

519
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:22,958
Sit down.

520
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:27,833
I said, sit down.

521
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,083
You're not under arrest, Vincent.

522
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:43,250
And you won't be as long as you tell me
everything that went on out there.

523
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,250
- I never met them.
- Don't bullshit me.

524
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:51,708
I am telling the truth.

525
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:54,833
Why did they pick you up
at the intersection...

526
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,333
if they're looking for Harrison.

527
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:01,083
The driver didn't know Harrison.

528
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,458
When he pulled up,
I flashed him the signal.

529
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:05,833
A signal?

530
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:09,292
A piece of cardboard with a number.

531
01:19:23,542 --> 01:19:26,750
- Where did he drop you?
- Somewhere in the forest.

532
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,292
What happened?

533
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:33,375
When I got there, there were
2 other guys waiting in another car.

534
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:38,458
When they saw me, I knew I was screwed.

535
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:43,500
I told them Harrison was dead,
and I was willing to take his place.

536
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:48,292
But they didn't go for it. Either
they didn't believe me, or whatever.

537
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,167
But they didn't want me to be there.

538
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:56,500
I saw one of the men had a gun.
When he reached for it, I reacted.

539
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,750
I ran and I just kept running.

540
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:03,417
- Did they chase you?
- They chased me, they shot at me.

541
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:07,917
But I just kept running.

542
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:11,750
I ran so hard that I lost the heels
of my shoes.

543
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:28,250
If you saw them again,
would you be able to identify them?

544
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,583
Of course.

545
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,417
Could you take me to that place
in the forest?

546
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:39,250
I was in a panic.
I have been running for hours.

547
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:43,083
It was dark. How the fuck do you
expect me to remember where I was?

548
01:20:43,792 --> 01:20:47,583
But if we took you to that intersection,
you'd get your bearings, right?

549
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:52,542
The driver blindfolded me.

550
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,792
You're lying.

551
01:20:57,375 --> 01:20:58,792
I am telling the truth.

552
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,750
Put your boots back on.

553
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:28,333
Can I go now?

554
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:46,125
Twenty two dollars please.

555
01:24:04,792 --> 01:24:06,042
Hello?

556
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,292
- Mom?
- Vince.

557
01:24:09,292 --> 01:24:12,667
How's dad?
How is everything?

558
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:15,500
Everything is the same.
He was wondering about you.

559
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:19,917
- Where are you?
- I am still in Chicago.

560
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:25,042
- How much longer?
- Not long, I will be home soon.

561
01:24:25,042 --> 01:24:30,083
What... what happened? Everything go okay?
Listen mom, I send some money in the mail.

562
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,333
Certified mail.

563
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:35,375
- Money?
- A lot of money.

564
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:39,583
If you are not home,
have Clara wait for it, okay.

565
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:42,250
What do you mean money?
From where?

566
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:46,000
I will explain everything later.
Just make sure somebody is home.

567
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:50,750
You're scaring me, Vincent.
Are you in trouble?

568
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:55,500
No, everything's fine. Just make sure
somebody is home tomorrow, okay.

569
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,917
Vincent, please tell me what's going on.
I love you.

570
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,250
Eighteen twenty-five.

571
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:18,708
How much for the lamb?

572
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:23,958
- It's not for sale.
- I will give you 100 bucks.

573
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:26,083
- For the lamb?
- Yeah.

574
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:37,708
It's snowing.

575
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:43,708
Yeah.

576
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:51,542
Going far?

577
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:55,500
I am going home.

578
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:58,792
Where?

579
01:29:01,917 --> 01:29:03,625
Ohio.
