2
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:15,061
Hey Sinbad, do you have
any idea where we're going?

3
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:18,098
Nope. Why should
I start that now?

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,037
Hold up, Hold up,
Hold up, Hold up.

5
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:27,407
Is my treasure hunting
interfering with your online
dating?

6
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,976
As a matter a
fact, it is.

7
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:33,079
I want to see what kind
of women are available here.

8
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,016
You know, you mind
shutting that thing that's below
your nose?

9
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:38,088
It's making a lot of noise.
I'm trying to focus here, man.

10
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:41,724
What is this?

11
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,139
You can't die yet.

12
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:00,743
You still owe me a
thousand bucks.

13
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:06,746
Leave it. A
millennia from now maybe

14
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:09,082
two guys will find it, convince
somebody it's a historic relic

15
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:11,284
and make a big pile of money.

16
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:14,754
But what if--
No. Nothing.
Come on. I found it.

17
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:16,059
Man.

18
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:20,931
This is where he hide.

19
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:28,936
Wait. So Perseus hid his
treasure in Mexico?

20
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:30,671
This place wasn't called
Mexico back then.

21
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,745
Perseus was just staring at a
big black map looking for a
place to hide his fortune.

22
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,046
You see, when the kid who killed
medusa be came an old man,

23
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:41,882
he went crazy with Dementia.

24
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:44,251
He was convinced Zeus was
after his fortune.

25
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:48,823
So he packed up his ship and
spent 10 years searching for the
perfect place to hide it.

26
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:51,862
Eventually, he hoarded all his
wealth up in a cave.

27
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,098
This cave.

28
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:00,100
Wait, so Perseus discovered
the New World?

29
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:01,971
Yeah. It's all in my book.

30
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:04,138
At least what should be my book.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,711
Sinbad, not now.

32
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:11,010
How did we even get
in this place?

33
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:13,717
Same way Perseus killed Medusa.

34
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,223
Through the neck.

35
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,396
Open sesame.

36
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:42,812
The treasure of Perseus.

37
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:56,826
Whoo.
What? Oh yeah.

38
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,808
Someone's been here.
Recently.

39
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,011
Why didn't they take nothing?

40
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:20,414
Probably some academic moron who
wants to preserve this place.

41
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,949
How do you even know that?

42
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,919
Because I use to be one of those
academic morons.

43
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:26,523
Let's hurry.

44
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:31,528
Oh yeah. That's nice.
That's nice.

45
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:41,568
That's nasty, man. Look,
just leave it, alright?
Let's just go.

46
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,836
No, no, no.

47
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,872
This bitch made it personal.

48
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:48,408
I'm going to sell this thing and
buy a yacht the size of a
football field.

49
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:07,127
Hi.
We were just browsing.

50
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,896
What kind of return policy do
you guys have?

51
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:13,202
Who are you?
- We were just leaving.

52
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:15,271
RUN!

53
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,441
Want that?

54
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:31,187
Ha Ha!

55
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:36,091
Get him!

56
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,297
Go! Go! Go!

57
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:44,066
Oh, come on.

58
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:52,408
Whoo!

59
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:08,290
That kid just stole the next
atom bomb.

60
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,360
I want it back.

61
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,967
Find him immediately.
Understood?
-Yeah.

62
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,571
Left this though.

63
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,510
Oh.

64
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:33,079
You should log into his
Facebook. Say something stupid.
-Ssh! Don't talk.

65
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:41,615
Ten thousand dollar.
My final offer.
The gold alone
is worth that.

66
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:45,119
Fine. The new price is nine
thousand.
-Nine? What happened to ten?

67
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:47,120
You annoy me.
Service charge.

68
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:49,790
Wait, have you actually sucked
the life right out of a man?

69
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,393
Because right now I feel like I
w ant a divorce and we're not
even married.

70
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:57,096
So go sell it somewhere
else. But I doubt they'll
give you cash today.

71
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:59,632
Come on. Throw in some
hazard pay? I almost go
shot getting this.

72
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:02,136
Who did you try to
kill for this?

73
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,504
They tried to kill me.

74
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,672
Were they government?

75
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,273
No. Fortune hunters like me.
Big guy had an eye patch.

76
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:11,745
The other was wearing
a thingy. Like--
-The other one...

77
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:16,216
Was he a bit of a...dandy?

78
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:18,351
Do you interrupt everybody's
conversations?

79
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:24,193
I was going to introduce you
after our deal. Sinbad, meet
Ace Adar.

80
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,327
I'm an aficionado of you,
young man.

81
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,329
Well that sound a little
bit dirty.
-No.

82
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:34,603
Half of my collections at home
are pieces you've found and sold
to Lyta here.

83
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:37,603
Anything of interest?

84
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:40,206
No artifacts this time.
Just gems.

85
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:44,211
"Just gems." Lyta, give me what
I need for my boat so I can
leave town

86
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,812
and end our torrid love affair.

87
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:49,319
Ooh!
-Ooh! You hurt so good.

88
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:53,687
Careful. That gave me a
chemical burn when I
touched it.

89
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,425
Oh.

90
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,727
Fascinating.

91
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,660
Do you know what this is?

92
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:01,364
Oh, Oh yes.

93
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,634
I believe you found the
Heart of Medusa.

94
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:08,735
Legend says that while her eyes
could turn a man to stone,

95
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,504
her heart could turn the
world to stone.

96
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:14,440
Sounds like a premium
price to me.

97
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:15,875
Wow.

98
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:18,211
I'll give you twenty five
thousand for the stone.

99
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:21,214
Ooh, and double for the
scimitar.

100
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:22,682
This isn't for sale.

101
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:24,151
No?

102
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,388
No.

103
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:29,223
Some things can't be bought.

104
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:30,456
Blasphemy!

105
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,591
My Dad gave this to me.

106
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:34,427
He said it was handed down by
Old SIndibad himself.

107
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:39,166
Wait. Seven Seas-Arabian
Knights Sindibad?

108
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:43,073
Maybe. All I know for sure is
that it's a great way to open up
champagne bottles.

109
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:45,339
Ah. Oof.

110
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,474
If that's the true Scimitar
Sindibad,

111
00:08:47,476 --> 00:08:49,876
they opened up throats of
both men and demigods.

112
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:52,211
I don't believe in any of that.
My Dad did.

113
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,214
He even said I look like him.

114
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,849
You do.

115
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,352
Look.

116
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:01,190
See. Here.

117
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,792
You must forgive me. I forget
that trinkets I collect are
family heirlooms.

118
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:08,865
I have more of your history at
my home in Los Angeles.

119
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,898
That's okay.
You keep it.

120
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,232
No, no. I insist.

121
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:18,340
It hasn't brought me luck. Maybe
it'll make your wish come true.

122
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:22,576
See, already working.

123
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:24,280
Hey!

124
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,416
I'm the buyer.
You're the seller.

125
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:31,588
You keep talking dirty to me,
Lyta. You're turning me on.

126
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:35,889
And if you're serious about
buying a boat,

127
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:39,429
may I suggest you do so
and lay low.

128
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:45,631
The men who I met at the cave.
The "dandy." You know them?

129
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,402
Yes, I do.

130
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,606
He sounds like Manta.

131
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,972
Another collector of rare
antiquities. Except for one
difference.

132
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:54,908
Not as weird?

133
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,477
To me, artifacts are a
taste of history.

134
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:02,682
But to Manta, they are weapons
of magical destruction.

135
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:06,419
Weapons? Come on,
you believe that?

136
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:08,688
No, no, no.
But Manta does.

137
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,427
Rumors are he slaughtered
an entire Amazon tribe with
the amulet of

138
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,462
Silverado in an attempt
to look eternally young.

139
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,398
Trust me. It didn't work.

140
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,899
Why didn't he just use
photoshop?

141
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:24,538
You joke now. But Manta is
deadly serious about his
tactics.

142
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,241
Well then let's get together
and kick this guy's ass.

143
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,379
- I ain't afraid of him.
- You should be.

144
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:38,420
I'm leaving for California
tonight. I'm curious to find out
more why Manta wants this stone.

145
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,254
Please join me.

146
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:42,822
My estate is secluded
and off the grid.

147
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:45,792
You'll be safe if Manta
chooses to look for you.

148
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:48,394
I'm not hiding from this guy.
Especially not in LA.

149
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:50,998
If Manta messes with me,
I'll mess back.

150
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,301
Besides, this time tomorrow
I'll be half-way to Chile.

151
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:57,504
Well if you reconsider,

152
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:00,673
you always have an ally and
a confidant in me.

153
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,475
Like you I keep a low profile,

154
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:05,278
but you can always find my
consignment shop in

155
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,913
the city's Tehrangeles market.

156
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,482
That's my card.

157
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:11,518
Lyta, always a pleasure.

158
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,889
Good luck to you.

159
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:28,034
I already took out my
twenty percent.

160
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:30,003
Why are you giving me more?

161
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:32,976
Consider it my donation to the
"Snarky Bitch Club."

162
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,760
So how we make out?
- We got enough for the boat.

163
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,226
The good one.

164
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,828
Aye, aye, captain.

165
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,999
So we'll set sail tomorrow.
Or we could go north?

166
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,701
I'm never going back to
the United States.

167
00:12:01,703 --> 00:12:03,602
What?
-Hey.

168
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:05,574
Do you think I look
like this guy?

169
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,942
Nah. He's actually
good looking.

170
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,510
Really?

171
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,679
Pack up. We're leaving in
the morning.

172
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,215
Why so soon?

173
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:18,451
You want to be around if eye
patch and that Russian guy track
us back here?

174
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:20,455
Good point.

175
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:26,092
Weapons of magical destruction.

176
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:29,364
WMDs.

177
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:54,620
Hola.

178
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:55,757
Jax?

179
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:58,759
What are you trying
to do kill me?

180
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,427
Why are you sneaking
in here?

181
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,432
I didn't think you'd be home.

182
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,535
Oh God.

183
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,804
Here, I'll get you some ice.

184
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:09,939
How did you find me?

185
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,706
Who did you think I was-
The cops?

186
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,578
Yes. I mean, no.

187
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,413
Ow!

188
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,581
There.

189
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,517
Does that feel better?

190
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:23,582
You're making it worse.

191
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,652
Oh, you big baby.

192
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,691
Just hold it on there
for a minute.
-There's no bag.

193
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:33,192
Jax.

194
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:34,461
What are you doing here?

195
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:39,899
Well I'm spending the
summer here studying old
missionary customs.

196
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:43,135
And then when I saw
you were also here--
-No one knows I'm here.

197
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:45,004
You have a
snapchat account.

198
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:49,978
With pictures of yourself
in San Lucas.

199
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:53,816
- I like they way the
filters make me look.

200
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:55,749
Yeah.

201
00:13:55,751 --> 00:14:00,086
Well, I hope that you're not
that upset that I brought it.

202
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,022
I thought it might help
patch things up.

203
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,456
Patch things up?

204
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,759
Okay. Maybe patch is
the wrong word.

205
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,528
Pants can be patched.
Tires can be patched.

206
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,198
You can find pumpkins in a
patch. But my reputation--

207
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,902
I'm sorry! Look, how many times
do I have to say that I'm sorry.

208
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:17,637
I'm sorry that your father
ruined my reputation.

209
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,505
You can't blame him forever.

210
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:21,707
He stole my work and then blames
me for what he stole.

211
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,811
Okay. You know what,
you're right.

212
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:27,246
It was a stupid
thing to do.

213
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:30,484
He was afraid he'd
lose tenure.

214
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,918
Well I lost my degree
and now spend my time
hiding from the law.

215
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,788
That was your choice, Sinbad.
-Was it?

216
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,225
Sinbad, you stole the
university's collection

217
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,794
of Egyptian dynasty
gems and then you sold
them online.

218
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:46,668
- Because I was very,
very upset.

219
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:53,273
Are you trying to
decapitate me?

220
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,944
Jealous of my skills?

221
00:14:55,511 --> 00:15:00,683
Oh yeah. I am just heartbroken
over you skills.

222
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,952
Seriously, Sinbad.

223
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:07,287
You could have been the
greatest archeological
professor in the world.

224
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,891
Now you're just a
lousy thief.

225
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:14,159
I prefer the term
undercover entrepreneur.

226
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:15,495
Oh really?

227
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,532
Then how come you can't do
any better than selling

228
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:22,635
buried treasure to old
crone Lyta downtown, huh?

229
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:24,538
At least I'm honest
about who I am.

230
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,908
- Well.

231
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:29,075
He did put you
in the book.

232
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:30,780
See.

233
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:35,150
"Special thanks to
Sinbad Siridad."

234
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,620
Really?

235
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:46,194
I want to help you start over.

236
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:49,763
Why?

237
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:52,097
Because if you really wanted to
be a criminal,

238
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:55,704
then I wouldn't still be
in love with you.

239
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:00,509
Okay.

240
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,615
Here's my "special thanks."

241
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:20,059
And then out of nowhere, this
cyclops comes running--
-He wasn't a cyclops.

242
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:22,696
It was a bloody cyclops.
Just because a guy
wears an eye patch

243
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:25,230
doesn't make him a "cyclops."
-I bet he was born with one eye.

244
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:26,798
Well, you only
have one ball.

245
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,303
Sinbad and his bad jokes.
Remember buddy, I own half the
deed on this mine.

246
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:33,974
- I know.
- So we set sail tomorrow.

247
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:36,208
Alright, well we have a 90 foot
schooner.

248
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,645
It's a traditional Turkish motor
sailer with a transform stern.

249
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,081
Technically, it's a 35 foot
fishing boat with an off
board motor.

250
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,619
Do we have a crew?
-Are we just gonna go with those
dudes you found on Craigslist?

251
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,052
You know they
work cheap.

252
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:48,623
Sebastian?

253
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:55,361
As long as you're on board,
I'm fine.

254
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:57,730
Wait. So you're going to
trust a deaf guy over me?

255
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:00,033
Any day. No one's more
trustworthy than a man

256
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,701
who can't hear anything.

257
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,869
Was that even sign language?
 -Nah.

258
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:05,171
Sebastian reads lips.

259
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,343
I was just trying to
look smart.
-Hmm.

260
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,111
See you tomorrow.

261
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:17,953
The rest of you, godspeed
and wadaeaan.

262
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:19,685
Wadaeaan?

263
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:20,554
I'm embracing my culture.

264
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:22,321
So now you're embracing
your culture?

265
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:25,126
Help me pack up the rest of this
stuff. Just the essentials.

266
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:32,268
Hmm.

267
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:38,674
See you on the boat,
baby.

268
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:46,846
Really?

269
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:47,747
What?

270
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:48,948
I thought we were gonna,

271
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,019
explore the women of the world
and screw the seven seas.

272
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:55,387
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
still gonna do that.

273
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:57,222
With your girlfriend
around?

274
00:17:57,224 --> 00:17:59,925
Nah. Well, you know, she--
she's like--

275
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:02,162
You bought her a flower.
You're in love.

276
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,163
I'm- I'm not in love.

277
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,897
You are hopelessly devoted.

278
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:07,703
No. I'm just...

279
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:09,803
yeah. Yeah.
I'm in love.

280
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,203
But she's coming with us,
alright?

281
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:14,274
It's my boat, too. So do you
have a problem with that?

282
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,175
No.

283
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:18,044
Very chivalrous
of you.

284
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:20,279
- I'm going to take
a shower.

285
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,885
She's a lucky lady,
Nicky boy!
Yeah. Yeah.

286
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:30,289
May we come in?

287
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,093
Nick!

288
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:34,730
Get out of the shower.

289
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:36,698
Now.

290
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,367
The Heart of Medusa.

291
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,737
We know you stole it.

292
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,110
What?

293
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:52,479
Remember Cyclops and the
Russian guy we met at the cave?

294
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,446
Yeah?

295
00:18:54,448 --> 00:19:00,153
I think they sent Charlie's
pissed off angels to get their
stuff back.

296
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:02,458
What? Dude, there's
nothing right there?

297
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,199
Let me ask one more time.

298
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:15,201
Or do you prefer a
different language.

299
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:19,506
- Where is the Heart of Medusa?

300
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:22,812
I don't have what you want.

301
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:26,980
I still smell her
heart on you.

302
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:30,349
The stone's residue
sours the skin.

303
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:32,519
I didn't hold anyone's heart.

304
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:38,293
How can you lie when the proof
is branded on your skin?

305
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:45,298
If you're talking about the
emerald, I sold it.

306
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,235
Who did you give it to?

307
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:55,008
This one's a fighter.

308
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,012
Manipulate the coward instead.

309
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:06,986
Tell us where the heart is. Or
rip your friend's out instead.

310
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,288
Why just his heart?

311
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,058
When he has such other
such delicate intimacies
we can rip open.

312
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,426
I sold the damn thing.

313
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:18,431
To who?
- To a woman who I thought was
the world's biggest bitch.

314
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,866
Until you walked in
the door.

315
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:22,902
Ow!

316
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:25,974
Man, come one, Sinbad. Man,
Stop pissing them off!

317
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:31,146
Look, it was Lyta.
Lyta!

318
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,179
How do we know you're
not lying?

319
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,417
Because this one is crying.

320
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,983
Who the hell are you guys?

321
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:42,323
You're a man. You don't get
to ask me questions.

322
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:50,496
You're Arabian?

323
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,434
You know him?

324
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,567
You ladies want this, too?

325
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:58,605
What do you think this place is-
QVC?

326
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,374
When I get that stone back,

327
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:04,376
I'm coming back here to break
open your head

328
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:08,413
the same way it broke mine.
-And mine!

329
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,128
Sinbad?

330
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:28,902
It's Lyta.

331
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,439
- It's still there.
- Huh?

332
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:35,508
What a nightmare.

333
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,951
I know who did this.

334
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:20,553
They think it was an
animal attack.

335
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,555
I had no idea they'd
kill her.

336
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:24,457
Who?

337
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,125
Three women.

338
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:30,198
They knocked me out before I
could her they were coming for
the emerald they sold.

339
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:33,132
Why didn't they
come back for me?

340
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:36,336
I should tell them.
-No, wait.

341
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:37,738
You're on probation.

342
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,508
They'll probably just blame
you so they have an easy
case to close.

343
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,676
I can't stand back
and do nothing.

344
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:48,647
Okay. Well, why don't
you try telling them
what's going on?

345
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:51,219
The I can see
if I can help.

346
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:55,087
So what's so special about
this amulet that you had?

347
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:58,590
Someone told me it's the
Heart of Medusa.

348
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:01,462
The Heart of Medusa?

349
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:03,596
Oh my God.

350
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:05,765
Who all knows that
you have this?

351
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,334
I was chased down
by a Russian guy.

352
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:11,371
Manta?
Manta Marquis?

353
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:12,939
How do you know
about him?

354
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:16,409
I was the one who told him where
to find the Heart of Medusa in
the first place.

355
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:20,512
You told someone else of my
theory of Perseus burying his
treasure out here?

356
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:23,685
Okay. I's not just
your theory.

357
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:28,688
Look, we shouldn't talk here.

358
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,195
It's not safe.
Let's go to my office.

359
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:45,206
That's them.

360
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,443
Who are they?

361
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:51,076
The Furies.

362
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:55,280
The living manifestations
if vengeance,

363
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:57,115
Jealousy,

364
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:59,288
and unresting rage.

365
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:02,188
So Manta hired three look
a-likes to scare me into

366
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,323
giving back the
Heart of Medusa?

367
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,362
That guy is sick.

368
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,195
And you led them to me.

369
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:15,036
Or maybe she
led you to me.

370
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:17,670
What the hell are
you doing here?

371
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:20,539
I came to render additional
services from the doctor,

372
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:26,348
but instead I find her
keeping interesting company.

373
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,550
What's going on?

374
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,384
You two know each other?

375
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,684
We had a deal.

376
00:24:32,686 --> 00:24:35,288
Or so I thought.

377
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,825
Manta hired me to map out
a potential location of
Medusa's heart.

378
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,492
And when Dad's book was
published--

379
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:43,064
A book based on my theories.

380
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:46,467
A lot of people came out
looking for treasure.

381
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:50,403
Fortune hunters like Manta
hire me all the time to help
them map out spots.

382
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,306
I had no idea he'd
actually find it.

383
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:56,145
But I did.

384
00:24:56,711 --> 00:25:02,448
And now I find you coercing
with the man who stole it. Why?

385
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,588
No. You tell me why you killed
Lyta to get it back.

386
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:08,755
Or maybe you know?

387
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,724
How dare you accuse me of
being involved in that. I
don't even know this guy.

388
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:15,795
Once he paid me for the map,
I was done with him.

389
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:19,298
I've spilled no blood.
Yet.

390
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,334
You just have your
women do it for you.

391
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,573
I don't associate with
the newer sex.

392
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:32,278
They're devious, as the
good doctor proves.
Where is the stone?

393
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,214
Lyta sold it. Ask her.
Oh, wait. You can't,

394
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:37,650
because she's kind
of dead now.

395
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:41,287
Its too bad. I thought
you might know.

396
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,490
Kill them.
Starting with her.

397
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:22,361
You okay?

398
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:26,201
I am the great Manta.

399
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:30,469
Wow.

400
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:32,907
He's so strong, AHH!

401
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,756
So we're getting a boat and
leaving tonight, right?

402
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,390
In this storm? No way.

403
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:52,624
We have to wait
till morning.

404
00:26:52,626 --> 00:26:54,794
But what if Manta
find us here?

405
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:59,999
Trust me. If Manta finds us in
here we are more than prepared.

406
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:07,405
What's wrong?

407
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:10,242
What is it?
-That guy threw one
hell of a punch.

408
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:12,613
Here. Let me see it.

409
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:20,819
Does that hurt?

410
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:23,888
A little bit.
-Yeah.

411
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,328
Yeah. It's a
little blue.

412
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,398
No. Doesn't hurt.

413
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,634
So who did you sell the
Heart of Medusa to?

414
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:38,506
Never you mind who I
sold that heart to.

415
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:45,044
Sinbad, I'm serious.

416
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:48,580
What's to stop Manta from
going after that guy?

417
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:50,016
We made a deal under
the table.

418
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:51,951
Lyta doesn't keep records.

419
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:55,453
There's no way Manta can
find out who it is.

420
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:57,789
Don't you think you should
warn the buyer?

421
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,561
This buyers isn't
afraid of Manta.

422
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,335
And I don't want you
to be either.

423
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:13,675
I am. I feel responsible for
getting you into this mess.

424
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:16,310
Well make it up to me.

425
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:22,882
What?

426
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:25,753
You afraid of remembering how
much you like kissing me?

427
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:32,325
No. I just don't want to
lose you again.

428
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,060
I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you.

429
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:38,064
It's not me that I'm
worried about.

430
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,699
It's you.

431
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,701
Why?

432
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,868
Someone has to
worry about you.

433
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,906
Right?

434
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:59,855
Jax.

435
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:03,425
Damn girl. I missed you
so much.

436
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,659
Hello, lover.

437
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,992
You lied.

438
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:13,968
One more time.
We want the heart.

439
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,009
I told you, I don't have it.

440
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:26,077
If you won't tell us,

441
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,617
We'll have to pull it out of
his whore instead.

442
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:38,624
Is it in there?

443
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,399
Enough!

444
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:58,144
What was that?

445
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:00,179
Alright.

446
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:03,182
Everyone on the boat.
We're leaving right now.

447
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,650
Shouldn't we call the cops?

448
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:06,684
Yeah. I'd love to see how
they'd handle this.

449
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:09,521
Everyone wants this stone so
bad and I want to find out why.

450
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:11,525
If anyone knows,
it's this Ace dude.

451
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:15,763
Voicemail.
-Shoot.

452
00:30:15,963 --> 00:30:17,762
Ace, this is Sinbad.

453
00:30:17,764 --> 00:30:19,565
I'm taking you up on that
offer you made me.

454
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,034
Hide that stone I sold you.
Manta is after it.

455
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:23,769
And the Furies.

456
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,471
It's going to take me about two
days to get to your shop.

457
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:30,912
You said if I ever got in
trouble I'd be safe with you.
I hope you meant it.

458
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,811
You in?

459
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:35,181
Well I'm not sticking
around here.

460
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:38,217
Plus, I'd like to see the
Heart of Medusa for myself.

461
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:40,618
Yeah. I'm coming with
you. Me and the fellas,
we got your back.

462
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,721
And me.
-Baby, no.

463
00:30:42,723 --> 00:30:44,022
You're leaving me
here by myself?

464
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:47,559
I will not put the woman that I
want to propose to in danger.

465
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,730
This is how you propose?
-I will propose

466
00:30:51,732 --> 00:30:54,469
when I get back, baby.
I promise.

467
00:30:56,937 --> 00:30:58,636
I hope you're worth it.

468
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:00,105
You and me both.

469
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:02,778
Let's get our asses to
Los Angeles.

470
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:16,721
Hey. Keep an eye
on those RPMs.

471
00:31:16,723 --> 00:31:18,757
We lose this engine we'll
be sitting ducks.

472
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,526
You know if you didn't have
such a criminal records,

473
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:21,861
we could have flown there.

474
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:24,797
And miss all this
aquatic comradery?

475
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,465
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

476
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:30,903
We're about an hour ahead of
schedule. If you can keep
this up all day and night,

477
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:34,175
we should be in Los Angeles
about dawn.

478
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:38,943
Hey. It's going to be okay.

479
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:40,778
You're not alone in this.

480
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,515
Not with me around.

481
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:43,781
Yeah, I know.

482
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:54,960
Look. Dolphins.

483
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:56,862
They're a good omen.

484
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:58,066
How so?

485
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,067
When pirates attacked Dionysus,

486
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,568
she turned them into Dolphins.

487
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:10,645
And then she charged them
with helping sailors,
instead of harming them.

488
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:12,912
Sweet story.

489
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:15,047
Too bad it's not true.

490
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:19,018
I think that what we saw last
night, it can all be true.

491
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,320
What you call magic,
I call science.

492
00:32:22,322 --> 00:32:25,924
Okay, then how do you explain
what those women turned into?

493
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:27,826
I mean, they flew away.

494
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:31,829
Biotechnological weaponry.
Manta's Russian after all.

495
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:38,170
That is paranoid and
delusional thinking. What are
you, an American?

496
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:41,140
And you believing in gods and
goddesses and

497
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:45,146
magic dolphins isn't paranoid
and delusional thinking?

498
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:51,152
As always, logic wins
the debate.

499
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:52,953
You want science?

500
00:32:53,854 --> 00:32:55,253
Fine.

501
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:57,291
Come on.

502
00:32:57,857 --> 00:32:59,293
Come on!

503
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,961
You ever study
numerology?

504
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:05,300
That's on my list of
things never to do.

505
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,201
Well when they showed up at
your door that first night,

506
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:11,069
you know what time
it was?

507
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:13,172
I don't know. Late.
Real late.

508
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:16,040
Was it after 3:30?

509
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:17,779
Sure.

510
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:22,381
When those two women
grabbed me last night, I
happened to look at the clock.

511
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:25,220
It was exactly 3:33.

512
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:27,152
Now there's 3 women.

513
00:33:27,154 --> 00:33:31,056
That's one Roma numeral
for each woman.

514
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:36,565
Now, 3+3+3 is 9.
-Hold on.

515
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:40,569
9. Yep.
Good work.

516
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:44,171
A group of 9 is called an
ennead.

517
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,175
Multiple enneads is
called Erineys.

518
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:52,711
Which is a Greek term for--
-Furies.

519
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:54,646
Exactly.

520
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:56,981
We live in a
mathematical universe.

521
00:33:56,983 --> 00:34:05,024
Somehow the time of 3:33
unlocks a dimension between
our world and theirs.

522
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:07,329
Is that central or
mountain time?

523
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:14,198
I just can't figure out why they
can't stay in our world?

524
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,703
What keeps sending them
back each time?

525
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:20,973
Maybe they have part-time
jobs as telemarketers.

526
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,776
That would explain why they're
so pissed off all the time.
-Sinbad, come on.

527
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:26,845
Be serious. I'm trying to
save your life here.

528
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,814
And my life. Nick's life.

529
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,216
I appreciate it.
I really do.
-I'm scared

530
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:35,220
that your sword isn't gonna
save you this time.
-I'm not.

531
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:40,292
This isn't paranoid or
delusional.
-Oh my gosh.

532
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:44,930
What is it gonna take to
convince you that these women
maybe supernatural?

533
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:47,466
- Sinbad?

534
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:50,703
SINBAD! SINBAD!
Oh my God!
Sinbad!

535
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:59,011
Ooh!
-It finally happened.

536
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,745
David Duchovny turned me
into a dolphin.

537
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:04,816
It's Dionysus, you idiot!
And quit making fun of me!

538
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:06,887
I'm okay.
Thanks for asking.

539
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:09,421
How you ever been with
a Merman, girl?

540
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:12,323
You want to go to Atlantis?
Right under the sea.

541
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:15,194
Are we gonna
celebrate this ship's
inaugural trip or what?

542
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:19,367
And may I point out how long
this trip is since some of us
can't fly?

543
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,682
Sinbad.

544
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,017
What kinda of adventure do
you got me going on?

545
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:39,517
Your last one.

546
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,419
Before you settle down and
become and old man.

547
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:44,189
- And you will get back to
Mexico,

548
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:45,991
give Daphne a proper proposal,

549
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:48,797
and become and old man.
I promise.

550
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,202
That ain't for you.

551
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,009
Nick wasn't kidding.

552
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:04,011
He really does love that girl.

553
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:09,316
Do you want to get married?

554
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:14,019
Are you proposing?

555
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:15,354
No.

556
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:18,890
Eww. I'm asking in general.

557
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,558
It's not really my style.

558
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,296
Yeah. I didn't think I
liked tradition either.

559
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:26,899
I think I'm staring to
change my mind.

560
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:29,169
About a lot of thing actually.

561
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:34,843
Like the Furies.

562
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:39,211
Even though they scare me, I
feel strangely comforted by

563
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:41,913
the fact that magic and
myth could be real.

564
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:43,482
Why?

565
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:45,920
The Ancient World was a
madhouse.

566
00:36:46,486 --> 00:36:51,256
And you prefer that over
the mindless chaos of the
modern world?

567
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:55,928
I mean, at least back then, you
could appease a god by making a
sacrifice to it.

568
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,533
Sinbad! Come
join the party!

569
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:05,136
It would be rude to not go up
and have a couple brewskis.

570
00:37:05,138 --> 00:37:06,571
Cheers.
"Party on!"

571
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,876
"Excellent!"

572
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:21,388
Maybe they overslept.

573
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:25,122
Did you get any sleep at all?

574
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:26,493
Nope.

575
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:28,326
Man.

576
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:31,098
I thought for sure I'd
figured it out.

577
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:35,433
Maybe they can't
manifest in water?

578
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:39,203
And can only crawl out of the
earth from where their blood was
first spilt?

579
00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:41,105
So you do believe!

580
00:37:41,107 --> 00:37:43,211
No. But you do.
It's cute.

581
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:47,011
I'm sorry they're just
regular assassins.

582
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:49,214
I'm so embarrassed.

583
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:54,051
Don't be. I used to stay up all
night waiting for Santa
Claus to show up. So what?

584
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:58,522
You stayed up all night
waiting for the brides of Satan
to show up.

585
00:37:58,524 --> 00:38:02,560
It is a little weird. I guess,
I can see how you'd be a
little embarrassed.

586
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:05,098
Why are you up so early?

587
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,033
We're half hour from port.

588
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,937
Oh really?

589
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,108
Thirty minutes.

590
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,011
That was fast.

591
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:27,021
Hey, can I see those
binoculars?

592
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:33,294
Thanks.

593
00:38:36,263 --> 00:38:38,132
I gotta go help up top.

594
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:40,131
Go pack up your books.

595
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,569
I want to be ready to rock
as soon as we dock.

596
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:47,171
Wait. Wait, do you see
that over there?

597
00:38:47,173 --> 00:38:49,109
On that cliff.

598
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:52,146
- Where?
- Here.

599
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:02,356
Trees?

600
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:05,093
Go back up.

601
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:16,937
Everybody up!

602
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:18,673
Approaching land!

603
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,513
I never thought I'd
be back here.

604
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:31,015
What? The United States
or with Jax?

605
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:33,417
Hey! We're not like official.

606
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,529
Keep it straight!
I can't control it.

607
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:47,765
Keep it straight!
I'm getting pulled
towards the rocks!

608
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:50,070
I'm going to go
shut off the engine.
- Alright.

609
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:53,772
Hurry!

610
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:57,508
We're in trouble!
Sebastian,
grab the wheel!

611
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,279
Mikey! Eyes up top!

612
00:40:02,015 --> 00:40:04,218
Special K is out of
the plates.

613
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:08,022
- It's the Furies!
- Not now Jax!

614
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:27,471
Ah! Stop! Stop!

615
00:40:27,473 --> 00:40:29,573
Stop! Please!

616
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:44,992
Help! Sebastian!

617
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:46,625
Sebastian!

618
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:49,294
Sebastian! Help me
hold him down!

619
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:50,665
Sebastian!

620
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,509
Are you okay?

621
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:05,810
Okay. Help the other crew!
Hurry!

622
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:07,479
Hurry!

623
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:08,716
What happened?

624
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,319
Furies! Come on!

625
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:15,423
Hurry!

626
00:41:22,528 --> 00:41:23,861
You want him?

627
00:41:23,863 --> 00:41:25,330
Nick!

628
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:27,799
Come and get him!

629
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:31,439
No!

630
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:46,618
Finally Arabian.

631
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:51,059
Your payment for my
vengeance is long overdue.

632
00:41:57,263 --> 00:41:58,466
Nick!

633
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:03,703
Nick!

634
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:09,810
Nick!

635
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,497
Looking for Ace Adar.
You heard of him?

636
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:31,866
He wasn't very nice.

637
00:42:32,598 --> 00:42:34,769
Let's try that guy.

638
00:42:38,437 --> 00:42:39,773
Hello.

639
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:43,841
Oh, no thanks.

640
00:42:43,843 --> 00:42:47,180
Don't look now but that guy
back there has been following us
for a while now.

641
00:42:50,883 --> 00:42:53,919
You're about as subtle
as a drunken goat in a
convalescent home.

642
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,859
No thank you.
It's pretty.

643
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:02,563
Come on. Let's go around.
Gotta find this Ace guy.

644
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,299
That's too expensive.
Thank you though.

645
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:08,700
Not to worry, Dr. Kree.

646
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:12,370
- Compliments of Manta Marquis.

647
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:36,261
Let's get out of here!

648
00:43:36,263 --> 00:43:37,995
Stop! Thief! Thief!

649
00:43:42,935 --> 00:43:44,368
In there!

650
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:03,020
All clear.

651
00:44:03,022 --> 00:44:05,290
What about these?

652
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:06,957
You're not gonna like this.

653
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:12,529
I must be crazy.

654
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:15,767
You...
-Oh my God.
- are welcome.

655
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:17,671
Thank you.

656
00:44:21,508 --> 00:44:23,211
Mr. Siridad!

657
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:24,942
Who are you?

658
00:44:24,944 --> 00:44:26,977
I want to help you.

659
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:28,946
Why have you been
following us all day?

660
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:30,814
I wasn't sure if it was you.

661
00:44:30,816 --> 00:44:32,049
You an assassin, too?

662
00:44:32,051 --> 00:44:34,319
I'm your driver.

663
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:37,888
Ace Adar sent me.
He wanted you to
arrive in style.

664
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,325
Welcome to Los Angeles.

665
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:42,597
Come. This way.

666
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:54,471
Mr. Siridad, we have arrived.

667
00:44:54,473 --> 00:44:57,808
Sinbad!

668
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,814
Welcome!
-Hey you!

669
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:01,549
Oh!

670
00:45:02,615 --> 00:45:04,616
How fragrant you are.

671
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,355
You didn't pick up your phone.

672
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:10,754
I lost the damn thing again.

673
00:45:10,756 --> 00:45:14,426
Me and modern day
don't mingle well.

674
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:16,931
Ace, I'd like you to meet--
-Shh!

675
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:19,966
Ooh.

676
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:23,968
Let me guess your name.

677
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,937
Okay. Mm-hmm.
-Please come closer.

678
00:45:26,939 --> 00:45:28,807
I want to read your palm.

679
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,310
Sure.

680
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:33,944
Hmm.

681
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:38,582
Somebody's been a naughty girl.

682
00:45:38,584 --> 00:45:40,521
Intelligent.

683
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:44,689
Yet naive in some matters.

684
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:45,924
Excuse me?

685
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:49,127
It's okay. I'm a raving idiot
about mechanics,

686
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:52,066
but I know every
constellation by heart.

687
00:45:55,401 --> 00:45:57,067
Hmm.

688
00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:01,071
You have a secret dream.
You're scared to tell the
other about.

689
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,040
Don't me all?

690
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:06,678
Now, as enchanting as this is,
we really do have to--

691
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,145
Ah. Ah.

692
00:46:08,147 --> 00:46:09,781
Here it is.

693
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:13,151
You have your aunt's name.

694
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:14,685
Jacqueline.

695
00:46:14,687 --> 00:46:15,654
Boom!

696
00:46:15,656 --> 00:46:18,522
Oh my God!
That's incredible.

697
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:20,125
Try him next.

698
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:24,529
Oh no, no, no, no. Sorry.
My skills only work on women.

699
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,564
Please, come inside.

700
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:28,336
Come inside.

701
00:46:33,406 --> 00:46:34,638
Thank you.

702
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,906
Thanks.

703
00:46:35,908 --> 00:46:38,611
Thanks.
-Thanks.

704
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,817
Come.

705
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:48,520
Ah.

706
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:50,020
Come in my friends.

707
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:52,093
Welcome to my home.

708
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,663
The Babylonaica?

709
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:04,502
But these volumes were lost
when the Library of Alexandria
burned down, right?

710
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:05,870
You have a good eye.

711
00:47:05,872 --> 00:47:07,772
Actually, those are only
reproductions.

712
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:09,540
The originals are stored
safely in my vaults.

713
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:15,647
But don't tell. Every armchair
archeologist with a blog will be
flying in to check it out.

714
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:17,752
Please. Come and sit down.

715
00:47:18,118 --> 00:47:19,854
Oh my gosh.

716
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,120
Do you still have the
Heart of Medusa?

717
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:26,957
Of course. Along with the liver
of Prometheus, the loins of
Adonis--

718
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:29,028
Keep your loins to yourself.

719
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,796
Manta knows we're in
Los Angeles.

720
00:47:32,798 --> 00:47:35,232
His men attached us by
your shop.

721
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:38,838
Ooh. That's awfully
bold of him.

722
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:40,805
Like the other artifacts
he recovered,

723
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:44,611
he must believe the heart can
be used as a weapon as well.

724
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:47,779
Is this stone a weapon?

725
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,214
Hard to say.

726
00:47:50,216 --> 00:47:54,919
Anything can be mutated into a
device of destruction.

727
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:58,656
Just look at what we've done
with the atoms in the air.

728
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:02,897
Three women are also after us.

729
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:08,131
Jax believes they're the Furies.

730
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:10,935
I know they're the Furies.

731
00:48:10,937 --> 00:48:12,106
Wait.

732
00:48:13,372 --> 00:48:17,140
You're on the hit list for both
the Russians and the Greek gods?

733
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:18,877
Popular boy.

734
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:21,946
Give me the heart and
let's all get out of here.

735
00:48:21,948 --> 00:48:24,249
And who's going to
reimburse me?

736
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:27,084
Where would you take us that's
safer than here?

737
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:30,921
Not every problem can be solved
by running away, Sinbad.

738
00:48:30,923 --> 00:48:33,924
Fine.
What's your solution?

739
00:48:33,926 --> 00:48:36,796
What do you think we
should do with the heart?

740
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,330
Destroy it.

741
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:44,903
If the stone no longer exists,
there's nothing for Manta or
these Furies to take.

742
00:48:44,905 --> 00:48:47,906
No. That stone is an
invaluable artifact.

743
00:48:47,908 --> 00:48:51,975
To be studied and learned from.
Not to be destroyed.

744
00:48:51,977 --> 00:48:56,281
My past experience ditching the
evidence only pisses of the
people you owe even more.

745
00:48:56,283 --> 00:49:00,688
Ace, what is the deal
with this stone?

746
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:08,993
I'm not sure but I believe there
is someone that can tell us what
we're dealing with.

747
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:10,564
But...

748
00:49:11,897 --> 00:49:14,299
But you rather give
me a migraine while I
try to figure out

749
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:16,636
what you're thinking
outside your head?

750
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:21,705
The heart isn't the only
treasure I own with
mystical appeal.

751
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:26,243
You have a skill with these
artifacts. I would like to
take advantage of.

752
00:49:26,245 --> 00:49:28,779
If you want me to do magic
tricks, there's a two
drink minimum.

753
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:31,885
But first,

754
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:35,587
you need to take a
bath and change.

755
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:37,725
To look at some artifacts?

756
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:41,225
Let's just say it's best to make
a good impression on her.

757
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:42,727
"Her?"

758
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,631
"Her."

759
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:46,598
"Her?"

760
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,366
No. "Her."

761
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:53,037
Okay. Alright you guy.
Well I think a shower
sounds wonderful.

762
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,975
But unfortunately, We
don't have ant clothes that
we can change into.

763
00:49:56,977 --> 00:50:00,044
Not to worry. I have ample
wardrobe selection for you both.

764
00:50:00,046 --> 00:50:06,084
I hope you don't mind a more
traditional style.

765
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:12,857
Show our guests to their rooms.

766
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:16,263
And lay out the clothes
I prepared.

767
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:22,866
We are running for our lives and
you're planning a dinner party?

768
00:50:22,868 --> 00:50:25,002
Who's supposed to jump in and
save the day, Martha Stewart?

769
00:50:25,004 --> 00:50:28,740
Oh, she' much better
than Martha.

770
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:32,979
Who is this lady you want
me to impress?

771
00:50:36,682 --> 00:50:39,017
I've never met her myself,

772
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:42,089
But I believe you can
draw her out.

773
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:44,591
Come my friends.
Go.

774
00:51:02,776 --> 00:51:05,442
So where's Sinbad?

775
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:08,115
This is going to make
and impression.

776
00:51:12,285 --> 00:51:14,451
Was he an Arabian
Chippendale?

777
00:51:14,453 --> 00:51:16,723
Very nice.

778
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:22,426
I just can't do the turban.

779
00:51:22,428 --> 00:51:25,062
Not to worry. I wouldn't
wear it either.

780
00:51:25,064 --> 00:51:27,865
But you look
magnificent.

781
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:30,903
A spitting image if I may
say so myself.

782
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,971
You know, we may
just fool her.

783
00:51:34,973 --> 00:51:37,475
Who else is
here besides us?

784
00:51:37,477 --> 00:51:39,076
Ace, instead of
playing dress up,

785
00:51:39,078 --> 00:51:40,645
we should be figuring
what this stone can do

786
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:45,015
and how to stop Manta and those
women from getting it.
-Mmhm. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

787
00:51:45,017 --> 00:51:47,021
Does it feel heavy?

788
00:51:48,988 --> 00:51:54,491
Yeah.  I should feel overly
exposed, odd weight to it.
-Like,

789
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:56,259
aura of armor, yes?

790
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,095
Where did you get this?

791
00:51:58,097 --> 00:52:00,330
The desert's too hot for
heavy armor,

792
00:52:00,332 --> 00:52:03,366
so old Sindibad had it woven
from the silk of the Calypso

793
00:52:03,368 --> 00:52:06,169
Spider to give him an
advantage in war.

794
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:09,075
I want to live
here forever.

795
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,743
I love this!

796
00:52:12,745 --> 00:52:16,180
Sinbad, isn't this
awesome?

797
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:18,352
Fits me perfectly.

798
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:25,122
Yeah. It is perfect. For a five
year old birthday party.

799
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:30,093
Guys, enough games.
Ace, where's the heart?

800
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:33,798
Upstairs. That's the best place
for us to try this.

801
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,968
Just in case things get
a little boisterous.

802
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,504
You know, if the Furies
do come tonight,

803
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:43,941
and it's safe to
assume they will,

804
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:47,046
we're going to need a magical
bodyguard ourselves.

805
00:52:48,046 --> 00:52:49,782
Please, come on.
Yes.

806
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:52,218
This way.

807
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:04,361
Jax?

808
00:53:04,363 --> 00:53:08,265
Oh, I'm good I'll stay here.
I found some reading.
-You sure?

809
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:10,269
Yeah.
-Okay.

810
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:21,511
How do these furies
keep finding me?

811
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:23,881
And if they're so magically
powerful and all-knowing,

812
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:25,486
why don't they know you
have the heart?

813
00:53:27,086 --> 00:53:29,520
Maybe it's not all
they want.

814
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:31,855
What aren't you telling me?

815
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:36,028
I wonder if the Furies
really want the Heart of
the Medusa back.

816
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:42,101
I'm beginning to believe that
they could be after you instead.

817
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:55,245
Watch your step.

818
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,850
Oh! Oof!

819
00:53:59,852 --> 00:54:01,084
Is this where you keep
the dead bodies?

820
00:54:01,086 --> 00:54:04,055
I know.
It's the heart.

821
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:04,955
Where is it?

822
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:06,926
In that basket.

823
00:54:07,993 --> 00:54:09,961
I tried covering it up
to contain the smell,

824
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:12,499
but it just gets
stronger.

825
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,365
Ah!

826
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:18,472
Sorry. That's
Cleopatra's asp.

827
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:20,904
What a great ass she had.

828
00:54:20,906 --> 00:54:23,406
Some say it's Cesar.

829
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:25,942
Dude. get a new hobby.

830
00:54:25,944 --> 00:54:27,914
Try the other.

831
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:35,118
Careful.

832
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:41,327
There's definitely a chemical
breakdown in that jewel like
nothing I've encountered before.

833
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,997
Wha is all this stuff?

834
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:48,234
Ah. This...

835
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,069
is my more
eclectic treasures.

836
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:54,205
Aladdin's carpets.

837
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,377
Here, the tears of Allah.

838
00:54:57,577 --> 00:55:01,848
This is a perfect atmosphere
for us to try using this.

839
00:55:04,984 --> 00:55:07,221
It never worked for me.

840
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,091
Not even as a traditional lamp.

841
00:55:11,624 --> 00:55:17,294
But perhaps if a descendant
of the original Old
Sindibad lights it,

842
00:55:17,296 --> 00:55:21,133
maybe it will bring her our
of her slumber.

843
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,600
Okay. Come on.

844
00:55:23,602 --> 00:55:25,435
What do you have to lose?

845
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:27,273
Try it.

846
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:33,379
I've tried all kinds of oils.

847
00:55:37,316 --> 00:55:41,718
It's not a lamp.
It's a puzzle box.
-Really?

848
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,923
How do we open it?

849
00:55:44,189 --> 00:55:45,392
Simple.

850
00:55:46,124 --> 00:55:48,125
Solve the riddle.

851
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:49,961
My lord.

852
00:55:49,963 --> 00:55:52,430
I had no idea it had
such a shine.

853
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,102
It's like brand new.

854
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,957
What's it saying?

855
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:29,265
It's some kind of Ancient
Genie dialect. I'm a bit rusty
but let me try.

856
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:46,250
She said she can manifest
reality three times

857
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:49,990
if you're too lazy to do it
yourself. Oh! She's witty.

858
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:55,328
Manifest reality, like...
Anything?

859
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:07,537
She said, you can limit
yourself if you like.

860
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:09,308
Millions do it everyday.

861
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:12,109
Ask her what the Heart of
Medusa is and why Manta

862
00:57:12,111 --> 00:57:15,015
and those rejects from
Lita Ford School of Rock
want it so bad.

863
00:57:15,781 --> 00:57:17,283
That's a mouth full.

864
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,586
Let me try.

865
00:57:31,164 --> 00:57:36,700
She's getting angry. She said
she can't read minds and the
stone can't do anything,

866
00:57:36,702 --> 00:57:39,736
It's just matter
without consciousness.

867
00:57:39,738 --> 00:57:42,242
But you just said she could.

868
00:57:42,575 --> 00:57:43,774
Let me try.

869
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,716
She's getting really mad.

870
00:57:52,718 --> 00:57:57,257
She says, "Make a wish.
Any wish. Get a life!"

871
00:57:58,457 --> 00:58:01,494
Bring my friend Nick
back to life.

872
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:16,209
You said you can do anything.

873
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,281
She can turn time forward, but
she can't turn time back.

874
00:58:25,283 --> 00:58:29,289
Okay. What else
can't you do?

875
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:42,765
She won't intentionally harm
anyone and she won't give you
money.

876
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:46,539
That would involve taking it
away from someone.

877
00:58:47,439 --> 00:58:49,809
So you can't kill the Furies?

878
00:58:51,843 --> 00:58:55,513
I am a Genie, not a machine gun.

879
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:58,182
Wait a minute, you
speak english now?

880
00:58:58,184 --> 00:59:01,285
What is this? Some weird
elaborate hoax?

881
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,220
I had no idea.

882
00:59:03,222 --> 00:59:04,921
I don't have time
for this.

883
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:09,660
You are different than
the other Sinbad.

884
00:59:09,662 --> 00:59:12,462
You have an air of arrogance.

885
00:59:12,464 --> 00:59:15,432
And yet you are actually humble.

886
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:19,904
A valiant hero trying
to be a thief.

887
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:31,247
You're wishes don't work because
you're actually pretending to be
something else.

888
00:59:31,249 --> 00:59:32,348
A rogue.

889
00:59:38,723 --> 00:59:40,723
If you think I'm a joke,
say it to my face.

890
00:59:40,725 --> 00:59:43,961
I don't need some industrial
Light and Magic rip-off
making fun of me.

891
00:59:43,963 --> 00:59:47,300
I came here for one reason.
To get the stone. Now that I
have it--

892
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,502
Hey! That's got the snake in it.

893
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:54,939
Which you should get rid of
because it's illegal to keep
exotic pets in California.

894
00:59:54,941 --> 00:59:58,341
Look at the thief
peaching the law.

895
00:59:58,343 --> 01:00:02,546
The Jinn was right. Deep down,
you are a hero at heart.

896
01:00:02,548 --> 01:00:05,718
Sebastian, we're
out of here.

897
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:08,622
Sinbad, wait.

898
01:00:10,323 --> 01:00:12,723
Get your stuff.
We're out of here.

899
01:00:12,725 --> 01:00:14,924
This guy has done nothing but
waste our time and play games.

900
01:00:14,926 --> 01:00:18,696
Sinbad, I'm sorry.
I never meant to offend you.

901
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,930
Offended I can handle.
But lied to?

902
01:00:20,932 --> 01:00:22,566
I never miss let you.

903
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:27,571
And you told me you were
going to share the magical
mysteries of my family.

904
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:29,772
And I have!

905
01:00:29,774 --> 01:00:32,609
If my heritage involves playing
footsie with some second-rate

906
01:00:32,611 --> 01:00:37,747
Barbara Eden wanna-be you keep
locked up on the attic, I pray
to God I'm adopted.

907
01:00:37,749 --> 01:00:43,354
Young man, that lamp hasn't
worked for anyone for
hundreds of years.

908
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:46,857
Who knows what you're
capable of if you just embraced
your legacy!

909
01:00:46,859 --> 01:00:48,825
I don't care about my heritage.

910
01:00:48,827 --> 01:00:55,332
I don't want the lamp. I
don't want the heart. I wish
I'd never even found it.

911
01:00:55,334 --> 01:00:57,734
I'd rethink that if I were you.

912
01:00:57,736 --> 01:01:01,705
Why? What's so special about it?

913
01:01:01,707 --> 01:01:07,511
Well it says here that the Heart
of Medusa has the power of
twenty gods.

914
01:01:07,513 --> 01:01:08,979
Big deal.

915
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:12,049
And it can transform the
shape of continents.

916
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:15,319
Oh yeah? I think Global Warming
has dibs on that one.

917
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:20,290
Okay. Well I think with
these ancient texts backing
up these claims,

918
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:26,964
that gem it could easily
be worth over one hundred
million dollars.

919
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:29,533
I will fight to the death
to keep that stone away

920
01:01:29,535 --> 01:01:33,837
from anyone who tries to take
it or wishes us harm.

921
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,973
How do you know that anyway?

922
01:01:35,975 --> 01:01:37,978
Easy.

923
01:01:39,345 --> 01:01:41,779
I found the instruction manual.

924
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,317
I forgot I owned that book.

925
01:01:45,584 --> 01:01:49,486
These texts are endless
allegories about the
Heart of Medusa

926
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:54,524
is a warning that revenge and
anger just trap a person

927
01:01:54,526 --> 01:01:59,598
in some kind of prison of rage
so that they can't move on with
their life.

928
01:02:00,031 --> 01:02:03,767
Sound like wise words to me.

929
01:02:03,769 --> 01:02:07,004
Cardinal, bring another
bottle of wine.

930
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:13,743
The Domaine Jean-Louise Rhone
2005.

931
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:18,381
Not the 2003?
You common Peasant!

932
01:02:18,383 --> 01:02:20,683
Oh, I'm impressed.

933
01:02:20,685 --> 01:02:24,988
Fetch the good vintage. I must
live up to Sinbad's standards.

934
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,591
You seem pretty calm on the
eve of Armageddon.

935
01:02:28,593 --> 01:02:34,997
Well, I learned long ago to let
fate have her way with me.

936
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:38,669
All I can control is whether
I face her sober.

937
01:02:41,106 --> 01:02:43,075
This is useless.

938
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:47,714
Ah. Let me see your finds.

939
01:02:50,548 --> 01:02:53,919
I'm not even sure if the Heart
of Medusa is a weapon anymore.

940
01:02:55,053 --> 01:02:57,723
Then we stick with what
we know works.

941
01:02:58,723 --> 01:03:00,059
Yeah.

942
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:04,731
I picked these up at the
market yesterday.

943
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:07,865
These work.

944
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,602
I highly recommend them.

945
01:03:09,834 --> 01:03:12,169
Instead of striking back
at the Furies,

946
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:17,006
perhaps there's another way to
quell their anger towards you.

947
01:03:17,008 --> 01:03:19,542
Why do they hate me so much?

948
01:03:19,544 --> 01:03:23,846
What's this grievance they
have against me?

949
01:03:23,848 --> 01:03:29,185
Hmm. The "useless" wisdom our
dear doctor discarded

950
01:03:29,187 --> 01:03:32,790
is actually the instructions
we're looking for.

951
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:34,558
Here it is.

952
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,696
You ancestor, Old Sindibad,
sailed seven voyages.

953
01:03:39,698 --> 01:03:42,899
Most with passion
and glory,

954
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:52,109
but it says here his fourth
voyage, i'm sad to say,
brought out the worst in him.

955
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:56,580
<i>He shipwrecked on an
 island and married the
 kingdom's princess.</i>

956
01:03:56,582 --> 01:04:00,817
<i> Not long after the wedding,
 she fell ill and died.</i>

957
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:04,888
<i> It was then he learned the
 land's dastardly custom.</i>

958
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:09,493
<i> If one spouse died, the
 living spouse was buried
 alive with them.</i>

959
01:04:09,495 --> 01:04:12,796
You know what, they use to
do that in India.

960
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,232
Except it was only the wives
that had to be buried alive with
their dead husbands.

961
01:04:16,234 --> 01:04:18,637
No the other way around.

962
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:22,205
Which is sexist.

963
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:23,841
Why did you look at me when
you said that?

964
01:04:23,843 --> 01:04:30,881
<i>Sinbad was thrown into the
communal tomb with just a little
 bit of water</i>

965
01:04:30,883 --> 01:04:32,783
<i> and a small loaf of bread.</i>

966
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:38,087
<i>Weeks passed. Just when he
 was about to die, the tomb
 opened and another couple-</i>

967
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:41,658
<i> this time the husband dead,
 but the wife was alive.</i>

968
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,861
<i>She was thrown into the cavern.</i>

969
01:04:46,664 --> 01:04:48,866
<i>Only thinking about
 himself, Sindibad killed</i>

970
01:04:48,868 --> 01:04:52,839
<i> the woman and took her
 rations to stay alive.</i>

971
01:04:58,209 --> 01:05:04,149
<i> He did this two more times
 with two other women
 thrown into the tomb.</i>

972
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:16,225
<i>Eventually he had enough
 rations to regain his
 strength and escape.</i>

973
01:05:16,227 --> 01:05:20,564
Those three women he killed

974
01:05:20,566 --> 01:05:22,698
became the Furies.

975
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,701
The stone he used to beat
them dead was the actual

976
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:29,105
hardened heart of
the slain Medusa,

977
01:05:29,107 --> 01:05:30,941
discarded in the cave,

978
01:05:30,943 --> 01:05:33,810
but given new life  by the anger
of the three murdered women.

979
01:05:35,013 --> 01:05:38,781
Resurrected by mad magic
as the Furies,

980
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:42,319
they swore to one day use the
stone to punish all men

981
01:05:42,321 --> 01:05:45,055
for Old Sindibad for Old
Sindibad's crimes.

982
01:05:45,057 --> 01:05:49,792
The stone keeps them
confined to this earth in an
infinite cycle.

983
01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:55,265
As long as their rage is
eternal, their lifeline will
have no end.

984
01:05:55,267 --> 01:05:57,700
So is the stone a life
force for them?

985
01:05:57,702 --> 01:06:00,604
Would explain the desire
and need for it.

986
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:02,876
And why they never stay dead.

987
01:06:04,008 --> 01:06:06,075
Each night they're born anew.

988
01:06:06,077 --> 01:06:11,348
Old Sindibad's eighth voyage was
meant to be one of redemption.

989
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:14,554
To use his wrath to
break their rage.

990
01:06:15,955 --> 01:06:18,290
He died before completing it.

991
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:21,725
But perhaps that for you to do.

992
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,928
Cardinal?

993
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:26,899
Ace, wait.

994
01:06:31,636 --> 01:06:33,937
Get back pretty boy.

995
01:06:33,939 --> 01:06:36,676
Get your hand off the
butter knife.

996
01:06:37,075 --> 01:06:39,709
Hello, treasure hunter.

997
01:06:39,711 --> 01:06:42,247
I'd like my property back, hmm?

998
01:06:43,982 --> 01:06:47,618
Where is the Heart of Medusa?

999
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,087
How dare you enter my home!

1000
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:53,122
You are a terrible host.

1001
01:06:53,124 --> 01:06:57,093
We came all this way
just to see you.

1002
01:06:57,095 --> 01:07:01,832
Cy, find the stone. I want to
test my theory of it.

1003
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:04,200
Right here.
Right now.

1004
01:07:04,202 --> 01:07:05,868
Oh yeah, you got a
theory?

1005
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:07,870
What "theory" is that?

1006
01:07:07,872 --> 01:07:15,379
Unlike you, this stone has
untapped potential.

1007
01:07:15,381 --> 01:07:17,080
Cy, find the stone.

1008
01:07:17,082 --> 01:07:21,321
Where is the stone?

1009
01:07:22,421 --> 01:07:24,057
Sebastian,

1010
01:07:24,722 --> 01:07:25,988
tell him where he can find it.

1011
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:28,360
Yes, Sebastian.

1012
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:36,368
Really?

1013
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,209
Drop it!

1014
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:48,879
Hey, hey! Stab her
neck.

1015
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:51,415
I will filet your neck
right now if you don't
tell him to let her go.

1016
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:53,816
Oh you won't
dare, Big boy.

1017
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:56,053
Snap her neck,
Let her go!

1018
01:07:56,055 --> 01:07:59,022
Let her go!
-He's going to snap her neck.
It's easy. She's going to die.

1019
01:07:59,024 --> 01:08:02,024
Don't snap her neck. Tell
him not to snap her neck.

1020
01:08:02,026 --> 01:08:03,959
Let go of me first and
I'll let her live.

1021
01:08:03,961 --> 01:08:08,230
Oh? Hmm? Then you'll get a
little on the side? Huh?

1022
01:08:08,232 --> 01:08:09,265
Huh?

1023
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:10,767
Eh?

1024
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:12,939
Alright.
-You like that?

1025
01:08:13,972 --> 01:08:15,337
Yeah,

1026
01:08:15,339 --> 01:08:16,842
Wow.

1027
01:08:27,218 --> 01:08:28,287
Wow.

1028
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:32,488
You. Little rich man.

1029
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:38,361
You're going to tell me where
the Heart of Medusa is?

1030
01:08:38,363 --> 01:08:43,403
Because you know and I don't.
I want to find it so badly. Hmm?

1031
01:08:47,405 --> 01:08:49,005
Right on time.

1032
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:50,273
Who's that?

1033
01:08:50,275 --> 01:08:52,908
Sure as hell ain't the
Avon lady.

1034
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,944
We better get the hell
out of here.
-No. No.

1035
01:08:54,946 --> 01:08:57,279
We don't have to
do anything. Hmm?

1036
01:08:57,281 --> 01:08:59,284
Cy, go check the door.

1037
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:08,825
Fine, you stay here watch them.
me and my new friend will go
check the door, okay?

1038
01:09:08,827 --> 01:09:10,128
Manta.

1039
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:13,162
I would listen to Sinbad.

1040
01:09:13,164 --> 01:09:16,398
Cy, you're my bodyguard.

1041
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,934
I pay you to guard my body.
You're going to go first.

1042
01:09:18,936 --> 01:09:20,836
Then we're going to
come in after you.

1043
01:09:20,838 --> 01:09:23,473
And you, my man,
you're doing great.

1044
01:09:23,475 --> 01:09:27,847
You keep your gun on them.
If he sneezes you shoot him in
the kneecap, okay?

1045
01:09:29,114 --> 01:09:31,982
What are you doing? Go.
-He punched me in the throat.

1046
01:09:31,984 --> 01:09:35,088
I will punch you in the
clavicle. Go! Now!

1047
01:09:41,126 --> 01:09:43,296
Promotions for you.

1048
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:53,002
Who wants to play?

1049
01:09:53,004 --> 01:09:55,538
Did you order strippers?
What's wrong with you?

1050
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:56,540
Hand over.

1051
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:59,242
Ta-ta-ta-ta. Who are you?
What do you want?

1052
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:05,184
Rage shouldn't be wasted on
those we have no quarrel with.

1053
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:08,788
So let's not disappoint them.

1054
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:18,828
What is this, hmm?

1055
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:23,032
Some kind of parlor fit for you
try to seduce me? No, no. no.
-I want you. Do you want me?

1056
01:10:23,034 --> 01:10:27,469
Ehh! No, you're woman--

1057
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:29,471
She's got no penis for
me to play with.

1058
01:10:29,473 --> 01:10:31,608
What is wrong with you and
your stupid lady brain.

1059
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,977
Always--

1060
01:10:35,346 --> 01:10:37,246
Bob, get in here!

1061
01:10:37,248 --> 01:10:40,051
Take care of these women.

1062
01:10:56,168 --> 01:11:00,239
Trust me. You do not want
to hear what these women
have to say.

1063
01:11:05,142 --> 01:11:06,578
Come on.

1064
01:11:09,647 --> 01:11:11,313
We can get out
through here!

1065
01:11:11,315 --> 01:11:14,386
Too high. We need a rope
or something.

1066
01:11:18,222 --> 01:11:19,622
They're going to bust
their way in.

1067
01:11:19,624 --> 01:11:21,657
Not if we barricade the door.

1068
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:22,894
Come on.

1069
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:26,161
Take that.

1070
01:11:30,302 --> 01:11:32,004
This should buy us some time.

1071
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:40,513
Oh God.

1072
01:11:41,113 --> 01:11:42,478
is it some kind of acid or
something?

1073
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,450
I don't know. It look magical.
I'm taking it.

1074
01:11:47,686 --> 01:11:48,952
Okay. Come on.

1075
01:11:48,954 --> 01:11:51,453
Books.
Come on.

1076
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:52,956
Swords.

1077
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:54,390
What the heck is this?

1078
01:11:54,392 --> 01:11:58,430
Sword. Big flower thing.

1079
01:12:05,037 --> 01:12:07,573
Jax, are you serious?

1080
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,943
Everything else Ace's shown us
in here has worked.
Why not this?

1081
01:12:12,945 --> 01:12:16,048
How?
-I think it's a good idea.

1082
01:12:19,618 --> 01:12:22,120
Ask.
-The Genie is a jerk.

1083
01:12:23,254 --> 01:12:25,458
Do it! Hurry!

1084
01:12:34,298 --> 01:12:38,335
- I don't have time to take a Rosetta Stone class.
-  Speak English!

1085
01:12:38,337 --> 01:12:40,370
That's a demand.
Not a wish.

1086
01:12:40,372 --> 01:12:42,040
What?

1087
01:12:42,606 --> 01:12:44,307
How do I use that?

1088
01:12:44,309 --> 01:12:48,611
You really want to know?
-Yes!
-I'll tell you.

1089
01:12:48,613 --> 01:12:49,746
Are you ready?
-Yes.

1090
01:12:56,754 --> 01:12:58,958
Oh my god! They're breaking in.

1091
01:13:00,191 --> 01:13:01,424
Wake up!

1092
01:13:01,426 --> 01:13:04,196
I know how to fly carpets!

1093
01:13:06,297 --> 01:13:07,699
Come on.

1094
01:13:09,434 --> 01:13:10,636
Get on.

1095
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:13,536
Steering.

1096
01:13:13,538 --> 01:13:14,571
Breaking systems.

1097
01:13:14,573 --> 01:13:18,308
- Ready?
- -Start the thing!

1098
01:13:37,495 --> 01:13:39,028
Are you okay?

1099
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:40,429
Are you okay?

1100
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:42,367
I didn't need my spleen anyway.

1101
01:13:43,802 --> 01:13:45,371
Oh no!

1102
01:13:55,212 --> 01:13:57,212
The stone is okay.

1103
01:13:57,214 --> 01:13:58,715
It's still in tact.

1104
01:13:58,717 --> 01:14:00,550
Don't look directly into it,
Jax.

1105
01:14:00,552 --> 01:14:03,289
Oh God.

1106
01:14:03,488 --> 01:14:05,220
Ace was right.

1107
01:14:05,222 --> 01:14:07,090
It does hurt to look at it.

1108
01:14:07,092 --> 01:14:09,358
Aww, is it beautiful.

1109
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,830
Come on. We have to get Ace and
bring Manta to the authorities.

1110
01:14:13,832 --> 01:14:15,165
Authorities?

1111
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:18,701
Sinbad, you're a wanted
man. They're just going to
arrest you.

1112
01:14:18,703 --> 01:14:20,804
Then I'll do my time.

1113
01:14:20,806 --> 01:14:24,139
I'm tired of hiding.
No more running away.

1114
01:14:24,141 --> 01:14:25,642
You're going legit?

1115
01:14:25,644 --> 01:14:29,315
I guess I am.

1116
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:32,615
I knew you were a lousy thief.

1117
01:14:32,617 --> 01:14:34,020
I suck at it.

1118
01:14:36,154 --> 01:14:39,288
You know, I have to admit,

1119
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:47,863
this whole time I secretly
blamed you for what your
father did to me.

1120
01:14:47,865 --> 01:14:49,799
Taking credit for my work.

1121
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:52,138
Stealing everything I ever had.

1122
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,810
You're nothing like your father.

1123
01:15:00,111 --> 01:15:02,545
I wish that were true.

1124
01:15:11,222 --> 01:15:13,790
Why didn't you take the
stone and run?
- Yeah, with those things

1125
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:16,158
running every night?
I don't think so.

1126
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,460
And I did wait for you,
didn't I?

1127
01:15:18,462 --> 01:15:22,298
You wanted to cut me out and
take the stone all for yourself.

1128
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:29,371
Don't tell me that my act was
so convincing that I fooled the
great Manta.

1129
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:33,645
Don't try to out bitch a bitch.

1130
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:37,850
Thank God you're alive.

1131
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:41,651
I was worried you'd been
knocked into a coma.

1132
01:15:41,653 --> 01:15:43,152
Why are you doing this, Jax?

1133
01:15:43,154 --> 01:15:47,256
Mr. Siridad! Just in time.

1134
01:15:47,258 --> 01:15:48,858
You two are in this together.

1135
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:54,730
I found the location of the
stone and Manta brought the
man power to get it.

1136
01:15:54,732 --> 01:16:00,836
And you almost ruined everything
with your big man muscles.

1137
01:16:00,838 --> 01:16:02,475
Yeah.

1138
01:16:03,876 --> 01:16:08,310
Of all the caves you could have
explored, Sinbad. Why that one?
Huh?

1139
01:16:08,312 --> 01:16:11,447
All through I'm still not sure
why I still let you convince me

1140
01:16:11,449 --> 01:16:13,750
I should leave the stone
where I found it.

1141
01:16:13,752 --> 01:16:17,687
I was right about it being
guarded, wasn't I?

1142
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:20,389
Jax, why are you doing this?

1143
01:16:20,391 --> 01:16:23,128
I have my reasons.

1144
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:28,932
One hundred million to be exact.

1145
01:16:28,934 --> 01:16:32,635
One hundred million split
between us. Hmm?

1146
01:16:32,637 --> 01:16:33,937
Of course.

1147
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:37,340
You said the stone couldn't be
used as a weapon.

1148
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:41,810
What mystical powers it has,
I still don't know.

1149
01:16:41,812 --> 01:16:46,782
But it does have a
practical use.

1150
01:16:46,784 --> 01:16:50,522
It is after all, it's
still a mineral.

1151
01:16:54,226 --> 01:17:02,232
The Heart of Medusa is actually
a complex emerald made up of
chromium and vanadium.

1152
01:17:02,234 --> 01:17:06,301
Chromium helps regulate your
blood sugar and vanadium is

1153
01:17:06,303 --> 01:17:10,473
a very rare chemical capable
of binding steel together.

1154
01:17:10,475 --> 01:17:14,277
The gun chips off a bit of
the gem here,

1155
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:17,714
the it oxides in
this chamber,

1156
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:22,417
and when the particles are
combined and projected into
someone--

1157
01:17:22,419 --> 01:17:23,786
It turns them to stone.

1158
01:17:23,788 --> 01:17:25,457
In a way.

1159
01:17:26,257 --> 01:17:29,291
The overdose of chromium
ruptures your blood vessels,

1160
01:17:29,293 --> 01:17:33,395
carrying the vanadium throughout
your body, hardening all your
organic tissue

1161
01:17:33,397 --> 01:17:39,635
before you finally combust.
-We call it the Medusa 2.0.

1162
01:17:39,637 --> 01:17:45,243
All through I wanted to call it
the gore gun, but Jax here
thought--

1163
01:17:46,878 --> 01:17:50,279
Isn't it fascinating?

1164
01:17:50,281 --> 01:17:51,684
Bravo.

1165
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:54,651
Why do you have Ace
and I tied up?

1166
01:17:54,653 --> 01:17:55,952
Huh?

1167
01:17:55,954 --> 01:17:58,353
To give you and audience?

1168
01:17:58,355 --> 01:18:01,991
No, silly.

1169
01:18:01,993 --> 01:18:04,727
So we can test it out.

1170
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:06,562
On you.

1171
01:18:06,564 --> 01:18:11,834
Rock hard Sinbad right
in front of me.

1172
01:18:11,836 --> 01:18:14,707
An new age is dawning.

1173
01:18:15,373 --> 01:18:19,742
One where technology and
magic are combined.

1174
01:18:19,744 --> 01:18:25,348
Unlike our ancestors, we won't
bow down and worship the gods.

1175
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:26,916
Yeah.

1176
01:18:26,918 --> 01:18:34,426
This time around,
we are the gods.

1177
01:18:36,761 --> 01:18:38,493
May I do the honors?

1178
01:18:38,495 --> 01:18:41,831
Better have Cy. Just in case it
vaporizes whoever is holding it.

1179
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:44,434
We still have some of the kinks
to work out.

1180
01:18:44,436 --> 01:18:46,705
Good idea.

1181
01:18:47,638 --> 01:18:50,809
Cy, will you do the honors?

1182
01:18:52,776 --> 01:18:55,346
You know I can hear you.
-What?

1183
01:18:56,681 --> 01:19:00,782
Ace, I'm so sorry.

1184
01:19:00,784 --> 01:19:03,655
No, you've inspired me.

1185
01:19:07,391 --> 01:19:09,994
Just as I will inspire you.

1186
01:19:11,596 --> 01:19:13,795
My friend, don't waste
your journey.

1187
01:19:13,797 --> 01:19:14,897
Fire!

1188
01:19:19,803 --> 01:19:20,902
Fire!

1189
01:19:20,904 --> 01:19:22,738
It's still calibrating!

1190
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,041
Get'em you stupid idiot!

1191
01:19:25,043 --> 01:19:27,379
- Where they go?
- That way!

1192
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,087
How do I stop this?

1193
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:43,395
Be more specific with your
intention to get what you want.

1194
01:19:43,861 --> 01:19:46,027
I can't do this alone.
Can you--

1195
01:19:46,029 --> 01:19:50,635
It is impossible for me--
-Kill anyone. I know.

1196
01:19:53,937 --> 01:19:55,670
What should I do?

1197
01:19:55,672 --> 01:20:01,743
I suggest using your enemy
to fight your enemy.

1198
01:20:01,745 --> 01:20:03,449
The Furies?

1199
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:06,785
Man, they want to kill me.

1200
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:10,952
And you think I can get them
in my side?

1201
01:20:10,954 --> 01:20:12,790
If that is your wish.

1202
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:16,461
Shall I bring them forward to
follow your will.

1203
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:18,995
How?

1204
01:20:18,997 --> 01:20:20,899
It's daylight.

1205
01:20:21,865 --> 01:20:23,935
Is it?

1206
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,473
Why did you summons us, Arabian?

1207
01:20:30,475 --> 01:20:32,111
I don't mean to hurt you.

1208
01:20:33,544 --> 01:20:34,876
I mean to serve you.

1209
01:20:34,878 --> 01:20:38,514
I mean, if you're willing
to serve me.

1210
01:20:38,516 --> 01:20:42,788
You can give is the weapon that
can also annihilate us?
-It's a trick.

1211
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:46,522
Look, we're on the same
side now, okay?

1212
01:20:46,524 --> 01:20:48,624
We're not adversaries anymore.

1213
01:20:48,626 --> 01:20:51,727
The enemy of my
enemy is also my friend.

1214
01:20:51,729 --> 01:20:58,099
There's people up there
that have done some really
messed up stuff.

1215
01:20:58,101 --> 01:21:00,670
I don't think you guys would
appreciate either. I think if
we--

1216
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,938
-What you stole from us

1217
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,741
other have perverted and
desecrated.

1218
01:21:05,743 --> 01:21:08,109
Help me fight them to
get it back.

1219
01:21:08,111 --> 01:21:10,479
This is a limited alliance.

1220
01:21:10,481 --> 01:21:12,715
You're too much like the
one who cured us.

1221
01:21:12,717 --> 01:21:14,483
If you think we'll
befriend you--
-I don't exactly want to

1222
01:21:14,485 --> 01:21:16,551
have a picnic with
you guys either, okay?

1223
01:21:16,553 --> 01:21:20,958
Could you stop blabbing and
start screaming?

1224
01:21:21,226 --> 01:21:23,128
Protect yourself.

1225
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:31,567
Did you guys here that scream?

1226
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:33,172
Do you think those women
are coming back?

1227
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:36,639
If they so they're going have
to deal with me.

1228
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:38,206
The money is in the account.

1229
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:40,609
We fly to Russia tonight.

1230
01:21:40,611 --> 01:21:43,011
First I need to fix the
calibration on this thing.

1231
01:21:43,013 --> 01:21:45,014
So there's no delay
between shots.

1232
01:21:45,016 --> 01:21:48,084
No, you will do as I say.

1233
01:21:48,086 --> 01:21:49,684
Must I?

1234
01:21:49,686 --> 01:21:54,156
Yes, dearest doctor.
You will.

1235
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:58,594
I am so sick of you talking
down to me.

1236
01:21:58,596 --> 01:22:01,197
Too bad.

1237
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:02,732
Indeed.

1238
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:19,251
The queen is dead.
Long live the queen.

1239
01:22:20,784 --> 01:22:22,587
Damn right.

1240
01:22:32,763 --> 01:22:34,796
Hand over the weapon, Jax!

1241
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,513
Run!

1242
01:22:51,048 --> 01:22:53,983
You get Sinbad.
I'll get the last one.

1243
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:56,688
You moron.

1244
01:24:06,923 --> 01:24:09,392
Sinbad, come out. I'm
not playing hide and seek,

1245
01:24:09,394 --> 01:24:11,597
especially not with my ex.

1246
01:24:12,195 --> 01:24:14,429
She's picking us off one by one.

1247
01:24:14,431 --> 01:24:16,999
We can't hide from here forever.

1248
01:24:17,001 --> 01:24:18,904
So let her find me.

1249
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,937
Jax?

1250
01:24:21,939 --> 01:24:23,104
I'm coming out.

1251
01:24:23,106 --> 01:24:24,943
So we can talk.

1252
01:24:27,244 --> 01:24:29,045
I've been thinking.

1253
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:31,817
Maybe it's not too late for us.

1254
01:24:35,887 --> 01:24:37,152
Jax?

1255
01:24:37,154 --> 01:24:38,987
It's not too late.

1256
01:24:38,989 --> 01:24:41,726
We can still take that magic
carpet and fly to Cabo.

1257
01:24:45,797 --> 01:24:46,999
Wait, wait, wait.

1258
01:24:47,731 --> 01:24:49,331
Answer me one question.

1259
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:51,867
Do you believe in soul mate?

1260
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:53,368
No.

1261
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:55,103
Me neither.

1262
01:24:55,105 --> 01:24:56,707
Aah!

1263
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:05,183
Give it to me! I've earned it!

1264
01:25:23,735 --> 01:25:25,134
Please. We had a bargain.

1265
01:25:25,136 --> 01:25:27,339
This has to end.

1266
01:25:42,954 --> 01:25:45,054
I'm free.

1267
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:47,288
Unlock your heart.

1268
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:50,792
Stop your sufferings.
Set free your rage.

1269
01:25:50,794 --> 01:25:53,895
Right now this rage is
all I got.

1270
01:25:53,897 --> 01:25:55,766
Everyone I ever loved is dead.

1271
01:25:56,066 --> 01:25:59,171
Every dream I have gone.

1272
01:26:00,337 --> 01:26:03,339
Go to your ship, Sinbad.

1273
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:06,878
See why the
Jinn couldn't grant your
deepest wish.

1274
01:26:07,477 --> 01:26:11,913
How could she? You can't
resurrect the living.

1275
01:26:11,915 --> 01:26:13,318
Nick!

1276
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:18,953
You're alive!

1277
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:23,091
Dude! Dude!
I've been working all hard all
day to get the army to find you.

1278
01:26:23,093 --> 01:26:26,127
The fact that I had no idea
where you were hindered
those plans a bit.

1279
01:26:26,129 --> 01:26:28,029
Bro, I saw you drown.

1280
01:26:28,031 --> 01:26:31,066
Yeah. A lifeboat pulled me out
the water that's to Daphne.

1281
01:26:31,068 --> 01:26:34,202
I few up and didn't let the
Coast Guard sleep until they
found him.

1282
01:26:34,204 --> 01:26:38,943
I got a bit of a bump on my head
but at least I got the boat
fixed up and running.

1283
01:26:40,977 --> 01:26:42,210
What'd I miss?

1284
01:26:42,212 --> 01:26:43,912
Nothing important.

1285
01:26:43,914 --> 01:26:46,014
Everything all good
with the heart?

1286
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,818
Yeah. Yeah.

1287
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,085
Everything's just fine.

1288
01:26:51,087 --> 01:26:52,787
Should I call off the troops?

1289
01:26:52,789 --> 01:26:56,058
Yeah. Call them off right now.
They find out who we are, we're
all gonna be in trouble.

1290
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,158
Most definitely.

1291
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,963
Right. Right.

1292
01:26:59,864 --> 01:27:03,499
So, can we go to Chile now?

1293
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:05,369
We can go...

1294
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:08,839
where ever we want.
