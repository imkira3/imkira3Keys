2
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,678
Cold this morning, Captain.

3
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,397
Cold.

4
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,536
And hard.

5
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,721
lt's time, captain.

6
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,726
lt's time.

7
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,314
Time indeed.

8
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,290
What are you doing? You're supposed
to be upstairs sleeping.

9
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,126
Stanley keeps waking me up.

10
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,170
l get it.

11
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,673
Boy, are you getting heavy.

12
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,591
Don't let her pull more
than her usual nonsense.

13
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,511
Two stories, two glasses of water.

14
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,683
-Jack, you're going to miss the plane.
-Okay. Cricket, you listen to me.

15
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,145
Go upstairs with Mrs. Wheeler now
and go to sleep.

16
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,690
On my business trip,
I'll get Stanley a little brother.

17
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,609
-Will you promise?
-l promise.

18
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,773
-Can I get you anything, sir?
-No, thank you very much.

19
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,152
If you try and get sleep,
the flight will go faster.

20
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,530
l can never sleep on a plane.

21
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,325
-Turbulence.
-Pardon?

22
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,953
Turbulence. Solar radiation
heats the earth's crust,

23
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,997
warm air rises, cold air descends.

24
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:19,669
-Turbulence. I don't like that.
-Try to sleep anyway.

25
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,209
Dr. Ryan?

26
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,603
Jack, boy, get yourself in here.

27
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:23,525
-Jesus! You look like hell.
-Thank you very much, Admiral.

28
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,445
-Want coffee?
-l think I need some coffee.

29
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,656
I'm not going to ask you
how your flight went.

30
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,075
When's the last time
you got some sleep?

31
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,621
l don't know.
This thing's still on London time.

32
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,541
-Milk and sugar?
-Milk and sugar.

33
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,793
So how's Caroline?

34
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,961
Last time I saw her

35
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,173
was at your granddad's place
in Maine, wasn't it?

36
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,509
She's fine. Sends you her best.

37
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,013
-And Sally?
-She's fine.

38
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,056
What is she now, three?

39
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,393
No, she's a very precocious five.

40
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,355
She announced
to Caroline and I the other day

41
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,316
that her life would be
considerably less lonely

42
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,903
if we were to buy her a baby brother.

43
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,909
But she decided it would be enough
if we were to buy one for Stanley.

44
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,622
-Who's Stanley?
-Stanley's a bear.

45
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,629
All right. What's important enough
to get you on a plane

46
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,881
in the middle of the night?

47
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,675
British Intelligence
obtained these pictures two days ago.

48
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,638
She's the Red October,
the latest Typhoon class.

49
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,097
Big son of a bitch.

50
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,642
Twelve meters longer
than the standard Typhoon.

51
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:43,355
Three meters wider.
The captain's name is Ramius.

52
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,774
-One of yours?
-Yeah. I did his bio last year.

53
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:50,320
He's taken out the lead boat
in each new sub class for 10 years.

54
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,197
Fairly good political connections.

55
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,408
Trained most of their
attack boat skippers.

56
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,037
The Russians call him
Vilnius Nastavnik.

57
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,499
The Vilnius schoolmaster.

58
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,338
-What are these doors?
-Those doors, sir, are the problem.

59
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,049
l don't know what they are.
Neither do the British.

60
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,136
Perhaps our friends in Murmansk
have come up with something new.

61
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,431
With your permission,
I'd like to show these to someone.

62
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,517
-Do you know Skip Tyler?
-Sub driver.

63
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,603
Was. Clipped by a drunk driver.
Lost his leg.

64
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,023
He's teaching at the academy,
consulting for navy labs.

65
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,776
-Clearance?
-Top secret or better.

66
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,365
Margie, have a car for Dr. Ryan
downstairs in 10 minutes.

67
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,832
A satellite caught Red October
in Polijarny inlet this morning.

68
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,833
Do you hear it?

69
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,502
No.

70
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,547
Beaumont, at Cal Tech
we used to do this in our sleep.

71
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,299
You hear it now?

72
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,219
Wait a minute. Maybe.

73
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,350
-It's buried in surface clutter?
-Yes.

74
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,686
-l should go to SAPS?
-Correct, Seaman Beaumont.

75
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,732
Signal algorithmic processing systems.

76
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,653
Give it a week,
and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

77
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,321
So. . .

78
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:02,827
Like Beethoven on the computer,
you have labored to produce

79
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,044
a biologic.

80
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,175
-A what?
-A whale, Beaumont. A whale.

81
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,512
A marine mammal that knows
a hell of a lot more about sonar

82
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,264
than you do. Kill the SAPS.

83
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,644
Train over to 2-6-9 and let's try it again.

84
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,940
If he gets to ragging on you too bad,
ask him about Pavarotti.

85
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,692
We don't have time for sea stories.

86
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,861
l was in the middle
of teaching Seaman Beaumont

87
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,114
the intricacies of modern sonar. Now. . .

88
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,659
l ain't chief of the boat.
I'm Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

89
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,620
-Cob, please.
-Come on, Cob. Tell me.

90
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,082
Okay. Fine. Go ahead.

91
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,838
Seaman Jones here,
he's into music in a big way.

92
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,006
He figures this whole boat is basically

93
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,802
just his own
personal, private stereo set.

94
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,888
-He gets this piece of Pavarotti. . .
-He was Paganini.

95
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,057
-Whatever.
-Paganini.

96
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,350
This is my story, okay?

97
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,688
Tell it right. Pavarotti's a tenor.
Paganini was a composer.

98
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,650
Okay. So he's got this music,
and he's got it out in the water.

99
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,529
He's listening on his headsets,
happy as a clam.

100
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,073
Then all hell breaks loose.

101
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,869
-A slew of boats out of San Diego. . .
-including one way out at Pearl.

102
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,371
Including one way out at Pearl.

103
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,249
All of a sudden,
they start hearing Pavarotti.

104
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,294
-Pavarotti. . .
-Coming out of their asses.

105
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,840
-What do I do?
-l got it.

106
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,763
Conn, Sonar.
New contact, bearing 0-9-7 .

107
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,891
Designate contact number Sierra 3-5.

108
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,811
-Captain, aye. What've you got, Jones?
-Distant contact, probably submerged.

109
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,104
It's a wild guess,

110
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,024
but I'd say we hit a boomer
coming out of the barn.

111
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,319
Could be a missile boat out of Polijarny.

112
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,447
Okay. Start your track.
I'll be there in a minute.

113
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,073
Sonar, aye.

114
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,011
Time to open the orders, sir.

115
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,767
The Political Officer is in your cabin.

116
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,936
Very well.

117
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,730
You have the conn.

118
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,002
What are you doing?

119
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:44,382
l must oversee
the stability of the crew, Captain.

120
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,304
By invading my privacy?

121
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:55,351
Privacy is not a major concern
in the Soviet Union, comrade.

122
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,022
It's often contrary to the collective good.

123
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,906
"Behold, I am coming as a thief. . .

124
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,284
"And they gathered them together

125
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,664
"In a place called. . .

126
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,333
"Armageddon."

127
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,503
"And the seventh angel
poured forth his bowl into the air,

128
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,506
"and a voice cried out
from heaven, saying,

129
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,967
"'It is done."'

130
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:34,432
A man with your responsibilities
reading about the end of the world.

131
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,850
And what's this?

132
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,022
"l am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

133
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,234
It is an ancient Hindu text
quoted by an American.

134
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,613
-American?
-He invented the atomic bomb,

135
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,866
and he was later accused
of being a communist.

136
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,079
You wrote
and underlined these passages?

137
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,580
No.

138
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,796
This book belonged to my wife.
l keep it for sentimental value.

139
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,132
I'm sorry, Comrade Captain.
Your wife was a beautiful woman.

140
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,718
Her death was unfortunate.

141
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,722
I'm only doing my job.
It is my responsibility.

142
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,813
How many agents
did the KGB put aboard my boat?

143
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,982
-Your boat, Captain?
-Yes.

144
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,568
This vessel belongs
to the people of the Soviet Union.

145
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,532
Besides, if the KGB
or the GRU has agents aboard,

146
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,826
l will be the last to know.

147
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,872
l suggest we open our orders, Captain.

148
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,876
Certainly, comrade.

149
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,754
"From Commander. . .

150
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,841
"Strategic submarine forces
red banner northern fleet."

151
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:37,180
We're to proceed north
to grid square reference 54-90

152
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:41,017
and rendezvous with
Alfa submarine Konovaicv.

153
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,896
-Captain Tupolev's boat.
-You know Tupolev?

154
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,400
l know he descends from aristocracy
and that he was your student.

155
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,696
It's rumored he has a special place
in his heart for you.

156
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,825
There's little room in Tupolev's heart
for anyone but Tupolev.

157
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,041
Having made contact,
we are to run a series of drills.

158
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,127
Tupolev will hunt us
while we test our ship.

159
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,046
Having evaluated
the operational readiness

160
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,255
of the caterpillar drive,

161
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,551
we are to return to Polijarny
on or about the 16th of this month.

162
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:22,266
Captain, this is an historic moment.
I'd like to make a request.

163
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,894
-Before you proceed, comrade. . .
-l know it's not protocol,

164
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,771
but would you permit me
to post our orders

165
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,690
and inform the crew of our mission?

166
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,261
Where I'm going, you cannot follow.

167
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,002
Dr. Petrov, report
to my cabin immediately.

168
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,005
There's been a dreadful accident.

169
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,328
Buddy!

170
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,048
Daniel, got any more rods? More rods!

171
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,343
Listen to me.
There's no cradle underneath it.

172
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,804
-Get it over.
-Relax! Stop being an old maid.

173
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,057
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?

174
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,101
-All right. Bring her up.
-What? What?

175
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,646
Ryan!

176
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,898
Who let you in here?

177
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:38,152
Skip, what, have they
got you playing with models now?

178
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,073
Damn it, Bill! Tell them to slow down!

179
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,409
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
Slow it down, will you?

180
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,997
It's not a model.
The DSRV. Rescue sub.

181
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,251
l know what it is.
What are you doing with it?

182
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,836
We're rigging it
with a generic docking collar

183
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,173
so it'll mate with British, German. . .
Just about anybody's sub.

184
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,468
We can get it
anywhere in the world in 24 hours.

185
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,681
-How's your back?
-It's fine.

186
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,101
Have you got a minute?

187
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,647
Bigger than a regular Typhoon.

188
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,485
-What are these doors?
-You don't miss much, do you?

189
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,405
Those are too big to be torpedo tubes.

190
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,492
Would you launch an ICBM horizontally?

191
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:30,329
Sure. Why would you want to?
They're symmetrical.

192
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,917
Right down the long axis of the sub.

193
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:39,547
-How about a towed sonar array?
-Nope. Too close to the screws.

194
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,299
I'll be. . .

195
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,053
This. . . This could be a caterpillar.

196
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,015
-A what?
-A caterpillar drive.

197
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,767
Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

198
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,811
-You follow?
-No.

199
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,815
It's like a jet engine for the water.

200
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,109
Goes in the front,
gets squirted out the back.

201
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,988
Only it's got no moving parts,
so it's very, very quiet.

202
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,740
Like how quiet?

203
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,534
It's doubtful our sonar
would even pick it up.

204
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,827
And if it did,

205
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,622
it would sound like whales humping
or a seismic anomaly.

206
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,750
Anything but a submarine.

207
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,711
We messed with this
a couple of years ago.

208
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,130
Couldn't make it work.

209
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,718
They really built this?
This isn't a mock-up or anything?

210
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,220
She put to sea this morning.

211
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,686
When I was 12,

212
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,189
l helped my daddy
build a bomb shelter in our basement

213
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,566
because some fool
parked a dozen warheads

214
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,819
90 miles off the coast of Florida.

215
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,365
This thing could park
a couple of hundred warheads

216
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,949
off Washington and New York,

217
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,870
and no one would know
anything about it until it was all over.

218
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,052
-Are you all right, Captain?
-Yes.

219
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:12,932
It's just to die for something
as petty as slipping on tea.

220
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,851
You're blaming yourself, Captain.
It was an accident.

221
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,854
-You'll feel better when we put in.
-Put in?

222
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,648
To base, Captain.

223
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,401
We cannot
go on without a political officer.

224
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,570
Doctor, this is a combat vessel
of the Soviet Navy,

225
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,989
and I'm a senior combat officer.

226
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,993
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.

227
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,831
Seaman, come here.

228
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,251
Come here.

229
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,672
-Your name?
-Cook's Assistant Loginov, sir.

230
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,342
Good. I want you and the doctor
to witness this.

231
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,097
I'm removing
the political officer's missile key. . .

232
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:57,435
Carry on. And I'm keeping it myself.

233
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,438
Captain, I think we should report this
to Red Fleet Command.

234
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,483
I'm afraid that's impossible, Doctor.
Our orders are for strict radio silence.

235
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,402
Orders, sir.

236
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,446
-That's all, Loginov.
-Yes, sir.

237
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,449
This is most unnerving, Captain.

238
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,244
The reason for having two missile keys

239
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,832
is so that no one man may. . .

240
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,667
May what?

241
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,255
May arm the missiles.
Perhaps I should keep the key.

242
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,091
-Thank you. That'll be all, Doctor.
-Captain, l. . .

243
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:33,220
When I address the crew,
then you will understand.

244
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,931
Yes, sir.

245
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,394
-Petrov.
-Yes, sir?

246
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:45,858
l will try to forget your comments
when I present my report.

247
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,068
Thank you, sir.

248
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,660
Holding steady on 3-1-0.

249
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,330
Twelve knots at about 20,000 yards.

250
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,583
-Have you got a make on him?
-Computer's chewing on it, sir.

251
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,879
Twin screws.
The plant noise sounds like a Typhoon.

252
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,265
I'd say we got a new boat, sir.

253
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,018
Tommy, I miss
something on the boards?

254
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,896
Sub plant hasn't said anything about it.

255
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,192
All right.

256
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,860
How many Typhoons
we got in the computer?

257
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,906
-Six, sir.
-Okay. Call this guy Typhoon 7 .

258
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,700
Start a tape on him.
See if we can work in a little closer.

259
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,494
Yes, sir.

260
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,704
Won't he hear us?

261
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,123
Not if we stay
in his baffles, Seaman Beaumont.

262
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,876
Not if we stay in his baffles.

263
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,797
Come in behind his propeller,
and he's deaf as a post.

264
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,245
Any sonar contacts, Mr. Kamarov?

265
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,747
No contacts, Captain.
The sonar is clear.

266
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,209
Good. Do we have
any surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?

267
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,628
-No contacts, sir. Scope is clear.
-Good.

268
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,048
Then it is time
l explain our orders to the crew.

269
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,886
Comrades, this is your captain.

270
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,723
It is an honor to speak to you today,

271
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,767
and I'm honored to be sailing with you
on the maiden voyage

272
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,937
of our motherland's
most recent achievement.

273
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:51,775
And once more,
we play our dangerous game,

274
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,611
a game of chess,

275
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,698
against our old adversary,
the American Navy.

276
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,117
For 40 years,

277
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,786
your fathers before you
and your older brothers

278
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,247
played this game and played it well.

279
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:10,252
But today, the game is different.
We have the advantage.

280
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:14,923
It reminds me of the heady days
of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin,

281
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,260
when the world trembled
at the sound of our rockets.

282
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:22,306
They will tremble again
at the sound of our silence.

283
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,644
-The order is engage for silent drive.
-Aye, sir.

284
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,481
-Ballast control, open outer doors.
-Yes, open outer doors.

285
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,774
Diving command.

286
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,943
Engage caterpillar
and secure main engines.

287
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,616
Doors opening, Captain.

288
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,162
Comrades, our own fleet
doesn't know our full potential.

289
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,915
They will do
everything possible to test us,

290
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,001
but they will only test
their own embarrassment.

291
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,337
We will leave our fleet behind.

292
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,798
We will pass through
the American patrols,

293
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,841
pass their sonar nets,

294
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:03,430
and lay off their largest city
and listen to their rock 'n' roll

295
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,517
while we conduct missile drills.

296
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,435
Then...

297
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,938
And when we are finished,

298
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,358
the only sound they will hear
is our laughter

299
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,193
while we sail to Havana,

300
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,780
where the sun is warm
and so is the comradeship.

301
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,701
Cryogenic plant
coming on line, Captain.

302
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:28,455
A great day, comrades.
We sail into history.

303
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,297
Caterpillar engaging.

304
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,928
Caterpillar engaging, Captain.

305
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,111
-What happened?
-l don't know.

306
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,766
-Full rudder left.
-Full rudder left.

307
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,269
Navigator. New course, 2-5-0.

308
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,606
-Yes, new course, 2-5-0.
-Steering 2-5-0 .

309
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,275
Yes, course is 2-5-0.

310
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:12,976
Sonar contact, Captain.
Port quarter. Close aboard.

311
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,687
American, Los Angeles class.

312
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,609
-American. Captain, we. . .
-Course 3-1-0 .

313
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:25,739
-ls the American turning to follow us?
-No, Captain.

314
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,742
The American is continuing
in his original course.

315
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,246
-He's continuing northwest.
-He can't hear us.

316
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,915
And the singing?

317
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,889
Let them sing.

318
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,368
What are you talking about?
Check your gear.

319
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,954
Running diagnostics now, Captain.

320
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,214
Sonar is working, Captain.
The Russian disappeared.

321
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,301
One minute, he was steady
4,000 yards off the bow,

322
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:31,722
and then he was gone,
and for a second, I thought I heard. . .

323
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:37,644
-Heard what?
-l thought I heard singing, sir.

324
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,440
-Singing?
-Yes, sir.

325
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:14,181
Good morning, sir.
l hope we had a lovely evening.

326
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,892
A little chilly this morning.

327
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,670
There's a letter there
from Marko Ramius.

328
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,173
Marko.

329
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,205
Yes?

330
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,959
No. This is Dr. Ryan.

331
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,588
What the hell happened?

332
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,298
Come on. This is no longer

333
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,342
a research project.

334
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,640
l got a line on those doors.

335
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,186
You know what they are?

336
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:49,192
-A nearly silent propulsion system?
-How did you know that?

337
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,154
The captain of the sub
following her radioed in.

338
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:57,034
Thing disappeared right in front of him,
and that's only the half of it.

339
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,827
Read.

340
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,502
I'm sorry.

341
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,465
-Got your l. D .?
-My God, this is unbelievable.

342
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:16,386
The Kirov, three Sverdlovsk,
the Kiev, the Minsk.

343
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,346
They've sortied their whole bloody fleet.

344
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,639
That's about the size of it.

345
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,809
-Good afternoon, Admiral.
-Afternoon, Matthew.

346
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,603
Where are we going, anyway?

347
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:29,149
Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt,
President's National Security Adviser.

348
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:34,029
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there,
along with a few other people.

349
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:37,949
-Who's giving the briefing?
-You are.

350
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,452
The yeoman will have all the slides
laid out for you.

351
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,996
So all you got to do. . .

352
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:53,924
Look, no one understands
this material better than you.

353
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,178
Just give him a rundown on the sub
and a précis of the stuff in your hand.

354
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,764
He's liable
to ask some direct questions.

355
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,101
Give him direct answers.
Tell him what you think.

356
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,645
Come on.

357
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,403
Gentlemen, the last 24 hours have seen

358
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,324
some extraordinary
Soviet Naval activity.

359
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:23,328
The first to sail was this ship,
we believe called the Red October

360
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,124
in reference
to the October Revolution of 1917 .

361
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,128
A variant of the Typhoon class,
she's some 650 feet long

362
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,713
and 32,000 tons
submerged displacement,

363
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:38,135
roughly the same size
as a World War ll aircraft carrier.

364
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,472
We believe that these doors,
here on the bow and again on the stern,

365
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,975
enclose a unique propulsion system,

366
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,520
a magneto-hydrodynamic drive,
or caterpillar,

367
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:52,065
that would enable
the sub to run virtually silent.

368
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,484
It is possible that this new drive system

369
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,570
allowed the captain,
a man named Ramius,

370
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,697
their senior and perhaps
most respected commander. . .

371
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,699
Do we have his picture available?

372
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,327
Allowed Ramius to elude
one of our attack boats, the Dallas,

373
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,747
which trailed Red October
from harbor this morning.

374
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,461
It is also possible
that this drive system, if operable,

375
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,589
could render the Red October

376
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:19,259
undetectable to our SOSUS
warning nets in the Atlantic.

377
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,346
Mr. Ryan, would you characterize this
as a first-strike weapon?

378
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,519
That is a possibility, sir.

379
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,063
It is designed to approach by stealth

380
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,691
and to shower its target
with multiple independent warheads

381
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,111
with little or no warning before impact.

382
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,448
Goddamn thing's made to start a war.

383
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,700
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

384
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,244
About the same time
the Dallas lost contact,

385
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:50,373
there were additional sailings from
Polijarny and from Leningrad

386
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,376
on the Baltic
and from the Mediterranean.

387
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,795
There are now
some 58 nuclear submarines

388
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,548
headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

389
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,219
This afternoon a satellite pass
over Polijarny found heat blooms

390
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,721
in the engineering plants
o the Kirov, the Minsk,

391
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,848
and more than 20 other
cruisers and destroyers,

392
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,226
indicating they were preparing to sail.

393
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,729
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.

394
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,232
Admiral Greer, your conclusions.

395
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,902
Sir, the data support
no conclusions as yet.

396
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:24,491
The absence of activity in the Pacific
suggests this could be just an exercise.

397
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,161
-It may have nothing to do. . .
-Suppose it's not an exercise?

398
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,039
Suppose this is the beginning
of a move against NATO?

399
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,500
NSA can speak for that, Mr. Pelt.

400
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,586
l must emphasize the extreme
sensitivity of this information

401
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,338
and that it not leave the room.

402
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:42,926
Before sailing, Captain Ramius
sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin,

403
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,638
Chairman of the Red Fleet
Northern Political Directorate.

404
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,599
-That's her uncle.
-Whose uncle?

405
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,019
Ramius' wife. Padorin's her uncle.

406
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:57,315
Now, the contents
of the letter are unknown,

407
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,818
but Admiral Padorin
immediately demanded

408
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:04,864
a meeting with Premier Chernenko,
and within minutes of that meeting,

409
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:09,369
the Soviet fleet sailed with orders
to find Red October and sink her.

410
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,956
Sink her?

411
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,625
My God.
They've got a madman on their hands.

412
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,794
If it gets within 500 miles of the coast,

413
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:21,840
we'll have
less than two minutes' warning.

414
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,356
-Today's the 23rd, isn't it?
-What?

415
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,900
-ls today the 23rd?
-Yeah.

416
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,581
You son of a bitch.

417
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,043
You son of a bitch!

418
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,674
You wish to add something
to our discussion, Dr. Ryan?

419
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,556
Sir, I was just thinking

420
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,685
that perhaps there's
another possibility we might consider.

421
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,356
Ramius might be trying to defect.

422
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,191
Do you mean to suggest
that this man has come. . .

423
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,485
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

424
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,285
Ramius trained most
of their officer corps,

425
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,373
which would put him in a position
to select men willing to help him.

426
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,042
And he's not Russian.

427
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:43,463
He's Lithuanian by birth, raised by
his paternal grandfather, a fisherman.

428
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,801
And he has no children,
no ties to leave behind.

429
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,724
And today is the first anniversary
of his wife's death.

430
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,895
Come on. You're just an analyst.
How can you read his mind?

431
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,106
l know Ramius, General.

432
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,692
He's nearly a legend
in the submarine community.

433
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,236
He's been a maverick his entire career.

434
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,696
l actually met him once
at an embassy dinner.

435
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,492
Have you ever met
Captain Ramius, General?

436
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,668
Admiral Hollis,

437
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:27,257
how long before Ramius could be
in a position to fire his missiles at us?

438
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,092
Four days.

439
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:33,388
All right. I'll brief the President.
That will be all, gentlemen.

440
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:37,517
Dr. Ryan,
would you stay for a moment, please?

441
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,688
l said speak your mind,
Jack, but Jesus. . .

442
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,620
You slammed the door
on the general pretty hard, Jack.

443
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,207
-That was not my intention, sir.
-Yes, it was.

444
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,002
He was patronizing you,
and you stomped on him.

445
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,588
In my opinion, he deserved it.

446
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:12,218
Listen, I'm a politician,
which means I'm a cheat and a liar,

447
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,930
and when I'm not kissing babies,
I'm stealing their lollipops,

448
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,809
but it also means
that I keep my options open.

449
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:26,065
So let's assume for a minute
that you're right

450
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:31,029
and this Russian intends to defect.

451
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,532
What do you suggest we do about it?

452
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,871
-We definitely grab the boat, sir.
-Wait a minute.

453
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,124
We're not talking
about some stray pilot with a MIG.

454
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,167
We're talking about

455
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,545
several billion dollars' worth
of Soviet state property.

456
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,006
They're going to want it back.

457
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,216
Maybe it's enough then

458
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,551
just to get some people onboard
and inspect it.

459
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,847
Call it whatever you want to. . .
A coast guard safety inspection.

460
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,600
So how do we proceed?

461
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,146
First, we need to contact
the commanders in the Atlantic directly.

462
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,731
The Russians get one whiff of this

463
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,274
through the regular
communications circuits,

464
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,943
the game is up.

465
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,987
Second, we figure out
how we can help them.

466
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:17,700
We devise a plan to intercede,
ready to go at a moment's notice.

467
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,746
Third, somebody's
got to go make contact with Ramius

468
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,290
and find out
what his intentions really are.

469
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,543
Okay. When do you leave?

470
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,712
Wait a minute.

471
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,758
The general was right.

472
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,969
l am not field personnel.
l am only an analyst.

473
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,220
You're perfect.

474
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,264
l can't ask
any of these characters to go.

475
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,807
They don't believe in it.

476
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,893
They'd never stake their reputation
on a hunch, whereas you. . .

477
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,979
Are expendable.

478
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,817
Something like that.

479
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,574
I'll give you three days
to prove your theory correct.

480
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:02,412
After that, I have to hunt down Ramius
and destroy him.

481
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,080
Will you do it?

482
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,267
Mother of God! Secure the mast!

483
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,769
All ahead, two-thirds!
Set depth to 900 meters!

484
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:30,648
-What is it? What's happened?
-Mast secured, helm at two-thirds.

485
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,989
-Commence heading 2-0-5.
-2-0-5, affirmative.

486
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,756
These orders
are seven bloody hours old!

487
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,009
Sitting on the bottom
like an addled schoolboy.

488
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,385
-Captain. . .
-Passing at. . .

489
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,638
-All ahead, flank.
-All ahead, flank.

490
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,264
Inquire of the engineer
about the possibility

491
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,267
of going to 105% on the reactor.

492
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:12,231
Seven hours.
The entire fleet is after him.

493
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,618
-Leveling at 900 meters.
-Very well.

494
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:28,331
Captain, engineer reports
105% on the reactor possible,

495
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,583
but not recommended.

496
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,429
Go to 105 on the reactor.

497
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,686
Captain, what is it?
Where are we going?

498
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,689
We're going to kill a friend, Yevgeni.

499
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,692
We're going to kill Ramius.

500
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:21,718
If you like borscht, perhaps,
but I've eaten better in an oiler's galley.

501
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,344
My wife said to the waiter,

502
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,223
"Where did this man
learn to cook, Afghanistan?"

503
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,184
So then we went on
to the Bolshoi, the ballet,

504
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,730
to see this new girl as Giselle.
You remember how beautiful she was.

505
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:37,442
-She just married a factory manager.
-Excuse me, Doctor.

506
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:43,322
Do you have the figures
for the latest batch of radiation tests?

507
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,117
-Now?
-Now.

508
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,749
Perhaps you could bring
the preceding set as well

509
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,792
for comparison.

510
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,587
Thank you, Doctor.

511
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,106
It will take him some time.

512
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,486
Before we begin, Captain,

513
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,573
I'd like to know
exactly what happened to Putin.

514
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,872
He didn't slip on his tea, did he?

515
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,292
l don't think I like your tone, Slavin.

516
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,795
What the hell's
my tone got to do with it?

517
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:43,800
-We're risking our lives here.
-Putin could've caused complications.

518
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,301
Did you think
he would just go away and sulk

519
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,804
while we carried out our plans?

520
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,556
Are you saying he was murdered?

521
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,476
-My God.
-Stop whining, Yuri.

522
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,480
-How can you justify murder?
-So he was murdered.

523
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,856
The man was a pig,

524
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,567
but it's a decision
we should've all made together.

525
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,027
You are not in command here.

526
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,947
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.

527
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,075
-What are you talking about?
-They could kill us all.

528
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,203
Everything that
happens on this ship affects us all.

529
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,539
The Master-at-Arms
is already suspicious.

530
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,167
-We could still go back.
-There will be no going back.

531
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:26,384
Before we sailed,
l dispatched a letter to Admiral Padorin,

532
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,304
in which I announced
our intention to defect.

533
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,476
In the name of God, why?

534
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,731
When he reached the New World,
Cortez burned his ships.

535
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,443
As a result,
his men were well motivated.

536
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,946
You have signed our death warrants.

537
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,367
-Padorin will send the entire fleet.
-Jesus, they'll find us.

538
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,577
They'll find us and. . .

539
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,788
No one's going to find us.
That's enough, Yuri.

540
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,166
You had to do it,

541
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,879
you couldn't just turn the submarine
over to the Americans.

542
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,882
You had to make a political statement.

543
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:10,428
Or was it something deeper, Captain,

544
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:14,432
something that made you
unable to slip away?

545
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:20,146
-Was it ego, Captain?
-We each have our reasons, Victor.

546
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:25,067
My own began the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship,

547
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,362
a ship which had but one use.

548
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,906
And as for the rest,

549
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,826
those are things
that I alone must carry the burden for.

550
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,998
Anatoli, you're afraid of our fleet.

551
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,751
You should be.

552
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:45,463
Personally,
l give us one chance in three.

553
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,094
More tea, anyone?

554
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,016
No?

555
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,187
Then you may report back to your posts.

556
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,498
You heard the Captain. Dismissed.

557
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,634
Captain.

558
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,190
Captain, I would never
disagree with you in front of the men,

559
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,858
you know that.

560
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:52,071
But in this case, Victor is right.

561
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,867
It would've been better
if you had not informed Moscow.

562
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,869
Vasily.

563
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:03,833
Moscow is not the worry,
nor the whole Soviet navy.

564
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:08,254
l know their tactics.
l have the advantage.

565
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,841
No.

566
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,261
The worry is the Americans.

567
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,100
If we meet the right sort, this will work.

568
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:27,231
We get some buckaroo. . .

569
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:38,409
Some turbulence, Commander?
You don't like flying. This is nothing!

570
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,953
You should've been with us
five, six months ago!

571
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,039
You talk about puke!

572
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,375
We ran into a hailstorm
over the Sea of Japan, right?

573
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,461
Everybody's retching their guts out!

574
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,338
The pilot shot his lunch
all over the windshield,

575
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,549
and I barf on the radio!

576
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,301
Knocked it out completely,

577
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,219
and it wasn't
that lightweight stuff either!

578
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,056
It was that chunky,
industrial-weight puke!

579
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,599
You want a bite?

580
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:07,480
Jack, next time you get a bright idea,
just put it in a memo.

581
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,823
Sir.

582
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,619
That'll be all, Lieutenant. Thank you.

583
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,746
That hawkeye from Weymouth Trap?

584
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,707
Four wire.
Caught a gust over the fantail.

585
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,584
Not bad, considering.

586
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,921
-The gentleman is here to see you.
-The gentleman?

587
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,799
What the hell
you talking about, Charlie?

588
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,717
l apologize for the uniform, sir.

589
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,929
This is Admiral Greer's idea
of a low profile.

590
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:43,724
-You work for Jim Greer?
-That's right, sir.

591
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,686
Then I imagine you'll tell me
what all the hubbub's about.

592
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,357
Captain, you got a minute?

593
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,693
Jonesy's got something
l think you ought to see.

594
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,779
Martinez, get yourself a cup of coffee.

595
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,573
-Send me up some tea.
-Aye, Captain.

596
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,285
Messenger, get the captain a cup of tea.

597
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,331
Captain.

598
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:12,962
Sir, the moment that sub went silent
and I thought I heard some singing,

599
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,214
l heard something
in the background real faint.

600
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:19,885
After all those subs took off,
l caught it again and got it on tape.

601
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,223
l washed it through the computer
and was able to isolate this sound.

602
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,062
When I asked
the computer to identify it,

603
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,982
what I got was magma displacement.

604
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,526
You see, sir, the SAPS software

605
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,237
was originally
written to look for seismic events.

606
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:42,241
l think when it gets confused,
it kind of runs home to mama.

607
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,619
-I'm not following you, Jonesy.
-Sir, I'm sorry.

608
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,914
Listen to it at 10 times speed.

609
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,133
Now, that's
got to be man-made, Captain.

610
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,968
All right.

611
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:07,057
The first contact was at 09:15,
and the bearing was 2-6-9.

612
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,517
At 09:30, it was here.

613
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,605
l came back to it at 11:00 and 11:15,
here and here.

614
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:16,233
Remember the dispatch we got
about Russian sub skippers

615
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,527
running the Reykjanes Ridge
at high speeds

616
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,822
because they had hyper-accurate
surveys of the underwater canyons?

617
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:26,368
The front door to those canyons
was a formation called Thor's Twins.

618
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,995
Yeah?

619
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,885
Look at that.

620
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,139
-Right into Red Route One.
-Captain.

621
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,059
You may think I'm crazy,

622
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:55,064
but I'll bet that magma displacement
was actually some new Russian sub,

623
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,816
and it's headed for the Iceland coast.

624
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:02,279
Have I got this straight, Jonesy?

625
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,908
A $40 million computer
tells you you're chasing an earthquake,

626
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:10,079
but you don't believe it,
and you come up with this on your own?

627
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,916
-Yes, sir.
-Including all the navigation math?

628
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,461
-Sir, I've got all the. . .
-Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.

629
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:22,466
Tommy, I want you
to plot us a speed course

630
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,594
for the bottom end of Red Route One.

631
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,932
We'll never find him in those canyons.
First take us to periscope depth.

632
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:33,352
-This we got to phone in.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

633
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,363
Hang on, Jonesy.

634
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,830
If I can get you close enough,
can you track this sucker?

635
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,624
Yes, sir.

636
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,919
Now that I know what to listen for,
I'll bag him.

637
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,881
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.

638
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,844
That's the craziest notion
I've ever heard.

639
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:10,848
A serving line officer?
An entire ballistic missile submarine?

640
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,349
They can't all want to defect.

641
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,144
Even if it's only the officers,
it's extremely difficult to believe.

642
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,813
-What's his plan?
-His plan?

643
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,443
Russians don't take a dump, son,
without a plan.

644
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,903
Senior captains don't start
something this dangerous

645
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,613
without having thought
the matter through.

646
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,781
What's he going to do,

647
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,075
sail into New York,
pop the hatch, and say here I am?

648
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,077
It might be just that simple, yes.

649
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,164
Things may appear simple
in the cubicle at CIA,

650
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,665
but in the middle of the Atlantic

651
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,335
with Soviet warships
bearing down on us,

652
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,502
they get more complex.

653
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,505
-Smoke?
-No, thank you.

654
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,925
And I don't think your notion
of a few days' inspection

655
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,844
is going to wash either.

656
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:52,306
In order to be of any value,
you'd have to tear it apart.

657
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,308
The metallurgy would
take a couple of months.

658
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:59,063
-Then we'd have to keep it.
-What will you do with the crew?

659
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:03,150
Ones that don't defect
will go back and say we got the boat.

660
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,362
Or do you plan to eliminate them?

661
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,323
We're not at war, sir.

662
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:13,202
So you have to get
them off the boat in such a way

663
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,037
that they think we don't have it,

664
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,874
and they'll report
that we don't have it to their bosses.

665
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,669
Otherwise, this whole business
is just academic, right?

666
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,007
Yes, sir. I think I see your point.

667
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,804
When's the last time you slept?

668
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,807
A while.

669
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:39,186
-The chief outside will fix you up.
-Thank you, sir.

670
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,022
Captain.

671
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,447
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.
We'll be in the CIC .

672
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,909
Things are liable
to get a little dicey around here.

673
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,286
Yes, sir.

674
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,589
-You think he's crazy?
-Certifiable.

675
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:12,094
No matter what his credentials,
l don't care for him wearing the uniform.

676
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,013
Did you see that ring on his finger?

677
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,600
-The academy, class of '72. A Marine.
-You're kidding.

678
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,978
-How did you. . .
-Greer told me.

679
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:25,315
Summer of his third year,
he went down in a chopper accident.

680
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,776
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

681
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:33,323
That kid spent 10 months in traction
and another year learning to walk again.

682
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,535
He did his fourth year from the hospital.

683
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,495
It's up to you, Charlie,

684
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,207
but you might consider
cutting the kid a little slack.

685
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:49,256
Russians are going to find that sub
before we get near it, anyway.

686
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,906
-Passing Thor's Twins, sir.
-Very good.

687
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,954
Passing the Twins now, Captain.

688
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,290
Very good.
You may commence your run.

689
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,793
-Call me at the first turning.
-Aye, Captain.

690
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,921
Mr. Kamarov.

691
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,840
-You may commence your run now.
-Aye, sir.

692
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,677
First leg on my mark, course 2-6-0.

693
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:40,140
Speed, 18 knots. Depth, 270 meters.

694
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:45,521
Five, four, three, two, one.

695
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,273
Mark.

696
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,817
Diving command, course 2-6-0.

697
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,362
-Course 2-6-0 , aye.
-Speed, 18 knots.

698
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,782
-Speed, 18 knots, aye.
-Stop pissing, Yuri.

699
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,492
Give me a stopwatch and a map,

700
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,495
and I'll fly the Alps
in a plane with no windows.

701
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,039
If the map is accurate enough.

702
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,897
We're in the lane
and approaching first turn.

703
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,734
Come left to course 1-9-5.

704
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,488
In 30 seconds,
decrease depth to 200 meters.

705
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,031
Maintain speed.

706
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,325
Very good, Navigator.

707
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,620
Captain, we're approaching
the first turn.

708
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,205
Twenty-five seconds to course 1-9-5.

709
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,126
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.

710
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,506
Aye, Captain.

711
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:59,011
Navigator, recompute for 26 knots.

712
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,389
Turn on my mark.

713
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:08,228
Five, four, three, two, one. Mark.

714
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,689
Diving control, come left to 1-9-5.

715
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,275
-Come left to 1-9-5.
-Up on the bow planes.

716
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:26,455
Course now 1-9-5
and maintaining speed 26 knots.

717
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,711
Mr. Kamarov?

718
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:37,633
Next leg, Captain,
come right to course 2-4-0 now at

719
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,802
eight minutes and 40 seconds.

720
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,890
Very good. Maintain course and speed.

721
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,896
Too fast, Vasily. Too fast.

722
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:56,777
Those charts are laid out precisely.
So many knots for so many seconds.

723
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:01,156
-And this thing handles like a pig.
-Watch your bearing, Mr. Slavin.

724
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,499
Fifteen seconds to turn, Captain.

725
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,251
-Should we decrease speed?
-Negative.

726
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,338
-Prepare to come right.
-Aye, sir.

727
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:20,342
Eight, seven, six, five,

728
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:25,138
four, three, two, one. Mark.

729
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,516
Fifteen degrees
down angle on the bow planes.

730
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,977
Come right 2-4-0 . Move it!

731
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,957
We're in the lane.

732
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,502
Next leg 34 minutes
to the Neptune Massif.

733
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:58,547
Course 2-4-0 .

734
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,644
What happened?

735
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,939
The cryogenic plant!
The magnets aren't cooling.

736
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:19,818
Temperature in the caterpillar
is 50 degrees above red line and rising.

737
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:24,156
-It's going to melt.
-Kill it! Shut it down!

738
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,996
-Captain?
-What happened?

739
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:35,459
-The cryogenic plant failed.
-Reactor damage?

740
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,378
There was a power spike,
but the reactor scrammed automatically.

741
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:42,424
-Was there any radiation leakage?
-l don't know yet!

742
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,927
-How long will it take to fix?
-l got to find what's wrong first.

743
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:49,347
Could be the liquid helium
or the superconductors.

744
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:55,270
Captain, we will have to stop
until we can repair the caterpillar unit.

745
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,982
Negative. We'll run
on normal propulsion.

746
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,110
Captain, we will not be silent.

747
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:06,698
Make revolutions for 20 knots
and engage the propellers.

748
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,078
Aye, Captain.

749
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:16,458
-Commence engine start-up.
-He'll get us all killed.

750
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,632
The Captain knows what he's doing.

751
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,092
Doctor.

752
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,013
Naval activities?

753
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:34,893
l have no knowledge of this.
But then, I never was a sailor.

754
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:39,064
Mr. Ambassador,
you have nearly 100 vessels operating

755
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,316
in the North Atlantic right now.

756
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,777
Your aircraft have dropped
enough sonar buoys

757
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:46,988
that a man could walk
from Greenland to Scotland

758
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:50,909
without getting his feet wet.
Shall we dispense with the bull?

759
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:56,498
You make your point
as delicately as ever, Mr. Pelt, but. . .

760
01:03:56,582 --> 01:04:00,836
And what looks like an exercise
could be a prelude to war.

761
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,546
How can we tell the difference?

762
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:06,341
Prudence demands
that we deploy ships to observe yours.

763
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,552
Your government should consider

764
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:13,431
that having your ships and ours,
your aircraft and ours,

765
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:17,811
in such proximity
is inherently dangerous.

766
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,773
Wars have begun that way,
Mr. Ambassador.

767
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:34,452
-We have lost one of our submarines.
-Lost it?

768
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,874
We fear she may be down, and. . .
This is most embarrassing, but. . .

769
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:44,754
Several of the officers
are sons of high party officials.

770
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:50,051
One is even the son
of a Central Committee Member.

771
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,012
l cannot say which.

772
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,891
You're telling me
this is a massive rescue operation?

773
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,893
That is correct.

774
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,482
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

775
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:12,157
-I'm not sure that. . .
-Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

776
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:19,331
That is very gracious of you, sir.
I'll pass your offer on.

777
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,417
But at this time,

778
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:25,462
l think we're doing everything
that can be done.

779
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,941
Captain?

780
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:54,324
Our strategy depends on your answer.
The entire fleet will know where we are.

781
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:59,454
Captain, Sonar. We've been overblown
by a multi-engine turboprop.

782
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,164
Put it on audio.

783
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,671
Short transients, close aboard.

784
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:11,549
-Water entry of small objects.
-Sonar buoys.

785
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,428
-Battle stations.
-Battle stations!

786
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,722
-Battle stations!
-Battle stations!

787
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,517
How long to Neptune Massif?

788
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:25,146
-How long?
-Four minutes, 10 seconds.

789
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,316
Should we bottom the boat?

790
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,861
No. Too late now.
We've run out of time.

791
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:35,198
Countermeasures.
Prepare to launch missiles.

792
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,741
Aye, sir.

793
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:48,837
Aircraft on computer guidance.
Request permission to launch.

794
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,673
You are authorized
to launch the weapon.

795
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:55,176
Weapon is away.

796
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:03,059
High speed screw!
Torpedo in the water!

797
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,145
Stand by.

798
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,647
Torpedo is active.

799
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,901
Torpedo has acquired.

800
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,947
-Launch countermeasures.
-Launch countermeasures. Aye, sir.

801
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,954
We're in the lane.

802
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,332
-How long till the turn at Massif?
-Two minutes, nine seconds.

803
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,878
We have no room
to maneuver in these canyons.

804
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,796
Shut up.

805
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,262
Torpedo has reached countermeasures.

806
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:42,474
-Torpedo has lost contact.
-Massif approaching.

807
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:50,523
Torpedo has reacquired.
Torpedo has reacquired and is homing.

808
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,109
Give me the count.

809
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:56,905
Turn at Massif
40 degrees starboard in 30 seconds.

810
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:00,617
-Time to torpedo impact?
-Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.

811
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,203
-Increase to flank.
-Full ahead flank.

812
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:05,914
-Full ahead flank.
-Full ahead flank, aye.

813
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,125
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.

814
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,461
35 seconds.

815
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,929
30 seconds.

816
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,182
Turn at Massif in

817
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:29,437
seven, six, five, four,

818
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:33,650
three, two, one. Mark.

819
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,944
Torpedo impact 25 seconds. . .

820
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,321
-The turn, Captain.
-Not yet.

821
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:43,284
Mark plus eight seconds.

822
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:48,123
Plus nine, plus 10 seconds,
plus 11, plus 12,

823
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:52,669
plus 13 seconds, plus 14,
plus 15 seconds.

824
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:55,630
Captain, we're out of position
by a boat length.

825
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,508
Torpedo impact now 15 seconds.

826
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,635
Sound collision.

827
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,930
-Sound collision.
-We're out of the lane!

828
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:06,224
-You're relieved.
-Borodin?

829
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,774
Right full rudder!
Reverse starboard engine!

830
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,026
Right full rudder.
All back starboard shaft.

831
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,696
All back starboard shaft!

832
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,742
Torpedo impact 12 seconds,

833
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:31,082
10, nine, eight, seven, six, five. . .

834
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:05,033
-Captain, they're really shooting at us!
-Pull yourself together!

835
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,242
Why?

836
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,536
Boy! Easy, boy.

837
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:13,041
If they were really shooting at us,
we'd be dead by now.

838
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,126
Give me some line.

839
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:36,231
l found out what happened
to the caterpillar.

840
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:39,734
The buffer circuit has been torn out.

841
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:43,905
It was only a matter of time
before an overload shut it down.

842
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,449
-What are you saying?
-Whoever did this

843
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:50,411
knew how to cripple the caterpillar
in a way not easy to find.

844
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,539
Captain, we have a saboteur on board.

845
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,255
It can't be any of the officers.

846
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:03,007
They had plenty of time
before we embarked.

847
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,051
Must be a crew member.

848
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:07,637
Go to Putin's cabin.

849
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:11,224
Check his files
for information on the crew.

850
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:14,686
We may have
to put them off before we planned.

851
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:20,316
The average Russky, son,
don't take a dump without a plan.

852
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,862
Wait a minute.

853
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,658
We don't have to get
the crew off the sub.

854
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:30,994
He would have had to do that.

855
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,372
We just have to figure out
what he's going to do.

856
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,876
How is he going to
get them off the sub?

857
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:42,922
They'd have to want to get off.

858
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:47,927
How do you get a crew
to want to get off a submarine?

859
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:53,641
How do you get them
to want to get off a nuclear sub. . .

860
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,768
l know how he's going
to evacuate the sub.

861
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:56,853
Not now, Jack.

862
01:11:56,937 --> 01:12:00,481
Yankee One star base,
say again status.

863
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,985
-Declare an emergency.
-Declare an emergency.

864
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,862
Yankee One, requesting vectors.

865
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:09,198
Vector 2-7-0 speed is buster.

866
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,992
Yankee One's icing
hydraulic pressure.

867
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,910
Say again, Yankee One.

868
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,496
Bear Foxtrot got too close to the group.

869
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:19,000
One of the F-14s crowded him,
and they bumped.

870
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,669
He's losing hydraulic fluid.

871
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:24,672
They're trying to get him
back aboard now.

872
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,382
Busy morning.

873
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:32,805
Russian attack subs are now stationed
off every east coast port.

874
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,766
We're up here.

875
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,019
The New Jersey is moving up the coast

876
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:41,147
while the Russians,
aside from over 100 Bear Foxtrots,

877
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:44,859
have a row of subs
and several surface groups.

878
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:48,154
-That's a lot of firepower.
-For a rescue team, yes.

879
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,365
There's something else strange.

880
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,159
They're using sonar
as if they're looking for something,

881
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:55,745
-but nobody's listening.
-What do you mean?

882
01:12:55,829 --> 01:13:01,084
At their speed they could run over
my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

883
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,338
They're not searching for Ramius.
They're driving him.

884
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,548
Driving him where?

885
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,513
The hounds to the hunters.

886
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:16,766
Your sub captain's
going to make it to America.

887
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,645
He's going to die within sight of it.

888
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,107
His wing man
kept requesting permission to fire.

889
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,900
Somebody messes up,

890
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:28,778
we'll be in the biggest naval battle
since the Jutland.

891
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:30,863
Jesus!

892
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,950
Water's too cold to oject.

893
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:38,621
-Air boss will try to bring him aboard.
-Sir, what's this sub off by herself?

894
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:40,498
Bart Mancuso's boat.

895
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,918
He's going to the bottom
of Red Route One.

896
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:48,005
He's had intermittent contact
with a magma displacement.

897
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,258
-He's got this. . .
-Magma displacement?

898
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:54,387
-ls that like a seismic anomaly?
-l suppose so. Why?

899
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,557
ls there a way you could get me
onboard the Dallas?

900
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:58,766
What for?

901
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,978
l think Mancuso's
found the Red October.

902
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:05,398
He hasn't found anything, Jack.
He's just waiting.

903
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,525
Sir, this silent propulsion system

904
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,569
could easily be mistaken
for something. . .

905
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:13,781
The only way to get you onto Dallas
is to fly you out to a chopper.

906
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,408
The only way to get you that far north

907
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:18,202
is to use a chopper turned
into a flying gas can.

908
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,540
Admiral, Yankee One is on final.
Rescue personnel are in place.

909
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:27,211
Pick up your left wing.
You're drifting left. Power, power!

910
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,505
Wave off, wave off!

911
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,799
Eject, eject, eject!

912
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,354
Fire, fire! Fire on the flight deck!

913
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:50,693
This business will get out of control,
and we'll be lucky to live through it.

914
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:56,866
Fire on the flight deck.
All hands lend assistance.

915
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,250
The bird's loaded down
with enough fuel to get you there,

916
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,044
but Dallas may not be there.

917
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:11,881
We're trying to reach her.
If she's gone deep, it's dodgy.

918
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,258
If you have to ditch. . .

919
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:23,226
If you have to ditch,

920
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,770
don't think about anything
but the survival gear.

921
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:29,440
At this water's temperature,
you'll have about four minutes.

922
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,609
I'll try to remember that.

923
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:37,698
Next time, Jack,
write a goddamn memo.

924
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:05,142
Diving officer,
make your depth 6-5-0 feet.

925
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,894
Make my depth 6-5-0 feet.

926
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:10,064
Sonar, Conn preceding
below the thermal layer.

927
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,234
-The captain's sacked out?
-Yeah.

928
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:17,238
-Auxiliaries proceed 5,000 pounds.
-What about him?

929
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,282
He won't leave.

930
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:24,120
Conn. Sonar, hold.
No contacts on bearing 2-9-5.

931
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:33,004
You know, I seen me a mermaid once.

932
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:37,425
I've even seen me
a shark eat a octopus,

933
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:41,554
but I ain't never seen
no phantom Russian submarine.

934
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,136
We're emerging
from the route, Captain.

935
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,472
I've ordered
a routine clearing of the baffles.

936
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:28,267
We'll be making
the first turn in a few minutes.

937
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:32,521
The caterpillar is operational
and appears to be running normally.

938
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:39,236
The crew know about the saboteur.
They are afraid.

939
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:44,533
That could
be useful when the time comes.

940
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:52,333
You know, we could make
the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

941
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,504
Half of them
would freeze before they were rescued.

942
01:17:56,588 --> 01:18:00,925
No, it's Massachusetts or Maine. . .
In 48 hours.

943
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:04,345
Two days.

944
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:14,230
Do you think
they will let me live in Montana?

945
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:27,034
l would think
they'll let you live wherever you want.

946
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:32,707
Good. Then I will live in Montana,

947
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:37,378
and I will marry a round
American woman and raise rabbits,

948
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:43,259
and she will cook them for me,
and I will have a pickup truck.

949
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,512
Or a. . .

950
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:52,309
Possibly even a recreational vehicle

951
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,729
and drive from state to state.

952
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:59,734
-Do they let you do that?
-Yes.

953
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:04,572
-No papers?
-No papers. State to state.

954
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:07,032
All right. Commence your turn.

955
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:16,459
Then in winter I will live in Arizona.

956
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,922
-Actually, I think I will need two wives.
-At least.

957
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:36,604
-Possible aspect change on target.
-Sonar, Conn. Aye.

958
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:39,857
Concur possible
target zig based on bearing rate.

959
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,613
-Conn! Sonar! Crazy Ivan!
-All stop! Quick quiet!

960
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:48,407
-All stop, aye.
-Engine's all stopped.

961
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,957
What's going on, Jonesy?

962
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,168
Russian captains
sometimes turn suddenly

963
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:03,839
to see if anyone's behind them.
We call it Crazy Ivan.

964
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,425
The only thing you can do is go dead,

965
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:10,471
shut everything down,
and make like a hole in the water.

966
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:12,473
So what's the catch?

967
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:16,727
Catch is a boat this big
doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

968
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:21,524
If we're too close,
we'll drift right into the back of him.

969
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:28,364
What about you?
What do you look forward to?

970
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:38,541
l. . .

971
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:43,212
l have no such appetites.

972
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:46,882
Now, let's see if he can hear us.

973
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:54,515
There must be something.

974
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,358
What is it?

975
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:11,657
l miss the peace of fishing

976
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,452
like when I was a boy.

977
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:20,916
Forty years I have been at sea.

978
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,962
A war at sea.

979
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:28,924
A war with no battles.

980
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,761
No monuments.

981
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:36,348
Only casualties.

982
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:44,106
l widowed her the day I married her.

983
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,821
My wife died
while I was at sea, you know.

984
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:12,134
Post guards in the engineering spaces.

985
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:16,889
If he can get to the caterpillar,
he can get to somewhere more vital.

986
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:23,062
-Where is he, Jonesy?
-Conn, Sonar.

987
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:26,065
Target is now coming out
of our starboard baffles.

988
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:29,652
My read is that
he is returning to base course.

989
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,280
Concur. He's returning to course 2-1-0 .

990
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,783
He went right around us.

991
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:41,497
We'll give him another 30 seconds,
then secure from silent running.

992
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:43,624
Captain?

993
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,669
Here's what we got on the ELF .

994
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:50,297
-Thanks.
-Aye, sir.

995
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:00,224
What is it?

996
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,812
You're not going to believe this.

997
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,493
Commander, we are
approaching no return.

998
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:21,453
Dallas apparently
hasn't gotten the message.

999
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,790
-We have to turn back for the carrier.
-Give it a couple more minutes.

1000
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:27,167
Negative. Fuel status
says we turn around now.

1001
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:30,337
Fuel status?
You got a reserve, don't you?

1002
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,589
I've got a 10-minute reserve,

1003
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,175
but I'm not allowed
to invade that except during war.

1004
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,846
If you don't get me on that submarine,
you might have it.

1005
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:43,183
You got 10 minutes worth of fuel.
We stay here 10 more minutes.

1006
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:53,902
Mount up! I got a submarine
at around 3:00. About 2 miles.

1007
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:56,947
Okay, Tony, hook him up.

1008
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:00,534
I'll be lowering you down
to the submarine now.

1009
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:05,372
Give me eight minutes.
Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

1010
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,500
-Very well. Surface the ship.
-Surface the ship. Aye, sir.

1011
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:11,253
Whoever this guy is,
he's in for one hell of a ride.

1012
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:14,089
Okay, Commander,
go ahead and sit down.

1013
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:19,928
-You ever do this before?
-Once. On a calm day off Hawaii.

1014
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:23,766
The pilot will have
a difficult time keeping steady.

1015
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:27,061
Don't take chances getting grounded.
Keep that rod in front of you.

1016
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,228
In air like this,

1017
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,897
the rotors will
put out enough static electricity

1018
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:31,190
to light up Chicago.

1019
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:32,524
That's why I joined the Navy.

1020
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:36,403
A diver's in the escape trunk
in case this guy goes in the drink.

1021
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:40,824
Someone must have a burr up his ass
to go for a stunt like this.

1022
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:02,471
All right. Ready! Ready!
Get your hook up!

1023
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,768
Commander,
if I got to bring you back up,

1024
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:10,687
I'm going to shake the wire.
I'll give you a thumbs up, like this.

1025
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:15,442
Remember to cross your arms.
Got it? Okay. Out you go.

1026
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,903
Passenger's out the door.

1027
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:28,205
Passenger's halfway down,
drifting forward. Start forward.

1028
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,546
All right, Tommy.
Get the hook on his cable.

1029
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:40,801
On his cable. Now, watch it.
Don't touch him. Okay, here he comes.

1030
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:46,974
No!

1031
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,977
It would be easier
without that bloody crosswind.

1032
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:52,312
Where is he? I can't see him.

1033
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,399
Don't touch him!

1034
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:59,069
Jack! Jack! Jack!

1035
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:05,075
-This is never going to work.
-Okay, reel him back in.

1036
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:15,502
Tony, what's going on back. . .

1037
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,675
What happened? Dallas,
have you got a swimmer standing?

1038
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:26,471
Emergency stop! Man overboard!
Port side! Send out the diver!

1039
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:29,183
Very well, Dallas. We are history.

1040
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:41,653
Get the doc down here!
I'll be in the escape trunk.

1041
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:48,619
Down ladder!
Down ladder! Make a hole!

1042
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:54,833
Watch his head. Watch his head.

1043
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:10,349
How do you do, Captain?
It's a pleasure to be aboard.

1044
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:14,311
l have to talk to the President.

1045
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:19,441
Of course.
May I inquire as to the subject?

1046
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:25,072
It seems that the initial reports
that one of our submarines was missing

1047
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:27,866
were not completely accurate.

1048
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:32,079
The submarine in question

1049
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:36,083
is commanded
by Captain Marko Ramius.

1050
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:40,587
Apparently, he has suffered
a kind of mental or nervous breakdown.

1051
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,675
Just before he sailed,

1052
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:48,470
he posted a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin

1053
01:27:48,554 --> 01:27:52,015
in which he announced his intention to. . .

1054
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:57,104
To fire his missiles
on the United States.

1055
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,357
Why didn't you tell me this
the last time we met?

1056
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,567
In my position
I'm sometimes compromised

1057
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:06,238
by the fact Moscow
doesn't always tell me everything.

1058
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:09,616
So one of your
submarine captains has gone insane?

1059
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:13,287
-What do you want from us?
-You offered your assistance.

1060
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:14,955
That was a rescue mission.

1061
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:19,167
Now you want us to help you
hunt him down and kill him.

1062
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:24,589
l have been instructed
to ask your president for precisely that.

1063
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:28,552
Find him? We already found him.
We had to break off to pick you up.

1064
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:31,430
-Captain, excuse me. Coffee?
-Thank you.

1065
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:33,682
-Cigarette?
-Don't smoke.

1066
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,977
Assuming we can find him,

1067
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:39,062
just what exactly
am I supposed to do about it?

1068
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,480
Captain, radio.

1069
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:43,483
We're receiving flash traffic
on the VLF emergency circuit.

1070
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:46,403
Very well. Bring it down.

1071
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,865
Mr. Ryan?

1072
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:56,496
-Chief, excuse us for a second.
-Leonard, come on out of there.

1073
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,173
The sub we're after
is called the Red October.

1074
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,550
She's under the command
of a man named Ramius.

1075
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:09,926
Now, there's the possibility

1076
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:14,264
that he and a good portion of his crew
are attempting to defect.

1077
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:18,602
Defect?

1078
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,563
Excuse me.

1079
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:40,832
You say the boat's called
the Red October?

1080
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,001
-That's right.
-Skipper's Ramius?

1081
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:44,836
Right.

1082
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:49,007
It seems the circumstances
have changed somewhat, Mr. Ryan.

1083
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:57,516
Get this man some dry clothes.

1084
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,519
-I'll be in the conn.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1085
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:02,437
"National Command Authority

1086

Chief of the watch, rig for red.

Time Quartermasters and Navigator
on the deck in the conn.

1097
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:54,114
What's going on?

1098
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:57,909
-Battle stations are manned and ready.
-Very well.

1099
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,704
-Captain, I have to talk to you.
-Not now.

1100
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:04,499
Make your depth 1,200 feet,
20 degrees down angle.

1101
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:08,837
Diving Officer, make your depth
1,200 feet, 20 degree down.

1102
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:13,800
Full dive on fair water planes.
Full dive on stern planes.

1103
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,553
Twenty degree down.

1104
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:21,892
Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

1105
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:24,895
Five hundred.

1106
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:28,565
Six hundred.

1107
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:32,319
Seven hundred.

1108
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,408
Did you get a good fix?

1109
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:39,868
-Yes, Captain.
-Very well.

1110
01:31:39,952 --> 01:31:42,245
At ordered depth, 1,200 feet.

1111
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:52,172
-Sonar, Conn. You got him, yet, Jonesy?
-Very faint, sir. Hold on.

1112
01:31:53,799 --> 01:31:57,052
Yes, sir. Contact Typhoon 7
on bearing 2-5-0.

1113
01:31:57,136 --> 01:31:58,512
Right where he's supposed to be.

1114
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:02,724
-Any sign he's alerted to our presence?
-No. Operating as before.

1115
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:07,229
Come left 2-6-5.
Bring us up behind him quietly, Tommy.

1116
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,396
Aye, aye, Captain.

1117
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:11,525
Diving Officer,
make your depth 500 feet.

1118
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:24,079
Captain, please listen to me.
Two minutes, that's all.

1119
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:29,626
-Plot, time to intercept his track.
-Four minutes, Captain.

1120
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:33,296
Very well, Mr. Ryan. Two minutes.

1121
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,389
It makes perfect sense.

1122
01:32:42,473 --> 01:32:45,642
Look at the situation,
Ramius intends to defect.

1123
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:48,728
The Russians know this,
which is why they've tried to sink him,

1124
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:50,939
but they haven't been able to. . .

1125
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:52,732
-l have a firing solution.
-Very well.

1126
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,901
Captain, you have to listen to me.

1127
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:57,904
The Russians will stop at nothing
to prevent Ramius from defecting.

1128
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,115
They've invented
this story that he's crazy

1129
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:04,035
because they need us to sink him
before he can contact us.

1130
01:33:06,038 --> 01:33:10,458
Weapons Control, I want full safeties.
l don't want this fish coming back.

1131
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:13,837
-Full safety.
-Captain, I know this man.

1132
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:19,384
-Has he made any Crazy Ivans?
-What difference does that make?

1133
01:33:19,468 --> 01:33:21,886
-The next one will be to starboard.
-Why? Because his last was to port?

1134
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:25,890
Because he goes to starboard
in the bottom half of the hour.

1135
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,689
Flood tubes one and two.
Warm up the weapons.

1136
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:35,984
Find a way to establish contact
without violating orders.

1137
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:37,819
He wants to defect!

1138
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:42,115
Mr. Thompson, call Chief Watson
to the conn with his sidearm.

1139
01:33:46,495 --> 01:33:49,414
Conn, Sonar.
Signal to noise ratio's dropping.

1140
01:33:49,498 --> 01:33:51,124
Possible aspect change in target.

1141
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:54,294
Possible target zig
based on bearing rate.

1142
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:58,048
Conn, Sonar. Crazy Ivan!

1143
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,385
Captain.

1144
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,222
Captain, he's turning.

1145
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:12,395
-Which way is he turning?
-To the starboard, sir.

1146
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:16,858
Give the man a chance.

1147
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:20,236
All back full.

1148
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,781
-Captain, say again.
-l said all back full!

1149
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:25,700
Back full. Aye, sir. Engines back full.

1150
01:34:29,872 --> 01:34:31,998
We're cavitating. He can hear us!

1151
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:36,461
-Conn, aye. All stop.
-All stop, aye.

1152
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:41,966
All right. We just unzipped our fly.
Mr. Thompson, open the outer doors.

1153
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:44,177
Firing point procedures.

1154
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:46,221
Now, if that bastard
so much as twitches,

1155
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:48,515
I'm going to blow him right to Mars.

1156
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:50,892
All stop rudder amidships.

1157
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:55,271
What's going on?
Can you identify the contact?

1158
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:58,775
American Los Angeles
class attack submarine bearing 0-1-5. . .

1159
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:00,985
Captain, sharp metallic transients.

1160
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,988
He may be trying to open
his torpedo tube doors.

1161
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:05,740
Outer doors are open
on tubes one and two.

1162
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:08,284
-We're ready to shoot.
-Very well.

1163
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,746
My orders are specific, Mr. Ryan.

1164
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:15,208
He's opened his outer doors.
He's preparing to fire.

1165
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:17,377
Flood tubes three and four
and plot a solution.

1166
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:21,256
Captain, flood tubes three and four.
Plot solution.

1167
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:26,052
Shall I open the torpedo tube door, sir?

1168
01:35:27,513 --> 01:35:31,141
-Captain, shall I open outer doors?
-No.

1169
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:36,187
Lock the firing solution
into the computer.

1170
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:39,232
Do not open the doors.

1171
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:49,159
Aye, Captain.

1172
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:52,078
Lock solution into computer.

1173
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:55,248
Conn, Sonar.
Target's flooded his tubes.

1174
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:57,542
Has he opened his outer doors?

1175
01:35:57,626 --> 01:36:01,588
Negative, Captain.
He's just sitting there. Hold on.

1176
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:07,010
-Hull popping. Target's coming shallow.
-What's that mean?

1177
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,766
That means he's a very cool customer,
your Russian.

1178
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,267
He knows we're here
and ready to shoot.

1179
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:16,186
He's not provoking us.

1180
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,605
He's heading to periscope depth
to see what's on the surface.

1181
01:36:18,689 --> 01:36:22,066
-What's his course?
-His course is 2-7-0, due west.

1182
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:26,321
-Bring us alongside him.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

1183
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:29,032
Sonar, Conn. Report all contacts.

1184
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:34,120
Conn, Sonar. My only contact
is Typhoon  7 , bearing 1-9-5.

1185
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:39,167
-Very well. Fire control, range to target?
-Range is 300 yards.

1186
01:36:40,836 --> 01:36:43,129
Make your depth 65 feet.

1187
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:46,299
Diving Officer, make your depth 65 feet.

1188
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:51,262
He wants to go up and take a peek.
We'll play along.

1189
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:10,073
-Going to 45.
-Going to 45.

1190
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:12,826
-Weapons status?
-Weapons are on.

1191
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:16,871
Tubes three and four are flooded.
Outer doors are closed.

1192
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:20,375
-Twenty-five meters.
-Depth 25 meters.

1193
01:37:20,459 --> 01:37:23,419
Mark this bearing.

1194
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:34,389
You wanted to talk to him, Mr. Ryan.
There he is.

1195
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:36,474
What do you want to say?

1196
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:39,769
-ls he the only one looking?
-Probably.

1197
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,981
We'll have to chance that.

1198
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:47,986
"U .S. told
you intend missile launch." Break.

1199
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:53,449
"Do not approach U .S. coast
or you will be attacked." Break.

1200
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:58,872
"If intention is other
will you discuss option?" Break.

1201
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,042
Can he acknowledge with a single ping?

1202
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:06,588
Yeah, he can. The question is, will he?

1203
01:38:14,346 --> 01:38:19,309
Verify our range to target.
One ping only.

1204
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:23,521
Aye, Captain.

1205
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:33,364
I'll be damned. Now what?

1206
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:36,910
All right.

1207
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,662
"If defection

1208
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:47,337
"you plot course toward. . ." The chart.

1209
01:38:48,505 --> 01:38:52,800
l need a chart. No. No.

1210
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:57,764
Okay. Where the hell are we?
Someplace deep. Someplace deep.

1211
01:38:57,848 --> 01:39:00,767
Okay. Okay!

1212
01:39:01,727 --> 01:39:04,187
Send them this!

1213
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:10,193
-You out of your mind?
-Just send it.

1214
01:39:14,531 --> 01:39:16,366
Tell me one thing.

1215
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:19,619
How did you know
he was going to go to starboard?

1216
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:21,204
l didn't.

1217
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:26,209
l had a 50/50 chance.
l needed a break. Sorry.

1218
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:30,755
That's all right, Mr. Ryan.
My Morse is so rusty

1219
01:39:30,839 --> 01:39:34,384
l may be sending dimensions
on playmate of the month.

1220
01:39:53,904 --> 01:39:56,572
Reverify our range to target.

1221
01:39:57,908 --> 01:40:01,786
-One ping only.
-Captain, I just. . .

1222
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:05,957
Give me a ping, Vasily.
One ping only, please.

1223
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:11,212
Aye, Captain.

1224
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:17,885
What the hell is this about?

1225
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:24,475
The Russians want us to sink her.
We might have to do that.

1226
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:36,487
We must give
this American a wide berth.

1227
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:40,033
Let us turn south.

1228
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:51,627
Mr. Kamarov.

1229
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:57,383
-Plot a new course due south.
-Yes, sir.

1230
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,762
New course 1-8-0.

1231
01:41:33,295 --> 01:41:36,339
It's the reactor! Shut down the reactor!

1232
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:43,137
-Seal the ventilation system!
-The ventilation controls have failed!

1233
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:46,516
Everybody out. Clear the compartment!

1234
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:49,102
Out!

1235
01:41:58,153 --> 01:42:00,113
Ventilation system, shut it down now.

1236
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:03,074
They don't respond.
The controls don't respond!

1237
01:42:03,158 --> 01:42:06,577
Bypass it. Seal it manually!
Move! Shut it off.

1238
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:09,914
Melekhin, say again.

1239
01:42:17,714 --> 01:42:19,882
Suffered a leak in
the primary coolant tube,

1240
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:21,425
so shut down the reactor,

1241
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:24,512
but the ventilation
circuits have been disabled.

1242
01:42:24,596 --> 01:42:26,514
The coolant appears
highly contaminated.

1243
01:42:26,598 --> 01:42:28,975
l knew there was damage
when the caterpillar went down.

1244
01:42:29,059 --> 01:42:31,811
Radiation alarms activating
in all compartments.

1245
01:42:31,895 --> 01:42:35,481
Engineering is heavily contaminated,
and radiation's moving forward.

1246
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:38,151
Get to periscope depth.
Ventilate with outside air.

1247
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:39,986
Aye, Captain. Periscope depth!

1248
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:42,530
-Prepare to ventilate!
-Ventilating won't do anything.

1249
01:42:42,614 --> 01:42:45,658
-We've got to get them off.
-What's the battery condition?

1250
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:49,829
-Four hours. Six, if we're cautious.
-Engage battery system.

1251
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:52,165
We've got a level one radiation leak.

1252
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:54,041
Every surface
of this ship's contaminated.

1253
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:57,044
We've got to get the men off.

1254
01:42:57,713 --> 01:43:00,840
Sir, we have been sabotaged!

1255
01:43:00,924 --> 01:43:04,427
-Who said anything about sabotage?
-Captain!

1256
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:07,847
Sir, I'm afraid the doctor is right.

1257
01:43:12,978 --> 01:43:14,395
Very well.

1258
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:17,940
Surface. We'll evacuate
the men to the deck.

1259
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:20,693
Aye, Captain. Surface the ship!

1260
01:43:20,777 --> 01:43:23,196
Prepare to muster
all personnel to escape hatches.

1261
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,490
Break out the rafts.
Lash them to the deck.

1262
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:30,244
We'll use them as shelters
until the fleet arrives.

1263
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,956
Make sure the count
is accurate, Doctor.

1264
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:18,459
-We must get the entire crew out.
-Yes, sir.

1265
01:44:18,543 --> 01:44:22,797
Master-at-arms reports rafts secure
and evacuation proceeding.

1266
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:24,382
Very good.

1267
01:44:30,847 --> 01:44:33,099
We'll rotate through the conn.

1268
01:44:33,183 --> 01:44:36,852
No officer will spend
more than 20 minutes below deck.

1269
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:38,854
-Will that be satisfactory?
-Completely, Captain.

1270
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:44,735
Surface contact, 2-7-0 ,
six miles and closing fast.

1271
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:48,948
-It's a warship.
-What? Here? Can you identify it?

1272
01:44:49,032 --> 01:44:53,953
It's a frigate, U .S. , probably,
Perry class. He's signaling.

1273
01:44:55,163 --> 01:45:00,668
"Red October. Red October.
Halt and stay where you are.

1274
01:45:00,752 --> 01:45:05,047
"Do not attempt to submerge,
or you will be fired upon."

1275
01:45:07,259 --> 01:45:11,345
Captain, I think he means to board us.

1276
01:45:16,226 --> 01:45:18,352
You will go with the crew.

1277
01:45:18,437 --> 01:45:21,814
The officers and l
will submerge beneath you

1278
01:45:21,898 --> 01:45:24,400
and scuttle the ship.

1279
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:28,279
You'll receive
the Order of Lenin for this, Captain.

1280
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:42,001
We're going to cast off.
The captain's going to scuttle the ship.

1281
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:49,091
He's going down, sir.

1282
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:52,470
Put a shot across his bow.
Come right at 1-8-0 .

1283
01:46:23,835 --> 01:46:27,296
Seahawk One, this is bravo command.

1284
01:46:44,314 --> 01:46:45,981
She's ready.

1285
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:49,860
Seahawk One,
release on my command.

1286
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:53,280
Drop now, now, now.

1287
01:47:01,331 --> 01:47:04,375
Range to target, 900 yards.

1288
01:47:05,168 --> 01:47:07,044
Eight hundred yards.

1289
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:10,756
Seven hundred yards.

1290
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:14,427
Six hundred yards.

1291
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,641
Five hundred yards.

1292
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,937
Four hundred yards.

1293
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:28,858
Three hundred yards.

1294
01:47:31,278 --> 01:47:33,696
The torpedo is detonated.

1295
01:47:34,364 --> 01:47:39,243
Now, understand, Commander,
that torpedo did not self-destruct.

1296
01:47:39,327 --> 01:47:43,622
You heard it hit the hull.
And I was never here.

1297
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:47,626
Contact Dallas. Give them the go.

1298
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:50,212
Advise Dallas. Get the DSRV moving.

1299
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:51,755
Dallas, this is Reuben James.

1300
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:00,014
There are about two million things

1301
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:02,641
that can still go wrong with this stunt.

1302
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:07,897
Central Intelligence Agency.
Now, there's a contradiction in terms.

1303
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:12,651
How's the coffee, Ryan?

1304
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:15,654
Dallas, this is the Mystic.
Request clearance for launch.

1305
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:19,575
Mystic, Dallas.
You're cleared for launch.

1306
01:48:19,951 --> 01:48:21,744
Hatch is secured.

1307
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:24,330
Life support, normal.
Prelaunch checks complete.

1308
01:48:24,414 --> 01:48:26,290
-We're ready to launch.
-Aye.

1309
01:48:26,374 --> 01:48:28,459
-Flood the skirt.
-Flood the skirt. Aye.

1310
01:48:28,543 --> 01:48:33,005
Skirt's filled and equalized.
Soft seal. Ready to lift off.

1311
01:48:33,089 --> 01:48:35,758
Okay. Let's do it.

1312
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:38,844
We're off.

1313
01:48:39,262 --> 01:48:41,555
Thrusting port.

1314
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:05,996
-Six hundred yards and closing.
-Steer right to course 0-7-5.

1315
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:08,123
Four hundred.

1316
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:14,713
Two hundred yards.

1317
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:18,342
One hundred yards.

1318
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:27,309
Hit the lights.

1319
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:44,785
Jesus, that's a big sucker.

1320
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:03,637
-Okay, we're in position.
-You can open the hatch.

1321
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:06,640
Hold it a second. Jonesy.

1322
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:10,936
Mr. Ryan.

1323
01:50:13,898 --> 01:50:16,108
He's defecting.

1324
01:50:16,568 --> 01:50:21,447
-And he can't change his mind?
-He's not going to change his mind.

1325
01:50:21,531 --> 01:50:24,658
You willing to bet your life on that?

1326
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:47,222
-Sir, could you hand me that hammer?
-Yeah.

1327
01:51:09,913 --> 01:51:11,580
Americans.

1328
01:52:55,477 --> 01:52:57,019
He's turning green.

1329
01:53:19,876 --> 01:53:22,002
What's so funny?

1330
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:27,299
The captain seems to think
you're some sort of cowboy.

1331
01:53:28,676 --> 01:53:30,052
You speak Russian.

1332
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,722
A little.

1333
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:38,852
It's wise to study
the ways of one's adversary.

1334
01:53:38,937 --> 01:53:40,729
Don't you think?

1335
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,524
It is.

1336
01:53:45,735 --> 01:53:46,819
l doubt you'd remember,

1337
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:50,781
but we met once
at the Consulate in Leningrad.

1338
01:53:50,865 --> 01:53:53,742
Along with your wife. I'm very sorry.

1339
01:53:56,746 --> 01:54:00,541
What gives you the right
to fire on my ship?

1340
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:05,295
-Your signal said nothing of a torpedo.
-Ryan.

1341
01:54:07,173 --> 01:54:10,592
It was necessary
to maintain the illusion for your crew.

1342
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:14,221
-My crew are being rescued, yes?
-As we speak.

1343
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:21,979
-You sent the signal.
-That's correct, sir.

1344
01:54:24,274 --> 01:54:28,986
Then how did you know
our reactor accident was false?

1345
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:33,240
That was a guess,
but it seemed logical.

1346
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:41,999
Very well.

1347
01:54:45,587 --> 01:54:50,716
l present you the ballistic
missile submarine Red October.

1348
01:54:55,471 --> 01:55:01,518
My officers and I request asylum
in the United States of America.

1349
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:09,359
It's a pleasure, sir.
Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1350
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:14,656
Torpedo. The Americans
are shooting at us again.

1351
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:18,702
The pitch is too high.
The torpedo's Russian.

1352
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,413
What do you mean another torpedo?
Where the hell did it come from?

1353
01:55:21,497 --> 01:55:25,751
Conn, Sonar. New contact. Sierra 4-1.
Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1354
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:31,089
Why don't I have a detonation?

1355
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:33,050
The weapon enabled
on the far side of the target.

1356
01:55:33,134 --> 01:55:35,510
It passed Red October before arming.

1357
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:39,723
Fire again with the right settings
and reload both tubes.

1358
01:55:39,807 --> 01:55:41,141
Get me power.

1359
01:55:41,225 --> 01:55:45,145
-Get that damn thing off my boat.
-It's off.

1360
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:47,773
l think somebody shot a torpedo at us.

1361
01:55:47,857 --> 01:55:50,984
-No shit, buckwheat. Get out of here.
-Where am l. . .

1362
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:01,119
The Captain is fighting them.

1363
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:04,957
The Captain is fighting the Americans.
The Captain is fighting the Americans.

1364
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,669
Borodin, fire control.

1365
01:56:09,545 --> 01:56:14,257
-Ryan. Sit here.
-I'm not a naval officer. I'm with the CIA.

1366
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:16,218
-CIA?
-I'm not an agent.

1367
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:18,971
l just write books for the CIA.

1368
01:56:19,722 --> 01:56:22,391
Whatever. Sit down.
And do exactly what I tell you.

1369
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:23,850
DSRVs away.

1370
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:26,603
There's a Russian Alfa
8,000 yards to starboard.

1371
01:56:26,688 --> 01:56:28,730
l think it's the Konovaicv.

1372
01:56:28,815 --> 01:56:31,733
-Increase the flank.
-Increase the flank.

1373
01:56:32,235 --> 01:56:36,780
-How?
-That knob. Turn right full.

1374
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:40,617
All ahead flank. Right full rudder.

1375
01:56:40,702 --> 01:56:43,578
-He's shooting again, sir.
-Go to battle stations.

1376
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:47,499
-Battle stations.
-Chief of Watch, man battle stations.

1377
01:56:50,628 --> 01:56:54,047
Torpedo in the water. Bearing 3-1-5.

1378
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:58,385
-Make range 7 ,000 yards.
-Steer right 3-1-5.

1379
01:56:58,469 --> 01:57:02,180
-That's heading into the torpedo.
-Steady, bearing still 3-1-5.

1380
01:57:02,265 --> 01:57:05,684
-Estimated range, 6,000 yards.
-Still 3-1-5.

1381
01:57:05,768 --> 01:57:08,353
Steer right till this reads 3-1-5.

1382
01:57:08,438 --> 01:57:12,441
No, that's wrong.
Ryan, don't turn that god damn wheel.

1383
01:57:13,276 --> 01:57:15,610
3-1-5.

1384
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:29,416
You're heading straight
into that torpedo.

1385
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:32,377
-Yes.
-Doing what?

1386
01:57:32,462 --> 01:57:35,047
-He's turned into the torpedo's path.
-What?

1387
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:38,341
Red October's turned directly
into the torpedo's path, sir.

1388
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:40,177
Mother of God.

1389
01:57:40,553 --> 01:57:43,930
Torpedo steady, bearing 3-1-5.
Range, 5,000 yards.

1390
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:46,016
Melekhin, more speed.

1391
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:49,061
Negative.
We are already running 110%.

1392
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:50,896
Then get me 115%.

1393
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:55,317
Estimate range 3,000 yards.
Closing awfully fast.

1394
01:58:01,532 --> 01:58:04,576
He's heading right into the torpedo.
What's he trying to do, kill himself?

1395
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,703
We have a firing solution
on the Russian Alfa.

1396
01:58:06,788 --> 01:58:08,789
-Can we shoot back?
-They didn't shoot at us.

1397
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:12,667
l can't attack a Soviet submarine
without authorization.

1398
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:20,217
Torpedo bearing, steady at 3-1-5.
Best range, 900 yards.

1399
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:24,971
Torpedo impact, 20 seconds.

1400
01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:28,350
What books?

1401
01:58:29,477 --> 01:58:32,979
-Pardon me?
-What books did you write?

1402
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:37,526
l wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey
called The Fighting Sailor,

1403
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:40,278
about naval combat tactics.

1404
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:41,947
l know this book.

1405
01:58:42,031 --> 01:58:43,115
Torpedo impact. . .

1406
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:44,950
Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan.

1407
01:58:45,034 --> 01:58:48,203
-Ten seconds.
-Halsey acted stupidly.

1408
01:58:48,287 --> 01:58:53,625
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1409
01:58:53,709 --> 01:58:58,547
five, four, three, two. . .

1410
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:01,633
Torpedo impact. . .

1411
01:59:01,717 --> 01:59:03,552
Now.

1412
01:59:12,103 --> 01:59:15,021
I'll be damned.

1413
01:59:15,982 --> 01:59:19,442
-What happened?
-Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

1414
01:59:20,736 --> 01:59:22,154
By turning into the torpedo,

1415
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:26,032
the captain closed the distance
before it could arm itself.

1416
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:29,828
-So that's it?
-Not quite.

1417
01:59:29,912 --> 01:59:31,663
Right now, Captain Tupolev

1418
01:59:31,747 --> 01:59:34,541
is removing the safety features
on all his weapons.

1419
01:59:34,625 --> 01:59:37,544
He won't make the same mistake twice.

1420
01:59:38,087 --> 01:59:43,842
-Vasily, have you plotted a solution yet?
-Aye, Captain. It's a little rough, but l. . .

1421
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:52,559
-Gunfire?
-That's what it sounded like, sir.

1422
01:59:52,643 --> 01:59:55,520
-Won't change his mind?
-It's one of the crew.

1423
01:59:55,605 --> 01:59:59,107
Whoever he is,
he's having second thoughts.

1424
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:19,753
l would like to have seen Montana.

1425
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:35,894
Captain, he stumbled forward
into the missile bay.

1426
02:00:35,978 --> 02:00:39,356
There's a silo hatch warning
port side, number 20.

1427
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:43,235
-He can't launch a missile.
-No, but he can blow one up.

1428
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:48,782
-Captain, take the conn.
-Fire control's blasted to hell.

1429
02:00:48,866 --> 02:00:52,410
-Then get behind him and stay there.
-Captain, wait.

1430
02:00:56,165 --> 02:00:59,084
You may need this, sir.

1431
02:01:01,837 --> 02:01:03,505
Thank you.

1432
02:01:07,134 --> 02:01:09,552
Don't just stand there, Ryan.
Go with him!

1433
02:01:09,637 --> 02:01:11,429
-You, you speak English?
-Yes, sir.

1434
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:12,847
Get your butt over here.

1435
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:15,225
Captain, torpedo broke off on impact.

1436
02:01:15,309 --> 02:01:18,311
Set the safety ranges for zero.

1437
02:01:18,396 --> 02:01:20,105
l cannot go any faster.

1438
02:01:20,189 --> 02:01:23,900
We must get him
before he gets to the ignition circuits.

1439
02:01:31,867 --> 02:01:34,953
What happens
if he gets to that ignition circuitry?

1440
02:01:35,037 --> 02:01:37,914
He can incinerate the ship.

1441
02:01:45,673 --> 02:01:48,383
ls that door the only way out of here?

1442
02:01:49,719 --> 02:01:50,885
Yes.

1443
02:01:51,512 --> 02:01:53,596
Don't let him get past you.

1444
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:58,268
Ryan. Be careful what you shoot at.

1445
02:01:59,645 --> 02:02:04,899
Most things in here
don't react too well to bullets.

1446
02:02:06,485 --> 02:02:08,111
Right.

1447
02:02:26,547 --> 02:02:29,924
l have to be careful what I shoot at?

1448
02:02:37,558 --> 02:02:39,100
Safety ranges set to zero.

1449
02:02:39,185 --> 02:02:41,227
Sonar, give me
the bearing for Red October.

1450
02:02:41,312 --> 02:02:43,146
She's positioned behind us.

1451
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:46,566
Right full rudder!
I'll shake the man loose.

1452
02:02:53,783 --> 02:02:56,201
-He's going deep.
-Thirty degree down angle!

1453
02:02:56,285 --> 02:02:58,870
All the countermeasures
were over there, right?

1454
02:02:58,954 --> 02:02:59,996
Very well.

1455
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:29,484
Admiral, the Alfa's too quick.
It's only a matter of time.

1456
02:03:30,152 --> 02:03:34,614
"Ryan, some things in here
don't react well to bullets."

1457
02:03:34,698 --> 02:03:38,368
Yeah. Like me.
l don't react well to bullets.

1458
02:03:57,972 --> 02:04:00,348
-Where's he now?
-Close, sir.

1459
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:06,604
-Nine hundred meters, directly ahead.
-Got him.

1460
02:04:06,689 --> 02:04:09,607
-Match bearings and fire.
-We are too close!

1461
02:04:09,692 --> 02:04:11,776
Don't argue. Launch the weapon.

1462
02:04:11,861 --> 02:04:13,695
The torpedoes are armed
in the tubes! You cannot. . .

1463
02:04:13,779 --> 02:04:15,613
Do it now!

1464
02:04:18,033 --> 02:04:22,078
Another torpedo. It went active
the moment it was launched.

1465
02:04:22,163 --> 02:04:24,289
Left full rudder.
Ease off on your bow planes.

1466
02:04:24,373 --> 02:04:26,499
l think he's got us.

1467
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:38,887
Way to go, Dallas!

1468
02:04:42,808 --> 02:04:45,602
Torpedo is in acquisition.
Range 500 yards and closing.

1469
02:04:45,686 --> 02:04:49,439
-You've done it, Mr. Thompson!
-l hope this works.

1470
02:04:49,899 --> 02:04:52,108
Chief, put us on the roof.

1471
02:04:52,193 --> 02:04:55,945
Countermeasure station, on my mark.
Five, four. . .

1472
02:04:58,824 --> 02:05:02,327
One. Release countermeasures.
Emergency blow!

1473
02:05:02,411 --> 02:05:04,037
Full rise. Fair water plane.

1474
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:14,047
Six hundred feet, 550 , 500 feet.

1475
02:05:14,882 --> 02:05:18,134
-Four-fifty.
-Come on, big D . Fly.

1476
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:34,776
Captain scared 'em out of the water!

1477
02:05:37,196 --> 02:05:40,823
That torpedo's still active.
It's searching for another target.

1478
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:08,434
A goddamn cook!

1479
02:06:37,089 --> 02:06:38,715
How close is that Alfa, Jonesy?

1480
02:06:38,799 --> 02:06:42,093
-Thousand yards, going to port.
-Reverse your turn.

1481
02:06:48,684 --> 02:06:52,729
We're turning straight at him.
Torpedo's still on our tail.

1482
02:06:57,026 --> 02:07:00,903
The hard part about playing chicken
is knowing when to flinch.

1483
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:10,663
Collision in 400 yards, 350 , 300 . . .

1484
02:07:10,748 --> 02:07:12,665
Captain!

1485
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:15,460
Right full rudder, 30 degree down angle.

1486
02:07:15,544 --> 02:07:18,713
Aye, sir. This one's going to be close.

1487
02:07:23,218 --> 02:07:27,138
-Torpedo dead ahead!
-You arrogant ass. You've killed us.

1488
02:07:55,209 --> 02:07:59,337
We have ascertained
the Red October's final position,

1489
02:07:59,755 --> 02:08:01,673
but given the depth of the water

1490
02:08:01,757 --> 02:08:04,967
and the fact that the wreckage
spreads across a wide area,

1491
02:08:05,052 --> 02:08:07,845
it'll be some time
before anything's recovered.

1492
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:09,138
However, your people are

1493
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:10,598
interviewing the crew now

1494
02:08:10,683 --> 02:08:13,476
and making arrangements
for their return.

1495
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:18,147
This has been
a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador.

1496
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:21,359
And I can only stress
that if you'd come to us earlier

1497
02:08:21,443 --> 02:08:23,778
it might have been avoided.

1498
02:08:24,863 --> 02:08:29,659
-l appreciate your candor in the matter.
-And I yours, Andrei.

1499
02:08:33,622 --> 02:08:34,580
Perhaps in the future

1500
02:08:34,665 --> 02:08:39,877
technology will allow a more
thorough investigation of the wreckage.

1501
02:08:39,962 --> 02:08:41,796
Perhaps.

1502
02:08:47,553 --> 02:08:49,929
There is another matter. . .

1503
02:08:50,013 --> 02:08:52,849
-One that I'm reluctant to. . .
-Please.

1504
02:08:55,477 --> 02:08:57,520
One of our submarines, an Alfa,

1505
02:08:57,604 --> 02:09:01,941
was last reported
in the area of the Grand Banks.

1506
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:06,112
We have not heard from her
for some time.

1507
02:09:07,906 --> 02:09:09,449
Andrei.

1508
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:13,995
You've lost another submarine?

1509
02:09:27,509 --> 02:09:31,971
All this way
to hide a submarine in a river.

1510
02:09:32,931 --> 02:09:35,266
We're 100 miles
from the nearest naval base,

1511
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:38,436
the last place that
satellites will ever look.

1512
02:09:40,522 --> 02:09:43,191
l grew up around here.

1513
02:09:44,985 --> 02:09:49,447
My grandfather taught me to fish
off that island right over there.

1514
02:09:52,868 --> 02:09:56,287
There's one question
you haven't asked me yet.

1515
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,582
Why?

1516
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:04,879
l figured you would tell me
when you were ready.

1517
02:10:08,050 --> 02:10:12,595
Now, there are those who believe
we should attack the United States first,

1518
02:10:12,679 --> 02:10:17,892
settle everything in one moment.
Red October was built for that purpose.

1519
02:10:19,561 --> 02:10:20,895
When the dust settles from this,

1520
02:10:20,979 --> 02:10:23,147
there's going to be
hell to pay in Moscow.

1521
02:10:23,232 --> 02:10:27,276
Perhaps. Maybe something good
will come from it.

1522
02:10:28,403 --> 02:10:32,907
A little revolution, now and then,
is a healthy thing, don't you think?

1523
02:10:39,915 --> 02:10:42,875
Do you still like to fish, Ryan?

1524
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:49,006
There's a river, not unlike this one,
near Vilnius,

1525
02:10:49,091 --> 02:10:52,051
where my grandfather taught me to fish.

1526
02:10:54,930 --> 02:10:59,684
"And the sea will grant
each man new hope

1527
02:10:59,768 --> 02:11:04,230
"as sleep brings dreams of home."

1528
02:11:09,778 --> 02:11:12,321
Christopher Columbus.

1529
02:11:16,451 --> 02:11:19,161
Welcome to the New World, sir.

1530
02:11:28,422 --> 02:11:30,506
Everything all right, sir?

1530
02:11:31,305 --> 02:12:31,780
