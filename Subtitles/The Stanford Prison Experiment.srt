00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,145
How's it going, fellas?

3
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,355
- Hi.
- Hi. How you doing?

4
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,982
All right.

5
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,776
Comfortable?

6
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,862
Uh, yeah.
Sure.

7
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,990
Okay. Question one.

8
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,742
Have you ever talked
to a psychiatrist

9
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,328
or a psychologist
about an emotional problem?

10
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,038
Uh, no.

11
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,541
Nice.

12
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,169
Have you ever felt
you needed help

13
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,379
with an emotional problem?

14
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,716
Uh...

15
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,428
No.

16
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,097
Have you ever attempted
to kill yourself?

17
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,851
Wow.

18
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,103
Uh, no.

19
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,564
No.

20
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,817
In the past year, have you
consumed any alcohol or...

21
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,027
- Yes.
- Illegal drugs?

22
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,862
Illegal drugs?

23
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,489
Um, yes.

24
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,117
Do... is this...
this is going on record?

25
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,454
If I say "no,"
that means that I can be in it?

26
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,747
Not necessarily.

27
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,498
It's $15 a day?

28
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,625
- Yeah.
- That's correct.

29
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,918
No, I haven't had any alcohol

30
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,669
or anything like that.

31
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,131
Have you ever given in to
an aggressive urge or impulse?

32
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,759
Uh, what do you mean by that?

33
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,429
Like, domestic violence
or rape, incest...

34
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,598
- No, no, no, no.
- Things of that nature.

35
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,099
- No.
- No.

36
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,727
I go to Stanford.

37
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,687
Okay.

38
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,232
Have you ever experienced
any emotional problems

39
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,317
associated with
your sexual interests

40
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,402
or your choice of
a sexual partner?

41
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,279
Does love count?

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,906
If you'd like it to.

43
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,533
Okay, then no.

44
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,702
Why do you want to
participate in this study?

45
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,788
To be honest,
financial gain.

46
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,164
I could use a little cash
this summer.

47
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,833
I just saw the $15 a day.

48
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,963
I was looking through the ads,
and it was just...

49
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,465
the most interesting.

50
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,675
If selected for
this study,

51
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,261
would you rather be
a guard or a prisoner?

52
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,347
I don't think I have
the qualities to be a guard.

53
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,974
Prisoner.

54
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,934
Prisoner, I guess.

55
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,811
I-I wouldn't want to be a guard.

56
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,771
- Prisoner.
- A prisoner.

57
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,189
Prisoner.

58
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,525
A prisoner sounds like
it would be a little less work.

59
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,527
Prisoner.

60
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,113
Why's that?

61
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,909
Nobody likes guards.

62
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,417
All right,
we got a heads.

63
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,793
So we can just put him
over there,

64
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,336
yeah,
with the prisoners.

65
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,884
Last one.
You want the honors?

66
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,979
Heads again.
He's a prisoner.

67
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,397
Okay, so the last
one's a guard.

68
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,524
Exactly.

69
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,943
Well, guys,

70
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,321
I think we have our prisoners
and our guards.

71
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,079
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,664
I am Dr. Phil Zimbardo,

73
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,584
professor of psychology
here at Stanford University.

74
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,544
Welcome to orientation.

75
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,962
You're gonna be
very pleased to know

76
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,591
that you all have been chosen
to be the prison guards

77
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,885
in this study.

78
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,846
And that choice was made based
upon the exemplary qualities

79
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,641
that you all demonstrated
during your interviews.

80
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,393
So good for you.

81
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,483
This experiment will be
an extension of my research

82
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,278
into the effects prisons
can have on human behavior.

83
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,405
And being that it's summer
and the school's almost empty,

84
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,950
we should have near complete
privacy for this study.

85
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,244
And as you'll soon see,

86
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,622
we have cleared out
some of the teachers' offices

87
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,540
and converted them
into prison cells,

88
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,043
and the hallway will serve
as the prison yard.

89
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,420
But remember,

90
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,964
just as you are watching
the prisoners,

91
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:27,844
my graduate staff and I
will be watching you.

92
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:32,557
So under no circumstances
whatsoever are you to hit

93
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,019
or physically assault
the prisoners in any way.

94
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,148
Now, you'll all be given
sunglasses and uniforms

95
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,817
to give the prisoners a sense

96
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:46,238
of a unified,
singular authority.

97
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,866
Once a prisoner is jailed,
he will not be able to leave,

98
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,744
except under
established procedures.

99
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,290
And from this point forward,

100
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,292
you should never refer
to this as a study

101
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,128
or an experiment again.

102
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,591
A lot of these books,

103
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,343
I don't even know
where I got them.

104
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,013
The perils of
moving in together.

105
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,266
What are you
thinking about?

106
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,684
The experiment?

107
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,477
No, experiment's routine.

108
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,354
You know, I'm gonna be away
for two weeks,

109
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,231
and then...

110
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,444
And then you are
gonna be starting

111
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,028
your new job.

112
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,364
You make it sound like
it's in a different state.

113
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,283
Berkeley is an hour
up the road.

114
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,576
Oh, that I know.

115
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,161
It's just I don't know
what the guys and I

116
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,787
are gonna do without you.

117
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,541
Phil...

118
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,420
No one's ever gonna
take me seriously and...

119
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,589
and my career seriously

120
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,217
until I go out there
and prove it on my own.

121
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,971
Hey...

122
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,058
It could have been
New York.

123
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,061
I made this decision
for us.

124
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,063
I know.
I know.

125
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,190
I know.

126
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,316
It's just...

127
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,447
You know what?

128
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,574
Nobody deserves this
more than you.

129
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,413
You were a great
student of mine.

130
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,129
And you're gonna be
a great professor.

131
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,006
Thank you.

132
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,681
Now wait a second.

133
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,058
You did miss a spot
right over there.

134
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,226
Hey!

135
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,560
You can't fall for that.

136
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,062
Come on!

137
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,356
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

138
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,404
Hey. You Daniel Culp?

139
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,614
Uh, yeah.
That's...

140
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,740
That's the name
they gave me.

141
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,283
I'm placing you
under arrest

142
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,702
for violation of
California Penal Code 211,

143
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,745
armed robbery.

144
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,163
Hey, my brother
didn't do anything.

145
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,374
Uh, they know that.
Everything will be fine.

146
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,292
Go‒go on, tell Mom
I won't be home for dinner.

147
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,835
She'll understand.
It's okay.

148
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,504
Hands on the car and spread 'em.

149
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,311
Which one of us
should start?

150
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,854
Well, I'll do it.

151
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,900
Okay,

152
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,485
feet apart.

153
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,406
Wider.
I said "wider."

154
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,866
You guys,
this doesn't have to be...

155
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,618
Just keep your hands
on the wall.

156
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,746
Okay, just keep your hands
on the wall.

157
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,165
Um, put your head down.

158
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,669
Uh, and take off
your shoes.

159
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,010
Uh...

160
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,678
Oh, oh.
Okay.

161
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,138
Um...

162
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,391
Put your hands
at your sides.

163
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,105
Now I want you to strip.

164
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,316
Uh, really?

165
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,901
Maybe I could have
some privacy first...

166
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,361
Shut up!

167
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,820
And strip.

168
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,283
And put your clothes
on the floor.

169
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,244
Oh, man.

170
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,970
Put your clothes
to the right.

171
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,722
The shirt.

172
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,976
Don't we have
to delouse him first?

173
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,228
Oh, shit.

174
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,771
Uh, stay where you are.

175
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,356
Ah, oh.
Right.

176
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,735
Jesse.

177
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,611
Ah.

178
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,863
You made it.
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

179
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,906
- Yeah.
- Very, very, very good.

180
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,616
Uh, everybody,
this is Jesse Fletcher.

181
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,910
He's gonna consult with us
on the experiment.

182
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,788
We got Paul, Kyle,
and you remember Mike.

183
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,831
- Hey.
- Yep.

184
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,874
Hi.

185
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,001
Why don't you
pull up a chair?

186
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,424
What?
Why me?

187
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,134
Just do it.

188
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,677
All right.

189
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,554
Put your arms
above your head.

190
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,448
Fuck.

191
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,838
Wow.

192
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,266
Hey, Phil,
um,

193
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,309
I don't mean to be rude,

194
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,354
but what qualifies him
to be here?

195
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,527
Well, he's got experience.

196
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,495
You're kidding, right?

197
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,372
Okay, boys,
let's take her down there

198
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,499
and show her
just how pretty she looks.

199
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,343
All right, listen up.

200
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,096
From now on, you will be known
as Prisoner 8612

201
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,973
and only as 8612.

202
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,641
And you will,
at all times,

203
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,561
refer to us
as Mr. Correctional Officer.

204
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,854
You got it?

205
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,856
Uh, yeah,
I got it.

206
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,148
What was that?

207
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,403
I mean, yes, sir,
Mr. Correctional Officer, sir.

208
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,821
Yeah, good.

209
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,406
All right,
um,

210
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,616
let's take her down
to cell number two.

211
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,541
All right.

212
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,668
Let's get the next one.

213
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,601
Hey.
What are you doing in here?

214
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,935
You're missing everything.

215
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,815
What?

216
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,569
You brought me here
to legitimize this experiment,

217
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,697
and there's nothing legitimate
about this place, Phil.

218
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,868
You're right.

219
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,786
You're right.

220
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,413
I didn't explain it well.

221
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,207
Prisons, they represent...

222
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,044
a loss of freedom,
literally

223
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,088
and symbolically.

224
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,132
Yeah, but that does not explain
why they're wearing dresses.

225
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,842
They're wearing dresses,
Phil.

226
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,763
Yes, I understand.

227
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,431
Uh...

228
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,310
We're trying to strip away
their individuality...

229
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,190
Make them uniform,
feminize them.

230
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,483
Feminize them?

231
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,068
Yes.
Feminize them.

232
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,987
Take away all the things

233
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,240
that make them them.

234
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,370
You see, we're trying
to understand

235
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,747
how an institution

236
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,874
affects an individual's
behavior.

237
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,963
We're trying to do something...

238
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,256
We're trying to do
something good.

239
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,356
Hey, man.
I'm Daniel.

240
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,691
Uh, that's Jeff.

241
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,733
Hey.

242
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,986
- I'm... I'm Peter.

243
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,278
Well, nice to meet you,
comrade.

244
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,530
What are you in for?

245
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,823
Uh...

246
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,366
they said something
about burglary,

247
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,701
but, uh,

248
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,119
I mean, I didn't really
do anything.

249
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,370
Sure, sure.

250
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,997
Joint's overflowing
with innocent men.

251
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,915
We've been framed...
framed, I tell ya!

252
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,376
I'm just messing with you.

253
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,628
You can sit down, you know.

254
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,005
Yeah.

255
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,759
Are you aware we're
supposed to be quiet?

256
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,637
Yeah, you are aware
they can't lay a finger on us.

257
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,764
It's in the contract.

258
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,225
We can do whatever we want.

259
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,394
I'm just saying I think
it'll go a whole lot smoother

260
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,478
if we do what we're told.

261
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,274
Okay!

262
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,026
Time for lineup!

263
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,523
Prisoners are part of
a correctional community.

264
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,734
In order to keep the community
running smoothly,

265
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,321
prisoners must obey
the following rules.

266
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,906
Rule number one:

267
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,492
prisoners must remain silent
during rest periods,

268
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,535
after lights out,
during meals,

269
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,288
and outside the prison yards.

270
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,040
Rule number two:

271
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,917
prisoners must eat at meal times

272
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,169
and only at meal times.

273
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,295
Rule number three:

274
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:14,175
prisoners must participate
in all prison activities.

275
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,718
Rule number four:

276
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,011
prisoners must address
the guards

277
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,930
as Mr. Correctional Officer

278
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,391
and the warden as Mr. Chief
Correctional Officer.

279
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,726
- Rule number five...
- You're on, Mike.

280
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,853
Smoking is a privilege.
Rule number six...

281
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:29,190
You can call me, uh,
Warden from here on.

282
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,859
Hey, maybe tell the guards
to lighten up a bit.

283
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,320
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't do that.

284
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,030
Rule number eight:
prisoners must report...

285
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,490
All right.
Don't interfere.

286
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,909
All rule violations
to the guards.

287
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,494
Rule number nine:

288
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,871
failure to obey
any of the above rules

289
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,249
may result in punishment.

290
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,880
All right,
stand at attention

291
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,507
for Warden Penny.

292
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,141
All of you have shown

293
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,520
that you are unable to function
in the real world.

294
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,232
You lack the responsibility
of the good people

295
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,609
of this great country.

296
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,863
Well, we are here
to help you learn

297
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,240
what your responsibilities are.

298
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,827
Now, if you follow the rules
and keep your hands clean,

299
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,704
if you repent for your misdeeds

300
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,249
and show a proper attitude
of penitence,

301
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,544
well, we'll get along just fine,
gentlemen.

302
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,387
- How is it in there?
- It's fine.

303
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,014
Prisoners are falling in line.

304
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,891
Yeah, we kind of did
all the hard work for you.

305
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,601
I can almost smell the pork.

306
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,228
Better pork than
wearing a dress, dude.

307
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,153
You know who
you look like?

308
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,573
You look like that guy
from Cool Hand Luke.

309
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,284
You know, the one that kills
Paul Newman at the end?

310
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,536
Haven't seen the film.
Thanks for ruining it, man.

311
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,663
Oh, it's a great flick.

312
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,957
I'm partial to Captain
myself.

313
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,961
Now, I can be a nice guy,

314
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,632
or I can be one real mean
son of a bitch.

315
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,343
It's all up to you.

316
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,981
Oh, we should strike
for better food.

317
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,027
And more money.

318
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,321
Just eat your food,
8612.

319
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,240
Keep your comments
to yourself.

320
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,138
Hey, man.
Can I have a smoke?

321
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,807
Oh, yeah.

322
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,282
Smoking is a privilege,
5704,

323
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,951
one you're gonna
have to earn.

324
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,995
It says in the contract,
after mealtime...

325
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,289
As for the rest
of you prisoners...

326
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,377
I need not remind you
of rule number one.

327
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,715
I don't want
any more talking.

328
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,716
Uh-oh.

329
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,925
Look at this guy.

330
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,677
Thinks he's John Wayne
or something.

331
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,348
- Jesus.
- What the fuck, man?

332
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,143
That means you, 8612.

333
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,978
You got that?

334
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,695
Okay, is it just me,
or...

335
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,947
Are these guys taking this thing
a bit too seriously?

336
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,365
Uh, yeah.

337
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,992
They're just doing
their job.

338
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,035
Same as us.

339
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,536
Uh, really?

340
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,830
'Cause it seems to me like
they're having more fun

341
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,665
twirling their batons
than I'm having

342
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,751
with my balls hanging out
of this fucking dress.

343
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,085
This isn't about fun.

344
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,170
This is a job.

345
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,546
Yeah, but for 15 bucks?

346
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,173
Yeah, 15 bucks
that I really need.

347
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,257
Yeah, we all need it,

348
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,092
but why should we be working
twice as hard for it

349
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,385
than these guys?

350
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:30,222
I'm thinking we need to make
the guards earn their pay.

351
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,769
Visiting day is in two days.

352
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,854
We would like to give you
the opportunity

353
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,272
to write a letter to the person

354
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,899
that you would like to have
come visit.

355
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,484
Isn't that nice?

356
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,027
In 30 minutes,

357
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,197
you will be required
to turn in a finished letter.

358
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,617
Do not seal the envelope.

359
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,160
Whether or not
your letter gets sent

360
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,787
will be based
on your behavior.

361
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,330
Are there any questions?

362
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,374
I have a question,
Mr. Chief Correctional Officer.

363
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,918
Uh, will we be allowed
one phone call?

364
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,544
No, you will not.

365
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,213
Oh, yeah...

366
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,632
Question, 5486?

367
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,716
I...

368
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,593
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Chief
Correctional Officer,

369
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,845
um, my glasses...

370
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,347
What about them?

371
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,058
Well, I...
I mean, need them to see.

372
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,184
Wha...

373
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,645
Your correctional staff
is here to serve you, 5486.

374
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,927
- Right, it's just I get...
- You don't need your glasses.

375
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,316
Don't interrupt
the warden, boy.

376
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,864
Mr. Correctional Officer,

377
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,991
when will we know
our sentence?

378
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,034
When judgment
is passed on you.

379
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,619
And when will that be?

380
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,663
Well, that is for the judge
and the court to determine.

381
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,789
When are we gonna
go to court?

382
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,960
That is also for the judge
and the court to determine.

383
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,881
Uh, Mr. Correctional Officer,
sir, uh, my pills...

384
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,049
I need my pills...

385
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,844
I wasn't aware that
you took medication, 3401.

386
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,514
Uh, well, they're vitamins,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

387
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,809
Well, you get all
the vitamins you need

388
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,854
in the tasty, nutritious
food we serve you, 3401.

389
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,398
- Yes, but...
- That's enough chin-wagging.

390
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,733
Let's get to writing those
letters, ladies.

391
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,102
No, nothing so far.

392
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,979
"I'll do my best to organize
the other prisoners

393
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,064
and bring an end
to this oppressive situation."

394
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,357
Signed, "Power to the people."

395
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,985
Well, clearly, he's not
taking this very seriously.

396
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,698
Hey.
Check this one out.

397
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,743
Look how he signed it.

398
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,665
Jesus.
It's only been ten hours.

399
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,959
This might be an interesting
two weeks after all.

400
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,669
Mm-hmm.

401
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,341
Let's go, boys.

402
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,927
All right, gentlemen,

403
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,137
we gonna have ourselves
a little count.

404
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,139
Gonna be a lot of fun.

405
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,809
Okay, 5704, go.
Loud and clear.

406
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,145
5704.

407
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,355
3401.

408
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,357
- 7258.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

409
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,900
Is that loud and clear?

410
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,445
Maybe you didn't hear me right.

411
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,906
Loud and clear.

412
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,990
Go.

413
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,076
5704.

414
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,244
3401.

415
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,496
- 7258.
- 819.

416
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,997
- 1037.
- Stop!

417
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,708
1037, you don't know
your own name?

418
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,877
Why'd you have to
look down?

419
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,420
'Cause I didn't know
my number.

420
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,172
- You didn't know your number?
- No, sir.

421
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,632
You know your name now, boy?

422
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,841
Yes, sir.

423
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,885
- What's your number?
- 1037.

424
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,638
Then, 1037, don't look down
at your dress next time.

425
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,014
Start again.

426
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,809
- Faster.
- 5704.

427
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,144
- 3401.
- 7258.

428
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,021
When I say, "Again, faster,"

429
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,315
I expect you to go again,
faster.

430
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,235
5704, go again. Faster.

431
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,195
- 5704.
- 3401.

432
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,155
- 7258.
- 819.

433
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,241
- 1037.
- 8612.

434
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,368
- 2093.
- Uh, 5486.

435
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,869
4325.

436
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,664
Now, that was terrible.

437
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,916
Maybe them caps on your heads

438
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,626
are a little too tight,
gentlemen,

439
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,795
'cause that was slow as hell.

440
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,130
Since you guys
can't go forwards,

441
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,173
how about we try
going backwards?

442
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,636
407...

443
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,887
No, God damn it.

444
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,097
I said backwards.

445
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,516
Starting with him.

446
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,059
4325.

447
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,353
- 5486.
- 2093.

448
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,105
Uh, 86‒
Fuck!

449
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,773
Excuse me, 8612?

450
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,775
Did you use profanity?

451
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,694
Yes, I did,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

452
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,407
Well, just for that, you have
to start all over again.

453
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,492
- 4‒
- Because of you.

454
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,703
That's right, don't interrupt
Mr. Correctional Officer.

455
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,371
Go, 4325.

456
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,999
- 4325.
- Uh, 5486.

457
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,084
- 2093.
- 8612.

458
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,045
- 1037.
- 819.

459
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,963
- 7258.
- 3401.

460
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,007
- 5704.
- Tell you what you're gonna do.

461
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,176
Tell you what we're gonna do.

462
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,887
I got a great idea.
How about we try singing it?

463
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,513
That'll get the blood boiling
a little bit.

464
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,223
5704, go!

465
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,725
I know you got it.

466
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,144
I know you got a set
of lungs on you, 5704.

467
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,274
I see any smiling,
it's jumping jacks.

468
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,985
Go.

Start again.

00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,040

819, how about you give me
a couple jumping jacks,

480
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,347
if you find it so funny.

481
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,724

how about you come on out here
and give me ten jumping jacks,

486
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,982
all y'all at the same time?

487
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,025
Count 'em off.

488
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,194
And sing it loud and clear.

489
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,990
- Ten jumping jacks. Let's go.
- ♪ One, two, three ♪

490
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,952
♪ Four, five, six ♪

491
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,912
♪ Seven, eight ♪

492
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,455
♪ Nine, ten ♪

493
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,168
This John Wayne guy
is remarkable.

494
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,378
From the second
he stepped in the yard,

495
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,879
he's been in complete control.

496
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,465
He's just doing his job.

497
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,387
- 5704.
- 3401.

498
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,638
7258.

499
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,932
- 1037.
- 8612.

500
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,809
- 2093.
- 5486.

501
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,102
4325.

502
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,562
No.
Now count it like you mean it.

503
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,272
- 5704.
- 3401.

504
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,606
- 7258.
- 819.

505
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,608
- 1037.
- 8612.

506
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,360
- 2093.
- 5486.

507
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,445
4325.

508
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,905
I want it fast,
I want it loud,

509
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,031
and I want it clear.

510
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,616
5704!

511
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,785
- 3401!
- 7258!

512
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,203
- 819!
- 1037!

513
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,705
- 8612!
- 2093!

514
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,207
- 5486!
- 4325.

515
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,627
That was pretty,

516
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,254
real pretty.

517
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,214
That's how
we want it done.

518
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,011
What are you so proud about,
7258?

519
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,046
Tell me the number of the dress
to the man to your right.

520
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,479
Don't look.

521
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,063
No cheatin'.

522
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,527
I couldn't tell you.

523
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,279
I tell you what.
Why don't you come out here

524
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,489
and give me ten
jumping jacks

525
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,032
after you tell me
what number that is?

526
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,619
3401.

527
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,080
4325,

528
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,875
tell me the number of the man
standing to your right.

529
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,586
Um, 5486,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

530
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,297
Well, since
you had to look,

531
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,715
I want you
to step up here,

532
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,051
I want you to do
five push-ups,

533
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,345
four jumping jacks,
then eight push-ups,

534
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,596
then six jumping jacks

535
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,431
so you will
remember the name

536
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,016
of the man standing
to your right

537
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,018
and you won't have
to look next time.

538
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,479
Five push-ups.
There you go.

539
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,733
One, two, three,

540
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,486
four, five.

541
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,283
One, two, three...

542
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,409
Little less rattle there.

543
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,953
Four.

544
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,834
- One...
- All the way down now.

545
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,293
- Three...
- There you go.

546
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,546
- Four, five.
- That's a real man's push-up.

547
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:44,341
Six, seven, eight.

548
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,932
One, two, three, four,

549
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,810
five, six.

550
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,728
Get back in line.

551
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,357
Did y'all enjoy your counts
this evening?

552
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,068
No, sir.

553
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,571
Who said that?

554
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,198
- This one.
- 8612?

555
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,286
What?
You want me to lie?

556
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,874
Maybe you'd enjoy
a little time in the hole.

557
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,635
Anybody else
not enjoy their counts?

558
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,055
Anybody else want to be
honest here?

559
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,060
Good.

560
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,481
Hey, I, uh...

561
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,483
I think one of us
needs to go home.

562
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,776
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

563
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,903
We got another
two weeks of this.

564
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,487
We need to pace ourselves.

565
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,281
Fine.

566
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,034
Have fun down here
in the dungeons of Jordan Hall.

567
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,579
- See you later.
- Good night.

568
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,247
Hey, Phil?

569
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,291
You want to go
get some rest?

570
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,876
Uh...

571
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,254
No, I'm gonna stay here
a little bit more.

572
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,638
Come on out of there, 8612.

573
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,935
Get crackin', boy.

574
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,937
Don't none of these other
prisoners get to sleep

575
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,898
till you make your bed
to my satisfaction.

576
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,278
Go on. Nice and tight.

577
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,576
And I assure you,

578
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,828
all of those other
prisoners are real tired

579
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,830
from all those counts
you made 'em do.

580
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,584
No wrinkles now.

581
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,799
Oh, I hope you're not
done yet.

582
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,343
I think your mama taught you
to make a better bed than that.

583
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,971
Come on now.

584
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,473
Don't disappoint
your mama, boy.

585
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,725
Move those sheets.
Start over.

586
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,898
I want those corners
nice and neat.

587
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,734
John Wayne is a fag.

588
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,196
What was that, 8612?

589
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,073
Um, I'm sorry,
Mr. Correctional Officer?

590
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,200
Did you just sass me, 8612?

591
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,661
Um...
No? No.

592
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,246
- Hmm.
- No, Mr. Correctional Officer.

593
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,831
That's funny.
I could've sworn you did.

594
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,541
That's so strange.

595
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,209
Very strange.

596
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,421
You know what?
Just the same, 8612,

597
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,214
why don't you come on
out here in the hallway

598
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,008
and give me 20 push-ups?

599
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,432
Count 'em off
so everybody can hear them.

600
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,893
One, two, three, four...

601
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:46,273
- Louder.
- Five, six seven, eight...

602
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,942
- Nine, ten...
- Don't touch his bed, 1037.

603
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,403
- 11, 12...
- I see you.

604
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,487
13, 14...

605
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,989
I don't think
cell three can hear you.

606
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,243
15, 16, 17, 18,

607
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,787
19, 20.

608
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,095
Well, are you ready
for me, 8612?

609
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,264
Sure am,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

610
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,432
All right, now.

611
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,912
I don't know, 8612.

612
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,539
Them look like
hospital corners to you?

613
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,875
How you guys doing?

614
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:47,876
- Good.
- Yeah.

615
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,044
- Good.
- Good.

616
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,421
- I mean, we...
- How'd it... how'd it go?

617
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,839
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

618
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,257
- Not too bad.

619
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,550
I mean, we...

620
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,843
We ran 'em pretty ragged.

621
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,512
- Really?
- Yeah.

622
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,347
You should've seen
8612's face

623
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,808
when I made him remake his bed
for the 12th time.

624
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,142
Little fucker looked at me

625
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,852
like I just took a shit
in his ice cream.

626
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,895
Thought he was gonna
burst out crying

627
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,271
right then and there.

628
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,940
Yeah, I mean,
he might have.

629
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,775
He's a pretty
emotional guy.

630
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,693
- Nice.
- He got pretty upset.

631
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,403
So they just, uh...

632
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,030
they let you do it?

633
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,032
Nobody steps in?

634
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,409
Well, yeah, I mean, they don't
really have a choice, you know?

635
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,661
Who's gonna step in?

636
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,538
I mean,
you know,

637
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,289
you're the boss man.

638
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,499
Hell yeah.

639
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,917
Wow.

640
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,377
They got to do
what you say.

641
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,712
Well, I guess we'll
have to give 8612

642
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,256
a little extra
attention tonight.

643
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,298
Mm-hmm.

644
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,508
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

645
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,063
- Let's go!
- Come on!

646
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,691
- Wake it up!
- Are you fucking kidding me?

647
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,900
Hello!

648
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,861
Hey.

649
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,112
You hear that?

650
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,197
Get out of there.

651
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,242
- All right.
- Get the fuck out of bed!

652
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,786
- Come on!
- Man.

653
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,664
- We just finally got to sleep.
- Oh, no.

654
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,416
We slept all day for this.

655
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,209
Hands up.
Against the wall.

656
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,752
Do it.

657
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,254
Hey, give me that.

658
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,967
Now, this
is an exercise period.

659
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,802
Each prisoner must
complete the following:

660
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,804
30 jump‒
Turn around.

661
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,848
30 jumping jacks,
30 sit-ups,

662
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,391
30 push-ups.

663
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,518
It is up to
the guards' discretion

664
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,937
whether or not a prisoner
shall do more.

665
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,022
Well, hell,

666
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,398
let's make it 40.

667
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,443
Do 'em now.

668
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,572
Hey, you heard the man.

669
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,615
- Fuck!
- Come on!

670
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,491
Jumping jacks,
sit-ups, push-ups.

671
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,410
Get to it.

672
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,411
Go!

673
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,829
One, two, three...

674
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,050
Keep going!

675
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,305
- You only did six, 7258.
- I did at least seven.

676
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,015
Yeah, good.

677
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,817
You're finished when I say
you're finished, 819.

678
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,152
Get back down.

679
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,947
I did 40 push-ups.

680
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,989
That's what you
told me to do.

681
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,157
I did them.
I'm done.

682
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,575
Hey, everybody
keeps going,

683
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,744
unless 819 decides
to join you

684
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,829
for an additional 20.

685
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,083
What's it gonna be?

686
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,125
You gonna do your 20,

687
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,169
or are these guys gonna go
till they drop?

688
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,297
It's up to you.

689
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,800
Fine.

690
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,093
Fascist pig.

691
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,011
Two, three...

692
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,429
- Everybody, stop.
- Four..

693
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,682
- Everybody, stop.
- Six, seven...

694
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,101
- 819, stand up.
- Eight, nine, ten.

695
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,229
- 11, 12, 13, 14...
- I said stand up, 819!

696
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,023
15, 16, 17, 18,

697
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,193
19, 20, sir!

698
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,198
What did you just call me?

699
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,661
I think you heard me,

700
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,539
you fascist pig.

701
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,375
Open up the hole.
Open up the hole.

702
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,546
The rest of you, return
to your cells immediately,

703
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,047
have them neat and orderly,

704
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,008
and be standing by the foot
of your bed in three minutes.

705
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,050
Go now.

706
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,438
Not bad,
not bad.

707
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,361
Is this your bunk.
8612?

708
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,033
Yes, it is,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

709
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,994
Why don't you make up
your bunk, 8612?

710
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,165
I did,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

711
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,667
Oh, really?

712
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,919
Well, that's not
what I see.

713
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,214
What the fuck, man?

714
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,424
I just made that!

715
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,389
What was that?

716
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,641
What just happened?

717
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,268
Fuck.

718
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,187
He...
You shit bag.

719
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,646
- You...
- Take him, take him, take him.

720
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,190
Put him in the fucking hole.

721
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,859
- Get in the goddamn hole.
- Oh, 819's already in the hole.

722
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,277
Put him in the hole!

723
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,945
Should I get Zimbardo?

724
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,572
Just put him in the hole!
Just do it.

725
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,074
Uh...

726
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,993
Let's just...
see what happens here.

727
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,370
You just hit him.
You're not supposed to hit him.

728
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,412
Clean up his bed.

729
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,455
You're not supposed
to hit him.

730
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,083
You hear me, 1037?
Fix his bunk.

731
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,463
You got two minutes.
You hear me?

732
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,841
Don't talk back.

733
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,096
You fix that
nice and neat now.

734
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,723
What happened out there?

735
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,893
That guy fucking hit me
with his nightstick.

736
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,145
He hit you?
They're not allowed to do that.

737
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,524
Well, I did grab
his throat first, but,

738
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,402
I got to tell you,
it felt good.

739
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,779
It felt really good.

740
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,157
I... I really don't think
that's the way to go.

741
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,200
Bullshit.

742
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,286
If we can convince the others,
the odds favor us, man.

743
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,497
It's what they'd do
in a real prison.

744
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,249
Wait, what are you...

745
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,251
No talking, 8612!

746
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,336
Shit and fall in it,
motherfucker!

747
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,463
Think about it.
There's only ever three of them.

748
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,257
There's nine of us.

749
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,676
How many more of us
can they throw in here?

750
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,662
All right, everybody.

751
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,664
Mealtime's over.

752
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,459
I want you to wash your dishes
and return to your cells.

753
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,295
Come on.

754
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,930
5486,

755
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,016
said mealtime's over.

756
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,438
No, not...
not until I get my glasses.

757
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,647
Don't be a pain in the ass.

758
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,691
I said mealtime's over.
Get up.

759
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,028
I said I want my glasses.

760
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,449
- Get him up.
- All right.

761
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,617
- Get up.
- No.

762
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,368
- No.
- Get up.

763
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,162
- Get up.
- Fuck you.

764
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,413
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Give me my glasses!

765
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,040
Let go of the table.

766
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,082
We'll talk about
your glasses.

767
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,125
Will you just give me
my glasses?

768
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,211
I get really bad headaches.

769
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,712
I'm not gonna fucking...

770
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,214
- Come here!
- Give me my fucking...

771
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,096
- Get Zimbardo.
- I'll get Zimbardo.

772
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,600
Lock him up.

773
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,145
Everybody's got something,
huh?

774
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,735
Phil, hey,
uh,

775
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,820
you have to come
see this.

776
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,540
When did this happen?

777
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,959
About ten minutes ago.

778
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,878
Should we step in?

779
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,421
Phil?

780
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,717
No.

781
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,138
Let the guards figure it out.
Let's see where it goes.

782
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,099
This is where it goes.

783
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,267
It's only been a day.

784
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,893
Let the guards handle it.

785
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,354
I think this whole thing is
taking a turn for the worse.

786
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,397
- Hey!
- You see...

787
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,692
Let 'em handle it.

788
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,195
Oh, man.

789
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,784
All right, let's go.

790
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,869
- Is it that time already?
- It's that time.

791
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,167
Wait...
Wait, what's this all about?

792
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:11,087
It's new cell assignments.
Warden's orders.

793
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,390
How was the hole, man?

794
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,809
It's all right.

795
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,186
At least the guards aren't
hassling you in there.

796
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,316
You okay, man?

797
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,571
I'd just about suck a dick
for a cigarette.

798
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,033
You know, I got to say,

799
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,660
I'm very dissatisfied with
this whole experience so far.

800
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,456
You know,
I just want my pills.

801
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,294
They're vitamins, Gavin.

802
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,712
You're not gonna die.

803
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,634
Hey, guys.

804
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,303
Guys,

805
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,556
8612 and I were talking
in the hole and, um...

806
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,226
I think we've got a plan.

807
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,111
What the fuck?

808
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,905
Oh, fuck.

809
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,289
Someone open this door
immediately

810
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,874
or face severe punishment.

811
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,502
Blow it out your ass,
Mr. Correctional Officer!

812
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,799
- Fuck!
- Whoo-hoo!

813
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,509
Way to go,
cell number one!

814
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,719
We're with you
all the way!

815
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,513
Revolution!

816
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,849
That's right!
You heard him, motherfuckers!

817
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,768
Revolution!

818
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,356
Men, it's your job
to keep my prison in order,

819
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,691
and right now,
there doesn't seem to be

820
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,942
a whole lot of order out there.

821
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,863
Sir, they've blacked out
their doors, and they...

822
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,364
Why am I hearing excuses?

823
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:07,036
Do not forget,
you have all the authority.

824
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,330
Yes, sir.

825
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,290
And you're stronger
than they are.

826
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,835
They're starting to create bonds
with each other.

827
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,339
Break 'em up.

828
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,716
- Okay? Get back in there.
- Yes, sir.

829
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,384
Establish some order
before it gets out of control.

830
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,510
Yes, sir.

831
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,930
And don't forget,
if you need to...

832
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,474
call for backup.

833
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,281
Step away from the door.

834
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,490
Fuck you.

835
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,783
- Whoa!
- Step away from the door.

836
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,826
Fuck you!

837
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,200
Come on, get up!

838
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,453
- Hey!
- Stop struggling!

839
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,080
- They're taking our beds, man!
- Cell three, cell three.

840
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,210
Get against the wall!

841
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,837
I need some help over here.

842
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,005
Hey, 8612,

843
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,298
these guys are
model prisoners.

844
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,758
They're literally helping us.

845
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,009
Come on, cell three.

846
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,303
What kind of fucking
solidarity is that?

847
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,346
Shut the fuck up!

848
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,939
Don't even think about it.

849
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,981
Do not even think about it.

850
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,525
I will ruin you.

851
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,778
Put your caps back on.

852
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,779
Right now!

853
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,785
1037, where's your cap?

854
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,873
It's right there, on the ground
in front of you.

855
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,044
Come on, man,
put your cap back on.

856
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,170
No way.

857
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,007
Put your cap back on.

858
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,052
No fucking way.

859
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,595
All right.

860
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,764
Help me get him on the ground.

861
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,183
Ah!
Fuck!

862
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,226
Give me that rope!

863
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,396
Hey, what are you doing to him?

864
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,647
You can't fucking do that!

865
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,899
- That's fuck...
- Hey, shut the fuck up!

866
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,111
- Shut up!
- Ah. Ah.

867
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,320
- Stop!
- Get off of me!

868
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,446
- Stop talking.
- Get off of me!

869
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,573
Stop!

870
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,283
Tie him up.
Tie him up good.

871
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,660
How do you like that, huh?

872
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,037
Stop! Stop moving!

873
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,877
Cell two,
as you can see,

874
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,545
your correctional staff
has prepared

875
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,506
a delicious, nutritious,
and very special meal

876
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,508
for the wonderful prisoners
of cell three

877
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,636
in appreciation of their
good conduct this afternoon.

878
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,474
You've been
model prisoners, boys.

879
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,184
Well done.

880
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,229
Don't eat that shit.

881
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,523
Hands off the bars,
8612.

882
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,566
I'm not gonna tell you again.

883
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,443
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

884
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,990
Dan.

885
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,962
Okay, one thing, though...

886
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,964
if only one of us gets away,
we've got to send help

887
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,799
to bust the other guys out.

888
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,133
Deal?

889
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,843
Yeah.
Yeah, deal.

890
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,261
Yeah.

891
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,979
Coast is clear.

892
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,571
Um...

893
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,117
I think that 8612's definitely
been a little, um...

894
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,410
testy.

895
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,829
Well, that's the word
you're gonna use?

896
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,831
Well, let's go back and look
at his questionnaire.

897
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,166
- I...
- Who's got him?

898
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,085
- I don't... I don't...
- I think...

899
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:18,264
Hey! Hey!
Hey!

900
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,891
No, no, no, no.
We can't wait for this, man.

901
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,768
Here.
Quick.

902
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,275
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

903
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,317
All the doors are locked!

904
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,360
We got to go, man.
They're coming.

905
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,445
How the fuck do we
get out of here, man?

906
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,487
I don't even know
where we are.

907
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,530
Hey!

908
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,906
What are you doing?

909
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,241
I'm gonna need you to...

910
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,826
Order you to get back
in your cells.

911
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,955
Fuck you, pig!

912
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,749
The prisoners are escaping!

913
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,462
Uh, okay.

914
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,963
The exit! Let's go!

915
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,427
Oh, what the...

916
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,180
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Yeah, go back! Go back!

917
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,973
Oh, no. No.

918
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,391
- Against the wall.

919
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,143
- Against the wall.
- Shut up!

920
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,939
- Fucker, get in there.
- Calm down, man.

921
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,357
- Fuck you!
- Jesus Christ.

922
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,402
Shut your fucking mouth!

923
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,446
You shut
your fucking mouth!

924
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,198
Shut your fucking mouth.

925
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,992
- I'm tired of this shit!
- You can't do this to us!

926
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,327
You're messing with...

927
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,496
You can't fucking
do this to us!

928
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,040
Stop!
Stop! Stop!

929
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,666
- You can't do this to us!
- All right!

930
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,376
- Okay, okay! Stop!
- All right!

931
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,419
Stop!

932
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,516
8612, you have proven to be
a singular

933
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,519
and terrible influence to all
of your prisoners around you.

934
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,647
You will stay in the hole
until further notice.

935
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,858
You will remain here,

936
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,944
and you will remain silent

937
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,070
until we fix the door
to your cell.

938
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,780
Is that understood?

939
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,031
Yes, Mr. Correctional...

940
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,866
- Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.
- Good.

941
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,193
Guys, wake up.
Guys, get up.

942
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,530
Guys, wake up! Guys, get up!

943
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,494
Well, well, well,

944
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,747
look at you three, all
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

945
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:52,251
You know, you boys are in
for a whole heap of trouble,

946
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,670
but if you clear this here,
uh, barricade,

947
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,965
I can spare you a shit storm the
likes of which you never seen.

948
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,676
Don't let them in.
Come on.

949
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,096
Well,

950
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,640
that's how he wants it.

951
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,858
Knock it down, boys.

952
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,032
All right, now,

953
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,909
up against the wall.

954
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,370
I leave all of y'all alone

955
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,415
for less than a day,
and look what happens.

956
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,500
You lose your beds,

957
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,252
try to escape.

958
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:40,925
What is so goddamn wrong
with all of y'all, huh?

959
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,305
This behavior
will not be tolerated.

960
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,140
And you,

961
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,475
look at yourself.

962
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,019
You're naked.

963
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,314
Why in God's name
are you naked, boy?

964
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,566
Um,
because...

965
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,068
You know what?
Never mind.

966
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,444
I don't even care.

967
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,029
Get him back his uniform,
will you, boss?

968
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,239
He'll catch a cold.

969
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,823
Guys, guys,

970
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:08,202
I really need... I need
to speak to a doctor or...

971
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,496
Or the warden
or somebody.

972
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,706
Quiet, 8612.

973
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,749
Come on, man!
Don't do that!

974
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,334
It hurts my ears!

975
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,627
Maybe you'll think
about that

976
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,087
next time you get yourself
put in the hole.

977
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,672
All right, you can
fuck off, man!

978
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,222
Now, because

979
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,848
I am not nearly as cruel

980
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,476
as my fellow colleagues
on the day shift,

981
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,354
your blankets will be returned
to y'all

982
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,107
and your dresses
will be repaired.

983
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,944
However, should you feel
the need to defecate or urinate,

984
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,364
please feel free to do so
in the fine buckets

985
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,200
provided by
your correctional staff.

986
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,160
That'd be us.

987
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,163
Thank you.

988
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,540
Guys, seriously,

989
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,166
y-y-you don't know.

990
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,584
I got to go...

991
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,503
I... to a doctor.

992
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,713
Anything!

993
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,798
I don't know.
I'm fucked up!

994
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,384
I feel so fucked up
inside!

995
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,178
I mean, God!
I mean, Jesus Christ!

996
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,222
I'm burning up inside!

997
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,807
Don't you know?

998
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,018
Please, please!

999
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,894
Please, please,

1000
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,397
please, please!

1001
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,149
Let me out of here!

1002
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,651
I want out!

1003
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,820
I want out now!

1004
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,282
He could be faking it.

1005
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,328
Should we deny his request?

1006
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:39,043
Let's bring him to
the old classroom upstairs.

1007
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,700
So, prisoner 8612,

1008
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,703
I understand
you're not feeling well.

1009
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,539
Um, yeah.
Yeah, I just, uh...

1010
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,084
I've had this really bad
headache all day,

1011
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,795
and, um, a couple hours ago,

1012
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,172
I started feeling
my stomach being all...

1013
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,840
being all knotted up.

1014
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,219
And what is it you'd like
for us to do about that?

1015
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,639
Well, I just...

1016
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,225
I figured I ought to,
you know,

1017
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,353
g-get out and go...
go see a doctor...

1018
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,730
Just to be sure.

1019
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,525
Surely you're not suggesting

1020
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,193
that we release you
from prison

1021
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,861
for a stomachache.

1022
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,490
Look, man,

1023
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,200
I just really don't feel well,

1024
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,701
and it would be really nice...

1025
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,036
Bullshit!

1026
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,874
100% Grade A bullshit.

1027
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,252
This boy's not sick.
This boy is weak.

1028
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,711
All right, listen, doc.

1029
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,130
You don't know what
it's like down there.

1030
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,589
What did you say?

1031
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,217
What did you just say to me?

1032
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,929
Hmm?

1033
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,931
I said, "You don't know
what it's like down there."

1034
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,393
San Quentin, boy,
17 years of hard time.

1035
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,895
Do you really think
you can tell me

1036
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,439
what it's like
on the inside?

1037
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,400
Uh, no.
No.

1038
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,860
I, uh...
No, I guess not.

1039
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,278
You damn right
you guess not.

1040
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,365
Look me in my eye
when I'm talking to you.

1041
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,204
You're a wimp,
8612.

1042
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,706
They'd knock
your goddamn teeth out

1043
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,207
and pass you around
like candy.

1044
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,555
So why don't you tell us
what the real problem is?

1045
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,434
Uh, all right.

1046
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,436
It's the guards, man.

1047
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,562
I mean, I really think
the guards

1048
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,689
have gone
a little bit overboard.

1049
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:09,318
From what I've seen, I'd say
you brought that on yourself.

1050
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,863
Look, I'd just really like
to get out of here, okay?

1051
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,033
You know that you're the most
rebellious one in here.

1052
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,995
It's pretty impressive.

1053
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,789
Maybe if you spent
a little less time fighting,

1054
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,374
you wouldn't be so tired.

1055
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,418
Yeah, but what
am I supposed to do, just...

1056
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,086
Don't interrupt me.

1057
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,380
I'm sorry, sir.

1058
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,757
Come on.
Look at you.

1059
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,635
You telling me
you can't handle, what,

1060
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,053
some push-ups,

1061
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,971
some jumping jacks,

1062
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,265
guys calling you names?

1063
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,643
Come on.

1064
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,645
Tell you what,
I'll talk to the guards

1065
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,438
and tell them to go easy on you,
all right?

1066
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:49,525
W-would you do that?

1067
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,986
Phil, I think
we're done here.

1068
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,155
Take him away.

1069
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,116
Wait!
Wait!

1070
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,618
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no!

1071
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,869
I'm not done here!

1072
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,329
No, no, no.

1073
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,705
I want to finish
the conversation.

1074
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,290
I don't want to do this.

1075
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,834
Hey, you're not really
gonna tell them

1076
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:08,835
to take it easy on him,
are you?

1077
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,087
Oh, my God.
Of course not.

1078
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,547
Are you kidding me?
He was faking it, anyway.

1079
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,631
I can tell.

1080
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,133
There's no way he's getting out
of here right now.

1081
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:18,428
During meals and whenever
they are in the prison yard.

1082
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,098
Oh, hello, 8612.

1083
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,350
Welcome back.

1084
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,144
Get your ass
back in line, boy.

1085
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,438
As I was saying,

1086
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:31,608
prisoners must remain silent
during rest periods,

1087
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:35,946
after lights out, during meals,
and outside the prison yard.

1088
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,656
- Rule number two...
- What happened?

1089
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,366
Prisoners must eat
at meal times...

1090
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:42,077
I couldn't get out.

1091
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,745
What do you mean, you couldn't
get out of the contract?

1092
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:44,871
Hey!

1093
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,873
No talking on the line,
you two.

1094
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,042
- Contract don't mean shit.
- Rule number three.

1095
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:52,629
I mean I couldn't get out.
I mean they wouldn't let me out.

1096
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,047
This is all real.

1097
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,382
This is all real.

1098
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,633
This is all real.
This is all real.

1099
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:57,968
This isn't a fucking experiment.

1100
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,012
This is all real.

1101
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,680
They won't let you go.

1102
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,223
They won't let us leave.

1103
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,933
You understand?
This is real.

1104
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,602
This isn't
a fucking experiment.

1105
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,478
Don't fucking touch me, man!

1106
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,813
- Just get back in line here.
- I mean it!

1107
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,398
- Come here.
- No! No!

1108
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,275
Let go of me!
No!

1109
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,402
You motherfuckers!

1110
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,947
You motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!

1111
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,408
You fascist motherfuckers!

1112
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,327
I want to see the warden!

1113
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,579
You understand me?

1114
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,998
You have no right
to fuck with my head!

1115
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,875
You have no right!

1116
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,543
I'll smash this camera!

1117
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,462
I'll beat up
your fucking guards!

1118
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,298
I want out,
and I want out right now!

1119
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,759
You're messing with my head,
man.

1120
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,385
My head!

1121
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,890
You have no right
to fuck with my head!

1122
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,811
Okay, what is it?

1123
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,688
Uh...

1124
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,608
We‒we hit a breaking point
last night,

1125
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:59,237
and, um,
8612 is gone.

1126
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,031
We let him go.

1127
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,371
Well...
You let him go?

1128
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,081
Well, the contract
explicitly says that...

1129
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,916
Do you understand
how much time and energy,

1130
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,502
not to...
not to mention money,

1131
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,962
has been spent
on this experiment?

1132
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,841
I leave for one shift,

1133
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,593
and you have tampered
with the integrity

1134
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,928
of the entire enterprise.

1135
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,846
Phil, we were following
protocol.

1136
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,640
The kid was
in a serious crisis.

1137
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,683
He was hysterical.

1138
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,059
He was threatening
to harm himself and...

1139
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,769
I'm the superintendent
of this facility.

1140
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,604
I make that decision.
Nobody else.

1141
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:33,980
It was late.

1142
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,607
Everything was escalating
really quickly.

1143
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,650
- Kyle.
- We...

1144
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,443
Did you even stop to think,

1145
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:42,155
for one second, if 8612,
just like Jesse said yesterday,

1146
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,281
was bullshitting you?

1147
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,242
He wanted a lawyer.

1148
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,999
What is it
with these lawyers?

1149
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,877
Oh, my God.
I see.

1150
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,796
I see.

1151
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,758
Well, then,
why did 8612 lose it?

1152
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:04,094
What did we miss
in the screening process?

1153
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,137
I mean, we missed something.

1154
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,223
We were all there.
We all screened him.

1155
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,933
He was only in there
for two days.

1156
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:14,187
Yeah, but without any
sunlight and sleep,

1157
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,314
your sense of time
has been totally altered.

1158
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,359
His only weakness
was that he resisted.

1159
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,111
He didn't bend,
so he broke.

1160
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:24,364
No, he broke because he couldn't
control the other prisoners.

1161
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:27,659
8612 just wanted control.

1162
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,828
Even as a prisoner
with essentially no rights?

1163
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,371
No, Jesse's right about that.

1164
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,373
8612 was fine

1165
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,125
while other people
were serving him.

1166
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,293
So what?

1167
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,336
You think if the other
prisoners had stuck with him,

1168
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,172
then, what, John Wayne
would have lost?

1169
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,300
Man, John Wayne can't lose.
He served the system.

1170
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,302
8612 served himself.

1171
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,888
I'm sorry.

1172
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:48,930
I don't buy any of this.

1173
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,933
No, I don't imagine
you would.

1174
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,312
This is bullshit.

1175
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,898
You're basing your conclusions
off your own experience...

1176
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,066
on real felons
in a real prison.

1177
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,234
So this is not a prison?

1178
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,236
This is a simulated prison.

1179
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,405
This is 18 college boys

1180
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:07,073
who's never been punched
in the fucking face.

1181
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,909
That's what this is.

1182
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,577
I think you guys
are both missing the point.

1183
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,454
- He missing the point.
- I'm not missing anything.

1184
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,497
You missing something.

1185
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,749
No, here's the point.

1186
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:19,920
The only thing
that separates those two

1187
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,047
was a coin flip.

1188
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,553
All right, what steps are being
taken to replace 8612?

1189
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,013
Well, none, as of yet.

1190
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,473
- We got...
- Kyle, come on.

1191
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,183
Start notifying the alternates
immediately, okay?

1192
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,267
Okay.

1193
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,685
And find out which ones
can start tomorrow.

1194
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,770
Got it.

1195
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,891
Until then, what do you want me
to tell the prisoners?

1196
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:43,777
Tell them 8612 has been taken
to maximum security.

1197
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,030
Get some more fear
into them.

1198
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,706
As you know,

1199
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,209
today is visiting day.

1200
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,671
For the sake of your friends
and family,

1201
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,465
I want this place
made presentable.

1202
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,509
That means cleaning up
the mess you've made,

1203
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,512
as well as cleaning up
yourselves.

1204
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,098
Out of respect
for your loved ones,

1205
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,350
I want you to put on
the outward appearance

1206
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,061
of self-dignity,
confidence,

1207
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,106
love,
happiness,

1208
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,108
even if you have none.

1209
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:43,086
You never had it this good,
have you, 2093?

1210
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,464
No, I haven't
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1211
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,135
So you never want to go home,
huh?

1212
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,180
I don't have a home,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1213
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,851
What was that?

1214
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,812
I don't have a home.

1215
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,856
Can't afford one after tuition.

1216
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,941
Been living in my car
all this summer.

1217
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,705
Y'all, uh,

1218
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:22,292
y'all see how good you got it
now, don't you, huh?

1219
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,544
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

1220
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,004
Well, you best remember that

1221
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,839
when you're talking
to your visitors.

1222
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,064
Wait.

1223
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:47,150
Hey, um,
you guys should hear this.

1224
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,111
So this was taken
a couple of hours ago

1225
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,072
from the mic in cell two.

1226
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,740
I was talking to the big guard,

1227
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,451
and he told me
that they had him locked up

1228
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,954
in maximum security.

1229
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,580
No, that's bullshit, man.

1230
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,333
I'm telling you, he's at home.

1231
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,669
That breakdown
was some jive acting.

1232
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,921
- He'll be back.
- What makes you say that?

1233
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,339
Because we had a deal.

1234
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,256
When we tried to escape,

1235
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:13,593
he said if either of us
make it out,

1236
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:15,011
that‒that we'd come back

1237
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,430
and then bust
the rest of the guys out.

1238
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,851
Hey, Phil.

1239
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:22,894
Phil, it's time.

1240
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,688
The, uh... the visitors
are here.

1241
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,440
So...

1242
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,150
How are you holding up?

1243
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,193
I'm... I'm okay.

1244
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,820
You know, it's actually
not so bad

1245
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,822
if you just cooperate.

1246
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,991
But are you...

1247
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,368
cooperating?

1248
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,166
You're cooperating, right?

1249
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,503
Ever since I was stripped down,
bare naked, I have been.

1250
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,678
Yeah, 'cause, see, I got
most of the rules memorized,

1251
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:41,056
except for the...
I guess, the new ones we get

1252
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,140
at the guards' discretion.

1253
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,684
Tell him
the most important rule, 4325.

1254
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,936
The most important rule is
always obey the guards,

1255
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,146
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1256
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,189
Amen to that.

1257
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,609
Can they tell you
to do anything?

1258
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,569
Yeah.

1259
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,821
What right do they have
to do that?

1260
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,199
Well, the guards
run the prison.

1261
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,408
Well, aren't there
certain rights

1262
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,618
that they have
to respect, I mean...

1263
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,745
Well, prisoners have no rights.

1264
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,623
Well, I think
maybe they do.

1265
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,666
Not in this prison.

1266
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:14,589
H-how's the food?
Are they feeding you well?

1267
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,550
Yeah, three meals a day.

1268
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:18,927
You look exhausted.

1269
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,428
He looks fine.

1270
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:24,015
Probably just a little
too much time in the hole.

1271
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,934
W-what's the hole?

1272
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,979
I don't think you're supposed
to talk about the hole.

1273
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,523
Okay.

1274
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,900
If something isn't right,
you can let us know.

1275
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,319
You know that.

1276
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,029
No.
I-I...

1277
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,531
Everything's fine.

1278
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,532
Are you sure?

1279
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,950
Yeah, of course.

1280
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,743
Okay.

1281
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,078
We miss you.

1282
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,579
I miss you too.

1283
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,682
Drive safe. Thank you.

1284
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,727
Uh, Mr. Zimbardo,

1285
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,479
we don't mean
to make any trouble,

1286
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,232
but we're just a bit
concerned about our son.

1287
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,275
Okay.

1288
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,193
Well, what...
what...

1289
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,945
what seems to be
the problem?

1290
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,239
Honestly, he looks like
he hasn't slept in a week.

1291
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,323
Hmm.

1292
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,575
Is there anything wrong
with your boy?

1293
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,702
Does he...
does he sleep well?

1294
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:26,744
Normally, yes.

1295
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,413
I-I... that's what has me
so concerned.

1296
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,582
You know what? We are recreating
a prison environment here,

1297
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,749
and one of the ways
that we do that

1298
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,960
is by instituting
regular counts.

1299
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,713
Some of those counts take place
very late at night.

1300
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,673
So that may be it.

1301
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,883
Okay.

1302
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:40,925
To be honest,
Mrs. Mitchell,

1303
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,468
we're all very tired,

1304
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:45,013
but everybody else seems to be
handling it pretty well,

1305
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,806
and...

1306
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,100
I don't know.

1307
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,895
Your son seems to be
a pretty tough kid.

1308
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,104
Do you think
he can handle it?

1309
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,647
Of course, he can.

1310
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:55,857
He is a tough kid.

1311
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,777
My wife's just being
overprotective.

1312
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,613
- It's her nature.
- No, I understand.

1313
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,823
We've wasted enough
of the man's time.

1314
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:06,284
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Zimbardo.

1315
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,245
You're welcome.
It's Doctor.

1316
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:11,623
Doctor.

1317
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,380
- Hey.
- Okay.

1318
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,925
I think we're gonna double up
on security tonight.

1319
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:23,968
Right?

1320
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,428
Uh...

1321
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:27,513
Guys, 8612.

1322
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,141
You heard the tape.

1323
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:33,061
He wants to come back, break
the other prisoners out, okay?

1324
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,688
Right, he wants to play a little
cat and mouse game, that's fine.

1325
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,232
I'll play a little
cat and mouse game with him,

1326
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,108
but I'm not gonna let him
screw up our work.

1327
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:41,945
I'm gonna personally
sit guard myself tonight.

1328
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,905
Phil, you know, we actually
were just talking...

1329
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,199
that it might be a good idea for
you to get some rest tonight.

1330
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,284
No, a good idea right now
is to keep our prison safe.

1331
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:50,328
I expect you guys to be a little
bit sharper than this, okay?

1332
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,996
Are we on the same page?
Can we be on the same page?

1333
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,039
- Sure.
- Yeah.

1334
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,666
Right? All right.

1335
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,146
Phil?

1336
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:19,983
Yes. Hi, Jim.

1337
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,151
What are you...
What are you doing down here?

1338
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,487
Picking up
some summer reading.

1339
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:27,657
And you?
It's quite the late hour.

1340
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:31,828
I'm actually waiting for
one of my subjects to arrive.

1341
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:34,372
- Ah, your prison study.
- Mm.

1342
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,876
I saw some of your boys earlier
in the hallway.

1343
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:41,462
It's a frightful sight.

1344
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,881
Just following protocol.

1345
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,676
Mm.

1346
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:47,844
Well, I would love to...

1347
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,137
to sit and chat
with you, Jim,

1348
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,806
but I'm actually in the middle
of it right now.

1349
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,933
Oh.
Certainly.

1350
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,102
- We'll catch up later.
- Yes.

1351
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:01,024
Something I'm curious about,
Philip.

1352
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,736
What's the independent variable
in your study?

1353
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,532
I'm sorry?

1354
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,076
Have you introduced
a variable

1355
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,954
that might influence
your outcome?

1356
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,289
This is an experiment, right?

1357
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,458
Not just a simulation.

1358
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:22,295
Are you challenging me,
Jim?

1359
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,922
No, I'm not challenging.
I just...

1360
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:26,382
Well, while I would love
to sit here and

1361
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:27,675
explain my prison to you,

1362
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,093
I actually have
more pressing matters

1363
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,803
than whether or not you
understand the academics

1364
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,513
of my work.

1365
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,725
Sorry to bother you.

1366
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,022
I'll see you again
when the semester begins.

1367
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,909
- Hey.
- Hey.

1368
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,661
Looks like 8612
is a no-show for tonight.

1369
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,705
Let's get Kyle and Vogel
and meet in the conference room.

1370
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,582
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

1371
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,709
but Kyle's gone.

1372
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:03,795
Gone?

1373
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,254
What the fuck do you mean,
gone?

1374
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:06,923
I mean, gone, gone.

1375
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,175
He, uh... he had a death
in the family.

1376
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,135
Jesus Christ.

1377
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:12,845
I mean, I'm sorry,
but, fuck,

1378
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,639
this could not have come
at a worse time.

1379
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,409
He didn't come.

1380
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,372
It's been days since he got out,
and he didn't come.

1381
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,207
Hasn't even been a day yet.

1382
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,708
That's not true.

1383
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,002
It's been at least two.

1384
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:46,045
No.

1385
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,839
No way.

1386
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:49,924
Oh, fuck.

1387
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,467
How are we even
supposed to know?

1388
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:54,637
He told us
he would come get us.

1389
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:56,556
Yeah, well,

1390
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,933
he also started to think
that all this was real.

1391
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,102
Isn't it?

1392
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,230
Hey, man. Hey.

1393
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,357
You got to pull it together,
all right?

1394
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,942
We've only got another week
in here.

1395
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,360
Another week?

1396
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,822
We're not even gonna last
another night.

1397
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:17,118
They've taken our clothes;
they've taken our beds.

1398
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,455
They don't even do that
in real prisons.

1399
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:22,707
They do.

1400
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:27,044
All right. Come on.

1401
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,088
Mealtime.
Let's go.

1402
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,300
Come on. Let's go.

1403
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,846
Come on.

1404
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,435
Come on, 819.

1405
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,604
It's mealtime.

1406
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,901
Do we have a problem here?

1407
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,740
I want to see a doctor.

1408
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,325
See if you can find one
in there.

1409
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,769
Ah!

1410
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,107
What's going on in there?

1411
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:32,944
Ah!

1412
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,035
What's your name, son?

1413
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,246
I'm 4325, sir.

1414
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,332
So how are you holding up?

1415
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,168
Not too bad, considering,
sir.

1416
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:55,424
Um, sorry, Father.
What are you doing here?

1417
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:58,219
I'm here to provide
guidance and counsel

1418
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,888
to the prisoners
in this jail.

1419
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,224
So what measures
are you taking

1420
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,725
to get out of prison?

1421
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,437
I'm not...

1422
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:11,107
entirely sure
if I understand the question.

1423
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,692
Has bail been set
in your case yet?

1424
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,527
If it has, sir,
I'm unaware of it.

1425
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,571
All right,
what about counsel?

1426
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,947
Do you have a lawyer?

1427
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,741
No.

1428
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:25,496
I wasn't aware that I was,
um,

1429
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:27,206
supposed to...

1430
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,667
Do I need a lawyer?

1431
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,419
Well, son, just how
do you suppose

1432
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,129
you're ever going to get out
of here without one?

1433
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,171
Wha...

1434
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:36,424
Why‒why would I need a lawyer
for an experiment?

1435
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,635
Well, I don't know what
experiment you're referring to,

1436
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:42,888
but you've got to take control
of your situation here, son.

1437
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:45,099
Take control of your life.

1438
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,394
Uh...

1439
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:51,188
Come on, 819,
you're the last one up, buddy.

1440
01:16:58,697 --> 01:16:59,864
Yeah, sit down.

1441
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,787
All right, let's start
with your name, son.

1442
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:07,788
What's your name?

1443
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,462
8‒819?

1444
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,380
It's not a trick question,
son.

1445
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,845
It's 819.

1446
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:24,388
And what steps
are you taking

1447
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:26,349
to secure your release?

1448
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:29,852
I'm sorry.

1449
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,188
What‒what steps am I...
am I what?

1450
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,814
It's a simple question, son.

1451
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,358
I don't know why
you're asking me this.

1452
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,026
I don't know what
any of this means.

1453
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,612
I didn't know I had to take
steps to secure my release.

1454
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:40,905
I don't know what
you're talking about!

1455
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:41,947
Calm down, son.

1456
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:43,491
Have you spoken
to your lawyer?

1457
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,784
My lawyer?

1458
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,410
I have an uncle
who's a lawyer.

1459
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:47,787
I could call him,
but I don't...

1460
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,080
That sounds like
a good start.

1461
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,706
All right, all right,
just calm down.

1462
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:51,957
Every‒everything's
gonna be fine.

1463
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,958
- Take a deep breath.
- No, look, I'm sorry, but...

1464
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:57,380
Can I just see a doctor
or call my parents?

1465
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,507
I just need a little help
right now, and I...

1466
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,925
Please, can I just see
a doctor or something?

1467
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,301
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

1468
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:04,720
Hey, everything's
gonna be all right.

1469
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:05,805
Listen,
what I'm gonna do is,

1470
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,098
we're gonna clear out
of this room,

1471
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,016
get a nice meal
brought in here.

1472
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,267
If you're still feeling
bad this afternoon,

1473
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:11,560
we'll call a doctor, okay?

1474
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:17,650
Okay, so I'm assuming

1475
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,111
that you've all seen
and heard the mess

1476
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:23,781
that your fellow prisoner has
created for us this afternoon.

1477
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:27,034
So I want you all
to say now,

1478
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,661
after me,

1479
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:32,248
"Prisoner 819
did a bad thing."

1480
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,293
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1481
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:38,379
Okay, that's great,
but I said loudly enough

1482
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,297
so that he can hear you.

1483
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:41,549
20 times.

1484
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,259
Let's go.

1485
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,303
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1486
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:48,931
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1487
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:52,143
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1488
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:53,894
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1489
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,521
Well, uh, thanks again,
Father.

1490
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,106
I think it really did
make a difference.

1491
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:59,108
- It's my pleasure.
- Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1492
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,776
What you're doing here,
it's a good thing.

1493
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:02,194
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1494
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:04,864
It'll teach these boys of
privilege what a prison is.

1495
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,158
They should know.

1496
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,702
I couldn't agree
with you more.

1497
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,413
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1498
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:16,250
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1499
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,295
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1500
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:22,131
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1501
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:25,092
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1502
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,803
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1503
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:30,765
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1504
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,684
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1505
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:36,103
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1506
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:40,107
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1507
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,525
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1508
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:42,860
Hey, Phil.

1509
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,195
I'm really worried
about 819.

1510
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,197
- He's calling a lawyer.
- Who?

1511
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,531
The priest.

1512
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,116
I don't trust that man.

1513
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,868
They can shut
this whole place down.

1514
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,411
I don't think so.

1515
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:53,704
He wasn't here ten minutes,

1516
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,414
and he became
part of the experiment.

1517
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:56,624
Even if he did call a lawyer,

1518
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,083
why should that
be any different?

1519
01:19:58,084 --> 01:19:59,335
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

1520
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,086
No!

1521
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:04,465
- Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.
- No, I didn't!

1522
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,926
- Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.
- No!

1523
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,014
Just stay here.
Let me handle this.

1524
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:22,149
Hey, Peter?

1525
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,484
They think I'm
a bad prisoner,

1526
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,486
but I'm not,
I swear I'm not.

1527
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,862
Hey. Hey.

1528
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:28,948
You're not even
a prisoner at all.

1529
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,576
And that's not a prison.

1530
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,579
It's a hallway...

1531
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,042
With a bunch
of empty offices

1532
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:42,253
in the basement
of Jordan Hall.

1533
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:53,347
You're free to go.

1534
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,890
Okay?

1535
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,228
All you have to do is sign
a couple of release papers.

1536
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,021
All right?

1537
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:05,317
Jesus, Phil,
why did you do that?

1538
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:06,819
Hey, he was a lost cause.

1539
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:07,945
I had to say something.

1540
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,196
All this talk
about lawyers...

1541
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,739
I can't afford
any more liabilities.

1542
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,949
I'm not letting anything
get in the way

1543
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,075
of the progress
that we made...

1544
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:14,493
I know.
I understand that.

1545
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:16,203
And will you make sure that
he takes him to Student Health

1546
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:17,454
and gets him checked out?

1547
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:18,747
Yeah.

1548
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:20,541
Hey, did you find
a replacement for 8612?

1549
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,042
I'm trying.
It's not that easy.

1550
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,210
There's not that many people
left on campus.

1551
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,920
Well, get on it!

1552
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:52,656
Phil?

1553
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:56,660
- Oh, ah.
- Hi.

1554
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,121
Hi. Oh.

1555
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,456
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

1556
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:03,709
So this is it?

1557
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,210
Well, it's quiet right now,

1558
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:08,547
but it... it has been
truly extraordinary

1559
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:11,258
the way these boys
have adapted.

1560
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,595
It's significant.

1561
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:17,222
It'll get better
later tonight.

1562
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,850
Well, you're gonna have me
around for a while.

1563
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,226
I heard about Kyle.

1564
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:25,564
So I'm volunteering to take
his place on the parole board.

1565
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:26,857
That's fantastic.

1566
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:30,235
Now you'll get to see
what it's really like.

1567
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:32,571
Like a chimp.

1568
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:35,157
And then the chimp
raped the woman.

1569
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:37,368
- And she had a baby that...
- You're a liar, man.

1570
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,535
No, no, I swear. I swear.

1571
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:40,829
Literally, every story you tell
is a bullshit lie.

1572
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,247
I'm fucking serious.

1573
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:44,541
And the baby was half chimp
and half human.

1574
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:46,710
It had, like, sideburns
and shit, like those.

1575
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,337
- I'm fucking serious.

1576
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,965
Hey, let's go, new guy, eat up.

1577
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,883
No thank you,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1578
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,889
Well, that is not
an option, 416.

1579
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,809
Well, I'm sorry
you think that, sir.

1580
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,978
You're sorry...

1581
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:09,149
Bring me his plate.

1582
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:16,323
How about you pick up
those sausages, boy?

1583
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,413
Now,

1584
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:24,832
you will not leave
this closet

1585
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,711
until those sausages
are in your belly.

1586
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:29,753
Got me?

1587
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,848
I believe the correctional staff

1588
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:44,685
has convinced me
of my many weaknesses.

1589
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,854
Despite my horrible disrespect
for them,

1590
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,064
the staff has treated me well.

1591
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:54,111
I now know that every member
of the correctional staff

1592
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:57,948
is only interested in
the well-being of the prisoners.

1593
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,535
And I believe that
because of their goodness,

1594
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:04,455
I have been rehabilitated
and transformed

1595
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,457
into a better human being.

1596
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:10,169
On a personal note,
the prisoner adds,

1597
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,588
I will turn 23 on Monday.

1598
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,507
This being my last year
at Stanford,

1599
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:17,092
I would like to be paroled

1600
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:19,678
so that I may spend one more
birthday with my old friends.

1601
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,181
Sincerely, 1037.

1602
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,518
From your request,
it sounds like

1603
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:29,063
you're very happy
with your setup here.

1604
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,814
Why do you want parole?

1605
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:35,903
Well, as I stated
in the request,

1606
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,321
it's my 23rd birthday on...

1607
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,615
Don't you think
the prison staff is capable

1608
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:41,658
of giving you
a birthday party?

1609
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:43,786
Yes.

1610
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:47,372
But for sentimental reasons,
I would rather spend...

1611
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:50,125
You should have thought about
that before you broke the law.

1612
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,127
Sir?

1613
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:55,422
Why are you in prison,
1037?

1614
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:58,675
I was charged with assault
with a deadly weapon.

1615
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,219
How do you plead?

1616
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,220
Not guilty.

1617
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:04,348
Not guilty?
Not guilty?

1618
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,225
So you're saying that the police
officers who arrested you

1619
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:07,309
didn't know what
they were doing,

1620
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,937
that they...
that there was a mistake,

1621
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,022
that there was some confusion,
that there...

1622
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:14,024
- No, sir.
- I'm not done speaking.

1623
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:15,651
They're lying,
is that what your saying?

1624
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:16,693
They're lying?

1625
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,864
Well, I haven't seen
any evidence,

1626
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:24,535
but I'm sure it's probably good
if they picked me up for it.

1627
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:28,247
Then you admit
there is some merit

1628
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,415
to the charges against you.

1629
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:32,000
Yes.

1630
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:35,879
There probably is some merit

1631
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,756
in what they're saying.

1632
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:38,924
Yes.

1633
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,134
You do recognize

1634
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,678
that prisons are
for people who break rules,

1635
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:45,764
and you put your freedom
in jeopardy

1636
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,475
doing exactly
which you did.

1637
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:53,856
Yes, and I realize that now,
and I...

1638
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,024
I find it hard to take
the word of a young man

1639
01:25:56,025 --> 01:26:00,154
with such a checkered
history with the law.

1640
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,322
What kind of citizen

1641
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,908
do you think you can be
with these kinds of charges?

1642
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:08,871
I don't understand
the question, sir.

1643
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,664
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you don't understand.

1644
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:13,375
1965, you were picked up
and later released

1645
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,961
on suspicion of car theft.

1646
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:19,089
1969, you were picked up
and later released

1647
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:23,677
for lack of evidence at a place
where narcotics were found.

1648
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,429
1970,

1649
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,265
you were arrested
for passing bad checks.

1650
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:30,767
Now, you tell us that
you can make it out there,

1651
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:33,103
but your behavior
don't reflect it,

1652
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:36,023
nor do your behavior
reflect it here.

1653
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:39,526
Now, I think

1654
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:43,071
that you're destined
to be prison scum.

1655
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:49,453
I understand that, sir.

1656
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:52,331
You believe in God?

1657
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,542
Yes, sir, I do.

1658
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,503
Why is that?

1659
01:26:58,504 --> 01:27:00,797
Well, because that's just
what I was taught, and...

1660
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:05,385
You were also taught that
assault is against the law.

1661
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:09,681
Or do you think it's legitimate
to go around hurting people?

1662
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:11,725
No, sir. I do not.

1663
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:17,356
But you stated
in your own handwriting,

1664
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:22,319
"My horrible disrespect
for them."

1665
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,821
Horrible...

1666
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:25,948
disrespect.

1667
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,951
That's hurtful,
is it not?

1668
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:34,414
1037, is it not?

1669
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:35,457
Yes, sir, it is.

1670
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:38,293
And what do you think
would happen

1671
01:27:38,294 --> 01:27:40,337
if everybody in this nation

1672
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:43,590
disrespected
everyone else's person, huh?

1673
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:46,134
I don't know.
I really don't know.

1674
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:47,970
You sicken me.

1675
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:51,139
1037, you sicken me.

1676
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,432
And to be honest,

1677
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:56,061
I wouldn't parole you
if you were the last man here.

1678
01:27:56,062 --> 01:28:00,524
You are the least likely
candidate for parole

1679
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:01,650
that we've seen.

1680
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:03,235
Now, how do you feel
about that?

1681
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,990
Well, I think that you're
entitled to your opinion.

1682
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,075
Well, my opinion
means something

1683
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:11,702
in this particular place.

1684
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,372
I think we've heard enough.

1685
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:16,832
You can take him away.

1686
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:23,880
I have one more question
for you,

1687
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:26,591
1037.

1688
01:28:26,592 --> 01:28:28,260
Since you've been here,

1689
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,886
you've been performing
your duties

1690
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:32,389
and accruing a certain salary?

1691
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,892
Tell me,
would you forfeit your pay

1692
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:37,561
in exchange for parole?

1693
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:40,939
Yes, ma'am, I would,
without a doubt.

1694
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:53,452
Do we let anyone go?

1695
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:56,830
Well, 1037 looks
ready to break.

1696
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:58,081
Yeah,

1697
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:59,458
but is that a reason
to parole a man?

1698
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,043
If we let somebody go,

1699
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,627
they're all gonna think
they can just talk their way

1700
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,046
out of here.

1701
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:07,674
Am I right, Jesse?

1702
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:12,346
I was just trying to do it
exactly how I was treated.

1703
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,848
Completely...

1704
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:17,642
reenact what they did...

1705
01:29:17,643 --> 01:29:19,353
their feelings,
their attitudes,

1706
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,563
their indifference.

1707
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,442
They...

1708
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:37,454
What are...

1709
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:38,538
Jesse, wait.

1710
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:39,748
Hey, where you going?

1711
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:40,791
You know what?

1712
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:42,209
It was an experiment,

1713
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,585
and I went along with it,

1714
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:45,045
but I really hate myself
right now.

1715
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,547
You did nothing wrong.

1716
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:49,549
That was just protocol.

1717
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,218
Protocol?

1718
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,011
Back in that room,
I became everything I've hated

1719
01:29:53,012 --> 01:29:54,346
for so long,

1720
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,640
and I let it happen.

1721
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:59,393
And I enjoyed it.

1722
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,520
You can't possibly understand
how it makes me feel.

1723
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:02,979
Hey.

1724
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:05,148
No.

1725
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:12,656
I need you to stay.

1726
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:18,620
Parole 1037 for me,
please.

1727
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,000
Sure.

1728
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:25,836
Thank you.

1729
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:46,690
Phil...

1730
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,234
Oh, no, no.
Don't, don't.

1731
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:16,052
What is happening here,
Mike?

1732
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,391
Is this thing over?

1733
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,648
We have become part
of this experiment,

1734
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,359
whether we like it or not,

1735
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,611
and frankly,
I don't even think

1736
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,489
that we can call this
an experiment anymore.

1737
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:39,910
It's a demonstration,
and...

1738
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,995
part of me thinks
that we already

1739
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,748
have the results
that we were looking for.

1740
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:47,876
- Mike...
- No, I...

1741
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:49,252
I wanted to say that to you

1742
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:50,462
the last day or two,

1743
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,423
but I was afraid
to question you.

1744
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:56,384
You know, I suppose that
if I didn't admire you so much,

1745
01:31:56,385 --> 01:31:59,262
um... I...

1746
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:01,598
I don't know.

1747
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:07,562
And now?

1748
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:11,566
After seeing what this place
has done to us,

1749
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:14,486
to 1037,
to 8612,

1750
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:17,280
to Jesse,

1751
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:20,033
now I realize

1752
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:22,994
that you have
to see this through.

1753
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,421
I think, uh...

1754
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,681
- This could be great.
- Yeah.

1755
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:51,398
I had no idea
it would turn out this way.

1756
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:55,193
But...

1757
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,031
This is important...

1758
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,870
To me.

1759
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,501
But the results
are important.

1760
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:15,672
They are.

1761
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,390
Parole him.

1762
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:54,628
Good evening, gentlemen.

1763
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,671
How about we make this one
a night to remember?

1764
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:01,009
You mean to tell me
that you spent all day long

1765
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,136
in that stinking hole
because you wouldn't eat

1766
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,305
two lousy, little sausages?

1767
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,474
God damn, boy.

1768
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,309
Well, maybe you want us
to take them sausages

1769
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,769
and cram 'em
up your ass, huh?

1770
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,854
Bet you like that,
416, won't you?

1771
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,273
Just 'cause you
have no friends

1772
01:34:15,274 --> 01:34:18,693
doesn't mean you have to make
everyone else suffer, 416.

1773
01:34:20,696 --> 01:34:22,656
New guy,

1774
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:24,157
look at me.

1775
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:25,700
There you go.

1776
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:28,328
The hell is your problem,
boy, huh?

1777
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,205
My problem is that
the guards

1778
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:32,082
and the people
running this experiment

1779
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,876
are not treating the prisoners
like human beings.

1780
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:39,673
The hell has that got to do
with sausages, huh?

1781
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,593
The guards and the experimenters
are clearly in...

1782
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,346
You address me

1783
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:50,725
as Mr. Correctional Officer.

1784
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:53,436
Mr. Correctional Officer,
the guard and the experimenters

1785
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:54,938
are clearly in violation
of the rules set up

1786
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,314
for this experiment,

1787
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:59,359
and I refuse to endorse
an unfair system.

1788
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,279
What did you
expect, boy?

1789
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,906
Huh?

1790
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:06,574
What the fuck
did you expect?

1791
01:35:06,575 --> 01:35:09,536
Did you expect this to be
a fucking nursery school?

1792
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:10,620
Huh?

1793
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:12,664
Is that what you thought
this was gonna be?

1794
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,751
You thought you were gonna get
some playtime in the yard, boy?

1795
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:19,629
You thought you could
go around breaking the law

1796
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:22,048
and wind up in
a fucking nursery school?

1797
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:25,135
You listen to me, 416!

1798
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:28,096
You ain't going nowhere
but this fucking hole

1799
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:30,640
until you eat
those fucking sausages!

1800
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:33,059
Do you fucking
hear me, boy?

1801
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:45,363
Now, trust that
your fellow prisoner

1802
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:48,783
will not stick his wee-wee
in your asshole

1803
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:53,246
as you march to the restroom
to relieve yourselves.

1804
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,206
Go on, now.

1805
01:35:55,207 --> 01:35:57,751
March.
Right, left, right.

1806
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,335
You know how it's done.

1807
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:03,047
Come on, you miserable
sons of bitches.

1808
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:04,591
It's time
to shit and piss.

1809
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,469
That means...
Go, go on.

1810
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:16,394
It's incredible,
isn't it?

1811
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:28,239
Hey, hey.

1812
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,040
Wait just a...
Will you wait a second, please?

1813
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:32,786
What is it?

1814
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:34,996
What is wrong?

1815
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:36,039
What's wrong?

1816
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,249
You're a psychologist,
for Christ sake,

1817
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:39,626
and you're asking me,
"What's wrong?"

1818
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,044
You're missing
the bigger picture.

1819
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,755
This study has the potential
to help people.

1820
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:45,381
Yes, felons, maybe,

1821
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:47,008
but those are kids,

1822
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:49,761
kids who have never committed
a crime in their lives.

1823
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,054
Kids who volunteered,

1824
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:52,514
kids who are being
paid money,

1825
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:53,723
kids who can leave
whenever they want to...

1826
01:36:53,724 --> 01:36:55,183
They tried.

1827
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:57,519
Every single one of them
came to your parole board

1828
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,187
and all but begged,

1829
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:00,730
and I was sitting there,
going,

1830
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:02,273
"What's wrong
with these kids?

1831
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:03,775
"Why don't they just quit?

1832
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,318
"What are they
trying to prove?

1833
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:07,237
What are they
so afraid of?"

1834
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,655
It's you.

1835
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:11,157
They are afraid of you.

1836
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:15,119
That is absolute nonsense.

1837
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,788
You're not looking at this
like a psychologist.

1838
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,206
No, I'm a human being,
Phil.

1839
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:19,791
I have empathy
for other human beings.

1840
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:21,292
Well, you're not gonna
cut it in this field

1841
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:24,462
if you're gonna get so emotional
over some basic procedure.

1842
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:31,261
Hey.
Hey, look.

1843
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,390
You...

1844
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,850
of all people,

1845
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,310
I thought would understand

1846
01:37:39,311 --> 01:37:41,354
what I have tapped into
in my prison.

1847
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,523
Your prison?

1848
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:45,733
Oh, my God.

1849
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:48,236
You are so in
over your head.

1850
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:52,323
Those are not prisoners.

1851
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:53,950
Those are not subjects.

1852
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,493
They're not students.

1853
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:58,288
Those are boys, Phil.

1854
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:01,332
Those are boys,
and you are harming them.

1855
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:04,168
You need to fix this...

1856
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:05,962
now.

1857
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:09,173
Wow.

1858
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:10,800
Are you finished?

1859
01:38:36,702 --> 01:38:39,287
Did I see you smile, 2093?

1860
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:42,040
I don't think so,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1861
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,666
What, you didn't think
it was funny?

1862
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:46,836
I think that it could be funny,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1863
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:48,171
Then why didn't you smile?

1864
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:49,547
Because I am not supposed
to smile during...

1865
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:50,882
That's right!

1866
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,801
They're getting it now.

1867
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,720
5704, what the hell
are you doing

1868
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,121
with that chair
over your head, boy?

1869
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,474
I don't know,
Mr. Correctional Officer...

1870
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:00,850
Well, if you don't know,
put it on down.

1871
01:39:00,851 --> 01:39:02,477
You standing there,
wasting all your energy.

1872
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:03,978
You like it in there, 416?

1873
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:05,521
Not at all,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1874
01:39:05,522 --> 01:39:06,898
Tough shit.

1875
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:12,278
7258,

1876
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:14,238
since you already have
your hands over your head,

1877
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:16,491
why don't you play Frankenstein?

1878
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:23,498
2093 can play
the Bride of Frankenstein.

1879
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:26,793
7258,

1880
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:28,378
stand here.

1881
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,713
Walk over like Frankenstein

1882
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:33,675
and say that you love 2093.

1883
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,392
That's not how
Frankenstein walks.

1884
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:44,185
Have you seen Frankenstein,
7258?

1885
01:39:44,186 --> 01:39:45,436
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

1886
01:39:45,437 --> 01:39:48,022
So walk like fucking
Frankenstein.

1887
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,362
Go on.

1888
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:56,114
I love you, 2093‒

1889
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:57,240
Get close.

1890
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,329
Boy, you better get
a whole lot closer than that.

1891
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,667
Get close.

1892
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,002
Yeah, there you go.

1893
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:17,301
I love you, 2093.

1894
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:18,344
Mm-hmm.

1895
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:20,471
Get the fuck back in line.

1896
01:40:20,472 --> 01:40:22,265
Quit crying
like a little bitch.

1897
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:27,395
Why are you such
an ass-licker, 2093, huh?

1898
01:40:28,605 --> 01:40:30,565
I don't know,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1899
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,442
You don't know.

1900
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:35,194
Why is it that you try
to be obedient so much?

1901
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:38,614
It's in my nature
to be obedient,

1902
01:40:38,615 --> 01:40:39,657
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1903
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:42,285
It's a fucking embarrassment
how obedient this guy is.

1904
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:44,620
You little brownnose,
kiss-ass homeless boy,

1905
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:46,831
always doing
what you're told.

1906
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:48,583
What if I told you
to get down on the floor

1907
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:50,043
and fuck the floor, huh?

1908
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,252
What would you do then?

1909
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:53,838
I would tell you
that I didn't know how,

1910
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:55,631
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1911
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:59,177
Uh-huh.

1912
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,431
Don't you go anywhere,
okay?

1913
01:41:06,351 --> 01:41:08,352
Let's wake up our friend here.

1914
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:17,070
Now, I want y'all to take
a really good look at this man,

1915
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:20,907
because this man here

1916
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,950
did not eat his sausages.

1917
01:41:25,287 --> 01:41:27,038
Now, 2093,

1918
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:29,040
come on over here.

1919
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:31,042
Tell 416 you're gonna
kick his ass.

1920
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:35,254
I'm sorry, sir,
but I object.

1921
01:41:43,806 --> 01:41:46,974
And just what
do you object to?

1922
01:41:46,975 --> 01:41:49,894
I object to the word that you
used, Mr. Correctional Officer.

1923
01:41:54,566 --> 01:41:56,734
The fuck word are you
talking about, boy?

1924
01:41:56,735 --> 01:41:58,820
I'm sorry, sir.
I cannot say the word.

1925
01:42:00,405 --> 01:42:02,573
Ass.

1926
01:42:02,574 --> 01:42:05,326
He doesn't want to say "ass."

1927
01:42:05,327 --> 01:42:06,994
Well, I gave you an order.

1928
01:42:06,995 --> 01:42:09,288
Now you get over there
and tell him

1929
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:10,873
right now.

1930
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:12,458
I'm sorry, sir.

1931
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:14,669
I'm unable to do that.

1932
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:25,471
Well, well, well,
well, well.

1933
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:29,684
Our little Mr. Obediency
has a sore spot

1934
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:31,352
for bad little words.

1935
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:34,021
Just tell him that you'll
kick him in the end.

1936
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,691
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

1937
01:42:37,901 --> 01:42:39,277
Eat your sausages, 416,

1938
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:40,862
or I will kick you
in the end.

1939
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:43,281
There you go.
He said it.

1940
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:47,368
No, he said it,

1941
01:42:47,369 --> 01:42:50,830
but did you mean it,
2093, huh?

1942
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:52,039
Yes. No.

1943
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,332
No, no, I'm sorry.

1944
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:54,375
No, I did not.
I didn't mean it.

1945
01:42:54,376 --> 01:42:55,585
So why are you lying?

1946
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:57,295
I said what Mr. Correctional
Officer told me to say, sir.

1947
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:58,337
That's bullshit.

1948
01:42:58,338 --> 01:42:59,463
He didn't tell you to lie,
now, did he?

1949
01:42:59,464 --> 01:43:02,717
Nobody wants any lying
in here, 2093.

1950
01:43:02,718 --> 01:43:03,968
Okay?

1951
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:08,723
Why is it that all of y'all

1952
01:43:08,724 --> 01:43:11,267
are a big load of liars,
huh?

1953
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,103
Huh?

1954
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:18,024
- I don't know.
- Huh.

1955
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:19,567
I guess we're just
a bunch of bastards,

1956
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:22,403
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1957
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:27,825
Uh-huh.
I like that.

1958
01:43:33,248 --> 01:43:34,957
Come on out here.

1959
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:39,086
So are you a bastard,
too, 2093?

1960
01:43:39,087 --> 01:43:40,755
If you say so,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1961
01:43:40,756 --> 01:43:42,340
I say so...
I want to hear you say it.

1962
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:43,758
I'm sorry, sir.

1963
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,259
I object
to the use of profanity,

1964
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,677
and I will not say it.

1965
01:43:46,678 --> 01:43:49,972
You said couldn't say that about
another human being, 2093?

1966
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:51,307
Can you say it to yourself?

1967
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:52,350
- Hmm?
- Uh?

1968
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:53,559
I wouldn't think of
saying it to myself

1969
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,894
because then I would
be saying that I would...

1970
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:56,229
That you'd be a bastard.

1971
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,855
- Right?
- No, sir.

1972
01:43:57,856 --> 01:43:59,857
- Yes, you would.
- Yes. Yes.

1973
01:43:59,858 --> 01:44:00,900
What would you be?

1974
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:02,360
Would you be a bastard?

1975
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:04,237
You'd be saying nasty things
about your mother,

1976
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:05,571
that's what you'd be doing.

1977
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:07,949
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

1978
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,450
Why the hell won't you say it?

1979
01:44:09,451 --> 01:44:12,370
Because I do not use
any profane language,

1980
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:13,496
Mr. Correctional Officer...

1981
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:15,206
Are you a fucking saint?

1982
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:20,836
It's real easy.
Just tell me what you are.

1983
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:24,173
I am whatever you wish me to be,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

1984
01:44:24,174 --> 01:44:25,549
Oh!

1985
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:26,550
Well, you know what?

1986
01:44:26,551 --> 01:44:29,262
If you won't say it...

1987
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:30,680
If you won't say
that you're a bastard,

1988
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:32,306
you want to know
something, 2093?

1989
01:44:32,307 --> 01:44:33,307
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

1990
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:35,017
You just proved my point.

1991
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:37,311
You a bastard.

1992
01:44:37,312 --> 01:44:38,980
You a bastard either way.

1993
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:41,107
Isn't that right?

1994
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:42,149
If you say so,
Mr. Correctional...

1995
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:43,442
I do say so!

1996
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:45,903
I want to hear you say it,
god damn it!

1997
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:51,742
I'm sorry.

1998
01:44:51,743 --> 01:44:53,327
I won't say it.

1999
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,832
Boys,

2000
01:44:57,833 --> 01:44:59,792
I'm sure you want to get a real
good night's sleep tonight.

2001
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:01,335
Am I right?

2002
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:03,129
Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer.

2003
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,840
Well, I think we're
gonna have to wait.

2004
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:11,262
Let 2093 think about just
what a bastard he really is,

2005
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:14,265
and then maybe he'll tell the
rest of us that he thinks so.

2006
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:15,933
May I have a cigarette,
please?

2007
01:45:21,606 --> 01:45:25,192
At this rate, we gonna be here
all goddamn night.

2008
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:28,738
And I love it.

2009
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:41,167
I think you're
perfectly accurate

2010
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,711
in your condemnation of me,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

2011
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:49,175
Oh, I know that.

2012
01:45:50,635 --> 01:45:52,636
But I shouldn't say the word.

2013
01:45:57,893 --> 01:45:59,894
Say what word?

2014
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:10,112
I shall not say with any meaning
the word "bastard."

2015
01:46:10,113 --> 01:46:12,490
Holy shit.

2016
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:16,619
He said it.

2017
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,662
Well, glory be.

2018
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,665
I do believe he did.

2019
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:26,754
I think we got a winner.
Chicken dinner.

2020
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:29,215
We might even get
to bed early, boys.

2021
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:30,758
Who knows?
Huh?

2022
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:37,556
Sweet relief.

2023
01:46:37,557 --> 01:46:39,809
Now, uh...

2024
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,644
2093, just for swearing,

2025
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:44,188
why don't you get on the floor
and give me ten push-ups?

2026
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:45,648
Thank you,
Mr. Correctional Officer.

2027
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,191
You're welcome, boy.

2028
01:46:49,444 --> 01:46:51,612
One, two...

2029
01:46:51,613 --> 01:46:53,781
- Three...
- Louder.

2030
01:46:53,782 --> 01:46:55,282
Four, five...

2031
01:46:55,283 --> 01:46:57,201
- Stop.
- Six.

2032
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:58,702
Those ain't no push-ups.

2033
01:46:58,703 --> 01:47:00,788
Start over.

2034
01:47:00,789 --> 01:47:03,874
One, two,
three...

2035
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:06,710
5704, you come over here.

2036
01:47:06,711 --> 01:47:08,629
Six, seven...

2037
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:10,297
You can sit on his back.

2038
01:47:10,298 --> 01:47:11,632
- Nine.
- Stop.

2039
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:12,800
Sit on his back.

2040
01:47:12,801 --> 01:47:15,136
Keep going, 2093.

2041
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:17,638
- Go on, boy!
- One!

2042
01:47:21,351 --> 01:47:22,393
You know what?

2043
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:26,897
4325, you come
over here too.

2044
01:47:26,898 --> 01:47:28,149
That's it.
Sit on his back.

2045
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:29,817
There you go.

2046
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:31,902
Now do a push-up, 2093,

2047
01:47:31,903 --> 01:47:33,446
and do not help him!

2048
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:39,410
One!

2049
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:48,961
Come on.

2050
01:47:48,962 --> 01:47:50,504
Get back
against the wall.

2051
01:47:52,382 --> 01:47:54,383
Big, tough guy, huh?

2052
01:47:54,384 --> 01:47:55,968
Can't even do one push-up.

2053
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:01,223
Yeah.

2054
01:48:17,616 --> 01:48:19,283
Okay?

2055
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,413
Now, Mr. 2093 here

2056
01:48:24,414 --> 01:48:27,500
says he ain't know
how to fuck.

2057
01:48:28,543 --> 01:48:30,669
We gonna show you.

2058
01:48:32,547 --> 01:48:34,423
Now, I want
my female camels...

2059
01:48:34,424 --> 01:48:36,926
- Line up.
- To line up in the middle.

2060
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:39,803
Shoulder to shoulder,
right beside one another.

2061
01:48:39,804 --> 01:48:41,263
- That's it. Right here.
- Like so.

2062
01:48:41,264 --> 01:48:42,306
That's right.

2063
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:43,766
And I want my male camels

2064
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,893
to get behind
the female camels.

2065
01:48:45,894 --> 01:48:48,687
- Bend down. Bend down.
- That's right. Come on, boys.

2066
01:48:48,688 --> 01:48:50,064
- Get down.
- What you doing, boy?

2067
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:51,357
Get on over here.

2068
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:55,069
And y'all gonna do like the male
camels do to the female camels,

2069
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,570
and y'all gonna hump them.

2070
01:48:56,571 --> 01:48:58,113
2093, pay attention.

2071
01:48:58,114 --> 01:49:00,241
You could afford to learn
a thing or two.

2072
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:01,450
- Come on.
- Now have at it, boys.

2073
01:49:01,451 --> 01:49:03,202
Went too deep. Come on.

2074
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:04,912
Got a lot of work to do now.

2075
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:06,830
Get inside her.
She's waiting for you.

2076
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:08,207
There.

2077
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:10,793
- Keep humping.
- Come on, that's it.

2078
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:13,420
Yeah, that's right.

2079
01:49:13,421 --> 01:49:15,548
Nice and gentle
with that camel, yeah.

2080
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,174
Good, keep her
in that low back end.

2081
01:49:17,175 --> 01:49:18,384
That's it.

2082
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:21,595
Open up that way.
Keep humping.

2083
01:49:21,596 --> 01:49:23,556
It's okay.
This one's gonna shed a few‒

2084
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:25,558
You know, uh, why don't you, uh,

2085
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:27,726
serenade your fellow inmates
to keep them in the mood?

2086
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:29,812
That's good. Come on.

2087
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:32,773
What would you like me to sing,
Mr. Correctional Officer?

2088
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:38,654

2109
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,194

Now I want all y'all to come up
to 416 and thank him.

2114
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:29,663
Thank you, 416, for singing
such a pretty song to us.

2115
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:32,583
Thank you, 416.

2116
01:50:32,584 --> 01:50:34,585
Oh, I think
you can do better than that.

2117
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:37,004
- Thank you, 416!
- There you go.

2118
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:38,172
Thank you, 416.

2119
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:40,090
Oh, I think you can
say it louder than that.

2120
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:41,425
Thank you, 416!

2121
01:50:41,426 --> 01:50:43,594
Yeah, say it
like you mean it now.

2122
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:44,720
Thank you, 416.

2123
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:47,264
From the bottom
of your heart now.

2124
01:50:47,265 --> 01:50:50,059
- Thank you, 416.
- Oh, yeah.

2125
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:52,478
Thank you, 416!

2126
01:50:54,105 --> 01:50:55,356
Thank you, 416.

2127
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:02,655
Thank you, 416.

2128
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:05,240
Thank you, 416.

2129
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:08,035
- Hey.
- Thank you, 416.

2130
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:10,371
Thank you, 416.

2131
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:11,413
Hey.

2132
01:51:12,457 --> 01:51:13,499
Thank you, 416.

2133
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,541
Hey!

2134
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:25,219
This experiment is...

2135
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:29,390
Over.

2136
01:51:36,272 --> 01:51:37,940
Did you hear what I said?

2137
01:51:42,153 --> 01:51:43,862
This exper...

2138
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:46,990
This experiment
is terminated

2139
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:49,159
from this point on.

2140
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:54,540
You...

2141
01:51:57,919 --> 01:52:02,297
The Stanford County Jail
is now closed.

2142
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:07,803
You're all free to leave.

2143
01:52:22,944 --> 01:52:25,112
So does this mean
we're not getting paid

2144
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:27,156
for the full two weeks?

2145
01:52:51,347 --> 01:52:53,390
I said to myself at
the beginning of the first day,

2146
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:57,060
"This could be a very long,
very boring experiment."

2147
01:52:57,061 --> 01:53:00,022
Uh, it wasn't conceivable.

2148
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:04,359
There was just no strong sense
of precedent

2149
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:06,653
for how far this thing could go.

2150
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:37,601
It's easy for you to say,

2151
01:53:37,602 --> 01:53:39,937
"Oh, I wouldn't have
acted that way."

2152
01:53:39,938 --> 01:53:41,939
But you don't know.

2153
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:44,233
That's... that's the truth.
You don't know.

2154
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:46,610
And now,
I know what I'm capable of,

2155
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:48,278
and it hurts.

2156
01:53:48,279 --> 01:53:50,656
That...

2157
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:52,199
I don't know... I don't know
how else to say it,

2158
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:55,285
but it does hurt me
to know that.

2159
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:05,045
You know, and I knew right away
it was wrong,

2160
01:54:05,046 --> 01:54:06,588
and I was the only one
that could see it.

2161
01:54:06,589 --> 01:54:08,799
You know, anyone could see it
except for these guys.

2162
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,883
You know, you give them
the uniform

2163
01:54:09,884 --> 01:54:11,051
with the glasses
and the nightstick,

2164
01:54:11,052 --> 01:54:12,636
and they simply
can't be the same person

2165
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:14,972
as if they wore street clothes.

2166
01:54:14,973 --> 01:54:16,932
Meanwhile, I'm just
a number in a dress.

2167
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:19,226
That's the thing; I wasn't
a prisoner in an experiment.

2168
01:54:19,227 --> 01:54:21,687
I was their prisoner.

2169
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:25,983
I really felt that
I was losing my identity,

2170
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:30,863
that this person
that I call Tom

2171
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:34,575
was disappearing.

2172
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:39,913
And it was a prison to me.

2173
01:54:39,914 --> 01:54:43,041
It still is a prison to me.

2174
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:46,169
You know, I don't look at it
as an experiment

2175
01:54:46,170 --> 01:54:47,921
or a simulation at all.

2176
01:54:47,922 --> 01:54:50,299
It was a prison
that was run by psychologists

2177
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:52,926
instead of by the state.

2178
01:54:52,927 --> 01:54:55,387
The consensus
is that they did suffer.

2179
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:02,060
But...

2180
01:55:03,104 --> 01:55:05,939
I think that

2181
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:08,525
they also learned a great deal
about themselves

2182
01:55:08,526 --> 01:55:10,611
and about human nature.

2183
01:55:10,612 --> 01:55:13,614
And I think most of them
would say

2184
01:55:13,615 --> 01:55:17,200
that in hindsight it was
a very valuable experience.

2185
01:55:43,353 --> 01:55:45,854
This whole experience harms me,

2186
01:55:45,855 --> 01:55:48,607
and I mean "harms"
in the present tense.

2187
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,484
- It harms me.
- How did it harm you?

2188
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:51,944
Or how does it
harm you?

2189
01:55:51,945 --> 01:55:53,779
Is it just to think that
people can be like that?

2190
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:54,947
Yeah.

2191
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:56,990
And I know
you're a nice guy.

2192
01:55:56,991 --> 01:55:58,533
You know?

2193
01:55:59,494 --> 01:56:00,535
Well, you don't know that.

2194
01:56:00,536 --> 01:56:01,703
No, I do.

2195
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:02,788
I do know that
you're a nice guy.

2196
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:03,997
Then why do you hate me?

2197
01:56:03,998 --> 01:56:05,832
Because I know what
you can turn into.

2198
01:56:07,168 --> 01:56:10,128
If you were in my position,
what would you have done?

2199
01:56:10,129 --> 01:56:12,005
I don't know.

2200
01:56:12,006 --> 01:56:13,674
I don't know.
I can't tell you that.

2201
01:56:13,675 --> 01:56:17,010
- I wasn't.
- Hmm.

2202
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:19,721
I don't think I would
have been as, uh...

2203
01:56:19,722 --> 01:56:21,848
I don't believe
I would have been

2204
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:24,851
as inventive as you.

2205
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:28,605
I don't think I would have
applied as much imagination

2206
01:56:28,606 --> 01:56:29,606
to what I was doing.

2207
01:56:29,607 --> 01:56:32,109
You understand?

2208
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:33,610
Yes.
I understand.

2209
01:56:33,611 --> 01:56:35,404
I would have been a guard.

2210
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:37,864
I don't think it would have
been such a masterpiece.

2211
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:45,038
Personally, I-I don't see
where it was really harmful.

2212
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:46,540
It was degrading,

2213
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:49,042
but that was part of
my particular

2214
01:56:49,043 --> 01:56:50,419
little experiment that...

2215
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,838
Oh, your particular
little experiments?

2216
01:56:52,839 --> 01:56:54,047
- Well, why...
- Yeah. Yeah.

2217
01:56:54,048 --> 01:56:56,008
Why don't you tell us
about those?

2218
01:56:56,009 --> 01:56:58,510
Yes, I was running
experiments of my own.

2219
01:56:58,511 --> 01:57:00,804
Well, tell me about
these little experiments.

2220
01:57:00,805 --> 01:57:02,222
- I'm curious.
- Okay.

2221
01:57:02,223 --> 01:57:05,017
I wanted to see just
what kind of verbal abuse

2222
01:57:05,018 --> 01:57:07,352
people can take before
they start objecting,

2223
01:57:07,353 --> 01:57:09,229
before they start
lashing back.

2224
01:57:09,230 --> 01:57:10,981
And it really surprised...

2225
01:57:10,982 --> 01:57:13,567
It really surprised me that
nobody said anything to stop me.

2226
01:57:13,568 --> 01:57:15,152
Nobody said,
"Come on, man. You...

2227
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:16,486
"You can't say
those things to me.

2228
01:57:16,487 --> 01:57:18,405
Those things are sick."
Nobody said that.

2229
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:20,657
And nobody questioned
my authority at all.

2230
01:57:20,658 --> 01:57:22,159
And it really shocked me.

2231
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,161
I-I started to get...

2232
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:26,830
I started to abuse
people so much.

2233
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:28,957
I started to get so profane.

2234
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,711
And still, people
didn't say anything.

2234
01:57:33,305 --> 01:58:33,380
