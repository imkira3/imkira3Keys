00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,654
about doing something
special for you...

stop looking at me.

it would've been

have that beautiful jaw...

jewelry I can actually wear?

220

not me!"

that the weapon is still being
offered to the highest bidder.

knows where that nuke is.

his daughter, Rayna.

with the heads of several
terrorist organizations.

300
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,417
Most ominously...

301
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,719
Solsa Dudaev,
the al-Qaeda-funded leader

302
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,488
of the Chechen Martyrs'
Brigade.

303
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,790
We have compelling evidence that
he has the machinery in place

304
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,058
to get that nuke
to New York in time

305
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,559
for next week's
UN General Assembly.

306
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,794
I'm already packed.

307
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,096
One of our sources was told

308
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,663
she has taken up residence
outside of Sofia.

309
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,697
Go get her.

310
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,701
Grab my things, Coop.

311
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,439
Jesus, Cooper, go put on
some sunglasses or something.

312
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,674
I feel like you're a Gypsy,
cursing me with it.

313
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,143
Yep, I'm on it.

314
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,611
Yeah, that's all good.
Oh, Fine?

Hi.
Hey, Super Cooper.

316
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,649
Oh! Um...

317
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:54,087
I just was feeling
a little weird about...

318
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,489
Oh, yeah? ...some of the stuff,
and I think the intel...

319
00:15:56,523 --> 00:16:00,127
on Rayna's location
seems a little too easy.

320
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,695
I just...
Something doesn't feel right.

321
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,397
It'll be right when
we get Rayna behind bars

322
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,366
and that nuke
back in our hands.

323
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,603
Yeah, sure. I just...

324
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,640
I don't know. All my alarm bells
are going off with this one.

325

Do I mean that?
You got me. You kidder.

Don't be.
God, I admire you.

Well, did he at least say it
in a flirty tone that says...

"And because of my admiration, I
shall now take my shirt off...

the same thing?

often make history."

Yes, you do know
the phrase is...

377
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,461
"Well-behaved women
seldom make history"?

378
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,028
Yeah. That's never
how she said it.

379
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,097
What were her others?

380
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,167
"Just blend in."
"Let somebody else win."

381

Classic. I got that a
lot in high school.

And there was, "Give up
on your dream, Susan."

She used to write that
in my lunchbox.

different between us

at the Academy.

to sleep every night.

I don't think she probably does.
She probably does.

485
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,951
I don't know.

486
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,620
I'm guessing you?

487
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,922
Drop your weapon.

488
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,457
Fine, what's happening?

489
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:04,958
Let me guess.
Whoever is in your ear

490
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,560
wants to know
what's happening?

491
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:09,697
(SOFTLY) He's about to die.

492
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,399
That's what.

493
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,505
An awfully big gun
for such a little girl.

494
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:20,608
Oh, God, don't say
stuff like that.

495
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:22,142
Okay, there's a knife rack
directly to your right.

496
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,812
The way she's holding the gun,
she's not experienced.

497
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,515
If you duck and lunge, you can
get the knife and disarm her.

498
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,868
Did someone just suggest that
you grab one of those knives?

499
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,786
No, no, no!

500
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Damn it!

501
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,087
Fine!

502
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:37,958
Can they see me right now?

503
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:40,933
Let me adjust
the angle a little bit.

504
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:42,696
(GUNSHOT)
(GASPS)

505
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,402
Oh, my God, Fine.

506
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:53,907
His name was Bradley Fine.
He worked for the CIA.

507
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,676
Other top agents include

508
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,378
Matthew Wright,
Timothy Cress...

509
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,281
Rick Ford and Karen Walker.

510
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:03,617
Come on, Fine. Come on.

511
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:07,555
I know who all
your active agents are.

512
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:11,124
So, unless you'd like
the body count to grow...

513
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,694
I suggest you stay
far away from me.

514
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:16,396
Now grab some tissues,

515
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,666
because shit's about
to get real sad.

516
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:19,699
FINE: No, no...
(GUNSHOT)

517
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,606
Oh, my God, Fine.

518
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,776
As Deputy Director...

519
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,212
I have never had
a more difficult duty...

520
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:36,249
than to bid farewell
to colleagues taken from us.

521
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:39,419
From Dover,
to the family services...

522
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:41,622
to memorials like these...

523
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:42,990
it's tough to say goodbye.

524
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:45,559
There's nothing you
could have done, Susan.

525
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:49,697
Bradley Fine was more than
just a coworker and a friend.

526
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,565
He was part of our family.

527
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,867
And as family,
even knowing that the universe

528
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:56,804
has a plan
for each human life...

529
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:58,472
it's hard to accept
the sudden loss

530
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:01,475
of such a good
and decent person.

531
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,614
SUSAN: (ON TAPE) Okay, there's a
knife rack directly to your right.

532
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:09,416
Susan, I got your assessment
report on Rayna Boyanov.

533
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,985
I know you're probably feeling
a lot of emotion right now...

534
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,188
but please refrain from using
the term "thundercunt."

535
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,492
Oh, my God. I didn't
realize I wrote that.

536
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:19,927
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:29,002 --> 00:24:30,303
Nancy, I'm sending
you a photo.

538
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:31,705
It's in pretty bad shape.

539
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:33,073
Can you enhance it?
Mm-hmm.

540
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:43,584
Paris?

541
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:48,055
How the fuck did this twat
find out our fucking names?

542
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:49,523
We don't know.

543
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:51,825
And dial it way back
with the "T" word, Ford.

544
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,261
You're not immune from the
HR department. Grow up.

545
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:56,329
And "twat" means something
completely different in England.

546
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,065
Here it means a vagina.

547
00:24:58,098 --> 00:25:00,668
Anyway, obviously
we're talking about a mole.

548
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,202
It could be a mole, they could
have hacked our system.

549
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:03,270
It's anyone's guess.

550
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:05,739
The bottom line is Rayna
Boyanov is about to sell...

551
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:07,675
a small-scale tactical
nuclear weapon

552
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,209
to a terrorist
organization...

553
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:11,879
and we don't know
where she or the bomb is.

554
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:14,281
Fortunately, our analyst
Susan Cooper found a lead.

555
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,951
Rayna had the number
of Sergio De Luca...

556
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,687
and we've long
suspected De Luca

557
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,623
of working as an intermediary
with terrorist groups.

558
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:24,925
Rayna may be using him
to find buyers for the nuke.

559
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,595
The number was to an office
he keeps in Paris.

560
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:29,429
I told you to send me in
there instead of Fine,

561
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:30,831
and you didn't.

562
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,600
And now Fine is dead.
I'm going the fuck in.

563
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,167
You can't.

564
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,103
We need someone to follow De
Luca without being detected...

565
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:38,238
and that will hopefully
take us to Rayna...

566
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,773
but it can't be any of you.

567
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,810
Here's what we do...

568
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:46,313
I go into the Face/Off
machine, get a whole new face.

569
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:48,515
I turn up,
they never know it's me.

570
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,683
Do you have quarters?
Because it costs 50 cents.

571
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,284
What, I gotta pay?

572
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:53,386
No, because it doesn't exist.

573
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,955
Yes, it does!

574
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:58,592
I heard Cress and Wright talking
about it in the shitter.

575
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:00,427
I'm pretty sure
they were pulling your leg.

576
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,529
You pair of fucking vaginas.

577
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,798
Seriously,
you've got to cut that out.

578
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:07,467
Jesus. Look, one of us
has to go in.

579
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,136
Doesn't matter
if we've been exposed.

580
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:10,838
We've all gone deep before,

581
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:12,740
and we've always
gotten our guy.

582
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:15,175
Guys, this is more than
just a kill mission.

583
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,811
We can get Rayna, De Luca, and
some top terrorist leadership...

584
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:20,047
and get the weapon back
if we do this right.

585
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,715
We just need someone
who can shadow them

586
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:23,717
without attracting attention.

587
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:24,685
We need someone invisible.

588
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:25,953
I'll do it.

589
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:28,188
Okay, thanks, lunch lady.

590
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:29,489
I'm serious.

591
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,524
I have never
been out in the field.

592
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:33,961
Exactly. Stupid fucking idea.

593
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:36,496
My point is that
it's highly doubtful

594
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,198
that I've ever been exposed.

595
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,133
But you worked with Fine.

596
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,234
They may have
a record of you, too.

597
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,836
SUSAN: Possibly.

598
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,706
But the odds of them
knowing my face are very low.

599
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,708
Miss Crocker, I would
really like to do this.

600
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:49,442
For Fine.

601
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:51,879
What are you gonna do? Bring one
of your cats as a sidekick?

602
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:54,147
I don't have any cats!

603
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:56,817
You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

604
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,052
Look here, Betty...

605
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,754
Ford, if you call me
Betty Crocker,

606
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:02,622
I will rip your fucking
heart out of your chest.

607
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:04,658
Not only did I
become a citizen

608
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,360
and take a vow
to protect this country...

609
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:11,699
I also took a vow to avenge my
fallen comrades. We all fucking did.

610
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:14,301
No, we didn't.
Not me.

611
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:17,437
I'm pretty sure we all took a fucking vow.
I remember it.

612
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,573
I remember raising my fucking
hand and saying some shit.

613
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:22,876
If you think
I'm gonna sit by

614
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,550
and let you send in
a fucking secretary...

615
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,579
to do my work...

616
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,181
you might as well accept
my resignation now.

617
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,750
If I can jump in,

618
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:32,652
I am technically, uh,
classified as an agent.

619
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:34,888
Look...

620
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:36,824
SUSAN: Full agent. So...

621
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:39,326
agent, agent, agent,
I'm an agent.

622
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,895
Are you considering this?

623
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:44,497
For your safety, and the safety
of those around this table...

624
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:46,233
I am considering it.

625
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:48,335
Then consider this,
I quit.

626
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:53,140
And I know there's a fucking
Face/Off machine.

627
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,208
You're just keeping it
secret from me.

628
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,845
Okay.

629
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,518
That hasn't happened before.
(DOOR CLOSES)

630
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,816
It is quite
a lovely office.

631
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:04,852
What's your deal, Cooper?

632
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:06,453
What do you mean?

633
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:08,288
You got a fiery side?

634
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:11,558
I really did, in that report,
mean to write "cunning."

635
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:12,993
I've been going over
your files.

636
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,195
You were top of your class
at the Academy,

637
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:16,629
in all computer
and support skills.

638
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:17,798
No surprise there.

639
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:19,699
But you have a certain...

640
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,902
tame demeanor
around the office,

641
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,536
that says you've never
even held a gun.

642
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,439
So imagine my surprise...

643
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,513
when I saw footage from
this drill back at The Farm.

644
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,882
SUSAN: Is that...
I can't even...

645
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,116
Is that me? I can't really...
(GUN CLICKING)

646
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,389
SUSAN: (ON COMPUTER)
Stupid gun!

647
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,253
Somebody definitely
sped this up.

648
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:42,890
Ooh! Camera angle
and stuff make...

649
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:44,992
(YELLING)

650
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:46,459
Cooper, Cooper, stop!
Jesus Christ, what are you...

651
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:47,828
Ouch.

652
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:49,262
Out of context, that's...

653
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:52,432
I must have watched
this 15 times now...

654
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,101
because what the fuck?

655
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,936
I almost put it up
on YouTube.

656
00:28:55,969 --> 00:29:00,107
I was, to say the least,
uncomfortable with the event.

657
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,109
But I would also like to say,
it was over 10 years ago.

658
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:03,410
The instructor
was not harmed.

659
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:05,645
Fine was your mentor, right?

660
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:07,114
Yes.

661
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:10,050
Why did you not
become a field agent?

662
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,551
Well, we're such a great
fit and a great team.

663
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,386
Fine made
some great points.

664
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,323
Maybe I match better with,
just staying...

665
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:17,958
In his ear.
Well...

666
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:19,459
Yeah, he sniped you.

667
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,461
All the top agents used to
do that before I got here.

668
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:23,263
I really thought he made
some great points.

669
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:26,066
Women.

670
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,567
All right, have you had any
field training since then?

671
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,601
10 years is a long time.

672
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:30,270
No, ma'am.

673
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:32,906
Normally, I would send you back to
The Farm, but there's no time...

674
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,242
and I can't take a chance of
anyone leaking your name.

675
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,110
(LAUGHING)
Am I going?

676
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,711
You're going.

677
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:41,214
Okay. Jeez. Sorry.

678
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,018
But it's a track and report
mission only.

679
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,719
Got it.

680
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:47,921
We'll be giving you
a new identity.

681
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,689
You'll no longer be
Susan Cooper.

682
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,892
I had a few ideas for that.
Your new name...

683
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:53,526
I was just spitballing
and I thought...

684
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,628
Seraphina,
Maddox, Gisele...

685
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:57,297
Carol Jenkins.

686
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,598
Carol Jenkins.

687
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,300
If I may, ma'am,

688
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,436
there was a 13-year-old girl
named Carol...

689
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,572
that used to kind of take me
around the neighborhood...

690
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:07,207
and use my braid
as a dog leash...

691
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,342
and make me
beg for biscuits...

692
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:10,978
Carol Jenkins.

693
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:13,380
Yes. Carol Jenkins, huh?

694
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,883
Carol Jenkins
is a single mother of four...

695
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:18,051
temporarily relocated
from Delaware

696
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:19,887
to increase sales
for a software company.

697
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,821
Okay, that is...

698
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:23,356
a different occup...

699
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:27,327
Is there a problem?
No.

700
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,160
I was just wondering if this was my
family, or if I had taken hostages.

701
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,699
I'm just not sure...

702
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:35,002
how De Luca is gonna take me
seriously if I look like this.

703
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:37,037
De Luca is not going to
take you anything.

704
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,205
In case
you did not hear me...

705
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:39,606
you are not to make
direct contact

706
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:41,308
with any of the targets.

707
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,776
Track and report.

708
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,345
We're setting you up
in a surveillance office

709
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:46,980
across the street
from De Luca's.

710
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,515
You'll be tapped into
the same telecom trunk...

711
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:51,018
and have access to voice and
data coming into his office...

712
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:52,251
and that is as sexy
as it gets.

713
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,021
One mistake,

714
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,389
and we've got a nuclear bomb
in the hands of terrorists.

715
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:57,357
Do you understand?

716
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,858
Yes.

717
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:00,892
Go see Patrick. He's got
special equipment for you.

718
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,567
Oh, my God.

719
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,969
What are you doing?

720
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:12,940
Did you come up
with your spy name yet?

721
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:15,408
Mine would be
"Amber Valentine."

722
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,410
That sounds like
you're an adult film star.

723
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:19,179
No, I did the spy
name formula.

724
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:20,480
"Amber" was the name
of my first pet,

725
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:21,949
and I grew up
on Valentine Street.

726
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,816
That's how you come up
with your porn name.

727
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,752
I thought it was your spy name!
No!

728
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:27,120
What would yours be?

729
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:29,656
"Meatball Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard."

730
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:31,624
Yeah.
Wow.

731
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:35,228
Oh, my God.

732
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:37,597
This is so exciting!

733
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,765
(LAUGHS)

734
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:39,899
You're a spy!

735
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,201
I know! I know!

736
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,335
Oh, my God!

737
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,636
You're gonna get
one of those!

738
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,972
SUSAN: No, I'm not!

739
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,274
Look at that!

740
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:49,142
NANCY: That looks high-tech.

741
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:50,643
It's like the future.

742
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:53,213
Patrick.
Susan.

743
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,115
Hey, Patrick.
Yes.

744
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:57,184
I was given specific
instructions by Elaine

745
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:58,417
to tailor these
gadgets to you.

746
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:00,753
SUSAN: Wow. NANCY: Wow,
look at that watch.

747
00:32:00,787 --> 00:32:01,787
These are not yours.

748
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:02,990
Oh.

749
00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:08,128
Is that a rape whistle?

750
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,430
Elaine wanted you
to only be carrying items

751
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:13,466
a single woman travelling
through Europe would have.

752
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,035
But she could get that
at any pharmacy.

753
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:16,903
Not this whistle.

754
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,305
When you blow
through this whistle,

755
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:20,173
a small, poisonous
dart flies out...

756
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,142
neutralizing your target.

757
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:25,045
Also, it needs your
fingerprints on it to work.

758
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:26,879
That is really neat!
Stop it, that's amazing.

759
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:29,182
That is really super cool!
I love that!

760
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:31,096
This anti-fungal spray
can freeze and disable...

761
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,320
any security system.

762
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,522
Wow.

763
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:37,657
That is quite an image to be
carrying all over Europe.

764
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,292
It's also a pepper spray.

765
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:41,561
Why not just make it
look like pepper spray?

766
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:43,430
That's a pretty good idea.

767
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,597
Well, next time.

768
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,033
I can wait,

769
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:48,135
if you want to print up
a new label.

770
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:50,803
No, I'd have to turn
the printer on again.

771
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:51,837
I don't really want to.

772
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:54,475
Each of these
are filled with chloroform.

773
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:58,079
Wow, that is an unsettling
amount of hemorrhoid wipes.

774
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,847
Makes me kind of wonder...

775
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,250
what, exactly,
is going on back there.

776
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:03,717
I wouldn't know.
I don't have that problem.

777
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,219
I don't have that problem.

778
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:07,055
If you ever feel like
you have been poisoned...

779
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:08,589
chew one of these.

780
00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:15,629
Have I done something
to you to upset you?

781
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:19,500
Because this is
a peculiar theme.

782
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:22,670
Finally, every agent gets
a night vision scope...

783
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:24,305
hidden in their watch.

784
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,774
I have heard about this.
I've been looking...

785
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:28,342
Oh.
Who's that?

786
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:30,278
That is Bette Midler
and Barbara Hershey.

787
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,146
From Beaches.

788
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,317
How much am I supposed
to like Beaches?

789
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,619
I would imagine a lot,
if you have the watch.

790
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:40,421
Hey, Pat, I'm flying!
PATRICK: Anthony!

791
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,090
Don't wear out
the battery on that.

792
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:43,791
Am I getting that?

793
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:45,859
No, you're not
gonna get that.

794
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:48,093
I've already packed your bags.
Hurry up and get dressed.

795
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:51,499
Carol Jenkins has to get
to the airport immediately.

796
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,933
And may I say...

797
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:53,934
I think it's very brave
of you to sacrifice

798
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:55,503
your life for your country.

799
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,705
I'm not sacrifi...
I'm coming back.

800
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,274
Let's see.

801
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:03,077
Hey, Pat! I'm gonna totally

DE LUCA: Nicola.

listening to me?

Wow.
Oh...

Come on, what is wrong
with this person?

1128

Nancy, can you pull up

Fine's POV cam
from Boyanov's office?

1134

Look on the desk.
There's some photos there.

standing next to a car.

1136

Renaldo is a Rolls-Royce.

1137
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:26,034
Hack into the Rolls'
tracking system.

1138
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:27,268
That car is a Wraith,

1139
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:29,270
so it has a satellite-aided
transmission.

1140

Then tap into Boyanov's feed.

1141

is in Rome, right now.

I can do this.

to toot my own horn,

1148
00:49:41,882 --> 00:49:43,317

I'm gonna toot...

a lot of people.

Rayna and that bomb.

I couldn't even be president?

Maybe I should just be married
to one of the dolls...

Why do I have ten cats?

Is that even legal?

00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,609
Susan, you heard Elaine.

1282
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:11,745
Track and report.
No contact!

1283
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:14,348
I'll track De Luca inside,
then I'll report.

1284
00:55:14,382 --> 00:55:16,484
And if he initiates
contact with me...

1285
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:19,086
I'll just go with it.
Susan!

1286
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,188
Your "cat lady" look is not
gonna fit in in there.

1287
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:23,357
That's why Penny Morgan is
gonna burn her cat T-shirt...

1288
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,025
and spend some
of that Mary Kay money.

1289
00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:26,460
This is full-blown rogue!

00:55:44,878 --> 00:55:46,847
I really hope De Luca is still
in there, for your sake.

1298
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,749
And they're not gonna
reimburse you for all that.

1299
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:50,217
You should have gone
to cheaper stores, Susan.

1300
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,952
Okay, I'm going offline,
Nancy.

1301
00:55:51,985 --> 00:55:53,086
No, wait!

1302

1306
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:05,399
If I'm not out in 10 minutes,
it's because I won the place.

1307
00:56:05,433 --> 00:56:07,635
Let me just
rub that for luck.

1308
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,670
Oh, that's an oily scalp.

1309
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:21,715
I'm sorry, but I have
to check you in.

1310
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:25,218
Your name, please?
Penny Morgan.

1311
00:56:25,252 --> 00:56:27,555
I don't see you on the list.
I'm so sorry.

1312
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:29,289
She's with me.

1313
00:56:29,322 --> 00:56:31,191
Darling.
(GROWLS)

1314
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:33,527
You're late.
The way you look...

1315
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:36,063
I'd say it was more
than worth the wait. Come.

1316
00:56:36,096 --> 00:56:37,465
Let's get a drink.
Ow. Ow.

1317
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:39,232
Such a gentleman.

1318
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:41,769
You look absolutely stunning
tonight here, darling.

1319
00:56:41,802 --> 00:56:43,437
What the fuck are you doing
in here, arsehole?

1320
00:56:43,471 --> 00:56:44,672
That's quite a tone
change, isn't it?

1321
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:46,173
What are you doing in here?

1322
00:56:46,206 --> 00:56:48,375
You are completely
compromising me right now.

1323
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,177
I'm compromising you?
Fucking hilarious.

1324
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,378
You were about
to cause a scene

1325
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:52,580
trying to get into
this fucking place.

1326
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:54,181
Give me a little credit. What
do you think I'm gonna do?

1327
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:55,583
Run over there and be like,
"Hey, I'm a crazy lady!

1328
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:57,217
"Where's the buffet?
I'm from the Midwest.

1329
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,686
"Where's Blue Man Group?"

1330
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,954
I am not an idiot, Ford.
You are an idiot.

1331
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:02,289
You should not be
in this casino...

1332
00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:04,257
because De Luca is here and
I need to get close to him.

1333
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:06,460
How you gonna do that? How
you gonna do that, Cooper?

1334
00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:07,427
What, are you gonna
seduce him?

1335
00:57:07,461 --> 00:57:08,596
That your big fucking plan?

1336
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:09,930
Yeah, what if it is?

1337
00:57:09,963 --> 00:57:11,364
Why is that so hard
to believe?

1338
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:13,200
Because you look like a flute
player in a wedding band.

1339
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:14,568
That's fucking why!

1340
00:57:14,602 --> 00:57:16,436
I'm here to take De Luca out.

1341
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,606
Ooh. It sounds romantic.
I hope you get lucky!

1342
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,407
God damn it, if I was trying
to sound romantic...

1343
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,576
you'd be lying on the floor,
soaking wet and breathless...

1344
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,944
wondering what came over you.

1345
00:57:23,977 --> 00:57:26,379
But I'm not, so get the
fuck out of my way!

1346
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:28,415
I need you to rein it in,
buddy, okay?

1347
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:30,417
If you take out De Luca, we don't
have a shot at getting Rayna.

1348
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,520
So take it down, like,
5,000 notches!

1349
00:57:32,553 --> 00:57:33,721
Take it down?
That's how you get

1350
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:34,955
polonium-210 slipped
into your drink...

1351
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:36,423
and go 18 months
in intensive care

1352
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:37,658
for radiation poisoning...

1353
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:39,560
and go six months
without eyesight...

1354
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:41,762
while everybody you've
ever loved is gunned down!

1355
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:43,731
Really? Everybody
that you love

1356
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:45,065
has been gunned down,
and just you survive?

1357
00:57:45,098 --> 00:57:46,066
Did you ever think that maybe

1358
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:47,467
everybody you love
is not being killed...

1359
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:48,936
but they're
killing themselves

1360
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:51,004
because they can't stand
to be around you?

1361
00:57:51,038 --> 00:57:52,640
This shit's the real deal,
life and death.

1362
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:54,542
This, the field...

1363
00:57:54,575 --> 00:57:56,343
is a hell of a lot different than
sitting behind your fucking monitor...

1364
00:57:56,376 --> 00:57:57,477
googling shit.

1365
00:57:57,511 --> 00:57:58,779
Stay away from me, Ford.

1366
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:00,347
And do not let
De Luca see you.

1367
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,749
And by the way,
I can see your gun

1368
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:03,116
sticking out
of your back pocket.

1369
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,719
Unless you're so extreme that
you've got a second dick...

1370
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:06,820
coming out of your hip!

1371
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:40,287
Konnichiwa.

1372
00:58:41,622 --> 00:58:43,456
Ma'am,
these seats are reserved.

1373
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,858
Of course they are.

1374
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:47,394
I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait outside.

1375
00:58:47,427 --> 00:58:49,029
Yes, absolutely.

1376
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:50,263
Nope, not a door?

1377
00:58:51,498 --> 00:58:53,634
I knew that.
Of course it's not a door.

1378
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:54,968
It probably
happens all the time.

1379
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:56,604
It's never happened before.
Okay.

1380
00:58:58,505 --> 00:58:59,773
Ma'am.
Yes.

1381
00:59:02,175 --> 00:59:05,412
Now, right here is okay.
No more exploring, please.

1382
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:06,880
Okay. Lovely.

1383
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:15,189
MAN: (SOFTLY)
From Mr. De Luca.

1384
00:59:18,492 --> 00:59:19,427
(EARPIECE BEEPING)

1385
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,460
Nancy?

1386
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:22,864
Susan. Oh, my God! Hi!

1387
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:24,332
I found her.

1388
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:26,034
I found Rayna.
She's with De Luca.

1389
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:27,401
You did it!

1390
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:29,170
Excellent tracking
and reporting, madam.

1391
00:59:43,952 --> 00:59:45,453
Oh, my God.

1392
00:59:45,486 --> 00:59:47,555
Somebody just put
something in her drink.

1393
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:49,190
NANCY: What is it?
Is it poison?

1394
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,759
I don't think
it's a fiber supplement.

1395
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:52,827
She killed Fine, Nance.

1396
00:59:52,861 --> 00:59:56,397
I could really enjoy just
watching her die right now.

1397
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,599
She's the only one who knows
where the bomb is...

1398
00:59:58,633 --> 01:00:00,001
so Dudaev would never
get his hands on it.

1399
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,102
Oh, God, Susan.

1400
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:02,135
What are you gonna do?

1401
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:04,939
Excuse me, ma'am.

1402
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,876
Hi, do you speak English?

1403
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:10,378
Because I think somebody just
put a roofie in your cocktail.

1404
01:00:11,345 --> 01:00:12,747
Are you sure
it wasn't you?

1405
01:00:12,781 --> 01:00:14,983
What? No! God, I would never!

1406
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:17,118
Could you point
the man out?

1407
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:20,354
He just kind of
zipped out that door.

1408
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:22,356
He's wearing a purple bowtie.

1409
01:00:25,193 --> 01:00:26,193
(INAUDIBLE)

1410
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:30,164
Thank you, Miss...

1411
01:00:30,198 --> 01:00:32,934
Oh. Penny. Morgan.

1412
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:35,236
But it's no trouble, really.

1413
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:38,106
I think us ladies have to
watch out for each other.

1414
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:40,008
This kind of thing
happens all the time.

1415
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:43,044
People often try
to roofie you?

1416
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:44,813
Once, I asked someone
for a Tylenol,

1417
01:00:44,846 --> 01:00:47,015
and they gave me
a Tylenol PM.

1418
01:00:47,048 --> 01:00:48,888
I'm not sure what
their intentions were, but...

1419
01:00:53,554 --> 01:00:54,756
It seems
they may have found him.

1420
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:56,309
Would you come with me
to identify him?

1421
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,693
Yes. Of course.

1422
01:00:58,727 --> 01:00:59,928
I'm happy to help.

1423
01:01:04,766 --> 01:01:06,267
(SOFTLY) Holy shit.

1424
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,942
My friend here
said she saw you

1425
01:01:13,975 --> 01:01:15,643
put something in my drink.

1426
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:17,345
I don't know
any of you people. Okay?

1427
01:01:17,378 --> 01:01:19,113
I'm just in Rome
on business.

1428
01:01:19,147 --> 01:01:21,482
I was about to head back
to my hotel and go to sleep.

1429
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:25,086
Perfect. Just in time
for a nightcap.

1430
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,420
Apparently, there's nothing
wrong with it.

1431
01:01:26,454 --> 01:01:27,454
I don't want your drink.

1432
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:32,592
(INAUDIBLE)

1433
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,102
Fuck you, Rayna.

1434
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:44,773
Mmm. Scrumptious.

1435
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:48,042
So, joke's on you.

1436
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:53,447
(CHOKING) Fuck you!

1437
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,385
Fuck you!

1438
01:01:59,754 --> 01:02:00,922
(GURGLING)

1439
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:22,610
How long was I out?

1440
01:02:22,643 --> 01:02:24,312
You fainted just long enough
for us to laugh at you.

1441
01:02:24,345 --> 01:02:25,847
What happened?

1442
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,881
It was all a dream.

1443
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:30,084
I'm just kidding.
A man's throat dissolved.

1444
01:02:30,118 --> 01:02:32,286
Sorry, I'm not usually,
you know...

1445
01:02:34,322 --> 01:02:35,957
Oh, thank you. That's...

1446
01:02:37,425 --> 01:02:39,393
surprisingly polite.

1447
01:02:39,427 --> 01:02:40,995
Sorry about that.

1448
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:43,064
I've seen a lot of things
in my day. I just haven't...

1449
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:45,599
I have never seen that,
exactly.

1450
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:48,002
Penny, do you feel the need

1451
01:02:48,036 --> 01:02:49,596
to tell anybody about
what you just saw?

1452
01:02:53,074 --> 01:02:54,575
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

1453
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:57,278
That asshole
got what he deserved.

1454
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:59,780
I knew from the second
I saw him, I thought...

1455
01:02:59,814 --> 01:03:01,214
"That guy doesn't
deserve a throat."

1456
01:03:01,582 --> 01:03:02,884
So, good on you.

1457
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:08,022
I would like to take you
to dinner to say thank you.

1458
01:03:08,056 --> 01:03:10,291
And we must discuss
this hideous dress.

1459
01:03:10,324 --> 01:03:11,993
It's just hysterical.

1460
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:15,263
Oh, good,
that's what I was hoping for.

1461
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:18,432
And by the way...

1462
01:03:18,466 --> 01:03:20,434
Hristo was supposed to be
looking after me at the bar...

1463
01:03:20,468 --> 01:03:22,403
and making sure nobody
put anything in my drinks.

1464
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,909
(SIGHS)

1465
01:03:27,942 --> 01:03:29,810
(SIGHS) They'll give him
a talking-to.

1466
01:03:29,844 --> 01:03:32,780
Seems fair.
Maybe dock him a day's wage.

1467
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:33,747
(GUNSHOT)
Or shoot him in the head.

1468
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:34,949
That always works.

1469
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:37,751
Rome is quite amaz...

1470
01:03:37,785 --> 01:03:38,920
Rome is the worst.
Yes.

1471
01:03:38,953 --> 01:03:40,889
So boring and tacky.

1472
01:03:40,922 --> 01:03:43,958
I'm so glad one of us
finally said it. (LAUGHS)

1473
01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:45,232
You have lipstick
on your teeth.

1474
01:03:45,693 --> 01:03:47,095
Really?

1475
01:03:47,128 --> 01:03:48,528
Looks like you ate
a box of crayons.

1476
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:49,662
Damn it.

1477
01:03:50,899 --> 01:03:53,001
Here we are.

1478
01:03:53,034 --> 01:03:54,735
These should have been brought
out when we first sat down.

1479
01:03:54,768 --> 01:03:56,637
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1480
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,008
So far, I'm riddled with
disappointment at the service.

1481
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:02,476
So sorry.
Signora, I apologize.

1482
01:04:05,779 --> 01:04:07,815
I once saw someone eat...

1483
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:10,919
one of these before.

1484
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,723
This is... strange.

1485
01:04:15,756 --> 01:04:17,591
Do you always tear your food
up into little pieces?

1486
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:19,260
You look like a squirrel.

1487
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:21,529
I was just checking
for the consistency.

1488
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:24,698
Mmm.

1489
01:04:24,732 --> 01:04:26,300
You eat like a baby.

1490
01:04:26,334 --> 01:04:27,468
Thank you.

1491
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:31,139
So, do you like to have a
look at the wine list?

1492
01:04:31,172 --> 01:04:32,640
Yes. Penny, you can order.

1493
01:04:33,942 --> 01:04:35,076
Okay. Oh!

1494
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:36,978
Has some heft.

1495
01:04:37,345 --> 01:04:38,412
Okay.

1496
01:04:38,446 --> 01:04:40,915
I'm feeling a red.

1497
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:42,984
Kind of a red.
I like a lot of noise.

1498
01:04:43,017 --> 01:04:44,585
I like a little bit of...

1499
01:04:44,618 --> 01:04:46,187
kind of a barky finish.

1500
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,621
I tend to like a white...

1501
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:50,724
with the grit of a hummus...

1502
01:04:50,758 --> 01:04:53,227
that's, of course,
been thinned out.

1503
01:04:53,261 --> 01:04:55,930
Just kind of jump up
in the front of your palate...

1504
01:04:55,964 --> 01:04:58,399
and then rip back
and sizzle.

1505
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:02,336
Almost a mineral
kind of dirt finish...

1506
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:05,974
if we're having meat. Okay,
here, this is looking...

1507
01:05:06,007 --> 01:05:08,076
promising.
Something with...

1508
01:05:08,109 --> 01:05:10,011
This one has
nice hints of toast...

1509
01:05:10,844 --> 01:05:13,281
and dogwood,
I assume? Hmm?

1510
01:05:13,314 --> 01:05:14,682
Uh...

1511
01:05:14,715 --> 01:05:18,419
I will have
the Sapori e Delizie.

1512
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,488
Right.

1513
01:05:20,521 --> 01:05:22,756
That is the name
of this restaurant.

1514
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:24,292
Yes, I'm aware of that.

1515
01:05:24,325 --> 01:05:26,560
So, why don't you
surprise us...

1516
01:05:26,594 --> 01:05:28,229
with something
that we don't know?

1517
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:30,064
Like a delicious
bottle of wine.

1518
01:05:30,098 --> 01:05:32,967
Right. Sorry, I will be back
in five minutes, okay?

1519
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:35,369
So hard to get
good help these days.

1520
01:05:35,403 --> 01:05:37,138
Don't you find that?
I find that.

1521
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,675
I know who all
your active agents are.

1522
01:05:43,978 --> 01:05:46,014
Okay, I'm sensing, uh...

1523
01:05:46,914 --> 01:05:48,482
Can I do a little do over?

1524
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:50,550
I, uh...

1525
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:53,254
I really don't know
how to order wine.

1526
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:56,991
I'm from a small town
in Iowa.

1527
01:05:57,025 --> 01:05:58,692
I saved up my money
to come on this Rome trip.

1528
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:00,594
I had a little jar
on my desk at work...

1529
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:02,063
and everybody said, "You're
never gonna make enough money."

1530
01:06:02,096 --> 01:06:04,098
But I did, and I'm here.

1531
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:07,068
And then I meet you,
and I can't afford...

1532
01:06:07,101 --> 01:06:08,536
to eat at a place like this,

1533
01:06:08,569 --> 01:06:10,404
and I'm just trying
to impress you...

1534
01:06:10,438 --> 01:06:12,340
and doing a really
poor job of it.

1535
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,909
I thought as much.

1536
01:06:15,943 --> 01:06:19,047
Your cheap prom dress doesn't
exactly scream sophistication.

1537
01:06:19,413 --> 01:06:20,881
Oh.

1538
01:06:20,914 --> 01:06:23,551
Well, I didn't go to prom,
so maybe it is...

1539
01:06:23,584 --> 01:06:25,153
When I was a little girl
growing up in Bulgaria...

1540
01:06:25,186 --> 01:06:27,421
which is the worst,
by the way.

1541
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,524
Poor people everywhere and
cabbages constantly cooking.

1542
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:33,094
There was this woman who was
kicked out of her house...

1543
01:06:33,127 --> 01:06:34,895
and she lost
all her money.

1544
01:06:34,928 --> 01:06:36,530
She couldn't even
sell her body.

1545
01:06:36,564 --> 01:06:39,533
So she became a clown
on the streets.

1546
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:41,835
She would perform all her
tricks standing in mud,

1547
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:44,072
and just cry and cry.

1548
01:06:45,306 --> 01:06:46,607
You remind me of this woman.

1549
01:06:47,608 --> 01:06:49,443
Oh. Thank you.

1550
01:06:49,477 --> 01:06:52,180
I don't know what it is, but
there's something about you.

1551
01:06:52,213 --> 01:06:55,116
The fainting,
the way you talk...

1552
01:06:55,149 --> 01:06:57,151
your terrible
sense of style.

1553
01:06:57,185 --> 01:06:59,320
I did get this at
quite a lovely...

1554
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:00,488
It makes me sad
to think of you here

1555
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:02,890
spending all your
savings on Rome.

1556
01:07:02,923 --> 01:07:05,093
Come on.
We're going to Budapest.

1557
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:06,727
Budapest?

1558
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,129
I have some business
to finish there...

1559
01:07:08,162 --> 01:07:10,131
and you can take my private
jet when we're done...

1560
01:07:10,164 --> 01:07:11,965
anywhere you want to
get home.

1561
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,639
My way of repaying you
for saving my life.

1562
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:15,236
Okay.

1563
01:07:19,773 --> 01:07:20,773
Is there a problem?

1564
01:07:25,913 --> 01:07:28,182
No. Not at all. Let's go.

1565
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:31,085
Hey! Wait, what?

1566
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,453
I'm just talking
to the girl!

1567
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:33,846
Okay, okay.
Let's not make a scene.

1568
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:36,324
Let me just
get my room key out...

1569
01:07:36,357 --> 01:07:38,459
and I'll grab a bag
and pack my things.

1570
01:07:38,492 --> 01:07:40,828
It's Susan.
She's sending a code.

1571
01:07:40,861 --> 01:07:41,829
RAYNA: No, they can
fly you back later.

1572
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:43,297
"Shut...

1573
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:44,665
And if the rest of your clothes
look like that dress...

1574
01:07:44,698 --> 01:07:46,066
"...down...

1575
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:46,900
...I can send someone
to burn them for you.

1576
01:07:46,934 --> 01:07:48,269
Ha-ha.

1577
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:49,670
"...the power."
Quite a zinger!

1578
01:07:52,806 --> 01:07:54,342
Shut down the power
to the Casino Di Rome.

1579
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:55,375
What?

1580
01:07:56,744 --> 01:07:59,046
Shut the entire bloody
grid down, then! Now!

1581
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:00,080
That would be great.

1582
01:08:03,016 --> 01:08:04,585
(GRUNTING)

1583
01:08:04,618 --> 01:08:06,899
MAN: Everybody, please remain
calm and stay where you are.

1584
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:08,421
(GRUNTS)

1585
01:08:14,962 --> 01:08:16,430
Oh, no!
What's happening?

1586
01:08:16,864 --> 01:08:17,864
(RAYNA SCREAMS)

1587
01:08:25,773 --> 01:08:26,874
(MOUTHING) I've got this.

1588
01:08:28,142 --> 01:08:30,178
What the fuck just happened?

1589
01:08:31,712 --> 01:08:32,913
God damn it.

1590
01:08:32,946 --> 01:08:34,482
Oh, my God! Rayna.

1591
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:35,816
Thank God
your hair broke your fall.

1592
01:08:35,849 --> 01:08:37,451
I don't know what happened.

1593
01:08:37,485 --> 01:08:39,487
The lights were going out, and I
don't know if it's a robbery.

1594
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,356
Two of your guys slammed
into me and took you down.

1595
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:44,592
I think one of them
touched my bottom.

1596
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,705
I don't know which one,
but I definitely felt a hand.

1597
01:08:47,295 --> 01:08:49,363
Are they gonna be okay?

1598
01:08:49,397 --> 01:08:50,498
I wouldn't
worry about them.

1599
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:52,300
Their fate has just
been sealed.

1600
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:57,271
Sorry. I'll let you go.

1601
01:08:57,305 --> 01:08:58,306
Shame on you!

1602
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:07,881
Wow.

1603
01:09:07,915 --> 01:09:10,951
This is a really jazzy plane.

1604
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:12,620
Is this yours?

1605
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:13,721
It was my father's.

1606
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:16,590
You've never been
on a private jet before?

1607
01:09:16,624 --> 01:09:17,625
Oh, no.

1608
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:20,728
I did get upgraded
to premium economy once...

1609
01:09:20,761 --> 01:09:23,130
which was pretty plush.

1610
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:25,633
Premium economy.

1611
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,201
Sounds like a pen
for dirty animals.

1612
01:09:27,235 --> 01:09:28,936
Yeah, probably.

1613
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:31,739
But it was not
quite like this.

1614
01:09:31,772 --> 01:09:33,173
Thank you.

1615
01:09:34,141 --> 01:09:36,310
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1616
01:09:36,344 --> 01:09:37,945
Can't just be because
I remind you

1617
01:09:37,978 --> 01:09:39,847
of some sad Bulgarian clown.

1618
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,249
You remind me of my mother.

1619
01:09:41,782 --> 01:09:42,782
Oh.

1620
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,286
Really?

1621
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:48,188
You know that you and I
are pretty close in age.

1622
01:09:48,222 --> 01:09:49,890
You're funny.

1623
01:09:49,923 --> 01:09:51,225
It's the Bulgarian
clown in you.

1624
01:09:51,259 --> 01:09:52,960
Okay.
She was marvelous.

1625
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:54,795
But she was different.

1626
01:09:54,828 --> 01:09:55,929
Eccentric, like you are.

1627
01:09:55,963 --> 01:09:57,365
Oh.

1628
01:09:57,398 --> 01:09:58,432
The moment I saw you
standing there

1629
01:09:58,466 --> 01:09:59,600
in that abortion
of a dress...

1630
01:09:59,633 --> 01:10:00,801
Ah... Come on.

1631
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:02,536
...it was as if to say...

1632
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,930
"This is what I've got, world.
It's hideous, but it's mine."

1633
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,141
This was her.
(GASPS)

1634
01:10:08,175 --> 01:10:09,710
Oh, wow.

1635
01:10:09,743 --> 01:10:11,245
Hey, how'd you get
that picture of me?

1636
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:12,746
I look amazing.

1637
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,748
Hello, doppelganger.

1638
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:16,917
She was the only person
I could ever trust.

1639
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:19,853
Well, here's to your mom.

1640
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:21,955
To my mother. And to you.

1641
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:23,557
And here's to you.

1642
01:10:23,591 --> 01:10:26,260
You may never
be as wise as an owl...

1643
01:10:26,294 --> 01:10:28,296
but you'll always
be a hoot to me.

1644
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:31,499
What a stupid fucking
retarded toast.

1645
01:10:31,532 --> 01:10:32,966
You're delightful.
As are you.

1646
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:36,737
Mmm.

1647
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:39,740
Now, where did you say
we were headed?

(CLEARS THROAT)

1654
01:10:52,953 --> 01:10:53,953
Chew one of these.

1655
01:11:09,303 --> 01:11:10,804
What happened?

1656
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,172
I've never seen somebody

1657
01:11:12,205 --> 01:11:13,874
dive for
stool softener before.

1658
01:11:13,907 --> 01:11:15,943
That's one thing
that happened.

1659
01:11:15,976 --> 01:11:16,976
What did you do?

1660
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:19,212
Did you drug me?

1661
01:11:19,246 --> 01:11:20,714
Of course I did.

1662
01:11:20,748 --> 01:11:22,350
I told you,
I can't trust anybody.

1663
01:11:22,383 --> 01:11:23,703
I had to look
through your things.

1664
01:11:23,817 --> 01:11:25,786
Anyway, tell me...

1665
01:11:25,819 --> 01:11:26,920
are your hemorrhoids
particularly large,

1666
01:11:26,954 --> 01:11:27,954
or just tenacious?

1667

I'm not texting,
if you must know.

1669

Jesus, Colin,
what the fuck are you doing?

01:11:41,168 --> 01:11:43,571
I'm sorry, Rayna, but there's
been a change of plans.

1674
01:11:43,604 --> 01:11:45,072
Who paid you off, Colin?

1675
01:11:45,105 --> 01:11:47,240
Colin hasn't worked here for,
like, eight months.

1676
01:11:47,274 --> 01:11:48,442
I'm Fredrick.

1677

Is that why
you're doing this?

1678
01:11:49,677 --> 01:11:51,244
Because I don't remember
your fucking name?

1679
01:11:51,278 --> 01:11:52,546
Let's just say
there's some people

1680
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,147
who really want
what you're selling.

1681
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:55,949
You don't have to do this.

I can give you a very
comfortable life, Col...

Um...

1684
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,288
You forgot my name again,
didn't you?

1685
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:02,322
No, I didn't.
Yeah.

1686

1687

Don't say fucking Colin.

1688
01:12:05,959 --> 01:12:08,496
Fuck! I don't give a shit
what your name is.

You're the fucking help!

1690
01:12:09,897 --> 01:12:12,500
Nice try, Colin... but Stan
and I already sold it to...

It's Fredrick!

paid me for one...

Blow that thing
all you want, lady.

1702

Yeah? Why don't
you blow me, Colin.

Penny Morgan bullshit.

1753
01:15:17,018 --> 01:15:19,420
Yeah, "You look
just like my dead mama.

1754
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:21,089
"Wah."

1755
01:15:21,122 --> 01:15:22,423
And fuck you for saying

1756
01:15:22,456 --> 01:15:25,660
I look anything
like that fucking beast.

1757
01:15:25,694 --> 01:15:27,696
No wonder your father
never had the son he wanted.

1758
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:29,631
You fuck that monster once...

1759
01:15:29,664 --> 01:15:31,966
and you just drop
the fucking mic and walk out.

1760
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,302
Fuck you. Everything
you've said is a lie.

1761
01:15:34,335 --> 01:15:35,870
Oh.

1762
01:15:35,904 --> 01:15:37,939
What happened? Did I hit
a little sore spot?

1763
01:15:37,972 --> 01:15:39,874
Yeah, he always wanted a
son, and you knew it.

1764
01:15:41,175 --> 01:15:43,311
Look, he wanted you
to take over the business.

1765
01:15:43,344 --> 01:15:46,014
He was just afraid you were
gonna get yourself killed.

1766
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,316
So if you wanna live, and you
wanna unload that bomb...

1767
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:49,851
you stick with me.

1768
01:15:49,884 --> 01:15:52,353
And if you got
a problem with that...

1769
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:53,655
you know what you
can do, Rayna?

1770
01:15:56,224 --> 01:15:57,726
You and your bullshit accent

1771
01:15:57,759 --> 01:16:00,028
can land this fucking plane
by yourselves.

1772
01:16:01,963 --> 01:16:04,966
Okay, bodyguard.

1773
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:07,201
But if I find out you're lying
to me about any of this...

1774
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:10,238
I'll show you ways to die
you never even dreamed of.

1775
01:16:12,073 --> 01:16:15,309
Now, let's go to Budapest.
I need a fucking drink.

1776
01:16:15,343 --> 01:16:16,678
Yeah, I bet you fucking do.

1777
01:16:22,116 --> 01:16:23,184
(SIGHS)

1778
01:16:23,217 --> 01:16:24,653
Oh, my God.

1779
01:16:26,354 --> 01:16:31,425
♪ People want my power
And they want my station

1780
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:36,197
♪ Stormed my winter palace
But they couldn't take it

1781
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:40,068
♪ Try to pull my status
But they couldn't fake it ♪

1782
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:46,074
Welcome back to the Four Seasons
Budapest, Miss Boyanov.

1783
01:16:46,107 --> 01:16:47,108
Don't talk to me.
You're not my friend.

1784
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:48,176
Get away from me.

1785
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,944
Move. Move! I got it.

1786
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,948
So, what's the plan?
Who are we meeting?

1787
01:16:53,982 --> 01:16:55,950
You're my bodyguard,
not my business partner...

1788
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:57,819
so just focus
on guarding my body.

1789
01:16:57,852 --> 01:16:59,520
So not knowing
who we're meeting tonight

1790
01:16:59,553 --> 01:17:00,588
is gonna make me
extra effective.

1791
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:01,923
That's okay. I get it.

1792
01:17:01,956 --> 01:17:03,391
I got shit to do.
You'll probably be fine.

1793
01:17:03,424 --> 01:17:05,393
Why don't I go get you
a nice dress to be buried in?

1794
01:17:05,426 --> 01:17:06,426
Dumbass.

1795
01:17:07,996 --> 01:17:09,430
I'm meeting
a potential bidder,

1796
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:11,132
if you must know.

1797
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:12,633
If they don't top
the current offer,

1798
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:13,827
the sale
will happen tomorrow.

1799
01:17:14,302 --> 01:17:15,303
Where?
I don't know yet.

1800
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:24,212
Anton!

1801
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:25,780
Ouch!

1802
01:17:25,814 --> 01:17:28,349
Anton is part of my
security team, psycho!

1803
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:30,885
Yeah, well, guess what?
I don't like his face.

1804
01:17:30,919 --> 01:17:32,386
I don't like the looks
of your face!

1805
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,988
And who the fuck are you?

1806
01:17:34,022 --> 01:17:35,790
I'm the person that's gonna
cut your dick off

1807
01:17:35,824 --> 01:17:37,625
and glue it
to your forehead...

1808
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:38,626
so you look like
a limp-dick unicorn.

1809
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:40,128
That's who the fuck I am.

1810
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:41,662
Your name should be
"Mr. Bag o' Dicks"...

1811
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:42,964
not "Anton."

1812
01:17:42,997 --> 01:17:46,100
Okay. Jesus.
Let's just calm down, okay?

1813
01:17:46,134 --> 01:17:48,636
Does he not look like a bag o' dicks?
Enough.

1814
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:50,271
I can see why my father
liked you now.

1815
01:17:51,605 --> 01:17:53,274
Amber is my hired bodyguard.

1816
01:17:53,908 --> 01:17:55,810
Be more like her.

1817
01:17:55,844 --> 01:17:58,212
And your head better not have
broken my fucking phone.

1818
01:18:08,256 --> 01:18:09,991
We've got a big night
ahead of us.

1819
01:18:10,024 --> 01:18:11,860
Don't be afraid
to clean yourself up, Amber.

1820
01:18:11,893 --> 01:18:13,427
Take a shower
is what I'm saying.

1821
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:15,396
Yeah? Don't be afraid
to hit water yourself.

1822
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:17,531
You smell like a dead hooker
that washed up on the beach...

1823
01:18:17,565 --> 01:18:18,833
then roasted in the sun
for a week

1824
01:18:18,867 --> 01:18:20,134
before anybody found
her body.

1825
01:18:20,168 --> 01:18:22,136
Okay. You need
to take it way down.

1826
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:23,571
I'm sorry, that's too much.
Okay, that was too much.

1827
01:18:23,604 --> 01:18:24,939
Jeez!
Too much.

1828
01:18:24,973 --> 01:18:25,973
God.

1829
01:18:32,947 --> 01:18:34,048
What are you staring at?

1830
01:18:35,549 --> 01:18:37,218
I will destroy you.

1831
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:38,619
And then after
I'm done destroying you,

1832
01:18:38,652 --> 01:18:40,789
I'll take a picture
of what's left...

1833
01:18:40,822 --> 01:18:42,957
of your body, and I'm gonna
text it to your mother.

1834
01:18:42,991 --> 01:18:44,893
With a little note that says
his last words were...

1835
01:18:44,926 --> 01:18:47,195
"My mother was terrible.
You did this to me."

1836
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:48,329
That's so fucking mean.

1837
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:49,597
Yeah, I'm so fucking mean.

1838
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:50,664
You're just
figuring that out?

1839
01:18:50,698 --> 01:18:51,866
Give me your coat.

1840
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,567
This is a man's coat.

1841
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:55,603
Yeah, but I don't
see a man, do I?

1842
01:18:55,636 --> 01:18:57,371
I see a reject from
The Sound of Music.

1843
01:18:57,405 --> 01:19:00,608
It was my mother's coat,
but she's very masculine.

1844
01:19:00,641 --> 01:19:03,477
You look like ABBA took a shit
and put a trench coat on it.

1845
01:19:03,511 --> 01:19:05,379
Well, I won't
give it to you.

1846
01:19:05,413 --> 01:19:06,414
I've been in this dress
for 12 fucking hours.

1847
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:07,447
Give me your coat.

1848
01:19:07,548 --> 01:19:09,050
No.

1849
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:12,120
Yeah. No, I won't give...
This is my coat.

1850
01:19:12,153 --> 01:19:13,855
I'm gonna reach through
your fucking body...

1851
01:19:13,888 --> 01:19:15,790
and rip out your back
like a fucking werewolf.

1852
01:19:16,424 --> 01:19:17,992
Without tearing the jacket.

1853
01:19:18,026 --> 01:19:19,527
Just so I can
wear your jacket,

1854
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,195
and give you a final
"Fuck you."

1855
01:19:21,229 --> 01:19:22,696
Oh, no, you won't.

1856
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:24,132
I'm gonna take
that fucking coat.

1857
01:19:24,165 --> 01:19:25,366
(GROANING)

1858
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:27,501
I warned you, you Swedish
gummy fish motherfucker!

1859
01:19:27,535 --> 01:19:28,535
ANTON: Ouch!

1860
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:33,975
Oh, my God.

1861
01:19:34,742 --> 01:19:35,944
Oh, my God.

1862
01:19:37,145 --> 01:19:38,813
Nance?
Oh, my God, Susan!

1863
01:19:38,847 --> 01:19:41,215
Hello. Hello?

1864
01:19:41,249 --> 01:19:42,550
Just say something
to me, please.

1865
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:44,118
Susan? Anything.

1866
01:19:44,152 --> 01:19:45,954
I cannot handle this,
Susan!

1867
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:47,355
There is nothing
in real life

1868
01:19:47,388 --> 01:19:48,456
that someone could
do to a spy...

1869
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,658
that is filthier
or more upsetting

1870
01:19:50,691 --> 01:19:52,093
than what my brain
will cook up right now.

1871
01:19:52,126 --> 01:19:54,795
So save me from myself,
Susan!

1872
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:55,897
Because you know
what's going to happen.

1873
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:57,565
I'm gonna get chattier,
aren't I?

1874
01:19:57,598 --> 01:20:00,001
Did you know that you can't
ever change having big pores?

1875
01:20:00,034 --> 01:20:02,837
Oh, my God, Nancy,
you are driving me nuts!

1876
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:05,039
I couldn't talk because I was in
an elevator filled with people.

1877
01:20:05,073 --> 01:20:07,241
You're all right.
Oh, thank God.

1878
01:20:07,275 --> 01:20:09,878
You disappeared for 12 hours.
We didn't know what happened!

1879
01:20:09,911 --> 01:20:12,246
I had to take out my earpiece
and my camera.

1880
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,920
Rayna's on to our agents
and she was gonna

1881
01:20:13,948 --> 01:20:15,616
spot my equipment
from a mile away.

1882
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:17,318
You're with Rayna?

1883
01:20:17,351 --> 01:20:19,954
You're not supposed to be
within a mile away of her.

1884
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:21,489
Nancy, I know,
but I'm in deep

1885
01:20:21,522 --> 01:20:23,024
and I'm getting
such good intel.

1886
01:20:23,057 --> 01:20:24,392
Please,
I just need to remain

1887
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:26,360
on radio silence
just a little bit longer.

1888
01:20:26,394 --> 01:20:27,828
Well, don't worry,
because I'll be able

1889
01:20:27,862 --> 01:20:29,130
to keep a better eye
on you now.

1890
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:30,403
What are you
talking about? How?

1891
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,968
What are you doing here?

1892
01:20:34,002 --> 01:20:35,636
Elaine wanted to know exactly
what you were up to...

1893
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:38,172
so I tracked your earpiece.
They sent me here to find you.

1894
01:20:38,206 --> 01:20:39,473
They sent you?

1895
01:20:39,507 --> 01:20:40,909
I'm as unknown as you are,

1896
01:20:40,942 --> 01:20:42,110
so they thought
my cover was safe.

1897
01:20:42,143 --> 01:20:43,411
Did they give you
an identity?

1898
01:20:43,878 --> 01:20:45,413
It's so cool.

1899
01:20:45,446 --> 01:20:47,548
I said I wanted to be
Amber Valentine... What?

1900
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:49,083
...and they let me use it.

1901
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:50,251
I don't know why you got
to pick your identity.

1902
01:20:50,284 --> 01:20:51,752
I had to go
as a freaking cat lady.

1903
01:20:51,785 --> 01:20:52,887
RAYNA: Amber!
BOTH: Yes?

1904
01:20:52,921 --> 01:20:54,255
Who is this?

01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,072
God, I can't wait
to kill you.

2223
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:48,482
(GROANS)

2224
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:03,364
(SCREAMS)

2225
01:36:04,432 --> 01:36:05,432
Oh...

2226
01:36:06,367 --> 01:36:07,368
That's clean through.

2227
01:36:08,837 --> 01:36:09,971
Thanks for your weapon.

2228
01:36:10,004 --> 01:36:11,272
It's been inside you,

2229
01:36:11,305 --> 01:36:12,945
so I don't think
it should go inside me...

2230
01:36:23,818 --> 01:36:25,286
Get up. Get up!

2231
01:36:28,456 --> 01:36:31,059
You are under arrest
by Susan Cooper...

2232
01:36:31,092 --> 01:36:32,652
and the government
of the United States.

2233
01:36:42,703 --> 01:36:44,305
Rayna, how did you do that?

2234
01:36:44,338 --> 01:36:45,338
I didn't.

2235
01:36:45,673 --> 01:36:46,673
He did.

2236
01:36:54,182 --> 01:36:55,182
Hello, Coop.

2237
01:36:58,519 --> 01:36:59,587
Fine?

2238
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:00,620
Ow...

2239
01:37:01,322 --> 01:37:02,523
FINE: Hey.

2240
01:37:03,491 --> 01:37:04,558
Coop.

2241
01:37:17,505 --> 01:37:18,572
Wake up!

2242
01:37:19,573 --> 01:37:21,675
Did you have a nice nap?

2243
01:37:21,709 --> 01:37:23,511
You were snoring
very loudly.

2244
01:37:23,544 --> 01:37:24,845
That's just really
not the most

2245
01:37:24,879 --> 01:37:26,780
upsetting news right now.

2246
01:37:26,814 --> 01:37:28,950
My father used to
bring people here.

2247
01:37:28,983 --> 01:37:31,552
Did he also make you dress
like a slutty dolphin trainer?

2248
01:37:31,585 --> 01:37:33,254
He'd starve them...

2249
01:37:33,287 --> 01:37:34,688
torture them.

2250
01:37:34,722 --> 01:37:36,157
You name it.

2251
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,625
But he especially
didn't like it

2252
01:37:37,658 --> 01:37:39,027
when people lied to him.

2253
01:37:40,028 --> 01:37:41,595
Not that I bought it.

2254
01:37:41,629 --> 01:37:42,663
You knew?

2255
01:37:42,696 --> 01:37:44,132
Of course I knew.

2256
01:37:44,165 --> 01:37:46,800
I told you, you were better
off in the basement, Coop.

2257
01:37:46,834 --> 01:37:48,202
You could have
avoided all of this.

2258
01:37:48,236 --> 01:37:49,837
And what, Fine?

2259
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:51,572
Now you're a nuclear
black marketer?

2260
01:37:51,605 --> 01:37:52,640
A terrorist?

2261
01:37:52,673 --> 01:37:54,342
No...

2262
01:37:55,409 --> 01:37:57,078
He's just fucking me.

2263
01:38:04,752 --> 01:38:05,920
You're a loud kisser.

2264
01:38:06,988 --> 01:38:08,957
Excuse me?
You're a loud kisser.

2265
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:11,192
And it's gross
and unappealing.

2266
01:38:11,225 --> 01:38:12,726
You look like some
old, toothless woman

2267
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,062
sucking the jelly
out of a donut.

2268
01:38:15,529 --> 01:38:16,998
Hey, what's it like
sleeping with the man

2269
01:38:17,031 --> 01:38:18,566
that killed your father?

2270
01:38:18,599 --> 01:38:19,599
Nice try, Coop.

2271
01:38:21,202 --> 01:38:22,971
She already knows
it was Cress.

2272
01:38:23,171 --> 01:38:24,305
Ah.

2273
01:38:24,338 --> 01:38:25,773
Okay.

2274
01:38:25,806 --> 01:38:29,143
You've probably always been in
love with him, haven't you?

2275
01:38:29,177 --> 01:38:31,445
Talking in his ear...

2276
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:34,248
hoping eventually one day
he'll fall in love with you.

2277
01:38:34,615 --> 01:38:36,050
(CHUCKLES)

2278
01:38:36,084 --> 01:38:38,687
Poor little,
pathetic Susan Coleman.

2279
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,122
That's not my last name,

2280
01:38:40,155 --> 01:38:41,755
so it's really not much
of a burn, is it?

2281
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:42,824
Cooping.

2282
01:38:42,857 --> 01:38:43,892
No.

2283
01:38:43,925 --> 01:38:45,160
Croupon.

2284
01:38:45,194 --> 01:38:47,162
Are you thinking "Groupon"?

2285
01:38:47,196 --> 01:38:48,730
No, my name's not "Groupon."

2286
01:38:48,763 --> 01:38:50,532
Croupe.
Keep going.

2287
01:38:50,565 --> 01:38:51,967
Kapowski.

2288
01:38:52,001 --> 01:38:53,535
That's getting
further from it!

2289
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:56,738
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
let's just call you dead.

2290
01:38:56,771 --> 01:38:58,307
Hey, baby?

2291
01:38:58,340 --> 01:38:59,441
I thought we were gonna hang
on to her till tonight.

2292
01:38:59,474 --> 01:39:01,010
I changed my mind.

2293
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:05,347
Goodbye.

2294
01:39:05,981 --> 01:39:06,982
(CLICKS)
(GASPS)

2295
01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:09,218
(CHUCKLES)

2296
01:39:10,219 --> 01:39:11,686
Like I'd waste
a bullet on you.

2297
01:39:13,755 --> 01:39:14,990
Put her in the room.

2298
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:25,199
Ah!

2299
01:39:33,475 --> 01:39:34,475
Hey, Aldo.

2300
01:39:35,644 --> 01:39:37,846
Hello, captured lady.

2301
01:39:37,879 --> 01:39:39,214
I failed.

2302
01:39:40,649 --> 01:39:41,683
I failed the mission.

2303
01:39:42,684 --> 01:39:44,686
Fine is alive...

2304
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,521
and he's a traitor.

2305
01:39:46,555 --> 01:39:48,190
Don't be downhearted.

2306
01:39:50,092 --> 01:39:52,461
My mama said to me...

2307
01:39:52,494 --> 01:39:57,566
"Aldo,
life is full of sorrow...

2308
01:39:57,599 --> 01:39:59,068
"and surprises.

2309
01:40:00,102 --> 01:40:05,740
"But, a magnificent
pair of bosoms...

2310
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:09,078
"will..."

2311
01:40:11,913 --> 01:40:13,215
Good story.

2312
01:40:25,594 --> 01:40:27,129
Susan.

2313
01:40:27,162 --> 01:40:28,663
Get away from me.
No, listen.

2314
01:40:28,697 --> 01:40:30,099
I haven't got much time.

2315
01:40:30,132 --> 01:40:31,333
Why'd you do it, Fine?

2316
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,303
This was my only way in.

2317
01:40:34,336 --> 01:40:37,406
I had to fake my death
to gain Rayna's trust.

2318
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:39,674
I jammed the signal,
popped out my lens.

2319
01:40:39,708 --> 01:40:41,543
It was easy.

2320
01:40:41,576 --> 01:40:44,346
I hated to do it to you, Coop,
but I had to. I had to.

2321
01:40:44,379 --> 01:40:46,248
Rayna knew
all about our agents...

2322
01:40:46,281 --> 01:40:48,983
because Karen Walker
sold her the names.

2323
01:40:49,017 --> 01:40:50,285
I just couldn't trust anyone
at the agency

2324
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:52,421
not to give me away,
not even you.

2325
01:40:52,454 --> 01:40:54,089
How do I even know
you're telling me the truth?

2326
01:40:54,123 --> 01:40:56,091
Did Karen Walker
try to kill you?

2327
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:57,559
You shot her?

2328
01:40:57,592 --> 01:40:59,661
I'm deep undercover.

2329
01:40:59,694 --> 01:41:01,630
But not so deep that
I can't still protect you.

2330
01:41:03,031 --> 01:41:04,099
All right, look me
in the eye.

2331
01:41:04,133 --> 01:41:05,334
What?

2332
01:41:05,367 --> 01:41:06,801
Really look me
in the eye.

2333
01:41:09,638 --> 01:41:11,706
One of your eyes is bigger
than the other.

2334
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:12,807
Really?

2335
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:15,076
No.

2336
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:16,978
You're perfect,
God damn it.

2337
01:41:17,011 --> 01:41:18,447
Asshole.

2338
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,714
(GROANS) SUSAN: God! (GROANS)

2339
01:41:21,116 --> 01:41:22,384
That hurt.

2340
01:41:22,417 --> 01:41:24,619
Good, it was
supposed to.

2341
01:41:24,653 --> 01:41:25,920
Bosom.

2342
01:41:25,954 --> 01:41:27,622
Is he dangerous?

2343
01:41:27,656 --> 01:41:30,024
Only if you have boobs.

2344
01:41:30,058 --> 01:41:32,294
So did Rayna
really know I was a spy?

2345
01:41:32,327 --> 01:41:35,730
No. Not until you blew your
cover back at that kitchen.

2346
01:41:35,764 --> 01:41:38,099
I really thought she was more
experienced than that.

2347
01:41:38,133 --> 01:41:39,734
Thank God she's not, huh?

2348
01:41:39,768 --> 01:41:42,504
Because if she was,
you'd be dead now.

2349
01:41:42,537 --> 01:41:43,977
I think they're pretty
good covers...

2350
01:41:44,005 --> 01:41:45,640
I gotta go.

2351
01:41:45,674 --> 01:41:47,776
We're heading to De Luca's
villa to meet with Dudaev.

2352
01:41:47,809 --> 01:41:50,345
Then we're taking him
to wherever the bomb is.

2353
01:41:50,379 --> 01:41:51,446
This thing is almost over.

2354
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:54,616
Hang tight.

2355
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:01,323
Hello, bound lady.

2356
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:03,192
Not now, Aldo.

2357
01:42:03,225 --> 01:42:06,928
I think Mr. Fine
has underestimated you.

2358
01:42:06,961 --> 01:42:09,030
You found your targets,

2359
01:42:09,063 --> 01:42:10,783
you tracked them down,
you fought very hard.

2360
01:42:11,132 --> 01:42:12,367
Susan...

2361
01:42:14,102 --> 01:42:15,237
you are a good agent.

2362
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:19,874
You'll get them
next time, huh?

2363
01:42:21,643 --> 01:42:23,345
Unless we die here.

2364
01:42:26,215 --> 01:42:28,450
Then you will not.

2365
01:42:28,483 --> 01:42:30,419
You know what,
I'm not going down like this.

2366
01:42:30,452 --> 01:42:31,986
I need you to untie me.

2367
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,222
Bosom. What?

2368
01:42:33,255 --> 01:42:34,856
Stop! God damn it!

2369
01:42:35,824 --> 01:42:36,824
Just untie me.

2370
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:39,728
No, you heard Mr. Fine.
He's working a plan.

2371
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:40,862
We have to stay put.

2372
01:42:40,895 --> 01:42:42,697
Untie me. Now.

2373
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:47,736
That's my ass.

2374
01:42:47,769 --> 01:42:50,939
It is very difficult to see
or gauge my position.

2375
01:42:50,972 --> 01:42:52,341
You're just simply
grabbing my ass.

2376
01:42:52,374 --> 01:42:54,909
Oh. I am, sorry.

2377
01:42:54,943 --> 01:42:56,978
Let's roll
to our side.

2378
01:42:57,011 --> 01:42:58,079
God!

2379
01:42:58,112 --> 01:42:59,848
Oh! Hey!

2380
01:42:59,881 --> 01:43:02,951
The knot is very tight,
but I am making progress.

2381
01:43:02,984 --> 01:43:04,553
Your hand is way up in there.

2382
01:43:04,586 --> 01:43:08,290
My right hand is restrained
from the weight of my body.

2383
01:43:08,323 --> 01:43:09,691
Okay. Let's try this.

2384
01:43:09,724 --> 01:43:10,892

(GRUNTING)

2386
01:43:12,427 --> 01:43:16,798
Okay. I will
inchworm my way...

2387
01:43:17,299 --> 01:43:18,767
(GRUNTING LOUDLY)

2388
01:43:23,872 --> 01:43:25,274
You're being very loud.

2389
01:43:27,242 --> 01:43:28,543
(GROANING)

2390
01:43:29,611 --> 01:43:30,611
Shh!

2391
01:43:31,179 --> 01:43:32,514
(GROANING)

2392
01:43:34,015 --> 01:43:36,751
Wait. I have idea.

2393
01:43:36,785 --> 01:43:37,785
God. Another one?

2394
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,322
Oh, Jesus.
Don't move.

2395
01:43:40,355 --> 01:43:41,823
Wait, wait, wait!
Stay still.

2396
01:43:41,856 --> 01:43:43,091
No, no, no!

2397
01:43:43,124 --> 01:43:44,459
Yes, yes, yes.

2398
01:43:44,493 --> 01:43:45,994
Oh, God!
Yes.

2399
01:43:46,027 --> 01:43:47,729
Can't be happening.

2400
01:43:47,762 --> 01:43:49,898
Damn it, I was having
such an empowering moment

2401
01:43:49,931 --> 01:43:52,000
before this started.

2402
01:43:52,033 --> 01:43:57,272
My penis may be gently kissing
the back of your head.

2403
01:43:57,306 --> 01:43:58,840
Just untie me
before I crush your nuts.

2404
01:43:58,873 --> 01:44:00,342
Oh, please.

2405
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:02,877
If only we had time
for such pleasures.

2406
01:44:03,678 --> 01:44:05,547
Go!

2407
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,949
Your face and the knot
are about to enter my colon.

2408
01:44:09,884 --> 01:44:11,320
Stop licking it!

2409
01:44:13,355 --> 01:44:14,589
(BOTH GRUNTING)

2410
01:44:15,424 --> 01:44:16,858
It is done.

2411
01:44:16,891 --> 01:44:18,427
Thank you, Aldo.

2412
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:20,194
I don't wanna know
why my neck is wet...

2413
01:44:20,228 --> 01:44:22,096
but you did excellent work.
Prego.

2414
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:24,065
Turn around,
let me untie you,

2415
01:44:24,098 --> 01:44:25,600
and let's get
the fuck out of here.

I need you to alert
CIA and Interpol.

2418
01:45:13,247 --> 01:45:15,116
I'm gonna go to De Luca's
and back up Fine.

2419
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:16,229
You know where
the villa is?

2420
01:45:18,553 --> 01:45:20,855
I know everything.

2421
01:45:20,889 --> 01:45:23,324
One day, lady super spy...

2422
01:45:23,358 --> 01:45:24,859
Susan Cooper...

2423
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:26,761
I will fuck you.

2437
01:47:04,959 --> 01:47:07,161
Welcome to Lake Balaton.

2438
01:47:07,195 --> 01:47:08,597
I found this staircase

2439
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:11,633
and made them build
a house around it.

2440
01:47:11,666 --> 01:47:14,168
Our dear Mr. Dudaev
will be arriving shortly.

2441
01:47:15,704 --> 01:47:19,674
You are about to become
a very rich woman, Rayna.

2442
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:21,676
Which means you'll have to be
a little more careful...

2443
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:24,112
about the company you keep.

2444
01:47:24,145 --> 01:47:27,516
So many people have such
terrible agendas...

2445
01:47:27,549 --> 01:47:29,984
like perhaps
your friend here.

2446
01:47:30,018 --> 01:47:32,787
I can see his obvious
outer appeal.

2447
01:47:33,655 --> 01:47:35,056
You have terrific eyes.

2448
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:37,191
Thanks.

2449
01:47:37,225 --> 01:47:39,127
But he also works
for the CIA, doesn't he?

2450
01:47:40,461 --> 01:47:44,298
An odd choice of companion for
someone in your work, Rayna.

2451
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:47,368
Doesn't exactly inspire
confidence in those around you.

2452
01:47:47,401 --> 01:47:50,505
Fuck you, Sergio. You would never
talk to my father like that.

2453
01:47:50,539 --> 01:47:51,673
I never had to.

2454
01:47:51,706 --> 01:47:53,542
Mr. De Luca, it's true.

2455
01:47:53,575 --> 01:47:56,010
I worked for the CIA,
but they think I'm dead.

2456
01:47:56,044 --> 01:47:58,780
I'm with Rayna now, and I'm
here to help you both.

2457
01:47:59,681 --> 01:48:02,751
You and Karen Walker
are both double agents.

2458
01:48:03,885 --> 01:48:05,920
What's going on
at the CIA?

2459
01:48:05,954 --> 01:48:07,689
Drones taking all
the cool assignments?

2460
01:48:08,089 --> 01:48:09,089
(BOTH LAUGH)

2461
01:48:10,058 --> 01:48:11,498
If we don't get rid
of him right now,

2462
01:48:11,526 --> 01:48:12,761
I'm calling off the deal.

2463
01:48:14,763 --> 01:48:17,131
Don't you fucking dare.

2464
01:48:17,165 --> 01:48:18,633
Yeah, why don't you listen
to that asshole.

2465
01:48:18,667 --> 01:48:20,802
Don't you fucking dare.

2466
01:48:20,835 --> 01:48:23,572
You're a bit
outnumbered here, Miss...

2467
01:48:24,739 --> 01:48:26,040
I'm sorry, what the
fuck is your name?

2468
01:48:26,074 --> 01:48:28,810
Susan Cooper.
I'm with the CIA.

2469
01:48:28,843 --> 01:48:31,613
Jesus. Rayna, did you invite
the entire agency here...

2470
01:48:31,646 --> 01:48:34,348
or are they just having
a company retreat

2471
01:48:34,382 --> 01:48:35,684
at the villa next door?

2472
01:48:35,717 --> 01:48:37,151
God, you're funny, huh?

2473
01:48:37,185 --> 01:48:38,519
It's just me.

2474
01:48:38,553 --> 01:48:39,621
It's gonna be
in your best interest

2475
01:48:39,654 --> 01:48:41,790
to keep Fine and me alive.

2476
01:48:41,823 --> 01:48:44,559
I'm trying, but I'm not quite
following your logic.

2477
01:48:44,593 --> 01:48:46,394
You want me to slow it down
for you? Okay.

2478
01:48:46,427 --> 01:48:48,062
You're about to meet
with Solsa Dudaev...

2479
01:48:48,096 --> 01:48:51,099
a man I've been collecting
intelligence on for years.

2480
01:48:51,132 --> 01:48:52,634
And I'm guessing
that your boys here

2481
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:53,968
are too busy manscaping...

2482
01:48:54,002 --> 01:48:56,437
to have told you
how he does business.

2483
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:58,673
Because about half the people
he deals with end up dead.

2484
01:48:58,707 --> 01:48:59,941
I can tell you what
Dudaev's gonna do

2485
01:48:59,974 --> 01:49:02,043
five minutes before he
even thinks about it.

2486
01:49:02,076 --> 01:49:05,313
And I sure as shit know enough to
cover up a Russian flag tattoo...

2487
01:49:05,346 --> 01:49:07,115
since Dudaev's brother was
killed by the Russian military.

2488
01:49:07,148 --> 01:49:08,617
Jesus!

2489
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:10,885
You own a computer?
You heard of fucking Google?

2490
01:49:10,919 --> 01:49:12,320
I'll tell you another thing.

2491
01:49:12,353 --> 01:49:13,521
You know
your little girlfriend...

2492
01:49:13,554 --> 01:49:15,790
the one from
the Paris bombing?

2493
01:49:15,824 --> 01:49:17,491
She's just using you
to get to Rayna.

2494
01:49:17,525 --> 01:49:19,127
If it hadn't been for me
last night...

2495
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:20,662
she would've kidnapped her
at the club...

2496
01:49:20,695 --> 01:49:21,630
and then you'd be
standing here

2497
01:49:21,663 --> 01:49:22,831
with your dick
in your hand...

2498
01:49:22,864 --> 01:49:24,232
because you'd never
find that bomb.

2499
01:49:24,265 --> 01:49:26,367
So you need me, De Luca.

2500
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,603
And I'm not gonna help you
unless you keep Fine alive.

2501
01:49:35,043 --> 01:49:36,410
Now, let me
get this straight.

2502
01:49:36,444 --> 01:49:37,979
You work for the CIA...

2503
01:49:38,012 --> 01:49:40,649
yet you're willing to help me
sell a nuclear bomb...

2504
01:49:40,682 --> 01:49:42,183
in order to save
this man's life?

2505
01:49:42,216 --> 01:49:43,484
Why would I believe that?

2506
01:49:43,517 --> 01:49:45,620
Because she's in love
with him.

2507
01:49:47,021 --> 01:49:48,322
Yeah, so what?

2508
01:49:48,356 --> 01:49:50,024
This idiot
doesn't even know it.

2509
01:49:50,058 --> 01:49:52,326
Too dumb to know
I'd do anything for him.

2510
01:49:54,128 --> 01:49:55,930
And fuck the CIA, right?

2511
01:49:55,964 --> 01:49:57,766
What have they ever
done for me?

2512
01:49:57,799 --> 01:50:00,034
Took 10 years of my life,
gave me shitty pay...

2513
01:50:00,068 --> 01:50:02,837
put me in a basement with
a ceiling full of bats...

2514
01:50:02,871 --> 01:50:04,873
that pretty sure gave me pinkeye
or at least an allergy...

2515
01:50:04,906 --> 01:50:06,240
Something got fucked up
in my eye.

2516
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:09,477
I would've been out
a long time ago

2517
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:10,712
if it hadn't been for Fine.

2518
01:50:12,981 --> 01:50:16,050
So, yeah, I'll do anything
it takes to keep him alive.

2519
01:50:17,686 --> 01:50:19,620
That's pretty pathetic,
right?

2520
01:50:19,654 --> 01:50:22,023
(SCOFFS) Extremely pathetic.

2521
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:24,358
God, you're an asshole.

2522
01:50:24,392 --> 01:50:27,028
When this is over, I'm gonna
shave that fucking head.

2523
01:50:27,762 --> 01:50:28,797
All right, Miss Havisham.

2524
01:50:29,864 --> 01:50:31,365
I'll take you up
on your offer.

2525
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:33,935
But if you try anything,
I mean anything...

2526
01:50:35,203 --> 01:50:36,705
I'll make
your dream come true

2527
01:50:36,738 --> 01:50:38,378
and send you and
your boyfriend to heaven.

2528
01:50:40,341 --> 01:50:41,341
Let's go.

2529
01:50:54,588 --> 01:50:55,790
Mr. Dudaev.

2530
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:57,992
Welcome to Hungary.

2531
01:50:58,026 --> 01:51:00,695
Like Chechnya,
only easier to pronounce.

2532
01:51:01,562 --> 01:51:03,364
Enough with the bullshit.

2533
01:51:04,432 --> 01:51:06,467
Where is the package?

2534
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,704
Once my client
sees the payment...

2535
01:51:09,738 --> 01:51:12,473
she'll take us all to its
very secure hiding spot.

2536
01:51:12,506 --> 01:51:14,675
Wherever that may be.

2537
01:51:23,151 --> 01:51:24,185
I got it, handsome.

2538
01:51:26,154 --> 01:51:27,655
100,000,000 Euros

2539
01:51:27,688 --> 01:51:29,128
doesn't buy
what it used to, does it?

2540
01:51:32,861 --> 01:51:34,062
Nice ice, Solsa.

2541
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:37,165
Right.

2542
01:51:38,532 --> 01:51:39,834
He's all yours.

2543
01:51:39,868 --> 01:51:42,103
Gentlemen,
if you would follow me.

2544
01:52:09,164 --> 01:52:10,399
Here it is.

2545
01:52:10,432 --> 01:52:11,733
What is this bullshit?

2546
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:13,668
Bullshit?

2547
01:52:13,702 --> 01:52:15,470
Solsa, I'll have you know...

2548
01:52:15,504 --> 01:52:16,738
It's the nuke.

2549
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:19,741
Clever girl.

2550
01:52:26,415 --> 01:52:27,415
A lead-lined compartment.

2551
01:52:28,283 --> 01:52:29,551
RAYNA: Correct.

2552
01:52:29,584 --> 01:52:32,354
The lead lining is thick as to
mask any radiation detection.

2553
01:52:32,387 --> 01:52:34,723
My father was extremely
good at his job.

2554
01:52:34,756 --> 01:52:36,558
DE LUCA: Unbelievable!

2555
01:52:36,591 --> 01:52:37,831
You could have warned me,
Rayna.

2556
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:39,028
I've been throwing
my gym clothes

2557
01:52:39,061 --> 01:52:40,301
on top of that thing
for a week.

2558
01:52:56,812 --> 01:52:58,247
It is beautiful.

2559
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:00,515
Yes, it is.

2560
01:53:05,855 --> 01:53:06,935
What the fuck
are you doing?

2561
01:53:07,789 --> 01:53:08,858
Conducting business.

2562
01:53:14,997 --> 01:53:15,997
Uh-uh.

2563
01:53:17,799 --> 01:53:18,799
Put it in the helicopter.

2564
01:53:19,835 --> 01:53:20,955
And don't forget
my diamonds.

2565
01:53:24,606 --> 01:53:26,108
What the fuck is going on?

2566
01:53:26,141 --> 01:53:27,843
De Luca played you, Rayna.

2567
01:53:27,877 --> 01:53:29,378
And you led him right to it.

2568
01:53:29,411 --> 01:53:31,813
You didn't expect me
to let him have it, did you?

2569
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:34,316
I mean, it's like giving a
Stradivarius to a hillbilly.

2570
01:53:34,349 --> 01:53:36,018
I have a buyer
who's willing to pay me

2571
01:53:36,051 --> 01:53:38,620
500,000,000 Euros for it.

2572
01:53:38,653 --> 01:53:40,055
And Dudaev would've
never been able

2573
01:53:40,089 --> 01:53:42,557
to get that bomb
onto American soil.

2574
01:53:42,591 --> 01:53:44,526
My buyer will have it in the
middle of New York City...

2575
01:53:44,559 --> 01:53:46,295
and use it next week.

2576
01:53:47,496 --> 01:53:48,998
So, you know,

2577
01:53:49,031 --> 01:53:50,265
if you haven't seen
Phantom yet...

2578
01:53:50,299 --> 01:53:52,434
So, what?

2579
01:53:52,467 --> 01:53:54,347
Does this mean you're gonna
kill me too, Sergio?

2580
01:53:54,736 --> 01:53:56,005
I'm afraid so.

2581
01:53:56,906 --> 01:53:58,340
Sorry, Rayna.

2582
01:53:58,373 --> 01:53:59,708
It's just cleaner that way.
You understand.

2583
01:53:59,741 --> 01:54:00,910
Explain it to me, De Luca!

2584

2587
01:54:14,256 --> 01:54:15,925
Thanks for the
performance, folks.

2588
01:54:15,958 --> 01:54:17,459
But sorry, Rayna,
show's over.

2589
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:25,399

2593
01:54:48,823 --> 01:54:49,824

01:55:24,393 --> 01:55:25,560
Did I get him?

2609
01:55:25,594 --> 01:55:27,562
De Luca's got the bomb
on the helicopter. Get up!

are you doing?

(EXHALES)

2706
01:59:45,019 --> 01:59:47,222
Good job, guys.
Sorry about the lake.

2707
01:59:47,256 --> 01:59:48,357
All right, motherfucker,
don't push.

2708
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:49,958
You're gonna
get your pictures.

2709
01:59:49,991 --> 01:59:51,326
There's enough 50
to go around.

2710
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:52,527
You know I just helped
kill a terrorist, right?

2711
01:59:52,561 --> 01:59:53,962
You ever see Kanye
do some shit like that?

2712
01:59:53,995 --> 01:59:55,364
He never, never!

2713
01:59:59,468 --> 02:00:01,403
Isn't this wonderful?

2714
02:00:01,436 --> 02:00:03,872
I was hoping to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

2715
02:00:03,905 --> 02:00:05,740
Give me some quality time
to deal with the fact...

2716
02:00:05,774 --> 02:00:07,894
that I was sleeping with
the man who killed my father.

2717
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:09,644
Anyway. Call my lawyer.

2718
02:00:09,678 --> 02:00:10,979
Get the Goyard tote
from the hotel.

2719
02:00:11,012 --> 02:00:12,247
I need everything on time...

2720
02:00:12,281 --> 02:00:14,048
Do you think
I still work for you?

2721
02:00:14,082 --> 02:00:16,818
Whatever. Fuck you.

2722
02:00:16,851 --> 02:00:19,421
I knew you really liked me.

2723
02:00:20,589 --> 02:00:21,589
Hey!

2724
02:00:23,758 --> 02:00:25,594
Fuck you too.

2725
02:00:30,532 --> 02:00:32,000
Don't touch
my fucking hair!

2726
02:00:34,336 --> 02:00:35,570
What are you looking at?

2727
02:00:40,208 --> 02:00:41,676
Oh, God, Aldo, don't...

2728
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:44,713
I am too tired
to fend off your groping.

2729
02:00:44,746 --> 02:00:45,947
(WITH BRITISH ACCENT)
Please.

2730
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:48,249
I understand completely.

2731
02:00:48,283 --> 02:00:51,085
Look, my real name
is Albert...

2732
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:52,421
MI6.

2733
02:00:52,454 --> 02:00:55,290
Look, I'm sorry if
my disguise was a bit much.

2734
02:00:55,324 --> 02:00:57,225
I just like to really
get into character.

2735
02:00:57,258 --> 02:00:59,160
Although I fear
I may have become

2736
02:00:59,193 --> 02:01:01,029
overexcited
at certain points.

2737
02:01:01,062 --> 02:01:02,263
Little bit.

2738
02:01:02,297 --> 02:01:03,732
By way of apology...

2739
02:01:03,765 --> 02:01:06,635
should your work ever
bring you to London...

2740
02:01:06,668 --> 02:01:09,237
I would love
to take you for dinner.

2741
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:11,906
Okay. Yeah,
I think that would be nice.

2742
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:13,342
Wonderful.

2743
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:19,080
God!

2744
02:01:19,113 --> 02:01:21,983
(WITH ITALIAN ACCENT) How you
like my English accent, huh?

2745
02:01:22,016 --> 02:01:25,354
I learn it from
the Downton Abbey.

2746
02:01:25,387 --> 02:01:27,027
(WITH BRITISH ACCENT)
No, I'm only joking.

2747
02:01:27,288 --> 02:01:28,623
Or am I?

2748
02:01:28,657 --> 02:01:29,758
Oh, my God.

2749
02:01:30,825 --> 02:01:31,825
FINE: Coop.

2750
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,127
Great work.

2751
02:01:33,161 --> 02:01:34,829
What a job.

2752
02:01:34,863 --> 02:01:36,565
Super Cooper.
Really amazing.

2753
02:01:36,598 --> 02:01:38,199
Thanks.
ELAINE: Yes, it was.

2754
02:01:38,232 --> 02:01:39,300
You really came through.

2755
02:01:39,334 --> 02:01:40,635
Thank you, ma'am.

2756
02:01:40,669 --> 02:01:42,036
I'd like to keep you
out in the field for now.

2757
02:01:42,236 --> 02:01:43,738
Wow.

2758
02:01:43,772 --> 02:01:45,807
We need you to fly
to Prague tomorrow...

2759
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,076
to infiltrate an international
drug-smuggling ring.

2760
02:01:48,109 --> 02:01:49,378
Here's your new identity.

2761
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:52,980
You in, Cooper?

2762
02:01:54,148 --> 02:01:56,818
Agent Susan Cooper
reporting for duty, ma'am.

2763
02:01:56,851 --> 02:01:59,020
Nobody says or does that, but great.
I won't do that.

2764
02:01:59,053 --> 02:02:00,053
Okay.

2765
02:02:00,389 --> 02:02:01,790
Thank you.

2766
02:02:01,823 --> 02:02:04,125
Francis Mays is an
unemployed telemarketer

2767
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:05,360
living off her
disability checks.

2768
02:02:05,394 --> 02:02:07,562
Oh, sweet Jesus!

2769
02:02:07,596 --> 02:02:10,164
And who wears reading glasses
in their passport photo?

2770
02:02:10,198 --> 02:02:12,300
She's only kidding.
She got ya!

2771
02:02:12,333 --> 02:02:14,202
(ALL LAUGHING)

2772
02:02:14,235 --> 02:02:15,704
Oh, my God!
That was a good one!

2773
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:20,108
Yeah, actually, I'm not. I
don't have a sense of humor.

2774
02:02:20,141 --> 02:02:21,175
No, you don't.

2775
02:02:21,209 --> 02:02:22,844
We'll talk soon.

2776
02:02:22,877 --> 02:02:25,380
Glad the pinkeye
is under control.

2777
02:02:25,414 --> 02:02:26,815
That was actually
an allergy...

2778
02:02:26,848 --> 02:02:27,949
Okay. Got it.

2779
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,918
So, you're a spy now, Coop.

2780
02:02:29,951 --> 02:02:30,951
Yeah.

2781
02:02:31,453 --> 02:02:32,320
Congratulations.

2782
02:02:32,353 --> 02:02:34,222
Thanks.

2783
02:02:34,255 --> 02:02:35,223
I don't think
I'll ever find anyone

2784
02:02:35,256 --> 02:02:36,456
as good as you
in the basement.

2785
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:39,894
I think you will.

2786
02:02:39,928 --> 02:02:41,563
There's a lot of good people
down there.

2787
02:02:43,732 --> 02:02:44,966
So, hey...

2788
02:02:44,999 --> 02:02:48,537
I know a great little
restaurant right near here.

2789
02:02:48,570 --> 02:02:52,941
Maybe you and I could go
for a nice, long dinner?

2790
02:02:59,814 --> 02:03:00,982
You know what,

2791
02:03:01,015 --> 02:03:03,452
I'm just kind of feeling
like a girls' night.

2792
02:03:04,318 --> 02:03:05,954
You understand, right?

2793
02:03:05,987 --> 02:03:07,922
Yeah, sure.

2794
02:03:07,956 --> 02:03:09,858
I'll catch you later.
You go have a great time.

2795
02:03:09,891 --> 02:03:10,891
Thank you.

2796
02:03:12,561 --> 02:03:14,429
You're a lot furrier
than I thought you'd be.

2797
02:03:15,063 --> 02:03:16,665
Yeah.
Yeah.

2798
02:03:16,698 --> 02:03:17,999
Smell you later, pal.
(CHUCKLES)

2799
02:03:20,802 --> 02:03:22,971
Hey, Coop.

2800
02:03:23,004 --> 02:03:25,974
All those things you said
about me to De Luca...

2801
02:03:27,842 --> 02:03:28,842
Did you mean that?

2802
02:03:30,011 --> 02:03:31,012
God, I admire you.

2803
02:03:34,516 --> 02:03:35,950
Glad you're still
alive, Beverly,

2804
02:03:35,984 --> 02:03:37,385
you silly fucking
girly wanker!

2805
02:03:37,418 --> 02:03:38,520
God!

2806
02:03:39,087 --> 02:03:40,154
Nice work, Cooper.

2807
02:03:41,289 --> 02:03:43,458
Wow. Is that a compliment?

2808
02:03:43,492 --> 02:03:44,993
That's not easy
for you to do.

2809
02:03:45,026 --> 02:03:46,795
Fuck it. Look, you
did a good job.

2810
02:03:46,828 --> 02:03:48,663
Probably just beginner's
luck, though.

2811
02:03:48,697 --> 02:03:51,032
There we go.
Where did you get a suit?

2812
02:03:51,065 --> 02:03:52,767
I fucking made it,
didn't I?

2813
02:03:52,801 --> 02:03:54,135
It's nice.

2814
02:03:54,168 --> 02:03:55,904
You still out
of the CIA?

2815
02:03:55,937 --> 02:03:58,006
Probably not.
They need me.

2816
02:03:58,039 --> 02:04:00,041
I think I need to spend some
time on my own first, though.

2817
02:04:00,074 --> 02:04:01,075
Clear my head.

2818
02:04:02,376 --> 02:04:04,679
I'm gonna take this
down the coast.

2819
02:04:04,713 --> 02:04:07,015
Maybe spend some time in Italy.
Drive it to Greece.

2820
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:10,952
Sometimes a man
needs to go to sea.

2821
02:04:11,553 --> 02:04:12,821
SUSAN: Sounds good, Ford.

2822
02:04:12,854 --> 02:04:13,888
Good for you.

2823
02:04:14,823 --> 02:04:15,823
Take care.

2824
02:04:16,357 --> 02:04:17,357
NANCY: Bye.

2825
02:04:20,061 --> 02:04:21,696
FORD: Arrivederci.

2826
02:04:24,332 --> 02:04:25,500
Do you think
he knows that's a lake?

2827
02:04:25,534 --> 02:04:27,636
No, I don't.

2828
02:04:32,707 --> 02:04:34,643
Let's go.
Okay.

2829
02:04:34,676 --> 02:04:36,845
You can't let anybody see
how sore I am.

2830
02:04:36,878 --> 02:04:37,979
I got you.
Okay.

2831
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:39,280
Come here.

2832
02:04:39,313 --> 02:04:41,415
My glutes
are really seizing up.

2833
02:04:41,449 --> 02:04:43,117
If you're sore,
I'll tell you what.

2834
02:04:43,151 --> 02:04:45,053
Take a hot bath and then
we're gonna celebrate.

2835
02:04:45,086 --> 02:04:47,221
I hope you like champagne
and beef jerky.

2836
02:04:47,255 --> 02:04:48,489
Well... Oh. That's a...

2837
02:04:48,523 --> 02:04:49,691
You have to!

2838
02:04:49,724 --> 02:04:51,425
Because I stole
a case of it...

2839
02:04:51,459 --> 02:04:52,661
I don't know
if I like them together.

2840
02:04:52,694 --> 02:04:54,797
...out of 50 Cent's
helicopter!

2841
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:57,032
Slower, slower.

2842
02:04:57,066 --> 02:04:59,234
FORD: Cooper,
is this a fucking lake?

2843
02:05:00,936 --> 02:05:03,138
How the fuck
do I get to Italy?

2844
02:05:06,576 --> 02:05:07,977
