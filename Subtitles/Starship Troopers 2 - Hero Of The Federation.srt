1
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:59,593
Our war is going better than ever.

2
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:04,427
But we need heroes! We need you.

3
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:09,440
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

4
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:13,607
Service guarantees citizenship.
Would you like to know more?

5
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:17,941
The sky marshal launches
Operation March to Victory.

6
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:20,988
A bold, new strategy
calling for total war...

7
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:24,947
...against the Bug, on every front.

8
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:39,306
Would you like to know more?

9
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,142
Look out! Look out!

10
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,441
Fall back!

11
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,115
Retreat! Retreat!

12
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,078
- We need pickup now!
- Yes, sir!

13
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:05,706
Sir, this is Mobile Infantry Bravo 6
to Fleet Rescue.

14
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,245
It's Bravo 6 to Fleet Rescue.

15
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,171
Fall back!

16
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,315
Retreat!

17
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,819
Horton, Sandee, pull back!

18
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,232
Help me with this, goddamn it!

19
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:40,566
You're okay, Sandee. I got you.

20
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,500
- You're okay!
- Hold what you've got!

21
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,709
- Come on, Bug!
- Tor!

22
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,837
Cover our 6!

23
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,415
Oh, that 6.

24
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:56,385
Hey, Bug!

25
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:00,844
Do you copy? Do you copy?

26
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,016
Brick! Cover Tor!

27
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:06,223
- Tor.
- Come and get some from Tor, baby!

28
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:17,649
Otter!

29
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:20,234
Fight or die, soldier!

30
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:23,037
- Private Sahara!
- Yes, sergeant?

31
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:26,410
Private Otter is a dead man.
If he won't fight, shoot him!

32
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,494
Sir!

33
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:32,716
Just pull the trigger, Billie!
It's not enough, but it'll have to do.

34
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:35,761
- Fleet Rescue to Bravo 6.
- Go ahead, Fleet Rescue.

35
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:39,512
Fleet Rescue to Bravo 6,
rescue priority is no-go, MI.

36
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:43,596
Colt-Victor-one-niner is negative
for pickup!

37
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,221
Hold the perimeter!
Hold that line!

38
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:49,391
- Hold the line!
- I don't want excuses!

39
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,228
I want a crossfire!

40
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:54,073
Get in and plug that hole.
Plug that hole!

41
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,489
- General, Fleet's no-go for pickup.
- We gotta make a move.

42
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,067
- Hold the line!
- Bugs have got Coy!

43
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:04,113
This is General Shepherd.
You jackass! We need pickup!

44
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:10,168
Bravo 6 to Fleet Rescue,
do you copy?

45
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:13,881
General, getting a vision.
It isn't clear.

46
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,880
They're building up.
They're all around us.

47
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:20,846
Lieutenant, you're the psychic!
Tell me something I don't know!

48
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,811
It's something massive.
It'll take us all out.

49
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:27,597
- I can't get it all, but...
- General! There's an outpost.

50
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:30,646
Hotel Delta 185,
abandoned eight days ago!

51
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:32,361
Half a klick that way.

52
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,236
- Middle of Satan's Anvil?
- Bugs own that real estate, general.

53
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,110
There's no cover on the Anvil.

54
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,568
We're gonna have a rough ride,
lieutenant!

55
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,074
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,455
You, you, you, and you, stay here.

57
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,452
Everybody else move out!

58
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:49,369
Request permission to remain
with the general.

59
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:51,125
- That's negative, Rake.
- Sir?

60
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:54,004
- Lieutenant Dill will assume command.
- Yes, sir!

61
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:57,012
He's the psychic.
You're the war fighter!

62
00:04:57,304 --> 00:04:59,974
Move them out, sergeant!
Give them hell!

63
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:03,387
Yes, sir!
Prepare to withdraw.

64
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,471
Withdraw!

65
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:09,224
- Let's go, move it, move it, move it!
- Come on, Billie.

66
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,524
Keep going!

67
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:14,270
Let's go!

68
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:18,782
Follow me!

69
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:29,374
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

70
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:39,849
- Get out!
- Go, go, go! Come on!

71
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:44,518
Let's go!

72
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:46,727
Let's go!

73
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:48,227
Move it!

74
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,522
Move it, move it, move it!

75
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,630
Where's my frigging outpost, corporal?

76
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,548
It's here. We're here...

77
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:38,732
About time, corporal.
That soup's gonna boil!

78
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,912
- Move out!
- Let's go! Come on, come on!

79
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,369
- Let's go! Come on, suck it up!
- Hurry up!

80
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:47,543
Move, move, move!

81
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:52,211
- Take cover!
- Let's get out of here!

82
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:58,593
Move it, Otter!
Come on, move it.

83
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:01,511
Come on! Hurry up.

84
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:04,471
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

85
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:06,888
Come on.

86
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,414
- Get down!
- Over there!

87
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,455
- Hurry up.
- Grab that door.

88
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:33,336
Bill, help me, help me...

89
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,588
Come on, Billie, come on!

90
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,137
Take my hand!

91
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:43,102
Come on! Stay down.

92
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:44,641
No!

93
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,188
- Come on!
- It's okay. I got you.

94
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,560
Otter, Kobe, get down!

95
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,911
Keep going.
Come on.

96
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:07,832
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Come on.

97
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:11,048
- Go.
- Kobe, look out!

98
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:23,685
Tor! Brick!

99
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,226
With me! Move!

100
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:34,740
Tor, Horton! Get Kobe inside!

101
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:38,075
- Brick, with me. Go!
- Come on!

102
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:40,735
Stay with me, buddy!

103
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,998
Sandee! Move on!

104
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:50,580
Here we go.
You're all right, you're all right.

105
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,532
Brick! You and Sandee...

106
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:20,402
...take a squad, set a perimeter.
Sahara? Get that door closed.

107
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,825
Sir!

108
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,241
Make a hole!

109
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:28,619
- Make it wide!
- Sahara! Out of the way!

110
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:32,879
- Coming through.
- Get out of the way!

111
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,794
Right, easy. Take it easy.

112
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,879
Watch his back.

113
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,017
Get his pack off!
Horton, cut that radio off!

114
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:45,060
Get that off him.

115
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:47,983
Take it easy.

116
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,436
You're all right.
Where are those meds?

117
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:23,346
Where are those meds?
Damn it!

118
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:36,030
- Sergeant?
- It's fine.

119
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:39,237
- Sergeant!
- Just take it easy. Take it easy.

120
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:42,367
I want someone on that com,
and I want pickup.

121
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,781
Yes, sir, wouldn't we all?

122
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:49,209
- That's a direct order, sergeant.
- No-go on the door, sarge.

123
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,000
Stay down. Relax, buddy.
You gotta relax.

124
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:56,883
Why can't you do anything
for this man, Tor?

125
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,219
Private!

126
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,310
Get on that com.
I want pickup now!

127
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:08,103
- What are you looking at, private?
- Sir, com don't run without power.

128
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:12,404
Well, at OCS, you learn that a sergeant
is the solution to any problem.

129
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,363
So you get the power up.

130
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:17,652
They say what kind of boat
Fleet lands in a shit-storm?

131
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,615
I am giving the orders!
You will take them!

132
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:24,407
I want the goddamn power!
And I want it now!

133
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:58,318
I am waiting, sergeant.

134
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:04,114
Horton, Otter, Sahara, with me.

135
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,890
Shit. Sir?

136
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,477
Might want to see this.

137
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:32,906
Radio's nonoperational.

138
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,113
Coming, lieutenant?

139
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,490
Looks like Colonel Hohlback
left in a hurry.

140
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,744
What the hell is that?

141
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:03,156
I'd say we've got company.

142
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:10,246
Horton! You and Otter locate
the reactors and fire them up.

143
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:25,476
What is that?

144
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,390
Outpost incinerator.

145
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,239
Move away from the door!

146
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,494
Why are you still here, soldier?

147
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:54,463
Probably because no
one lit the furnace.

148
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:01,677
Captain V.J. Dax.

149
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:03,929
Says here he's a big hero.

150
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:08,851
Combat medals, Bronze Stars, Purple
Heart, Purple Heart, Purple Heart.

151
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:11,234
Federal Medal of Valour
at Widowmakers.

152
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:12,686
That's a lot of crap.

153
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:16,281
Wounded four times, refused numerous
battlefield commissions...

154
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:18,408
Give me that.

155
00:16:10,174 --> 00:16:13,340
- Some hero.
- You murdered Colonel Hohlback?

156
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:16,713
He had his Morita and a sidearm.

157
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:21,216
I just used my hands.

158
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,434
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

159
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:26,476
He's a mad dog.
He stays in the cage.

160
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,482
Just remember, lieutenant,
every dog has its day!

161
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,227
Sarge! Hostiles!

162
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,447
I am in command here, private.

163
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,575
Now, how many and
what's our situation?

164
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:42,866
- Looks like a whole damn circus.
- Let's go.

165
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:50,758
Trooper!

166
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,322
Shelter!
Right perimeter, spread wide!

167
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,367
You three, follow me.

168
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:26,662
- He's spreading us too thin!
- You know something I don't, trooper?

169
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,270
They're shifting their lines!

170
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,516
You, take the left!
Take the middle! Take the right!

171
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,370
Sandee! Report!

172
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,659
Nothing! No movement!

173
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,162
Come on, you bastards!
What are you waiting for?

174
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:04,614
Shut up, fathead!

175
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:08,080
- You starting with me?
- Just like covering your 6, huh?

176
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,309
Prepare to fire!

177
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:32,196
Otter, get up!

178
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:38,364
Fire! Fire! Fire!

179
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:50,955
Come on! Bug!

180
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,536
Son of a bitch!

181
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,789
Pull back!

182
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,206
Come on, go, go!
I got you covered!

183
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:34,670
Billie. It's okay. It's okay!

184
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:40,383
Go, go, go, go!

185
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,978
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

186
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:58,829
Give me your hand.

187
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:01,748
- What?
- Give me your hand.

188
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,502
Look out!

189
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,475
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Don't let go!

190
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,224
No!

191
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,564
Pull back your line, lieutenant!

192
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:51,917
Weapon!

193
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:03,896
Let's go.

194
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,566
Bug!

195
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:26,623
Get down!
Move!

196
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:36,429
- All right, people, listen up!
- Who the hell let you out?

197
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:40,548
- In about 15 seconds...
- All right, you son of a bitch...

198
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,563
Shield your eyes at count zero!

199
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:48,145
Pass the word!

200
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,071
Get off your ass,
there's a war going on.

201
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,564
You two! With me on flank!

202
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,907
Perimeter burn in 10 seconds.

203
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:04,249
Perimeter burn in 10 seconds.

204
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:06,295
Look out!

205
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:12,880
Come on!

206
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:22,803
Three.

207
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,139
Two.

208
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:27,474
One.

209
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:29,276
Zero.

210
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:34,785
Perimeter burn.

211
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,745
I need two volunteers.

212
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:30,713
- Who do you think you are?
- The big stick that's running this show.

213
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:33,546
- I'll go.
- Me too.

214
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,967
If we're not back inside of five minutes,
it means more Bugs are on the way.

215
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,549
You mean we didn't kill them all?

216
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:42,934
You never kill them all, son.

217
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,927
All right, who's got...?

218
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:19,434
A light.

219
00:24:21,812 --> 00:24:23,472
Otter, take a knee.

220
00:24:24,482 --> 00:24:27,732
- You see those busted wires there?
- Yes, sir.

221
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:30,737
You got the wiggle room, kid.
Splice them together.

222
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:32,862
Trooper, hand me that...

223
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,868
Where's your knife?

224
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,162
I must have lost it, sir.

225
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:47,087
Anyone who loses his knife in my unit
would be strung up for lashes, kid.

226
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,844
You want to be careful
with the red wire.

227
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,525
We got movement!

228
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:09,983
Horton, illumination round.

229
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:18,864
Hold your fire, we're coming through!

230
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,748
It's the general.

231
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,955
I see him!
He's bringing home two.

232
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:26,421
He's bringing home three.

233
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:29,459
Wonder who didn't make it.
Hope it wasn't Goldy.

234
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:33,501
He was nice to me on my first day.
It's those little things that count.

235
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,886
Yeah, like doing your goddamn job.

236
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:38,762
Hostiles! Right on your general's ass!

237
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:40,892
Come on, kid!

238
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:30,278
Outstanding.

239
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:33,816
- That stinks!
- You get so you like it after a while.

240
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:37,444
- Son, I'll never forget it.
- Me neither, sir.

241
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,916
What kind of a-hole do you think I am?
Put her there!

242
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:43,745
Welcome back, sir.

243
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,040
I don't know who you are,
but you're aces with me.

244
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:51,881
It's nothing personal, general.
I'm just doing my job.

245
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:55,256
Hey, fellas, let me give you a hand.

246
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:01,769
Hell, I got a dog back home
weighs more than she does.

247
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:15,906
Well, look what the cat drug in!

248
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:20,243
You should see that damn cat!
We're in the shitter, huh?

249
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,574
- We got a chance.
- Good to see you.

250
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,827
Want the bad news or the bad news?

251
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:28,038
- I almost forgot your knife.
- Keep it, kid.

252
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:30,708
- No, I couldn't.
- Trooper needs a knife.

253
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:33,043
Officers just tell troopers
where to die.

254
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:38,844
- That's not really true, is it, sir?
- Watch out for officers, son.

255
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:40,893
It's their job to get you killed.

256
00:27:47,944 --> 00:27:51,395
First wave came in,
and Deke and Slater were killed.

257
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,530
Came in again and that...
That kid Goldy was gone.

258
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:01,623
And then it was just...

259
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:04,957
...me and O'Hara.

260
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:08,462
That magnificent son of a bitch.

261
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:11,672
We held them.

262
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:16,221
I tell you, this...

263
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:21,933
...star don't mean a hill of beans when
you're caught between shit and sweat.

264
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:25,522
And then these two beautiful
bastards show up.

265
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:30,188
These two here, and they're carrying
a couple of grenades...

266
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:33,068
...and they got a boatload of gumption.

267
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,234
And they saved my sorry ass!

268
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:37,903
And I'd like to introduce you to them.

269
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,081
This is Corporal Joe Griff,
Medical Corps.

270
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,919
And this is Technical
Sergeant Ari Peck.

271
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:47,669
And I can't tell you a thing about
Sleeping Beauty over here...

272
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,052
...because she snored through
the whole damn thing.

273
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,094
That's Private Soda, sir.

274
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:56,933
She didn't sleep after our
unit got chopped down.

275
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,050
Found Peck the next day,
what, about five days ago?

276
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:05,441
Everybody's gotta sleep sometime.

277
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:07,943
What's your story, Peck?

278
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:13,568
32nd Tech Brigade,
sole survivor, sir!

279
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:15,118
That's me.

280
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:19,407
Been out there about a month,
near as I can tell.

281
00:29:20,707 --> 00:29:22,249
That's a long time.

282
00:29:22,418 --> 00:29:25,584
Pretty long, yeah. I guess.

283
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,922
Well, then, we got to get you home.

284
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:31,753
Lieutenant Dill.

285
00:29:31,928 --> 00:29:34,799
- Yes, sir!
- Has pickup been arranged?

286
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,103
- Sergeant Peck, can I talk to you?
- Yes, sir?

287
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,361
You think you can make this com talk
and squawk like it ought to?

288
00:29:54,534 --> 00:30:01,203
Well, you can bet I'll die trying, sir.

289
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:07,672
- Get some sleep and try later.
- Oh, no, no. I'll get on this right now.

290
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:09,549
That's outstanding, sergeant!

291
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:12,718
You're a credit to your
Mobile Infantry unit. Thank you.

292
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:15,176
When is the last time
you took a shower?

293
00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:19,262
Let's worry about the sniff factor
after we get our asses unslung.

294
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:21,061
Yes, sir.

295
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:37,486
We could sit pretty tight if we could
shut this door, sergeant.

296
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:39,371
I'll get someone on it.

297
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:43,500
At least there's one man looking
in the right direction.

298
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,998
Yes, sir.

299
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:56,305
What's wrong with her, corporal?

300
00:30:56,474 --> 00:31:00,260
It's the wind, sir.
Dries out the membranes.

301
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:04,512
- She'll be fine when she wakes up.
- She's got the right idea.

302
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,353
Good night, troopers.

303
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:09,485
Get some sleep, all of you!

304
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:11,446
That's an order.

305
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,857
- And, Dill...
- Yes, sir.

306
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,411
I want a full report of today's
action when I wake up...

307
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,451
...explaining how you got five
of my troopers killed.

308
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,249
Yes, sir.

309
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,499
You heard the man.
Hit the sack!

310
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:37,136
Not you, trooper.

311
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:38,637
Yes, sir?

312
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,511
Letting that criminal loose is a
court-martial offence, private.

313
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:44,184
I thought he could help us.

314
00:31:44,358 --> 00:31:48,652
You thought the judgment of a murderer
was preferable to an officer's?

315
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:52,819
Well, that'll make for a hell
of a compelling defence.

316
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:57,153
I wasn't thinking, sir.
It was intuition.

317
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,371
Intuition?

318
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,251
I had no idea you were psychic.

319
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:10,963
I scored high when I was a kid, sir.

320
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:12,417
Really?

321
00:32:14,722 --> 00:32:17,011
Why aren't you wearing the black?

322
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,509
I became inconsistent, sir.

323
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:22,393
Onset of puberty?

324
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,809
It happens to you women.

325
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,070
- When is it gonna happen to you?
- Excuse me?

326
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:35,115
Puberty. I hear it's a necessary step
on the way to becoming a man.

327
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,073
You're addressing an
officer of the Federation.

328
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,083
Shove that officer crap
up your Buster Brown.

329
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,492
An officer who behaves
as you did today...

330
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,670
...and takes it out
on a trooper ain't a man!

331
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,504
I'm not a man? What kind of a man
turns his back on the Federation?

332
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,136
I'm glad you asked.

333
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:56,136
I trained a generation of people to
throw themselves into the grinder.

334
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,977
The Federation chewed them up
and spit them out.

335
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:03,095
So now when they say, " Push on
to glory," I say, "What glory?"

336
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:07,403
What would you know about glory?
You call yourself a hero?

337
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:13,074
No, son. That's something other people
call you, and it's really just a trick.

338
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:17,703
When you throw your life away, instead
of fool, they call you hero.

339
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:22,998
And as for glory, ask her. She'll
tell you everything you need to know!

340
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:25,660
How dare you?

341
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,423
Just one man's opinion.

342
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,296
No, it's not. It's treason!

343
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,298
Then maybe you ought to shoot me.

344
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,432
Now, there's something
we agree on.

345
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:42,053
Well, go ahead. Take out that
popgun and have at it, soldier.

346
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:48,519
I believe in the rules and regulations
that the Federation stands for.

347
00:33:48,697 --> 00:33:50,653
Very good, lieutenant!

348
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:52,781
But you left out the kids.

349
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:54,908
- What?
- Cowards.

350
00:33:56,078 --> 00:34:00,325
They always hide behind
rules and children.

351
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,843
I'll see you hang!

352
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:16,264
Just so long as it's regulation rope.

353
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:24,899
Oh, let's see.

354
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:33,947
Got your mystery meat sticks,
egg caps, hardtack, beans.

355
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:38,068
Insta-veggie meal,
Choco-pudding Delite.

356
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,729
Sweet tooth, huh?

357
00:35:05,193 --> 00:35:08,110
Taps in 15 minutes.

358
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:17,905
I'll get you!

359
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,991
Nice to have you with us, trooper.

360
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,077
You've been out for a long time.
How you feeling?

361
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:03,541
I feel good, sir.

362
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:05,164
You fit for duty?

363
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:07,796
Raring to go.

364
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:13,634
Well, that's outstanding.

365
00:36:50,844 --> 00:36:53,596
What's the ETA on a door
we can shut, gentlemen?

366
00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:57,762
Well, sir, I think that should do it.

367
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:00,508
If you'll hold on...

368
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:14,317
- Watch out for the cables!
- The cables. Stop it! Stop it!

369
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:16,403
Do it, do it, do it.

370
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,662
Shit.

371
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:29,630
Great, you welded
the damn thing open.

372
00:37:29,802 --> 00:37:31,082
You idiots.

373
00:37:32,054 --> 00:37:34,593
All personnel to the perimeter.

374
00:37:36,517 --> 00:37:39,353
Troopers, you heard the man.
Let's go!

375
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,225
Get moving!
Take that weapon. Come on.

376
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:45,767
Sandee, Horton, Soda, Brick,
come on, you lazy bastards.

377
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:49,395
Let's move it.
Move, move, move, move!

378
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:52,616
Sahara.

379
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,406
You two over there, you two
front and running. Where's my OP?

380
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:03,328
Man your post! Go, go, go!

381
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:13,253
- What's wrong?
- General, there's something...

382
00:38:13,431 --> 00:38:14,711
Move!

383
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:19,852
Scouting parties, sir, 100 metres out.

384
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,061
When they figure
that fence is down...

385
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:26,099
...they're gonna show up like relatives
to a rich man's funeral.

386
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,606
- Let there be light.
- Yeah.

387
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:38,405
- Yeah!
- Here we go. We got power.

388
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:41,578
That's what I'm talking about.
I can see you now.

389
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,422
Hey, general?

390
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:48,918
- Peck, is this your doing?
- It's a little wonky...

391
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,965
...but it'll hold. I hope.

392
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:54,296
You have our tremendous
gratitude, Peck.

393
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:58,138
Oh, it was nothing, sir.

394
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:02,013
I'll get back to work on the com now.

395
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,349
- Attaboy, Peck.
- Way to go, Peck.

396
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:09,354
Peck. Peck. Peck.

397
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:11,607
All right.

398
00:39:14,537 --> 00:39:16,992
Dax, the charges
against you are serious...

399
00:39:17,163 --> 00:39:20,165
...but I can't afford to lose a man
of your experience.

400
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,625
Give me your word
as an officer you'll do your duty.

401
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:28,091
I'm no longer an officer, general,
but I'll give you my word as a man.

402
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,628
Your rank is restored
until your guilt or innocence...

403
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:33,678
...is determined by a hearing.

404
00:39:33,932 --> 00:39:37,016
Well, I can assure you
I killed Colonel Hohlback.

405
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:41,770
Then I guarantee you'll hang, but until
then, I expect you to do your duty.

406
00:39:41,939 --> 00:39:44,645
- Yes, sir.
- I want forward OP.

407
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:47,024
Three watches a day.

408
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:50,528
Fences fail, troopers get lazy.

409
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:53,784
- You carry on, captain.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:40:33,326 --> 00:40:34,821
Something I can do for you?

411
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:39,200
I just came to say thanks
for saving my ass.

412
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:41,539
That's the job.

413
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:46,046
How come you don't sleep inside
like everyone else?

414
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:49,212
I figure this is where
the enemy will show up.

415
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:54,214
No telling what kind of fun
you could get in out here, huh?

416
00:40:57,811 --> 00:41:02,188
- Are you flirting with me, soldier?
- No, sir, I don't flirt.

417
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:06,646
- Never?
- Never ever, sir.

418
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:11,776
- Well, you're the real deal.
- The genuine article.

419
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:15,287
And you want some action.

420
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,830
You'll get all the action you want
after the Bugs show up.

421
00:41:25,214 --> 00:41:27,206
You know...

422
00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:32,336
...it's all the waiting that gets me.

423
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:38,849
Oh, I see.

424
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:43,606
You need something
to occupy your mind.

425
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:55,446
Come here.

426
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,457
That's good right there.
Drop and give me 100.

427
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:07,090
- Sir?
- You got a lot of energy, trooper.

428
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:10,841
Now get down and start counting.

429
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:13,254
Yes, sir.

430
00:42:15,683 --> 00:42:20,476
One, two, three, four...

431
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:25,313
...five, six, seven...

432
00:42:25,528 --> 00:42:27,070
Make it 200.

433
00:42:56,644 --> 00:42:59,051
You lose something?

434
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:05,520
Yo, you're the new guy, so l...

435
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:08,071
Can we play too?

436
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:11,905
I got mess duty.

437
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:15,196
- Thanks for the wake up, Soda.
- Pleasure.

438
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,037
You sure you know
what you're doing?

439
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:21,908
Oh, I got a pretty good idea, but...

440
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:24,620
...you know,
practice does make perfect.

441
00:43:24,798 --> 00:43:27,503
Nice.

442
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:29,751
Come on, Billie.

443
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:08,374
No, no, forget it, Sandee. He's a jerk.

444
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:14,173
Hey, Sandee...

445
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,636
- What's with her?
- Horton's with the new girl.

446
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:24,436
- Sipping some Soda.
- Ain't war hell?

447
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:40,293
Who goes there?

448
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,582
Horton?

449
00:44:45,423 --> 00:44:47,665
Oh, it's you.

450
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,549
Sorry.

451
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:56,600
You okay?

452
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:59,057
No.

453
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,647
- Anything I can do?
- No.

454
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:06,528
At least let me take a look
at that cut on your chin.

455
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:09,406
This? It's just a scratch.

456
00:45:09,865 --> 00:45:12,071
General wants everybody tiptop.

457
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,949
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah?

458
00:45:20,126 --> 00:45:23,081
How long have you been out here?

459
00:45:24,464 --> 00:45:27,667
- All my life, it seems like.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

460
00:45:27,843 --> 00:45:31,675
I've been here for eight months,
and I've only seen the sun twice.

461
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:35,514
Might be a little easier
if you took your helmet off, Jill.

462
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:44,893
God, what happened to your fingers?

463
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:48,901
- You know, muzzle burn.
- That looks really bad.

464
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:52,822
Hey, who's the medic here
anyway, huh?

465
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:57,571
Hey, Joe.

466
00:45:57,748 --> 00:45:59,159
Yeah?

467
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:02,168
Has anybody ever told you
what a nice smile you have?

468
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:06,082
Yeah.

469
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:08,549
Probably.

470
00:46:11,096 --> 00:46:13,219
Feeling better?

471
00:46:14,058 --> 00:46:15,967
No.

472
00:46:18,354 --> 00:46:20,181
Do you want to?

473
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:53,972
- What happened to her, corporal?
- Just a nosebleed, sir.

474
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:56,134
She's gonna be fine.

475
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,762
- How do you feel?
- You know how I feel.

476
00:47:03,276 --> 00:47:05,316
What gives?

477
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:08,191
It looks like we got
a couple new couples.

478
00:47:08,365 --> 00:47:12,315
No wonder we're losing this war.
Everyone's fucking instead of fighting.

479
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:16,493
What are you looking at?

480
00:47:16,664 --> 00:47:19,998
- Get back to work.
- I'll get to work.

481
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:29,504
- Good morning, captain.
- What makes you think so?

482
00:47:29,678 --> 00:47:31,837
Why, are we in for it?

483
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:36,593
- Sooner or later.
- You got time for breakfast?

484
00:47:38,062 --> 00:47:42,309
You're welcome to join me, as long as
you don't expect cheerful conversation.

485
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:44,772
Not a morning person, huh?

486
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:48,064
No, I'm a miserable, murdering bastard.

487
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:50,909
- And that's on a good day.
- What's a bad day like?

488
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,160
Any one day in particular
you're interested in?

489
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,037
No.

490
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:02,749
That second lieu-y
send you to question me?

491
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,290
- Lieutenant Dill? He thinks I'm an idiot.
- Are you?

492
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:11,045
- Me? Yeah. Definitely.
- Trust me, I got you beat.

493
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:16,424
Well, I fell in love, and I got busted
down from corporal for fraternisation.

494
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:20,766
- So who wants to be a corporal?
- Here's the idiot part.

495
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,684
He got killed.

496
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,269
You really some kind of psychic?

497
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:33,946
Yeah. Maybe. I guess.
Not like Dill, not Psi Corps.

498
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,488
Well, your fella...

499
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:41,410
...did you know he was gonna
buy the farm?

500
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:44,078
It doesn't work that way.

501
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:45,916
Well, that's good, I guess.

502
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:49,461
Maybe that's why I don't
believe in all that bunk.

503
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:54,801
Those tags belong
to the troopers that you lost...

504
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:58,766
...and you wear them because you feel
responsible for what happened.

505
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,352
That's a lucky guess.

506
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:04,975
- Why'd you kill your CO?
- You tell me.

507
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:07,525
I'm not that good.

508
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:11,897
He gave some stupid orders
that got kids killed.

509
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,195
One day too many,
or too many one day.

510
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,869
- Maybe I'm the wheel that broke.
- You ought to forgive yourself.

511
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:20,118
It's war.

512
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,041
Don't spend too much time
around me, trooper.

513
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:27,418
I'd hate to end up wearing your tags.

514
00:50:02,754 --> 00:50:05,459
Stupid Bug.

515
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:09,260
You're relieved.

516
00:50:09,428 --> 00:50:11,504
Thanks.

517
00:50:31,534 --> 00:50:34,239
Hey... Hey, trooper?

518
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:38,706
Who's that?

519
00:50:38,876 --> 00:50:41,082
Peck.

520
00:50:43,964 --> 00:50:46,372
Hey, sarge, what do you need?

521
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,050
Well, I could use a hand.

522
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:54,592
Buddy, anything I can do
for you is aces by me.

523
00:50:54,809 --> 00:51:01,096
You think you could
lie down on the fl...?

524
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:06,150
- The floor?
- Floor. And reach behind the cons...

525
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:10,817
I got it, I got it. You want me to lay on
the floor and reach behind the console.

526
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:15,113
Okay.

527
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:17,323
Here we go.

528
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:22,124
Son of a...

529
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,959
How's this?

530
00:51:30,346 --> 00:51:32,718
Oh, God!

531
00:51:32,932 --> 00:51:34,676
Help!

532
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:38,846
Gotta keep quiet.

533
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,405
Help! Help!

534
00:52:33,912 --> 00:52:35,287
We got com.

535
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,746
We got com.

536
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:44,920
This is Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Rescue.

537
00:52:45,091 --> 00:52:47,416
Come in, Fleet Rescue.

538
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:53,429
This is Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Rescue.

539
00:52:54,976 --> 00:52:57,218
- This is...
- How's that report coming?

540
00:52:57,437 --> 00:53:02,727
Well, I'm not so much writing a report
as building your gallows, Dax.

541
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:06,733
- I didn't take you for a carpenter.
- Shift to Command frequency.

542
00:53:06,905 --> 00:53:10,072
There was this other carpenter
a few thousand years ago...

543
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:12,698
...a better man than you or me.

544
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:16,155
Well, that carpentry business
was the death of him.

545
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:19,500
Be careful of what you build
and what crosses you bear.

546
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:23,583
- Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Command.
- Lieutenant.

547
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:29,093
Roger, Hotel Delta,
this is Fleet Command. Over.

548
00:53:29,262 --> 00:53:34,090
This is the 701 st Mobile Infantry,
Bravo Company, requesting pickup.

549
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:37,678
Take a number, MI.
We got stragglers all over the planet.

550
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:42,438
- What's your name, sailor?
- Fleet Lieutenant Mary Klinghof.

551
00:53:42,651 --> 00:53:46,352
- Getting smart won't help you, jarhead.
- You listen up, fruit fly.

552
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:48,818
This is General Jack Gordon Shepherd.

553
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,157
And if somebody doesn't make
this pickup their priority...

554
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:54,949
...I’m gonna make it
my priority to come down...

555
00:53:55,122 --> 00:53:57,792
...and chew out some Fleet-ass,
starting with you.

556
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:01,162
Sorry, sir, I didn't know
who I was talking to.

557
00:54:01,379 --> 00:54:03,704
- That's because you're a moron.
- Yeah.

558
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:06,669
Yes, sir, but we got
a lot of wounded out there.

559
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:10,711
The wounded come first. Any excuses
after that come out of your butt.

560
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:13,095
Shepherd, out.

561
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,842
Where's Peck?
I'm gonna give him a medal.

562
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,056
- Asleep, sir. Dead on his feet.
- Well, he's earned it.

563
00:54:20,232 --> 00:54:25,024
- Any day on that door, Brick.
- We're all waiting for something, sarge.

564
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,521
- But it ain't the door.
- Outstanding.

565
00:55:06,196 --> 00:55:08,236
Not you, trooper.

566
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:10,821
- Lucky guess.
- We're all gonna die.

567
00:55:11,035 --> 00:55:15,364
- What would you know about glory?
- It doesn't work that way.

568
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:20,417
- Lf he won't fight, shoot him!
- No!

569
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:24,458
- Sahara.
- I haven't seen him.

570
00:55:24,632 --> 00:55:26,791
- Wake up.
- The wheel that broke.

571
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,419
Wake up.

572
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:32,051
Wake up.

573
00:55:58,417 --> 00:56:02,498
Give me a little more.
Don't be shy. Come on.

574
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:12,096
Yeah. Oh, trouble at the trough.

575
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:14,472
It's gonna get ugly.

576
00:56:18,188 --> 00:56:20,311
- What's eating Tor, huh?
- Not you.

577
00:56:20,523 --> 00:56:25,649
Yeah, I guess you're right.
War does some weird things to people.

578
00:56:49,763 --> 00:56:51,554
Everything okay?

579
00:56:58,188 --> 00:57:01,355
No, I'm... Yeah, I'm fine.

580
00:57:19,627 --> 00:57:24,669
- You look a little shaky, trooper.
- Yeah, something's not right.

581
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:27,926
That's what they call it
when you're behind enemy lines.

582
00:57:28,095 --> 00:57:30,004
It feels worse than that.

583
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,133
Oh, is this another one
of your psychic hot flashes?

584
00:57:33,308 --> 00:57:35,265
It seems like Tor has changed.

585
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:38,223
Because he wouldn't take
Brick's bait? About time.

586
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:42,015
- It seems sudden, sarge.
- Like you puking your guts out?

587
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,814
I guess I'm coming down
with something.

588
00:57:44,987 --> 00:57:47,823
- I wonder what that could be?
- There's a big knot...

589
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:49,651
...where my stomach used to be.

590
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:53,693
Sarge, I barely touched the medic's
hand just now, and I saw something.

591
00:57:53,872 --> 00:57:56,826
- You saw something?
- Something terrible.

592
00:57:57,374 --> 00:58:01,420
- Maybe you're just going crazy.
- I love you too, sarge.

593
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:04,920
Girls get wacky
when they're pregnant.

594
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:08,502
Suddenly, they know everything
about everything.

595
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:11,514
Oh, Jesus.

596
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:16,766
Yeah, you're about as psychic
as a doorknob, trooper.

597
00:58:50,722 --> 00:58:52,596
You ready?

598
00:58:52,766 --> 00:58:57,844
I'm kind of tired.

599
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:04,106
- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, thanks.

600
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:06,734
Oh, my shoe.

601
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:09,149
Don't worry about it.

602
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:17,780
- Are you scared to shower, Otter?
- What does it matter?

603
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,788
We're going home
in a few hours anyway.

604
00:59:38,147 --> 00:59:39,557
Hi, guys.

605
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:47,780
Holy God, what the...?

606
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,638
Oh, God. Oh, God.

607
01:00:26,989 --> 01:00:30,690
Open the door! Open the door!
We're gonna die in here!

608
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:33,111
Open the door!

609
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:07,529
Captain, I need to talk to you,
but it's gonna sound crazy.

610
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,030
- Well, spit it out, trooper.
- Look, sir...

611
01:01:10,202 --> 01:01:12,989
...I know I'm not really
supposed to be psychic...

612
01:01:13,163 --> 01:01:15,203
...but I have this terrible feeling.

613
01:01:21,046 --> 01:01:24,000
- Yes, sir.
- As you were.

614
01:01:24,174 --> 01:01:29,466
We have a situation here that requires
the attention of Military Intelligence.

615
01:01:30,014 --> 01:01:32,587
- Tell him.
- This morning, in the mess...

616
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:36,433
...I accidentally touched Griff's hand.
I might've had a vision.

617
01:01:37,022 --> 01:01:39,145
Playing psychic again, private?

618
01:01:39,315 --> 01:01:41,853
Could you keep
an open mind here, lieutenant?

619
01:01:42,026 --> 01:01:44,433
This trooper's
got information that's vital.

620
01:01:44,654 --> 01:01:48,237
Some of the troopers have been
acting a little strange lately.

621
01:01:52,245 --> 01:01:55,449
Describe what you saw.

622
01:01:55,624 --> 01:01:58,080
He wasn't a man.
He was some other thing.

623
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:00,921
Maybe 1000 things.
Somehow he was connected...

624
01:02:01,088 --> 01:02:06,083
...to Tor and Sandee and Horton
and that new girl, Soda.

625
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:11,218
I've always been pretty fuzzy, sir,
and this came through sharp as a knife.

626
01:02:12,683 --> 01:02:15,638
Lieutenant, I know I'm not
a real psychic like you.

627
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:19,856
In fact, I just found out
I'm pregnant, and I didn't have a clue.

628
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:25,521
- You're pregnant?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid so.

629
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:28,657
You might be interested to know
that in our studies...

630
01:02:28,825 --> 01:02:32,526
...pregnancy has been shown
to heighten psychic ability.

631
01:02:32,704 --> 01:02:35,871
That's too bad because
I'd really like to be wrong.

632
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:41,789
Yes, me too, but I keep having
the same feeling.

633
01:02:41,963 --> 01:02:44,336
What is it?

634
01:02:44,508 --> 01:02:46,548
They're coming to wipe us out.

635
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:49,506
What's so new about that?

636
01:02:49,972 --> 01:02:55,098
I mean the whole species, everything
human. And they have a plan.

637
01:02:56,145 --> 01:02:59,764
Look, after what I did in the battle...

638
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:02,610
...I wasn't very sure
of myself anymore.

639
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:06,858
And I just figured everybody
thought I'd just cracked.

640
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:15,241
Yesterday, I might have been
inclined to agree...

641
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,874
...but that would've been me
screwing up, lieutenant.

642
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,672
Thank you, sir.

643
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:32,385
I'll get on this matter
with General Shepherd immediately.

644
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,678
Oh, and, trooper...

645
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:37,977
...that was some good work.

646
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,106
Sir.

647
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:13,012
General Shepherd?

648
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:20,353
What are you doing in here?

649
01:04:22,152 --> 01:04:25,236
General Jack and I
were just having a chat.

650
01:04:25,406 --> 01:04:27,647
What are you doing here, Dill?

651
01:04:27,824 --> 01:04:29,699
You and Shepherd?

652
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,620
Is that so hard to believe?

653
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:40,834
General?

654
01:04:41,005 --> 01:04:43,792
General Shepherd?

655
01:04:48,262 --> 01:04:50,137
General...

656
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:08,906
They're inside of you. Oh, God.

657
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:15,122
Back up, or I'll drill your damn skull.

658
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:17,823
Get back! Get away from the door.

659
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:19,587
Get away.

660
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:25,873
You bastards. You're all under arrest...

661
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:30,678
...for murder, sedition,
for treason against the Federation...

662
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:34,683
Oh, and you're gonna pay
because we're not gonna kill you.

663
01:05:34,894 --> 01:05:39,058
Oh, no. No, you see, we got
special places for things like you...

664
01:05:39,232 --> 01:05:40,857
...where they cut you up.

665
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:43,599
But they keep you alive
while they cut you up...

666
01:05:43,779 --> 01:05:48,774
...so they can see what makes you tick,
and they'll see what makes you sick.

667
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:54,995
And I'll be there. Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna be there to see...

668
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:10,467
You're under arrest, Dax.

669
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,799
On what charge?

670
01:06:12,975 --> 01:06:14,767
Murder.

671
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:43,498
- Captain Dax, what's happening?
- No talking to the prisoner.

672
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,891
Keep him covered.
You gave me your word, Dax.

673
01:06:57,106 --> 01:07:01,103
What makes you think I had
anything to do with this, general?

674
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:12,442
- Lock him up, sergeant.
- Yes, sir. With pleasure, sir.

675
01:07:20,963 --> 01:07:24,380
- Get out of here now, Sahara.
- Move it.

676
01:07:33,268 --> 01:07:35,426
You know what to do, Billie.

677
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:37,726
Yes, sir.

678
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:51,911
Why are you doing this, Billie?

679
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,905
It's not you and me.
It's gonna happen to all of us.

680
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:10,553
You trying to make a baby
with my barracks door, private?

681
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:18,355
Sahara, she don't want it,
but I gotta give her the Bug.

682
01:08:18,523 --> 01:08:23,862
- There's a wire loose in your head.
- No, it's a little piece of God.

683
01:08:24,029 --> 01:08:28,074
Not like the one people used
to believe in, or the Federation...

684
01:08:28,826 --> 01:08:34,413
...and it's filling me up. I can sort
of feel myself floating away.

685
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:37,542
Kid, you're not making any sense.

686
01:08:39,087 --> 01:08:42,005
You'll understand when you wake up.

687
01:08:42,173 --> 01:08:44,842
When I wake up?

688
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:54,260
- Don't fight.
- That'll be the day.

689
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:09,317
No!

690
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,615
You lonely, captain?

691
01:10:42,257 --> 01:10:45,128
Billie, please don't. Please.

692
01:14:37,544 --> 01:14:40,000
What the hell's going on, sergeant?

693
01:14:40,505 --> 01:14:43,756
- The Bugs are inside, sir.
- Inside the perimeter?

694
01:14:43,968 --> 01:14:45,628
No, sir.

695
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,006
Inside me.

696
01:14:49,224 --> 01:14:51,679
Sergeant, no! No!

697
01:15:07,701 --> 01:15:09,279
Keys.

698
01:15:12,289 --> 01:15:14,661
- What the hell kind of Bug is that?
- Jesus.

699
01:15:15,251 --> 01:15:19,083
One that gets inside and takes over.
Maybe it can tell us something.

700
01:15:19,712 --> 01:15:21,622
What are you talking about?

701
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:43,486
Everything that happened here
was supposed to happen.

702
01:15:43,696 --> 01:15:46,188
The Bugs brought us here
to create a weapon.

703
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:49,362
- What kind of weapon?
- Shepherd!

704
01:15:50,037 --> 01:15:52,507
He could bring this
to the top of the Federation!

705
01:15:52,873 --> 01:15:54,367
We gotta kill the general.

706
01:16:14,979 --> 01:16:16,889
Fire in the hole!

707
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:24,901
You're gonna die!

708
01:16:27,242 --> 01:16:29,366
They don't kill so easy, do they?

709
01:16:29,578 --> 01:16:32,069
- You're gonna die!
- They're not like us, sir.

710
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:35,539
Not anymore. They're Bugs.

711
01:16:39,254 --> 01:16:43,667
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die!

712
01:16:45,594 --> 01:16:47,920
They shut down the reactors.

713
01:17:04,281 --> 01:17:05,609
Sandee?

714
01:17:07,283 --> 01:17:08,943
Grenade!

715
01:17:11,872 --> 01:17:13,865
Sahara, you okay?

716
01:17:21,633 --> 01:17:23,376
Poor creatures.

717
01:17:26,011 --> 01:17:28,550
Why must we destroy you?

718
01:17:28,722 --> 01:17:30,382
I'll tell you why.

719
01:17:31,893 --> 01:17:35,725
Order is the tide of creation...

720
01:17:36,272 --> 01:17:38,977
...but yours is a species...

721
01:17:39,317 --> 01:17:42,983
...that worships the one over the many.

722
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:46,609
You glorify your intelligence...

723
01:17:46,784 --> 01:17:50,864
...because it allows you
to believe anything.

724
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,905
That you have a destiny.

725
01:17:55,167 --> 01:17:57,325
That you have a right.

726
01:17:57,962 --> 01:18:00,287
That you have a cause.

727
01:18:00,798 --> 01:18:03,123
That you are special.

728
01:18:04,135 --> 01:18:06,211
That you are great.

729
01:18:06,429 --> 01:18:08,339
But in truth...

730
01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:13,519
...you are born insane.

731
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:18,018
And such misery...

732
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:21,355
...cannot be allowed...

733
01:18:22,404 --> 01:18:24,562
...to spread.

734
01:18:25,032 --> 01:18:26,610
Kill them all!

735
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,114
Sahara! You get the general!

736
01:20:50,516 --> 01:20:53,269
- General Shepherd!
- That's me!

737
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:57,063
You can't take him! Whatever you do,
don't let him onboard!

738
01:21:00,778 --> 01:21:02,817
Hey, general!

739
01:21:23,301 --> 01:21:25,792
Listen up. She needs medical attention.

740
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:28,379
You just killed
a general officer, mister!

741
01:21:28,557 --> 01:21:31,095
Lots of generals out there, flyboy!

742
01:21:31,393 --> 01:21:35,226
This trooper's got information vital
to the survival of the Federation!

743
01:21:35,397 --> 01:21:38,482
She must reach safety at all costs!
You get me?

744
01:21:38,692 --> 01:21:40,270
Yes, sir!

745
01:21:43,572 --> 01:21:46,064
- Let's go!
- There are too many of them, Dax!

746
01:21:46,242 --> 01:21:50,156
You gotta tell them what you saw.
You gotta tell them about the new Bug!

747
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,032
You stay here, you'll die!

748
01:21:52,248 --> 01:21:53,873
Murderers don't go home.

749
01:21:59,255 --> 01:22:00,584
Dax!

750
01:22:05,094 --> 01:22:07,253
Dax!

751
01:22:54,187 --> 01:22:57,971
Dax. More than a soldier,
not just a man.

752
01:22:58,192 --> 01:23:00,065
A hero of the Federation.

753
01:23:03,906 --> 01:23:06,861
He gave his life so we could fight...

754
01:23:07,076 --> 01:23:09,402
...and these words for us to live by. ¨

755
01:23:09,579 --> 01:23:14,870
"Shed no tears for me.
My glory lives forever."

756
01:23:28,224 --> 01:23:30,631
And now you too can live the glory...

757
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:34,724
...because it's easy to be a hero
in the Mobile Infantry.

758
01:23:34,897 --> 01:23:37,567
Men and women like you
are signing up every day...

759
01:23:37,732 --> 01:23:40,734
...to serve the Federation
and save the galaxy!

760
01:23:40,903 --> 01:23:42,896
Isn't it time you did your part?

761
01:23:43,072 --> 01:23:44,531
Beautiful baby, ma'am.

762
01:23:45,658 --> 01:23:46,987
Thank you, sergeant.

763
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:49,871
Think how impressed friends
and teachers will be!

764
01:23:50,037 --> 01:23:51,367
Everyone loves a citizen!

765
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:52,915
Little trooper likes me.

766
01:23:53,124 --> 01:23:55,794
Sign up, and one day
they'll call you a hero too!

767
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:59,626
Hurry up, spud.
We need fresh meat for the grinder.

768
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:18,015
Shed no tears for me.
My glory lives forever.

769
01:24:18,065 --> 01:24:22,615
