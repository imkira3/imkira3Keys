2
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,820
God! I love this job! Man!
Can't you go any faster?

3
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,060
Floor this thing!

4
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,620
It's my wife's. I won't go faster.

5
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,100
You're doing 65 now.

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,820
65?! Shit!

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,820
Get your foot off the pedal!
You're killing my corn!

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,420
We're eastbound on 4th, in pursuit of
a red BMW, driver Caucasian, blonde.

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,180
Plate 2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174.

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,340
You are westbound on 2nd.
20 William 12 is southbound.

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,940
You're heading straight
toward each other.

12
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,340
- Somebody back off.
- Got it.

13
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,020
- What'd she say?
- We're about to have an accident.

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,180
Go! We'll stick with the red bastard.
You chase the blue.

15
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,140
That's confirmed.
You got red, we'll get blue.

16
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,460
- What's the pursuit?
- 20 William 15 and 20 William 12.

17
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,020
- That's Riggs, Murtaugh.
- And their squad.

18
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,700
- $20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.
- Who's driving?

19
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,500
Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,700
I knew nothing about the wagon.
Bet's off.

21
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,140
Shut up!

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,860
What the hell is that?

23
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,500
What fuckin' language is that?

24
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,980
It's German.

25
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,340
Japanese?

26
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,580
It's a Japanese radio.
Maybe they bought the L.A.P.D.

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,900
They own everything.

28
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,100
Shotgun!

29
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,700
Shots are being fired.

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,940
Thanks for the scoop.

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,740
The bastard shot my wife's windshield.

32
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,420
Entering the pursuit.

33
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,580
Oh, shit, man! We're splitting up!

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,220
Son-of-a-bitch! Now we're cooking.

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,220
Step on it!

36
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,420
Look out!

37
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,660
See you!

38
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,700
I'd like to see your license
and proof of insurance!

39
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,860
We got one. Yours is going up the hill.

40
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,380
So is Riggs, on foot!

41
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,180
Hey, Riggs! Get your slow ass in here!

42
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,180
Get in here, now!

43
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,660
Only if I drive.

44
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,500
Move over. I'll drive.

45
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,060
No, go around. I'm driving.

46
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,300
I'll drive.

47
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,380
Did you get a make on that red Beemer?

48
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,660
Not one scratch, you hear?

49
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,460
- You won't make it.
- I will.

50
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,860
There's not enough room!

51
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,820
You're not going to make it!

52
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Look at my side panel!

53
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,740
Goddamn it, you were right.

54
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,180
There wasn't enough room.

55
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,260
He's turning right!

56
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,900
Get out of the way!

57
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,820
This was a new car, Riggs.

58
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,420
Well, it still is.

59
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,100
On three.

60
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,860
One...

61
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,340
...two... three!

62
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,180
Shit!

63
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,700
You forgot to turn your indicator on.

64
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,580
Where the hell is he?
This guy's Mandrake!

65
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,700
Where were you, man?!
Goddamnit!

66
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,420
Me?! Where did he go?!

67
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,300
- He's fucking gone!
- I can see that!

68
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,500
- You're supposed to come on "three".
- I thought you meant, "three" then go!

69
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,500
No! We always go on "three"!

70
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Sometimes we go, "one, two, three,"
then go!

71
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,300
Go check back there!

72
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,540
If you see anybody running out,
just pump the shit out of them.

73
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,900
What was that?

74
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,300
- He crawled into the trunk.
- I got you covered.

75
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,540
Holy Christ!

76
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,660
That's a lot of money.

77
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,820
It's gold!

78
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,580
Gold!

79
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,980
Krugerrands.

80
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,020
It's illegal. You can't import them
into the country.

81
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,460
You're right.

82
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,260
The damage you caused is coming
out of the department's budget.

83
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,500
- Pay it in Krugerrands.
- Don't make jokes, make arrests.

84
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,700
I want an explanation.

85
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,700
- Things got out of hand.
- You said this was a routine bust.

86
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,860
You didn't mention helicopters,
automatic weapons, Krugerrands...

87
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,180
This was bigger than we thought.

88
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,020
Talk to you later.

89
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,540
I worked psycho ward.
You'll never get out.

90
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,220
One minute, fifteen seconds.

91
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,380
Shapiro, scratch my nose.

92
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,340
Hey! What's going on? Is this
kindergarten or a police station?

93
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,220
Get some work done.

94
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,540
Houdini Jr. Bets he can free himself
in 5 minutes.

95
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
I will too.

96
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,140
Don't try this at home, kids.

97
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,540
It's over now. Put your money
on the desk and get back to work.

98
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,260
Suckers.

99
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,700
How the hell did you do that?

100
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,060
I dislocated my shoulder once.
Now I can do it whenever I want.

101
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,700
Doesn't it hurt?

102
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,940
Yeah, it does.

103
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,620
But not as much as...
when I put it back in.

104
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,820
If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.

105
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,460
My door is always open, Sergeant.

106
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,300
We should keep this
on a professional level.

107
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,300
Why the hell do you
do this to yourself?

108
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,460
Who else could I do it to?
None of them will let me.

109
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,220
And I need the money.

110
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,300
Cough up!

111
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,820
It's not all here yet. I want it all.

112
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,940
Where did this come from?

113
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,500
You can't help yourself to this stuff!
It's evidence. It's a Krugerrand.

114
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,420
- It's mine. I won it.
- It's not yours.

115
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,780
You want to get busted?

116
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Want to get something to eat?

117
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,260
Not tonight.

118
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,940
- Rianne's commercial is on.
- She's in a commercial?

119
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,820
Not so loud!

120
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,860
What's wrong?
I'd be proud if I was you.

121
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,860
I haven't seen it yet.
What if she stinks?

122
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,620
You got to be kidding. She'll be great.

123
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
Listen up!

124
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,180
Tonight at... what time?

125
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,380
Come on!

126
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,020
What time?

127
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,740
Eight.

128
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,620
Eight o'clock, on... channel?

129
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,300
Eight. The Sergeant's daughter, Rianne.
Here's a picture of her.

130
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,140
She's going to make
her television debut in a commercial.

131
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,500
With this crowd, baby,
you'd better not stink.

132
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,220
What happened? This is a new car.
Mom's going to be upset!

133
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,180
- It's still new.
- No, it's not, it's wrecked.

134
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,860
I don't want your mother to know.

135
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,860
Do your homework too.

136
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,980
- Hey! I haven't read these.
- Rianne put them there.

137
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,420
Why don't you look out for me?

138
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,780
Hey, Ricky! I want to use my driveway
once in a while.

139
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,220
Nice oxygen tent.

140
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,860
- Do I look like Michael Jackson?
- No, but you're bad.

141
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,420
This is a two-car garage,
and this is my hobby room upstairs.

142
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,180
I retire when I'm 52, the whole
nine yards kick in when I'm 55.

143
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,260
You're not retiring, are you?

144
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,380
- I've thought of it, since I met you.
- Thank you.

145
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,140
This is a nice hobby room.
All you need now is a hobby.

146
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,060
Jesus!

147
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,900
What's wrong with you?

148
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,660
I'm sorry. That's very uncool.

149
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,140
You're sorry? Check my shorts!

150
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,380
- Don't you use hammers anymore?
- What's a hammer?

151
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,740
Easy. It's no Saturday Night Special,
for crying out loud.

152
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,060
Give it back.

153
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,220
A man's not even safe in his own home.

154
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,060
Then stay the hell out of here.

155
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,580
You got any traffic warrants?

156
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,060
Can you fix them?

157
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,580
Almost time. Are we taping this?

158
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,780
Yes, so we can watch it
over and over again.

159
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,380
Take the stairs.

160
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,740
Nick, get your feet off the table.
You too, Martin.

161
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,940
- The color's no good.
- It's fine. You'll mess it up.

162
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,660
I want you to look good.

163
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,740
Unplug it.

164
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,020
That's your sister!

165
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,660
Picture's perfect.

166
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,860
Yeah?

167
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,060
Do I know you?

168
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,740
Yes, sir.

169
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,460
We had a long talk about a week ago.

170
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,780
About what?

171
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,620
Your new hobby room.

172
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,540
This is George.

173
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,380
Did you sense that I liked you?

174
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,740
Yes, sir.

175
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,380
Sit down and be quiet.

176
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,900
- What are you eating?
- My tuna fish sandwich.

177
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,060
Tuna?

178
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,460
You can't eat tuna!

179
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,380
Dad killed Flipper.

180
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,220
We're boycotting tuna...

181
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,460
...because they kill the dolphins
that get caught in the nets.

182
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,180
Have ham.

183
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,700
Eat Miss Piggy.

184
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,140
- I'm sorry!
- It's only my eye.

185
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Oh, my God! It's coming on!

186
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,180
My baby!

187
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,780
Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?

188
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,300
When the time has come...

189
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
...and the moment is right...

190
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,180
...remember...

191
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,020
...use Ramses' Extra condoms.

192
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,380
- We do!
- Ramses' Extra.

193
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,380
Because caring means
all the protection you can get.

194
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,180
Take the kids upstairs.

195
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,860
We learn this in Human Development.

196
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,780
In Human what?!
Human Development what?!

197
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,460
Chill out, Daddy.

198
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,060
Upstairs!

199
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,820
Nick, upstairs.

200
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,500
You know how your father is.

201
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,300
- I looked fat.
- I liked you.

202
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,940
Home. Out!

203
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,780
I got a gun.

204
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,580
What? She looked beautiful.

205
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,180
I liked it. She made me want to buy
rubbers right now.

206
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,500
I thought it was great.
Rianne, that was...

207
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,740
- I thought you were terrific.
- Really?

208
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,260
I think she's got a hell of a future.

209
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,860
George is afraid. He's going home.

210
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,300
Stick around.

211
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,100
He has a gun.

212
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,540
It's an old gun
and he's not a very good shot.

213
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,940
That's good. I'm going anyway.
Good night.

214
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,820
- I'll buy you a beer.
- You let him buy it.

215
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,020
You're under 21. Be back by midnight.

216
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,620
Wait and see. Cops never let up.

217
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,860
I'll have rubbers on my desk,
rubbers in the mail, in the coffee...

218
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,540
If you'd only kept your mouth shut!
I'm going for a walk.

219
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,780
Give the boys some credit.
In one ear, out the rubber.

220
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,100
How goes it with you, Hans?

221
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,460
Okay. You, Pieter?

222
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,420
That's quite enough of that.
Come on over here, Hans.

223
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,460
Mind the plastic.
I'm having painting done.

224
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,540
The important thing is...

225
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
...are you okay?

226
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,940
No bones broken?

227
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,780
I'm fine, thanks.

228
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,980
Just bumps and bruises, eh?

229
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,980
Yeah, that's all.

230
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,580
Good, good.

231
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,100
However, we lost over $1 million
in Krugerrand.

232
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,620
I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.

233
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,460
It happens.

234
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,660
It's not your fault.

235
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,980
Sometimes things do not go as planned.

236
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,260
As you say, they just happen,
Eh, Pieter?

237
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,580
You give a whole new meaning
to the word, "drop cloth. "

238
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,580
Certain policemen have become
an intolerable nuisance.

239
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,660
They are obviously on to us again.
How do you propose to handle it?

240
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,340
Warn them off.

241
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,860
It's my experience...

242
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,620
...that a scared cop
is more useful than a dead one.

243
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,020
A warning?

244
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,340
Is that not a bit tame?

245
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,180
Depends on how you do it.

246
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,100
Then you better look at this.

247
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,860
This is the policeman in charge.

248
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,660
A Kaffir.

249
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,540
Lovely.

250
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,340
Remember to take these in order.

251
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,060
There's a packet
for each day of the week.

252
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,380
This yours?

253
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,740
I found it in the wash.

254
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,900
I keep losing this.

255
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,300
Something's wrong.

256
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,060
No, not really.
It's just a goddamn pen.

257
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,380
What about the pen?

258
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,740
It reminds me of something.

259
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,980
Of what?

260
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,260
It reminds me of...

261
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,420
...the night Vicki was killed.

262
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,020
I didn't mean to push.

263
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,220
That's okay.
We never really talked about this.

264
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,740
I was to meet her for dinner.
One of those romantic dinners for two.

265
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,220
I had so much work.

266
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,500
And I forgot about it.

267
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,260
She waited at the restaurant
for an hour before she drove home.

268
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,220
It was midnight when I got home
to a ringing phone. I answered it.

269
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,940
They said she was killed in a car crash.

270
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,460
If I'd been driving,
we'd have been all right.

271
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,140
I remember falling down
on my knees and shaking all over.

272
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,140
I remember thinking, "I'm losing it. "

273
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,660
There I was lying on the floor...

274
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,180
...and I'm seeing under the couch,
and I see this gold pen.

275
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,300
Just lying there. I'd been looking
for it for two months. There it is.

276
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,140
She wasn't a great housekeeper.

277
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,540
This voice goes off in my head,
like a drill instructor.

278
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,820
It said, "Get up! Now!"

279
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,660
I didn't feel like it, but I got up.
Muscles were still working.

280
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,620
Then I drove to the hospital...

281
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,100
...identified her, signed her out
with my gold pen.

282
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,660
Trish found a gold pen in the laundry.

283
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,020
Look around you, Sam.

284
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,180
One day, Sam...

285
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,860
...this'll all be yours.

286
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,540
Find a nice bitch,
raise a couple of pups.

287
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,700
A man could be happy here.

288
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,860
Anybody tell you if you sit on
cold rocks too long, you get piles?

289
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,740
Let's go watch TV.

290
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,140
Kaffirs!

291
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,220
Wondering about your kids?

292
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,460
About what we've done to them?

293
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,940
If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.

294
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,260
I'd be going fucking bananas.

295
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,980
Want to know what we've done?

296
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,460
Shall I tell you?

297
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,220
Just let your imagination run wild.

298
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,860
This has just been a warning.

299
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,820
After this, it gets bloody.
Tell your people to back off.

300
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,940
Don't be a smart Kaffir.

301
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,180
Maybe we let you live, huh?

302
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,020
- You didn't see a face?
- Not one. They had on hoods.

303
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,660
What about a voice?

304
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,380
That crazy motherfucker who did talk
had a strange accent.

305
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,380
Not German, not English.
Kind of guttural. Really shitty accent.

306
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,980
Wait. Anything like what we chased
the other night?

307
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,700
Yeah, kind of like that.

308
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,540
Trish and the kids?

309
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,660
They're at her sister's house
in Bellflower.

310
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,060
Listen up! You heard what happened
to Rog last night?

311
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,540
Forensics get back with anything?

312
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,820
Not yet. They'll keep us posted.

313
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,500
We got to watch each other's
backs and fronts.

314
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,580
You can all watch my back
in poker tomorrow. You in?

315
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,660
- If we catch these assholes.
- Count me in.

316
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,900
I got something special for you.

317
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,260
Leo Getz has been placed
in protective custody.

318
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,180
You guys are going to baby-sit
until Washington sends the Feds.

319
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,740
- How long?
- Until the red tape is processed.

320
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,180
Couple, three days.

321
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,580
Getz is going to testify
before a commission of inquiry.

322
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
Drugs, laundered money, etc.

323
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,340
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

324
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,620
This is not a shit assignment.

325
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,780
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

326
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,940
It isn't.

327
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,140
It is.

328
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,300
Shut up, both of you.

329
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,060
I've guaranteed his safety.

330
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,139
Why us?

331
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,300
You two are the most qualified. And...

332
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,540
...after last night,
you could use the break.

333
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,060
I can handle last night.

334
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,580
What do we do with him?

335
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,300
Take him to Disneyland.

336
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,060
This stinks. This stinks.

337
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,780
I don't give a fuck! I don't have an
ulcer because I know when to say that.

338
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,580
Here's where he's staying.

339
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,100
A nice hotel. The Justice Department
is paying. Enjoy yourselves.

340
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,580
One more thing.

341
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,620
Know what that says?

342
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,660
Yeah. Same thing as that,
but I don't give a fuck.

343
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,340
You're lucky.
I have to live with that.

344
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,220
What room is that for?

345
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,420
612.

346
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,060
This is it. 612.

347
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,700
Police.

348
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,060
How do I know that?

349
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,940
After I shoot you, you can
examine the bullet. Open up.

350
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,020
Don't you want to see a badge?

351
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,740
- Where's your badge?
- Shut up.

352
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,260
I get it. Bad cop, good cop.

353
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,860
Shut up.

354
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,540
Bad cop, bad cop.
I know the routines.

355
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,700
- Are you Leo Getz?
- That's me, Leo Getz.

356
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,420
Whatever you need, Leo gets. Get it?

357
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,780
I use that to break the ice
when I meet people.

358
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,180
I'm Sgt. Murtaugh, this is Sgt. Riggs.

359
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,300
Nice to meet you.
So what do I call you guys?

360
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,860
Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.

361
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,900
We're going to be your shadow.

362
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
That's fine. Hey, an old-fashioned...

363
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,620
Okay. I just ain't seen one
in a long time.

364
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,220
I didn't think anyone used them anymore.

365
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,980
I bet the kid's got an automatic.
Have you?

366
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,300
Yep, a Beretta.

367
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,100
You sure you guys are cops?

368
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,940
Better watch how you treat me.
I'm a state witness.

369
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,460
Star witness.

370
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,060
We'll take that room.

371
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,420
I already have my stuff in this room.

372
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,340
It's yours, okay?
I'll move it in the small room.

373
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,020
I'm the smallest guy here.
I'll take the small room.

374
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,500
Hey, loosen up, guys!
We're going to be together a long time.

375
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,180
I'll get it.

376
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,260
It's only room service.

377
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,860
You hungry? I'll call
for anything you want.

378
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,940
See this silk robe? Free.

379
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,340
- It's not free.
- Yes, it is.

380
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,620
- It's taxpayers' money.
- Same thing.

381
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,700
Morning, gentlemen.

382
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,380
That's my food. You guys
didn't want anything. Bring it here.

383
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,380
It's mine.

384
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,980
You could have had something.

385
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,980
I ordered eggs, not hamburger.

386
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,620
Not the window!

387
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,540
Shit!

388
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,740
Where is that son-of-a-bitch?

389
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,300
Somebody stop that guy! Stop him!

390
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,940
Don't leave me! I can't swim!

391
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,700
We're near the edge of the pool.
Now get the fuck off my back!

392
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,420
Clear! Get back! Police!

393
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,740
You okay?

394
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,620
Where were you?
Why didn't you follow me?

395
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,140
- Yeah, why didn't you?
- I was 7 floors up!

396
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,460
- He hit me.
- Good!

397
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,900
This guy took a big chance to pop all of
us. What'd you witness, a murder?

398
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,180
Nothing like that. Honest.

399
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,220
All I did was launder a half a billion
dollars in drug money.

400
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,300
Half a billion dollars?!

401
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,140
More or less.
Who can count that much money?

402
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,860
Could I have some cotton balls
for my nose?

403
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,980
Could you shut the fuck up?

404
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,300
You're supposed to take care of me.

405
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,500
Shut up!

406
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,300
Mr. Getz got away.
Our best opportunity and he gets away.

407
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,140
He slips through our fingers
and into the hands of the police.

408
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,260
What are you doing?

409
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,500
Checking to see
if I was standing on plastic.

410
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,980
Okay, I got it.

411
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,180
I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.
I work in a bank.

412
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,140
You have money to launder.
What do you do?

413
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,660
Bring it to you.

414
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,020
- He does.
- I don't understand. Why me?

415
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,620
Who am I?

416
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,020
You're a courier. You work for him.

417
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,620
I'm the drug dealer.

418
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,780
Don't you have plates? What is this?

419
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,460
I deposit the cash into the account
of a dummy finance company.

420
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,140
I issue you a cashier's check...

421
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,540
...in his name,
minus a small commission for myself.

422
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,500
- The other end.
- You like breathing?

423
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
How much?

424
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,020
2%.

425
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,220
Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.

426
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,900
You return it to me as collateral
on a loan I make to you.

427
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,700
But you don't pay back the loan.
You keep the money.

428
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,980
How's that work?

429
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,740
That's it! Don't you get it?

430
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,900
It's your money. You don't pay it back.
And it's clean.

431
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,420
It is now laundered.

432
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,740
You cops aren't too bright.

433
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,060
This is the best part.

434
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,580
You take a tax deduction...

435
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,500
...on interest payments
you don't even make.

436
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,260
- Am I a genius?
- You're a swindler.

437
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,500
Cheat.

438
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,140
Come on!

439
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,740
Everyone cheats. Look at the Pentagon.
So you got it?

440
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,700
So how come you turned yourself in,
Mr. Big Shot?

441
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,500
I was scamming those guys for months.

442
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,940
Every transaction, I kept a little.

443
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,020
You?

444
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,780
It was easy. Cash deposits...

445
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,380
...millions of dollars in small bills
changing hands.

446
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,660
Who's going to miss $10,000 here,
$20,000 there?

447
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,260
Drug dealers.

448
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,300
That's right. They did.

449
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,220
That's why I'm living
out of a suitcase now.

450
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,380
You can give that to Nick.

451
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,140
But it's softer.
I put a fabric softener in there.

452
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
It's small, Leroy.

453
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,820
It's Leo, not Leroy.
I'll buy you another shirt.

454
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,820
Just give me the names
of those drug dealers.

455
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,740
I don't know any.

456
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,980
I just dealt with the couriers.

457
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,100
Where does Trish keep my laundry?

458
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,140
Behind the machine.

459
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,980
You never met anyone except couriers?

460
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,100
No names.

461
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,820
Wait a minute, come to think of it!
Okay, listen.

462
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,660
They took me up in the hills
to a house on stilts.

463
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,180
And I had a job interview with a guy...

464
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,420
...and his name was...

465
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,820
Haynes! Hans!

466
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,340
- Take us there.
- We have to sit on this guy.

467
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,500
It won't hurt to look.

468
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,780
I know the address.

469
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,740
Let's go.

470
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
We shouldn't do this!

471
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,340
Come on, don't be a killjoy!

472
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,180
We're back! You're black, I'm mad.

473
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,020
This is going to be great!

474
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,180
If we're going, shouldn't I have a gun?

475
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,180
Is my nose still bleeding?
It's really sore.

476
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,140
Sorry about that.

477
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,580
It should be coming up soon.

478
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,300
- 9856.
- That's it.

479
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,980
- That's another possibility.
- This is the ninth possibility, Leo.

480
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,300
That's it. Nine.
My lucky number. Nine.

481
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,580
Stay in the car.

482
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,740
- Can't I come?
- Stay.

483
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,260
Nice car.

484
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,660
- What are you doing?
- Hooking it up.

485
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,940
You're not being careful!

486
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,660
I know what I'm doing. It's a car...

487
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,180
...not a baby carriage.

488
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,660
You're chipping the paint.

489
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,620
- You smell what I smell?
- I smell it.

490
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,260
A rat?

491
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,660
A real stinky one.

492
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,500
Where you going?

493
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,020
I'm a peeping Tom. It goes
with the badge. It's fun sometimes.

494
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,380
Bingo!

495
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,860
Lars, look!

496
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,180
What the fuck?!

497
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,900
Where's the pool?

498
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,120
No pool.

499
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,300
- Of course there is.
- This house is built on stilts.

500
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,660
I'm sure there's a pool.

501
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,780
Cuff yourselves.

502
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,940
Move that truck!

503
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,700
Your keys!

504
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,260
You all right?

505
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,180
Where you going?

506
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,860
That was the waiter from the hotel.

507
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,100
Wait for me!

508
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,860
Get the fuck out of here!

509
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,780
What are you doing?!
You can't take my truck!

510
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,740
Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!

511
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,220
Where did he go?

512
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,940
Riggs is hanging on the truck!

513
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,460
What are you doing out of the car?
Get in the car!

514
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,620
Get back! It's police business!

515
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,460
It's a high-speed chase!
Get out of the way!

516
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,500
I love it! We got to catch him!

517
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,620
Hello, asshole.

518
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,540
Give me that!

519
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,220
There they are! Hurry up!

520
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,220
Can't you go faster?!

521
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,660
Will you shut the fuck up?

522
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,580
Wipe out. It's under control.

523
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,740
I told you to look out!

524
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,900
- You're too old for this.
- Shut up! Yak-yak-yak.

525
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,140
And stay!

526
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,420
What do you think I am, a dog?

527
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,260
Hands behind your neck!

528
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,500
What are you guys doing here?
We got a lot to talk about.

529
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,300
What is going on?

530
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,660
Freeze!

531
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
Get down here!

532
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,020
Come on, it's been a bad day.

533
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,500
Show me your hands.

534
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,180
Take it easy, officer. I'm not armed.

535
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,460
I won't resist.

536
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,300
Put down your guns, gentlemen.
It's all right. Do as I say!

537
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,620
Hands on your head.

538
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,140
Behind your head!

539
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,220
You have no idea what you're doing.

540
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,860
We're professional police officers.
We do this for a living.

541
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
My name is Arjen Rudd.

542
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,820
I'm Minister of Diplomatic Affairs
for the South African consulate.

543
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,980
South Africa. Home of the Krugerrand.

544
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,820
Among other things.

545
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,540
These men also work for the consulate.

546
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,580
We have diplomatic credentials...

547
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,980
Keep your hands out of there.

548
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,340
Everybody, take it easy.
Especially you, Riggs.

549
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,580
Riggs?

550
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,420
You're Martin Riggs?

551
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,740
From Chicago. What's your name?
What's his name?

552
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,580
Pieter Von... Vor...

553
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,700
I'll just call you Adolf.

554
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,580
Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
That's you.

555
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,700
It's official.

556
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,260
They are official.

557
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,540
Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...

558
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,260
...no diplomatic agent
may be detained or arrested...

559
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,540
...once his identity
has been established.

560
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,780
We have a serious
diplomatic situation here...

561
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,700
...which I will take up
with your State Department tomorrow.

562
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,060
I'm quaking in my boots,
but I'll still bring you down.

563
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,940
My dear officer...

564
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,780
...you could not even give me
a parking ticket.

565
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,780
Who is the dickhead now, huh?

566
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,300
The South African government owns
this house. This is South African soil.

567
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,420
Now get out of here.

568
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,860
All of you.

569
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,140
Don't do it.

570
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,420
Don't do it or I'll make you
eat this fucking thing.

571
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,340
Kaffir.

572
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,660
Could you step out of the car, please?

573
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,020
Put them away. I'm sorry.

574
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,220
Sorry. Are you okay?

575
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,180
Don't open that.

576
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,860
That is a diplomatic pouch...

577
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,860
...protected under Article 27
of the Vienna Convention.

578
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,140
Is he serious with this stuff?

579
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,180
These are police officers, Miss
Van den Haas. They were just leaving.

580
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,780
She is a consulate secretary.

581
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,540
Give her back the briefcase.

582
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,820
Give it to her.

583
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,540
I'm sorry, Miss Consulate Secretary.

584
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,140
Don't talk to them! Come here.

585
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,060
He's a nice guy.
What's he paying you an hour?

586
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,980
Want to increase your pay?
Better hours?

587
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,500
I'd start getting used
to that sort of view.

588
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,660
It's the Triangle Trade again.

589
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,020
Don't you know American history?
Molasses to rum to slaves.

590
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,460
Now drugs to dollars to Krugerrands.

591
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,460
I got a dead guy with a surfboard
where his face used to be...

592
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,020
...and the State Department
breathing down our throats.

593
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,780
I'll have to make a formal apology
to the South African consulate.

594
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,660
Apologize? He's a sack of shit!
He's a crook.

595
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,540
It doesn't matter. He's a diplomat.

596
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,060
He has immunity. We can't touch him,
arrest him, prosecute him.

597
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,460
- Does that spell it out for you?
- Yes, sir.

598
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,900
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you.

599
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,940
You took a civilian on a bust.
One you're supposed to be protecting!

600
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,140
He's alive, isn't he?

601
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,820
I signed a waiver.
Besides, I usually wait in the car.

602
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,740
Usually?

603
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,220
They're very adamant about that.

604
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,580
- I don't give a fuck.
- They're good cops!

605
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,900
They're the best.
One time, a guy was waiving a gun...!

606
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,500
What did he say?

607
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,860
What did he say?

608
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,660
- "I don't give a fuck. "
- What's that mean?

609
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,580
It's his mantra. Why is everyone
parked on my desk? Up!

610
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,580
It's a rubber plant!

611
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,580
It looks to be about a week's supply.

612
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,860
Go spit.

613
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,100
I forgot. You're too old for that shit.

614
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,420
If you don't like it,
you can exchange it.

615
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,300
One moment, Miss Van den Haas.

616
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,620
I hope you understood
what happened here today.

617
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,980
I'd rather not jump
to any wrong conclusions.

618
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,460
Why don't you explain it to me?

619
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,060
The policies of our government
are not popular here in America.

620
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,260
The police department here
is overrun with blacks.

621
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,820
They have badges and guns
and they hate us.

622
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,820
Our consulate, its staff...

623
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,340
...and particularly myself will always
be targets for their harassment.

624
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,260
Things are getting out of hand.

625
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,620
There are too many losses. We'll
move the cash in one large shipment.

626
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,140
We'll need more than a suitcase.

627
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,180
I'll worry about that.
You worry about the police.

628
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,100
Your warning did not work.

629
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,860
- Let's go, Leo!
- I'm coming.

630
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,540
Come on! Move!

631
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,020
Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?

632
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,540
I've got to eat, too.

633
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,500
Give me the food.

634
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,660
Who ordered the super combo?

635
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,900
I get a steak sandwich.

636
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,180
Who gets Leo?

637
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,740
You got a big empty house. I got
a trailer. What will I do with him?

638
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,340
My place is too small. You take him.

639
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,900
I had him last night.

640
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,740
Excuse me, fellows.

641
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,900
This is tuna. I hate tuna.

642
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,860
I refuse to get stuck with tuna.

643
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,900
- Don't eat the tuna.
- I just said that!

644
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,420
I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.

645
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,340
We're not going back! Shut up!

646
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,420
Sure, don't go back.
Okay, don't go back!

647
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,740
Let me give you
a friendly piece of advice.

648
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,060
Never go through the drive-through.
Always walk up to the counter.

649
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,940
Let me tell you why.

650
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,700
They fuck you at the drive-through!

651
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,940
They know you'll be miles away
before you find out you got fucked.

652
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,700
You won't turn around and come back.

653
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,460
So who gets fucked? Leo Getz.

654
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,300
I'm not eating this tuna!

655
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,300
Shut up!

656
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,860
Get rid of that man.

657
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,220
You're going to have
to leave the premises right now.

658
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,420
The morning faxes.

659
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,740
What's the matter?
He kick you out of the house?

660
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,860
I want you to bite Leo for me.

661
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,780
What are you doing?

662
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,700
I'm cleaning up this pigsty.

663
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,020
I like this pigsty.

664
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,100
When did you last do the refrigerator?
Or the pan under it?

665
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,700
There's a pan under there?

666
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,660
Where's my phone?

667
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,180
Where's my TV? What have you done?

668
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,220
Everything is outside.

669
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,020
Just stop what you're doing.

670
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,260
- Get the dog out of here!
- You go before the mutt.

671
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,460
Out, out! Oh, man.

672
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,300
It's Collins.

673
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,460
Has Murtaugh checked in with you?

674
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,940
No. Why?

675
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,300
I haven't heard from him.
He doesn't answer his phone.

676
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,740
I'll be right there.

677
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,980
Stay in the car.

678
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,900
I'm upstairs!

679
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,660
Should I call 999, officer in distress?

680
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,940
I'll cover the back!

681
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,500
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.

682
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,340
In here.

683
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,340
Good morning.

684
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,700
First time in 20 years...

685
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,980
...I get the bathroom to myself.

686
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,700
No kids banging on the door.
No wife asking me to hurry up.

687
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,540
Just me and my new
Saltwater Sportsman magazine!

688
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,060
The one with the article
on deep-sea fishing?

689
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,220
So I'm reading about marlin
fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...

690
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,740
...when I glanced over.

691
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,580
Oh, Jesus.

692
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,580
Is that all?

693
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,220
You scared the shit out of me.

694
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,260
Scared the shit out of you?

695
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,220
How long you been here?

696
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,420
I've been here all night.

697
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,580
My legs are so numb
I don't know if I can...

698
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,180
Don't move.

699
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,580
I can't.

700
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,740
Just stay that way. Do you mind?

701
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,100
It's a dirty job,
but someone's got to do it.

702
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,020
Tell me I'm not fucked.

703
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,860
He's fucked.

704
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,380
Okay, but I'd be lying.

705
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,820
You'll be okay if you don't stand up.

706
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,380
That's a relief.

707
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,900
- I have to get help.
- No way!

708
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,220
Why?

709
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,180
I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.

710
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,220
This is serious.
I got to get the bomb squad here.

711
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,580
Bomb squad?

712
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,580
Okay, call them in.

713
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,900
Don't use the open frequency.

714
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,580
Let's try to keep this quiet, okay?

715
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,100
Sure. Trust me.

716
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,780
An escort is really not necessary.

717
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,620
I know you're a psychiatrist,
but it's not a pretty sight.

718
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,540
I have helped policemen
through very traumatic moments.

719
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,140
There is nothing in this room
that I cannot handle.

720
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,460
I was wrong.

721
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,460
Excuse me.

722
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,420
I should've known,
where there's one, there's the other.

723
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,100
You're a psychiatrist?
I have these dreams.

724
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,140
It's ready to come out.

725
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,660
I got to live in this house!

726
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,980
Clear this room.

727
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,780
Come on, Riggs.

728
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,020
You, too, Riggs.

729
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,180
No.

730
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,500
Riggs, out.

731
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,020
All right.

732
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,020
Dive into the tub.

733
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,860
Then pull the bomb blanket
over your head.

734
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:44,140
This cast iron tub
will withstand a hell of a blast.

735
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,660
I can't.

736
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,020
He can't.
He's been on there for 18 hours.

737
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,980
He can't even walk.

738
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,020
I'm gonna have to help him.

739
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,540
All right, you better wear this.

740
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,860
The nitrogen?

741
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,180
Almost there.

742
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,380
He's spraying this thing
with liquid nitrogen...

743
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,540
...to give you 1 or 2 seconds
before detonation.

744
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,500
- Got that?
- 2 seconds. Thanks a lot.

745
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,140
Lights out.

746
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,900
Get him up and out.

747
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,580
Good luck.

748
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,500
You got a piece?

749
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,740
- Yeah, a Smith and Wesson.
- Try this one.

750
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,220
Safety's on. I'll collect it later.

751
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,340
Good luck.

752
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,260
Alone at last.

753
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,420
Why didn't they plant the bomb
in Trish's stove?

754
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,100
All the needless suffering
could have ended there.

755
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,220
I'm going to die on a toilet.

756
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,300
Guys like you don't die on toilets.

757
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,340
And I'm here
and I don't plan on going now.

758
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,020
Let's do it.

759
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,300
On three.
Wait, let me get into the tub.

760
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,980
I'm just going to give you...

761
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,140
On three, huh? What do you say?

762
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,660
One...

763
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,620
...two...

764
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,820
Wait.

765
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,300
Do we do it on three, or...

766
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,420
...one, two, three...

767
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,340
- ... then do it?
- It's your ass. It's up to you.

768
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,340
My ass, yeah.

769
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,660
Three.

770
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,500
We go on three?

771
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,020
One, two and then three!

772
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,580
One...

773
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,100
Martin?

774
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,620
I know.

775
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,700
I mean it, man.

776
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,460
I hear you.

777
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,220
We're not going to die, all right?

778
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,700
On three.

779
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,140
Get off me. I don't want anybody
to see us like this.

780
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,780
Mr. Jones?

781
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,460
Sit down.

782
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,260
What can I do for you today?

783
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,580
I have this problem,
this very delicate matter.

784
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,060
My friend wants to emigrate
to South Africa.

785
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,540
Of course, I can help him do that.

786
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,220
I want you to talk him out of it.

787
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,060
Talk him out of it?

788
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,260
Whatever for?

789
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,420
This is a bad time for him to go,
with all the trouble.

790
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,820
Have him come back later
in the week and we'll sit down...

791
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,380
He's here.

792
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,700
Yeah, he's here now. Alphonse?

793
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,900
There must be some mistake.

794
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,380
Say, what?

795
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,700
Listen to your friend.
He knows what he's talking about.

796
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,540
I don't think you want to go
to South Africa.

797
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,860
Why not?

798
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,380
Because you're black.

799
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,940
You are.

800
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,460
He is.

801
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,860
Of course I am black.
That's why I want to go.

802
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,060
To join my brothers in the struggle...

803
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,180
...against the racist...

804
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,100
...fascist...

805
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,660
...white minority regime!

806
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,900
Fascist regime!

807
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,300
One man, one vote!

808
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,820
Free South Africa, you son-of-a-bitch!

809
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,820
I've heard as much as I want to.
You must leave.

810
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,220
What's happening?
Don't touch me! Back off!

811
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,060
Close the security gate! Quickly!

812
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,940
End apartheid now!

813
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:24,380
You going to arrest me
if I don't shut up?

814
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,620
One man, one vote!
Free South Africa! Give me that flag!

815
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,500
You can't push me out!

816
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,980
You call this security?

817
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:55,260
More people come in and out of here
than Grand Central Station.

818
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,900
Wait, gentlemen!

819
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,380
Don't bother to call the police.
I'm here already.

820
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,500
I should have known.

821
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,540
Well, well.

822
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,380
The master race.

823
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,660
I hope you realize
the trouble you are in right now.

824
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:23,300
As usual, you people have everything
upside down and turned around.

825
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,700
Gentlemen...

826
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,060
...show Officer Riggs into the street.

827
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:34,220
Fingers off.

828
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,740
Hands off!

829
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,380
Let me see that.

830
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,220
That's a piece of hardware you got.
Where do you get that stuff?

831
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,500
I've never seen it.
Where's it from, South Africa?

832
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,180
Don't move.

833
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:03,260
You haven't heard about me? I got a
bad reputation. Sometimes I go nuts.

834
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,180
Don't move.

835
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,980
I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.
Or is it Aryan?

836
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,260
Whatever the fuck your name is.

837
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,940
You fold up your tents...

838
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,380
...and get out of my country...

839
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,860
...and I won't do anything to you.

840
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,140
I'll leave you alone.

841
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,220
'Cause if you stick around here,
I'm gonna fuck your ass.

842
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,100
Send you home
with your balls in a sling.

843
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,620
Just get out of here...

844
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,140
...Kaffir lover.

845
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,980
Eenie...

846
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,900
...meenie...

847
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,040
...miney...

848
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,020
Hey, Moe!

849
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,660
Sorry, Adolf.

850
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,660
Pick them up with your hands.

851
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:07,660
Big smile. Big smile!

852
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,980
Vorstedt, come here.

853
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:13,580
Vorstedt!

854
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,660
- Hello, Officer...?
- Martin Riggs.

855
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,260
What are you doing here?

856
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,660
I've been with your boss...
shooting the breeze.

857
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,500
Shooting his fish.

858
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:44,300
The guy goes,
"But, but, but... you're black!"

859
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,860
He's black.

860
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,820
No shit.

861
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,540
He started some shit!

862
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,380
You get into Rudd's office?

863
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,980
I got up there.

864
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:01,060
Aryan Crud and his Brown Shirts
turned up, but I ripped this off a pad.

865
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:04,540
"Alba Varden, Thursday. " Alba Varden?

866
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,900
Isn't that Hitler's girlfriend?

867
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,380
That's Eva Braun.

868
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,500
He has a date with her Thursday.

869
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,540
Her name sounds familiar.

870
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,060
I don't know her.
It just sounds familiar. Alba Varden.

871
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,060
A deli! Let's eat. I'm starving.

872
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,580
I'll spring.

873
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,740
Let's go. Sounds good.

874
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,820
- Get out the other side, Leo.
- It's okay!

875
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,500
No cars.

876
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,420
That policeman.

877
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,460
You should pick from the bottom.

878
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,380
They put the old stuff on top.

879
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,700
Officer Riggs!

880
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,900
I followed you from the consulate.

881
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:18,300
You followed me?

882
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:22,620
Well, I needed some pork chops
and a toilet brush, too.

883
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,460
I wanted to apologize...

884
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,620
...for the other day,
if we frightened you.

885
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,780
I was a bit startled by all those guns.

886
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,140
I'm sorry.
And I wanted to thank you, too.

887
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,460
Thank me for what?

888
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,660
You don't like your boss
very much, do you?

889
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:50,140
I don't like many things
about my boss and my country.

890
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,820
But I like my job very much.

891
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,260
It keeps me here in Los Angeles.

892
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,660
You like this town?

893
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,500
That's a new one.

894
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,660
- I forgot your first name.
- It's Rika.

895
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,380
Rika Van Haagen-Dazs.

896
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,380
- Ice cream?
- No, Van den Haas. It's Dutch.

897
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,220
That's real pretty.

898
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,100
You got a rabbit at home?

899
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,540
It's mine.

900
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,100
Shop one day at a time?

901
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,900
Good police work, officer.

902
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,020
I get paid for that.

903
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,260
I don't shop for the entire week.

904
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,700
Why not?

905
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,340
I never know what I'll be hungry for.

906
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,380
Wait. Have dinner with me.

907
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:39,860
I got a nice place on the beach.
A good view from every window.

908
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:45,460
A beautiful sunset. Come on,
be original. Everyone else says no.

909
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:48,060
Come to my place. I'm a gourmet cook.

910
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,540
Let go of the basket.

911
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,660
I'll scream.

912
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:56,220
I'll embarrass you in public.
You'll turn red like that apple.

913
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,900
- Come on with me.
- No, no, please.

914
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,060
Let go of my bag! Look what she's
doing! Somebody call a cop!

915
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:05,740
What are you doing?

916
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,220
Let's go before someone calls a cop.

917
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,980
You are a cop.

918
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,060
You must be an honest cop.

919
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,420
It ain't much, but it's everything
I said. Look at the view.

920
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,900
I did exaggerate
about one thing, though.

921
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,420
I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.
I can only make chili.

922
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,740
- Like it with crushed Oreos?
- Of course.

923
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,820
A woman after my own heart.

924
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,940
Watch your step.

925
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,940
Sam wants in.

926
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:48,260
Here, sit down.
Oh, wait a minute. A little filthy.

927
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,740
I have no wine. How about a beer?

928
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:01,900
That's fine.

929
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:04,060
She drinks beer.

930
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,460
What's the matter?
You got a dirty glass?

931
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,140
Oh, it's the wedding ring.

932
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,460
I used to be married.

933
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,660
Not any more?

934
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,980
Not any more.

935
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,140
I've got something on the stove.

936
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,980
Rudd's hiding behind
his diplomatic credentials, isn't he?

937
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:52,820
Rudd's hiding behind
his diplomatic credentials.

938
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,140
He's not a very nice guy.

939
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,180
Whatever he's doing...

940
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,340
...he shouldn't get away with it.

941
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,300
How's it hanging, Wyler?

942
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,340
- What do you want?
- I hope better than Murtaugh.

943
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,340
Easy, easy.

944
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:21,860
Tell me something. Have your brains
ever seen the light of day?

945
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,780
Who are you?
What do you want? I'm a cop!

946
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,420
No, you were a cop.

947
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,300
Hurry up, honey.

948
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:32,540
I'm going to take a couple laps
before I go to the station.

949
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:30,180
Sam, take a hike.
No Stooges tonight. Go on.

950
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,780
Get that beer in here.

951
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,340
Don't worry about it.

952
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,620
Cavanaugh, are you in or out?

953
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,180
I'm out.

954
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,860
Put some music on.

955
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,220
Who's not accounted for?

956
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,820
Riggs and Murtaugh.

957
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:16,540
Murtaugh's taking the witness
to a new location.

958
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,820
- And Riggs?
- Hasn't checked in yet.

959
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,140
Get on the radio and find them!

960
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:25,380
We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.
How many do we have to lose?

961
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,500
Let's worry about the ones
that are alive, all right? Do it.

962
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,380
Sorry, Captain.

963
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,820
Get me Riggs.

964
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,420
I'll get that.

965
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:51,660
Wrong number.

966
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:08,580
Thanks to you, I missed my poker game
and I was feeling real lucky.

967
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,580
Okay, so what I see are nice,
conservative tax returns.

968
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:16,540
Everything by the book,
black and white.

969
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:20,020
So you just need to play around
in the gray areas...

970
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,100
...if you want to see some bucks.

971
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,900
On your salary, there's not much
to do but you need deductions.

972
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,580
- My boat.
- You can't deduct it.

973
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,180
No, it's the bill of sale.

974
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:31,020
I know, but you can't do it.

975
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,100
That's it, my boat! Let's go!

976
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,540
To my house.

977
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,340
Because of my boat.

978
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,220
Look at this commercial.

979
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,540
Look at the body on this kid.
She is so hot.

980
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:47,220
What are you doing? I want to look
at the girl! Why'd you do that?

981
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,300
I didn't hear you say that.

982
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,900
Say what? She's great.

983
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,820
She makes me want to buy rubbers.

984
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,300
Time for the seventh inning stretch.

985
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,500
That's a baseball expression.

986
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,140
I know.

987
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,340
But we're only up to the fourth inning.

988
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,260
Batter up.

989
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,100
Stay in the car.

990
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,020
I'll only be a minute, okay?

991
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,860
Stay in the car? It's cold.
You have no door.

992
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:44,300
You're the reason there's no door.
Turn on the heat.

993
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:51,380
Don't touch anything.
Nothing. I mean nothing!

994
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:57,860
Alba Varden. Why do I know the name?

995
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,700
It's here. It's got to be.

996
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,980
- Another day, another hobby.
- Yeah, another hobby. What's new?

997
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,580
That's the day on my boat.

998
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,900
It's not there. Where is it?

999
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:19,060
My birthday.

1000
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,100
I'll be damned.

1001
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,620
Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.

1002
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:56,100
Leo, I told you to stay in the car!

1003
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,539
Shit!

1004
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:04,980
Nailed them both.

1005
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,020
My car!

1006
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,340
Leo!

1007
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:26,420
Get up, get dressed.
Get dressed. Come on.

1008
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:35,940
- I don't understand.
- Just trust me. I got a bad feeling.

1009
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:45,660
Get in the truck.
The keys are under the front seat.

1010
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:48,940
When they stop to reload,
run for the truck!

1011
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,460
- What about you?
- I'll be okay.

1012
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:55,020
I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!
Stay out of the light!

1013
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,860
The master race.

1014
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:15,900
You shit! Who were those people?

1015
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:20,140
You tell me. Was it your husband?
What are you doing Saturday?

1016
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,380
It's Sam!

1017
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:36,580
Head down!

1018
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,300
Come on, Sam!

1019
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:59,700
Come on, Sam.

1020
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,540
Shake a leg.

1021
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,580
You made it.

1022
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,140
Has he got any holes in him?

1023
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,460
Oh, you clever dog.

1024
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:22,140
I promised to have you home by 11.

1025
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,660
This is the most incredible first date
I've ever been on.

1026
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:27,420
Wait until the second one.

1027
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:30,740
- No more helicopters, please.
- Okay, I promise.

1028
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,100
This is a very nice building.

1029
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:37,100
Any vacancies? I'm between homes.

1030
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,180
You can stay right here.

1031
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:41,100
I can?

1032
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,940
Yes, there's
a vacant apartment up there.

1033
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:47,620
I'm kidding.

1034
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,620
You can stay with me.

1035
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:51,180
Tonight?

1036
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:55,180
Yes, tonight. And tomorrow night.
And the night after that.

1037
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:56,900
And after that?

1038
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:58,940
Don't push your luck.

1039
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,780
I better go.

1040
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,700
Go inside and lock all the doors
and stay there.

1041
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:14,380
And you're not going to work tomorrow.

1042
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,540
There's better ways of staying
in LA than working there.

1043
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:20,540
All right. I've just quit.

1044
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:49,660
I'll just grab a few things...
Hell, I haven't got anything.

1045
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,740
Just bring yourself.

1046
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,420
I better go.

1047
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,540
Go home!

1048
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,940
Go get the girl.

1049
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:56,700
I would offer you a drink,
but I understand...

1050
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,220
...you're on the wagon.

1051
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,300
That stuff will kill you quick.

1052
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,780
You know so much about me,
who are you?

1053
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:10,740
I changed the course of your life.

1054
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,300
Four years ago...

1055
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,820
...when you was a narc at Long Beach...

1056
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,420
...you were getting too close,
so we put a contract out on you.

1057
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:21,500
I handled it myself.

1058
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,500
Drove your car right off the road,
remember?

1059
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:27,780
But you weren't driving, were you?

1060
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,260
You can't imagine the surprise...

1061
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:35,940
...when I pulled back a matted mop of
bloody hair to see this woman's face.

1062
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,020
Your wife, right?

1063
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,700
She didn't die straight away.

1064
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,700
It took a bit of time.

1065
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:56,300
You don't have much luck
with women, do you?

1066
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,340
She's dead. They killed her.

1067
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:37,940
Where are you?

1068
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:42,420
They killed her. She's dead.
They killed them both.

1069
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:46,300
Slow down. Who are you talking about?
Where are you?

1070
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:48,380
She's dead, Roger.

1071
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:54,180
Calm down. We'll take care of it.
Where are you?

1072
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,380
I'm not a cop tonight. It's personal.

1073
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:01,660
You don't know what happened tonight.
There's more.

1074
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:07,220
I'm going to get those bastards.
I'm going to fuck them. I'm going now.

1075
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:12,020
We're not going to the stilt house!
We're under orders!

1076
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:14,500
Then the house will have to come to me.

1077
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,900
They killed them both.

1078
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,780
They got Rika and they got my wife.

1079
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:26,900
Shit.

1080
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:41,620
What's the deal?

1081
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,420
You talk to the Feds,
but you don't talk to me.

1082
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:46,900
That's not fair.

1083
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,420
We trusted you.

1084
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,220
You betrayed us.

1085
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:58,780
You took our money!

1086
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,900
We want it back now...

1087
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:06,660
...you slimy little shit.

1088
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:10,540
Give him more. He likes it.

1089
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,300
Don't try and stop me.

1090
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:49,300
I've seen that look
in your eyes before.

1091
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,500
They declared war on the police.

1092
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:55,100
You know about that?

1093
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:57,660
I heard it on the radio.

1094
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,580
We don't have the authority.

1095
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:01,980
Cavanaugh...

1096
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:04,180
...Wyler, Shapiro...

1097
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:09,620
...Rika, Vicki. How much
fucking authority do you need?

1098
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,100
You got a plan?

1099
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:19,940
Drive around the front of the house...

1100
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:22,180
...wait for my signal...

1101
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,860
...and then just go in
and shoot those fuckers.

1102
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,180
They got Leo.

1103
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,780
Be careful.

1104
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:39,460
Wait.

1105
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:40,780
What's your signal?

1106
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:44,300
You'll know when it happens.

1107
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,660
Somehow I think I will know.

1108
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,260
Feel like talking?

1109
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:45,380
It's the big one!

1110
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,860
Cool it. Watch him.

1111
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,620
Move me away from the windows!

1112
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,180
Riggs, you crazy mother...!

1113
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:25,380
Holy Christ!

1114
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,060
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1115
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:33,460
Thanks.

1116
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,660
- Was Adolf in there?
- He got away.

1117
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,700
- I'm going to find him.
- What about Leo?

1118
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:41,180
What about Leo?

1119
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,220
You're on your own now.

1120
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,820
What do you mean?

1121
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:48,500
Take my car to the police station
and wait for the Federal Marshal.

1122
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:50,740
It's been an experience knowing you.

1123
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:58,420
- I don't want a hug.
- Go on. Lucky if you see him again.

1124
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,340
I had a lot of fun.

1125
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,740
You do your duty now.

1126
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,860
I'm going to really get them now.

1127
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:06,860
Listen. Wait.

1128
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,100
Is it okay if I sound the siren?

1129
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,140
Loud as you want.

1130
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:16,580
Really? Okay. Really?

1131
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,940
Check it out.

1132
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:27,540
Alba Varden is a cargo ship,
not a woman.

1133
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:31,260
The Port Authority said
that the Alba Varden arrived today...

1134
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:34,380
...and heads out tomorrow
to South Africa.

1135
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,380
This is the eleventh dock.

1136
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:41,620
It must be here someplace.
I know I'm right.

1137
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:47,780
The ship!

1138
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,540
What did I tell you?

1139
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:54,060
That container there
with three heavy hitters.

1140
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:55,380
Let's have a look.

1141
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:59,380
I'll take 2 of them out, you take 1.

1142
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:04,820
Better yet, you take 2, I take 1.
Pull over to the side.

1143
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:55,700
- I can't see shit!
- Me, either. What is this shit?

1144
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,340
Got a light?

1145
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,300
It's Rudd's, whatever it is.

1146
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:03,540
I still can't see shit.

1147
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:08,700
- You got something?
- I don't know. It's a car.

1148
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,220
Shit! Fort Knox!

1149
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:21,660
Hell, how much is it?

1150
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,820
Thousands.

1151
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,460
Fucking millions.

1152
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:31,500
Billions of fucking Donald Trump lotto.

1153
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:42,700
Look at this.

1154
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,380
These are $1,000 bills!

1155
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:51,580
With what I'm holding in my hand
I could put all my kids through college.

1156
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,020
Take it.

1157
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,100
Fucking drug money.

1158
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,020
Do something good with it.

1159
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:07,700
Rudd won't need it where he's going.

1160
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:22,100
Load the container.

1161
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:26,020
The next time the sun hits
their bodies, they'll be in Cape Town.

1162
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:32,900
- Hey, this thing's moving.
- It sure as hell is.

1163
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,780
- What are we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

1164
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,020
Let's shoot our way out.

1165
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,300
No, don't. I got a better idea.

1166
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:36,020
Our money.

1167
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,260
Make sure they're dead.

1168
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:56,140
- You go first. I'm too old.
- You go first. I'll cover you.

1169
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:13,500
- How do we get out of here?
- I'll go this way.

1170
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:16,060
I'll go this way and check over here.

1171
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:41,940
Oh, shit!

1172
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:52,900
Riggs, you okay?

1173
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:10,900
Drop it, asshole!

1174
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:19,540
Diplomatic immunity!

1175
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:32,220
It's just been revoked.

1176
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:52,860
You're breathing. You're not dead.

1177
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:55,180
No, don't die.

1178
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:58,540
You're not dead until I tell you.

1179
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:03,380
You got that, Riggs?
You're not dead until I tell you.

1180
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:05,140
You got that?

1181
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:08,020
You' re not dead until I tell you.

1182
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:10,540
Now, breathe with me.

1183
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:12,140
Breathe.

1184
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:19,540
Rog, in my pocket.

1185
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:32,380
I want you to throw those things away.
Those things will kill you.

1186
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,420
You son-of-a-bitch.

1187
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:44,500
I thought you were dying.

1188
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:48,220
I didn't die on your toilet,
I'm not going to die in your arms.

1189
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:50,060
You son-of-a-bitch.

1190
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:58,500
Where are they? Are they all gone?
Did you get the bad guys?

1191
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:01,020
They been dekaffirnated.

1192
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:12,380
Don't make me laugh! Jesus!

1193
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:17,380
Did anyone ever tell you...

1194
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:21,820
...you really are a beautiful man?

1195
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:28,460
Give us a kiss.

1196
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,300
Where'd that bullet hit you?
