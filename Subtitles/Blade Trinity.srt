2
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,662
<i>In the movies, Dracula wears a cape...</i>

3
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>...and some old English guy
always manages to save the day...</i>

4
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,251
<i>...at the last minute
with crosses and holy water.</i>

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,921
<i>But everybody knows
the movies are full of shit.</i>

6
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:50,926
<i>The truth is it started with Blade,
and it ended with him.</i>

7
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,929
<i>The rest of us were just
along for the ride.</i>

8
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,352
What's this chicken scratch?

9
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,521
It's cuneiform.

10
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,065
It's about 4000 years old.

11
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,903
- So why here?
- Because this is the cradle of civilization.

12
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,782
He would have been comfortable here.

13
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,326
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.

14
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,746
- There's something beneath us.
- You find a watch?

15
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,251
Is it a body?

16
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,798
Guys?

17
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,889
Go.

18
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,351
What the fuck? Motherfucker!

19
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,417
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist...

20
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,504
...and author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller:

21
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,633
<i>Human Health: The Whole
Being Breakthrough.</i>

22
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,512
Also with us, Martin Vreede, chief of police.

23
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,016
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls...

24
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,020
...next on <i>Bentley Tittle Live</i>.

25
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:36,610
Okay, Dr. Vance, you are
a psychiatrist and a biochemist...

26
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,069
...isn't that true?

27
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,363
Yes, uh, Bentley, I am both.

28
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,328
And it's for a reason. I have always believed
that true health can only be achieved...

29
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,539
...if we reconcile the body and the mind.

30
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,710
And, of course, in order to do that,
we have to get rid of a lot of old notions.

31
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,172
Okay, and how does
that fit in with vampires?

32
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:04,137
Uh, in the case of vampires, we're dealing
with creatures that are the repositories...

33
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,723
...of some of our most taboo thoughts.

34
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,433
- Okay.
- Predatory rage.

35
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,435
- Yeah.
- Sexual sadism.

36
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,771
- Sexual?
- Sexual sadism.

37
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,691
These are very scary subjects for people
to own up to, and they're right inside.

38
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,987
So, what you're saying is we pass
the buck onto someone else.

39
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,199
- You bet we do.
- And vampires...?

40
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,827
Well, for instance, there's
a hereditary blood disease.

41
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,287
I talk about it in my book,
it's called porphyria.

42
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:35,544
And the symptoms of this disease are
remarkably similar to classic vampire traits.

43
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,380
The people who suffer from
this disease are anemic.

44
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:43,134
They become intolerant to sunlight.
They can't handle garlic.

45
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:47,013
Garlic? Chief Vreede, okay,
what's your take on all these rumors...

46
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,809
...we've been hearing about vampires?
Vampires. Vampires! What?

47
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:56,022
The only vampires I'm worried about are
the ones passing the bar exam. Ha-ha-ha.

48
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,067
Ahem.

49
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,697
Seriously though, if vampires existed,
don't you think we would've found them by now?

50
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,700
The truth is, our streets
have never been safer.

51
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,412
Homicides, assaults, violent crime
is down across the board.

52
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,289
People wanna be concerned...

53
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,333
...they should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.

54
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,835
That's the guy I wanna hear about.

55
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,462
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?

56
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,923
He's a sociopath that
we've been pursuing.

57
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,468
Blade is a troubled individual.

58
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,888
I understand that he is
under the impression...

59
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,265
...that there is a vast
conspiracy of vampires.

60
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,933
Heh, heh. Yeah.

61
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,646
You've got to look at the psychiatric
underpinnings of a belief like that.

62
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:42,360
Odds are, he believes that he is
out there slaying monsters.

63
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,529
- Mm-hm.
- But what he's really doing...

64
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,073
...is trying to kill aspects of himself.

65
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,589
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.

66
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,134
Got it. Heading westbound.
I'm just beneath you.

67
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,761
Go.

68
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,187
Come on!

69
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,691
I got him. Pull!

70
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,818
You all right, man?

71
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,004
He's got a gun!

72
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,353
- Oh, my God!
- Aah!

73
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,746
Staked you with silver.

74
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,540
Why aren't you ash?

75
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,918
Why aren't you smarter?

76
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,421
Not a vampire, dumb shit!

77
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,054
Set your sorry ass up.

78
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,651
Hm.

79
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,949
Damn.

80
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,436
Oh, Blade.

81
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,350
What the fuck happened tonight?

82
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,896
How should I know?

83
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,190
He was human.

84
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,111
You're getting reckless, Blade.
Killing vampires is clean.

85
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,906
They ash, don't leave
any evidence behind.

86
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,450
Killing humans is messy.

87
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,493
You better hope nobody ID'd you.

88
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,580
This worked really good.

89
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,254
- What's this?
- A new delivery system for your serum.

90
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,298
It's an effervescent inhaler.

91
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,216
Just bite down on the mouth guard.

92
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,344
Delivery's automatic.

93
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,970
Some friends of mine made it.

94
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,222
Hm. Friends?

95
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,059
Yeah. You remember those?

96
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,062
<i>It was horrible. The one car crashed...</i>

97
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,230
<i>...then the guy in the coat
shot the other guy.</i>

98
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,608
<i>- It looked like there was a lot of blood.
- Thank you.</i>

99
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,860
<i>That was just a taste
of the mayhem that occurred...</i>

100
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,947
<i>...during tonight's brazen shootout
that left at least four people dead.</i>

101
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,743
<i>Now, apparently, an anonymous citizen
captured the whole event on video.</i>

102
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,661
Hey, Ray. Hey, we got a lead.

103
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,163
Let's catch a plane, Wilson.

104
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,915
Time to take these cowboys down.

105
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,751
That's what I'm talking about.

106
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,036
What's he been doing?

107
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,746
Fuck-all. Just feeding.

108
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,456
Been through five of them so far.

109
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,041
You think we have enough security?

110
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,294
We didn't capture him,
he allowed us to take him in.

111
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,922
You understand? I'm gonna go in.

112
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,368
You shouldn't have woken me.

113
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,579
We had to.

114
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,588
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.

115
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,050
What makes you think I care?

116
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,384
Your people need you.

117
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,844
My people?

118
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,935
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.

119
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,395
Look how far you have fallen.

120
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,648
The world's changed since your time.

121
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,525
The humans have a new hunter.

122
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,528
Blade.

123
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,656
And you'd like me to kill him, wouldn't you?

124
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,616
Yes.

125
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,703
<i>You can't fight the curse</i>

126
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,871
<i>You can't call the doctor</i>

127
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,593
<i>With the thirsty love guzzler</i>

128
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,263
<i>From the dark side, baby
Don't be afraid</i>

129
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,973
<i>You can't fight the thirst</i>

130
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,729
Subject is heading west.

131
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,981
Got him.

132
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,361
Congratulations. You're famous.

133
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,862
Somebody nailed us.

134
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,574
Your face is all over
the papers and television.

135
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,367
Media's eating it up.

136
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,035
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.

137
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,956
Something like this,
taking out a human...

138
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,709
...as far as the rest
of the world is concerned...

139
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,961
...you're public enemy number one.

140
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,922
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.

141
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,676
Damn it, Blade, don't you
see what they're doing?

142
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,846
They're waging a goddamn P.R. campaign.

143
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,099
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about...

144
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,561
...we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world too.

145
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,232
You worry too much, old man.

146
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,735
It's why we're still alive, goddamn it.

147
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,155
I've been doing this since before
you were born, Blade.

148
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,073
You're like a son to me.

149
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,868
I'm sorry I got old on you.

150
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,121
I see you alone, surrounded by enemies.

151
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,165
And it breaks my heart.

152
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,252
We can't win this war alone.

153
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,261
Look at it. He just gave me the evil eye.
Come on, man. What about that guy?

154
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:06,437
- Prostitute, baby. Whoo-hoo!
- Come on! Quit fucking around!

155
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,106
I'm hungry and I want to eat somebody.

156
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:14,111
- What about him?
- No fatties. They taste like Cheetos.

157
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,948
I don't know. I like him.

158
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,912
Wait. What about that?
Shrunken apple-headed bitch.

159
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,538
That fucking sorry ass over there.

160
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,876
Fucking blow me, man!
Just pick one already. Jesus Christ!

161
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,587
Oh, got it! Got it!

162
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,214
Baby on board.

163
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,176
Oh, looks like we got
ourselves a combo meal!

164
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,735
Chickie, chickie, chickie.

165
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,327
Oh, yeah, baby!

166
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,329
What's for dinner?

167
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,594
Heh, heh. Hey, pretty lady.

168
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,395
No! No!

169
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,731
No!

170
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,986
Scream if this hurts, <i>chica</i>.

171
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,449
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Aah!

172
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,910
"Fuck you"?

173
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,372
Garlic!

174
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,692
Come on!

175
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,354
Scream if this hurts, <i>chica</i>.

176
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,215
What is it?

177
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,177
What you were worried about.

178
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,862
Let's go, let's go!

179
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,785
<i>Shoot to kill!</i>

180
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,838
Move a finger, and you're dead.

181
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,631
How's about this one?

182
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,091
He's got something in his hand!

183
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,509
Get out, Blade!

184
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,100
Shit!

185
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,867
What's going on in there?

186
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,368
Somebody talk to me!

187
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,967
Hold it right there!

188
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,427
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

189
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,144
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

190
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:33,068
Special agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale. FBI.

191
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,696
We've been tracking you a long time.

192
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,823
Whistler.

193
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,241
Dead.

194
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,703
Just like all your victims.

195
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,081
How many people have you killed, Blade?

196
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,625
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?

197
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,171
1182.

198
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,340
But they were all familiars.

199
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,384
People who work with them.

200
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:01,471
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?

201
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,974
So how do you kill these
bloodsuckers, tough guy?

202
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,684
Maybe you can give us some pointers.

203
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,895
- You can stake them, right?
- What about sunlight?

204
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,106
- They ain't feeling sunlight right?
- What about crosses? Do they still work?

205
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,108
- In this day and age?
- I don't know, Ray.

206
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,861
What if Mr. Homey Vampire's like Jewish?

207
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,114
- Ha, ha. That's a good point.
- Heh, heh.

208
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,451
And what about garlic?
Does that work on Hindu vampires?

209
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,995
Or do you need like saffron or some shit?

210
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,498
- That was quick.
- Thank you.

211
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,340
You can keep doing your song and
dance as long as you want, Blade.

212
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,258
It's not gonna play.

213
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,427
We know what you are.

214
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,262
You're a stone-cold killer.

215
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,181
And you're sick as fuck.

216
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,808
Let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.

217
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,686
Hello, Blade.

218
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,438
My name is Dr. Vance.

219
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:55,442
I've been charged with giving
you a psychiatric evaluation.

220
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,780
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?

221
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,782
He's all yours.

222
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,007
I know you must find
this very frightening...

223
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,803
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

224
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,472
And in order for me to do that...

225
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,808
...I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions.

226
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,310
Okay?

227
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:36,233
Heh. You know, Blade, the darnedest thing.
I was signing in at Security...

228
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,611
...and couldn't remember the date.

229
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,990
Do you know what day it is?

230
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,996
How about the president?

231
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,331
You know who that is?

232
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,542
Who's in the White House right now?

233
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,377
An asshole.

234
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,217
I think somebody here wants
to talk about vampires.

235
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,179
Vampires.

236
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,852
For everyone else, it's kind of silly.

237
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,606
I had a set of wax teeth
when I was 7 years old.

238
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,610
It was fun.

239
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,113
I could be somebody else.

240
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,784
But I wanna hear you talk
about vampires.

241
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,746
What can you tell me about them?

242
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,624
They exist.

243
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,627
Are you one of them?

244
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:45,635
Sometimes the scariest monster of all...

245
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,888
...is the one in the mirror.

246
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,853
Tell me about blood.

247
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,772
When you drink blood...

248
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,858
...do you ever feel sexually aroused?

249
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,241
It just strikes me that this
business of vampirism...

250
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:14,539
...has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.

251
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,627
Nuzzling into someone's neck.

252
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,505
A nocturnal visit...

253
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:27,260
...with promises of delicious
physical intimacy.

254
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,517
The very sweet taste of saliva...

255
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,061
...mixed with skin.

256
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,273
Oh. Sounds good to me.

257
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,110
But where's it come from?

258
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,028
That's what I wanna know.

259
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:51,451
And I'm starting to wonder what your
relationship with your mother was like.

260
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,248
Were the two of you very close?

261
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,257
He's psychotic.

262
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,426
- No shit.
- For his safety and for the public's...

263
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,011
...I'm recommending he be
transferred to County Psychiatric...

264
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,680
Fuck that! That man is my prisoner.

265
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,141
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of crimes.

266
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,309
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.

267
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,979
Got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.

268
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,857
That man is my prisoner!
Don't fuck with my thing!

269
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,860
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.

270
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,070
You're supposed to be
working with us, chief.

271
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,447
Not this time.

272
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,372
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.

273
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,377
The usual dose for this sort
of thing is 200, 300 milligrams...

274
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:47,466
...but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself...

275
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,093
...I'll kick it up to a couple thousand.

276
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,679
You don't have a problem
with needles, do you?

277
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,475
There.

278
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,018
That wasn't so bad, was it?

279
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,063
Ooh. You're weak.

280
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,733
In need of your serum.

281
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,486
That must be a bad feeling.

282
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,323
I mean, who would've imagined...

283
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,576
...that a mere human like me
could have overpowered you.

284
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,331
You're one of them.

285
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,334
A familiar.

286
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,340
Going on five years now.

287
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,137
It's the endgame, Blade.

288
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,224
All their plans are coming to fruition.

289
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,853
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?

290
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:53,031
I hate familiars.

291
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,418
<i>It's why we're still alive, goddamn it.</i>

292
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,004
<i>You're like a son to me.</i>

293
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:14,553
<i>I'm sorry I got old on you.</i>

294
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:20,058
<i>I see you alone, surrounded by enemies.</i>

295
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,185
<i>It breaks my heart.</i>

296
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,629
Hi, Blade.

297
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,506
So glad to finally meet you.

298
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,550
I am such a fan.

299
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,012
I like your tattoos.

300
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,306
Do they mean anything?

301
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,891
Stupid.

302
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,102
Are you okay?

303
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,979
Are you tired?

304
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,774
You're weak.

305
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,448
We moved the humans around.

306
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,742
Like pawns.

307
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,286
We used them...

308
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,705
...to flush you out.

309
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,591
You're not so big.

310
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,470
You're all alone, Blade.

311
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,598
No one's gonna help you now.

312
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,163
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!

313
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,627
Wake up. This is your rescue.

314
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,343
Go!

315
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,267
Freeze!

316
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,491
Whistler!

317
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,035
This way!

318
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,379
Blade! You're dead!

319
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,965
Get down!

320
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,723
Blade.

321
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,524
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

322
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,360
Where are you going?
Where the fuck is he going?

323
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,654
This is supposed to be a rescue!

324
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,036
Get back, get back!

325
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,458
- We're pinned down.
- I can't shoot around corners.

326
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,168
I can.

327
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,233
Okay. We're fucked.

328
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,526
We're fine.

329
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,292
Forgot my sword.

330
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,048
<i>We are soldiers, after all</i>

331
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,842
<i>Down by honor we won't fall
After all</i>

332
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,344
Whoo!

333
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,012
Come on!

334
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,180
<i>Comin' out the back end</i>

335
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,724
<i>Dead at you
He throwin' that hot lead at you</i>

336
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,352
<i>Swang affiliate, XO sip, a gold getter</i>

337
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,354
<i>With the rest together
I'm a cold killer</i>

338
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,648
<i>It's "Me Against the World" like 2Pac</i>

339
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,400
<i>And like Biggie
I'm "Ready to Die" for what you got</i>

340
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,735
Abby.

341
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:53,868
We got him.

342
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,578
We'll be there soon.

343
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,413
Who the hell are you people?

344
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,291
Well, my name is Hannibal King.

345
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,794
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.

346
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,712
Whistler's daughter.

347
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,852
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.

348
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:23,481
They did. I was born
later out of wedlock.

349
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,278
When I came of age, I tracked my dad
down, and I told him I wanted in.

350
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,948
Been doing it ever since.

351
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,707
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

352
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,710
How do you bankroll this operation?

353
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,336
I date a lot of older men.

354
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,673
Come on, man, I'm joking.

355
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,425
You met Dex.

356
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,843
This is Hedges.

357
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,971
Sommerfield. She's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.

358
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:59,934
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter. Zoe.

359
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,896
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.

360
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:08,026
Hm. Sounds like rejects from
a Saturday morning cartoon.

361
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,904
We were gonna go with the Care Bears,
but that was taken.

362
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,827
- How many of you are there?
- There's enough.

363
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,579
We operate in sleeper cells.

364
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,415
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.

365
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,959
Consider us your reinforcements.

366
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,671
What, you amateurs are
supposed to be helping me?

367
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,383
Heh. You?

368
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,761
Look at you.

369
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,179
You're kids.

370
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,556
You're not ready to roll with this.

371
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,059
I mean, look at the way you're dressed.

372
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,895
What, that's supposed to be tactical?

373
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,524
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you." It's a joke, huh?

374
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,403
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?

375
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:57,325
- You think this is a fucking sitcom?
- Okay, first off, that's just rude.

376
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:01,287
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.

377
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,541
Mm. I'm impressed.

378
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,753
Look, Blade, my father
meant for us to help you.

379
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,798
Like it or not, we are all you got.

380
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,093
What the hell makes you think you
know about hunting vampires?

381
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,971
Well, here's for starters.

382
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,057
I used to be one.

383
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,976
Do I pass the audition?

384
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,188
Rookies.

385
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,274
Fucking Hannibal King!

386
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:34,153
I should've ripped his bleeding
heart out when I had the chance!

387
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,621
We had Blade.

388
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,039
We had him!

389
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,961
And don't tell me "I told you so," Asher.

390
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,963
What's wrong, half-pint?
You need a timeout?

391
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,172
Blow me.

392
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,843
We got caught with our pants down.

393
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,261
Pants down?

394
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,514
They pretty much fucking ass-raped us.

395
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,015
Oh, you loved it.

396
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,809
Has he been told?

397
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,478
About your failure?

398
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,647
Yes.

399
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,734
Maybe it's time I joined the game.

400
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,995
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?

401
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,665
You see her, and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off...

402
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:31,752
...but you still manage
to ask for her number.

403
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,838
Well, that's all I ever hook up with.

404
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,631
But this betty...

405
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:41,012
...whoa, she blew them all away
in the shitstorm sweepstakes.

406
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,181
Her name is Danica Talos.

407
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,807
You met her earlier.

408
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,394
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.

409
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,732
Moving on.

410
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,735
The man on her left is her brother, Asher.

411
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,363
And this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.

412
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,073
I picked Danica up in a bar...

413
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,784
...and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck...

414
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,912
...as her little vampire cabana boy.

415
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,497
Eventually, Abigail found me.

416
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,293
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.

417
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,631
And that's basically turning
a frown upside down.

418
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,676
We need to pool our resources, Blade.

419
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,678
"We"?

420
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,182
Yeah, we.

421
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,726
He's come back.

422
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,688
Take a look at this.

423
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,320
You gotta be kidding me.

424
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,538
- Where'd you guys get this stuff?
- I stole most of it.

425
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,042
Danica had a huge collection.
He had stone work...

426
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,671
...iron work, weaponry, art.

427
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,925
This stuff that shows up everywhere,
this symbol, this glyph.

428
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,844
It's on everything in here.
He is real.

429
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,348
You dig beneath all the myths,
all the layers of bullshit...

430
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,850
...that have cluttered our culture
for the last 500 years...

431
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,520
...and eventually, you're
gonna strike the truth.

432
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:14,939
So the movies are true.

433
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:19,151
The movies are just a comforting
fairytale compared to the real deal.

434
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,404
Bram Stoker, he wrote a good yarn.

435
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:27,076
But the events he described back in 1897...
God, that was just a tiny piece of the mosaic.

436
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:32,873
The real Dracula, his origins,
date back much, much earlier than that.

437
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,252
- How early?
- Try 6 or 7 thousand years.

438
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,796
This is a piece of his armor.

439
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,341
With it, we were able to extrapolate
a basic idea of what this fucker looked like.

440
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,718
Check this out.

441
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,013
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.

442
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:51,392
The Babylonians worshiped him as Dagon,
and now they call him Drake.

443
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,895
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.

444
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:07,366
<i>Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this:</i>

445
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:12,788
He was the first of his kind.

446
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,585
<i>The patriarch of</i> Hominus nocturna.

447
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,426
<i>He was born perfect.</i>

448
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:33,392
<i>And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.</i>

449
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,478
<i>Forget the movies, forget the books.</i>

450
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,313
<i>There's no happy ending with this guy.</i>

451
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,026
<i>He's been there, moving
behind the scenes...</i>

452
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,655
<i>...cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...</i>

453
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,159
...just like that...

454
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,165
...he up and disappeared.

455
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,875
And then we heard a rumor.

456
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,127
The vampires were searching for him.

457
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,630
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages...

458
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,800
...that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.

459
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,054
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.

460
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,014
And he was pissed.

461
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,323
In the window...

462
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,742
You sell vampire merchandise?

463
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,789
Uh, yeah. Look around.

464
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,541
We might have a few things.

465
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,129
We've got Dracula lunchboxes.

466
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,547
Did you see those?

467
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:30,676
There's bobbleheads, key chains.

468
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,344
This is funny.

469
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,059
<i>The garlic gets me every time.</i>

470
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,688
We've got just about anything.

471
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,774
Even vampire vibrators.

472
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,654
Here, check this out.

473
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,494
"Dracola." Makes you
wanna cry, doesn't it?

474
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,671
Was there something special you needed?

475
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,549
Hey, guy.

476
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,927
She's talking to you.

477
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,186
What?

478
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,188
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?

479
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,108
No!

480
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,098
- Why wake up Drake now?
- That's what we've been trying to figure out.

481
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,516
When I was under the fang...

482
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,603
...there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.

483
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,273
Never figured out why they'd wanna
destroy their food source.

484
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,649
That makes no sense, right?

485
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,693
They've always had plans
for the human race.

486
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,112
It seems likely that whatever
they're cooking up...

487
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,823
...Drake's return is part of it.
Let's face it...

488
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,992
...we are fighting a losing battle here.

489
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,619
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year. Big deal.

490
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,664
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.

491
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:24,957
We need a new tactic.

492
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,208
Like what?

493
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,876
A biological weapon.

494
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:30,963
For you sighted people...

495
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,676
...here's a little show-and-tell.

496
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,470
For the last year, I've been
working with synthesized DNA...

497
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:42,349
...in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.

498
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,518
We're calling it DayStar.

499
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,270
Think about it, Blade.

500
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,440
We could wipe them all out
in one single move.

501
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,191
So, what's been holding you back?

502
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,611
The lethality in vampires is still spotty.

503
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,947
The bottom line is, we need a better
strand of DNA to work with.

504
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,742
We need Dracula's blood.

505
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,411
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race...

506
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,872
...his DNA is still pure.

507
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,585
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.

508
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:15,466
We get his blood, we can boost DayStar's
viral efficacy to 100 percent.

509
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,718
All the vampires go bye-bye.

510
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,847
So can we just go right ahead
and sign you up...

511
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,183
...for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?

512
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,899
Oh. Uh...

513
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,361
Holy shit. Um... Gentlemen and hottie...

514
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,280
...we have a wide assortment of ass-kickery...

515
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,324
...for your viewing pleasure today.

516
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:44,244
Electronic pistol.
Comes in a variety of tasty calibers.

517
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,538
Explosive rounds.

518
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,791
Yeah, but with a concentrated
burst of UV light...

519
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,834
...instead of your standard hollow points.

520
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:52,628
I call them sundogs.

521
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,881
Hedges. Super Size me, sweetheart.

522
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,761
This little peashooter,
it's a modified version...

523
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,555
...of the Army's Objective
Individual Combat Weapon.

524
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,349
Pick your poison: sundogs, stakes...

525
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,975
...heat-seeking mini rockets.

526
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,354
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy will pump them out.

527
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:15,025
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...

528
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:18,696
Oh, God. Over here, we...

529
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,449
We call this the UV Arc.

530
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,621
Whoa. Sorry. The two points are
connected by a powerful UV laser...

531
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,748
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.

532
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,960
This bad boy is half as hot as the sun.

533
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,380
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.

534
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,758
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.

535
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,177
Turning into mist? Kind of doubt it.

536
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,764
General shape-shifting? Maybe.

537
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:49,059
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that...

538
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:53,063
...but another human,
with practice, could be possible.

539
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,567
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.

540
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,945
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones...

541
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:03,490
I have a... I have a question
about that, Hedges.

542
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,409
Have you ever been laid?

543
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:07,870
Many times.

544
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,121
With ladies.

545
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,583
Time for a little refresher.

546
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,003
Weakest link in the vampire
chain of command...

547
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,130
...has always been their familiars.

548
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,466
Since the vampires can't
go out in the daylight...

549
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,385
...they get the humans
to do all their dirty work.

550
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,304
We bleed the wannabes...

551
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,348
...sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.

552
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,517
I got you some new wheels.

553
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,144
You take care of it, now.

554
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,486
She's making playlists.

555
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,405
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.

556
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,866
It's like her own internal
soundtrack, you know?

557
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:49,995
Dark-core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.

558
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,582
Me, I'm more of a David
Hasselhoff fan, you know?

559
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,682
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.

560
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,017
Fuck! No, no! Please! Please!

561
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,352
Who's your handler?

562
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:58,772
I don't know my fucking handler.
I swear. I swear!

563
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:01,108
Oh, shit! Please! Please! Aah!

564
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,447
Oh, it's you.

565
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,241
I'll take that.

566
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,619
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

567
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,791
<i>Hello?</i>

568
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,042
<i>Hello?</i>

569
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,088
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.

570
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,381
Heh.

571
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,050
It's for you. Yeah, go ahead.

572
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,719
Hello?

573
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,470
Aah!

574
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,182
You know, at some point, you, uh...

575
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,643
You might wanna consider
sitting down with somebody.

576
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,687
You know? Have a little share time.

577
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,190
Kick back. Get in touch with your
inner child. That sort of thing.

578
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,778
Also, just a thought, but you might wanna
consider blinking once in a while.

579
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:55,829
I'm sorry, I, uh...
I ate a lot of sugar today.

580
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,097
Hey.

581
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,516
You just can't walk in here like that.
Unh!

582
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,442
Excuse me, sir.

583
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,951
Don't do that.

584
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,596
- Where's Vance?
- I'm sorry, you can't see Dr. Vance now.

585
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,273
Sit.

586
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,405
Can I, uh...? Can I help you?

587
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,573
Remember me? Time for payback.

588
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,076
All right, Vance, what the hell do you know?

589
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,039
Oh, Jesus. It's him.

590
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,833
Abby, it's Drake!

591
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,059
So you're the hunter they all fear.

592
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,021
- I had a feeling about you.
- Just shoot him!

593
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,605
Go ahead, Blade.

594
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:46,982
Show me what you're made of.

595
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:19,991
Oh, my God!

596
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,202
He got my baby! Aah!

597
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,122
No! My baby!

598
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,808
Ah. Careful, Daywalker.

599
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,852
I've been told about you...

600
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,979
...your weakness for humans.

601
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,606
Why'd you kill Vance?

602
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,941
He'd outlived his purpose.

603
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,818
He died a good death.

604
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,612
Quick, clean.

605
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,572
I wouldn't know anything about that.

606
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,115
You will.

607
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,578
How are you able to survive in sunlight?

608
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,997
Haven't you read Stoker's fable?

609
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,709
I was the first of the vampires.

610
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,837
I am unique.

611
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,840
- So that's why they brought you back.
- Of course.

612
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:02,093
They believe through me
they could become Daywalkers.

613
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,017
Look at them down there.

614
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,020
Scurrying around like insects.

615
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:16,149
They don't know anything about
honor or living by the sword...

616
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:17,943
...not like you and I do.

617
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:21,905
Do you think they could ever grasp
what it means to be immortal?

618
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,365
You're not immortal.

619
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:27,744
I must have heard hundreds of you
rodents make the same claim.

620
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,206
Each one of them have tasted
the end of my sword.

621
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,250
Perhaps I will too, then...

622
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,920
...but I think it is more likely,
the next time we meet...

623
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:39,422
...you fall before mine.

624
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,508
Catch!

625
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,736
Cootchie-coo.

626
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,408
Did you see that guy?
We're gonna lose, man. We're gonna...

627
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,702
Oh! God!

628
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,704
We're gonna fucking lose!

629
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,330
- Okay.
- Ugh.

630
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,375
What did the one lesbian
vampire say to the other?

631
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:20,171
- Shut up, King.
- See you in 28 days. Ha, ha!

632
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,633
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. What...?
What is that? What are you doing?

633
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,678
It's an elastic protein, okay?
It's gonna stop the hemorrhaging.

634
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:29,055
Okay. Is it gonna hurt?

635
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:30,974
Yeah, it's gonna sting a little.

636
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,600
Really? Unh.

637
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:38,189
Fuck me! Ow!

638
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,862
<i>I had a family once.</i>

639
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,948
Wife, two daughters.

640
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,872
<i>Then a drifter came calling one evening.</i>

641
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,249
A vampire.

642
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,045
<i>He toyed with them first.</i>

643
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:05,675
Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.

644
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,304
<i>I've been doing this a long time.</i>

645
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,556
Since before you were born.

646
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,352
<i>I don't want this life for you, Abby.</i>

647
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,354
Hey, Blade.

648
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,107
I got a question for you.

649
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,776
Say we're successful.
Say we wipe out all the vampires.

650
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,528
What then, huh?

651
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:08,988
You ever ask yourself that?

652
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:16,621
I mean, somehow, I don't picture you
teaching karate at the local Y.

653
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,008
He hates me, doesn't he?

654
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:30,343
Yeah.

655
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,440
Why do you wear that symbol?

656
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:49,112
Old habits.

657
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,868
I was a good Catholic school girl.

658
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,664
- Once.
- I was there when they crucified him.

659
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,419
He died for their sins.

660
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:06,629
Not mine.

661
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,467
And what are your sins?

662
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,597
Would you care to confess them?

663
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,728
Take it off.

664
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,564
Why?

665
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,525
I will make you a better one.

666
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,595
There's an old saying:

667
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,643
"Kill one man, you're a murderer.

668
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,647
Kill a million, a king.

669
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,359
Kill them all...

670
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,986
...a God."

671
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,972
Why do you do that?

672
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:44,102
Because there's something
bad inside of me.

673
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,522
This keeps it from getting out.

674
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,691
Why can't you just be nice?

675
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,740
Because the world isn't nice.

676
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,998
<i>I found where the vampires are working.</i>

677
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,417
Biomedica Enterprises.

678
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,295
They've been buying up
all sorts of supplies.

679
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,963
Check it out.

680
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:14,632
Taq polymerase.

681
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,552
Bone-marrow growth supplement.

682
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,638
Genetic-sequencing enzymes.

683
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,433
- Hm.
- You want a party favor?

684
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,686
Lucky seven. Silver hollow points.

685
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,229
Done.

686
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,177
You wanted to see me?

687
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,304
We've got trouble.

688
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,140
Doing a little moonlighting, chief?

689
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,683
Shit!

690
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,905
What are you doing here?

691
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,449
Talk.

692
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,201
Talk.

693
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,206
Spill it!

694
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:29,499
You know what we're doing.

695
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,626
What's inside?

696
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:42,095
Now, what's behind door number one?

697
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,224
I can't tell you. They... They'll kill me.

698
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,393
Kill you? Motherfucker, I'll kill you.

699
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,103
I'll just enjoy it better.

700
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,946
You know the routine.

701
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,005
Lights.

702
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,343
God in heaven.

703
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,944
What is this place?

704
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,947
It's a blood-farming facility.

705
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,166
Vampires decided that hunting
humans on a piecemeal basis was...

706
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,667
...too inefficient.

707
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,629
Why kill your prey when you
can keep them alive?

708
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,926
Under optimal conditions,
a donor can generate...

709
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,679
...anywhere from 50 to 100 pints of blood.

710
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,973
Productive.

711
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,310
Where do you get all these people?

712
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,731
They got processing centers
in every major city.

713
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,983
At any given time, there's what...

714
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,779
...2, 3 million homeless
wandering around America?

715
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,739
They just pull them in off the streets.

716
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,659
Nobody cares about them.

717
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,246
We're doing this country a service, really.

718
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,251
Vampire final solution.

719
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,296
Are they aware?

720
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,465
Do they feel anything?

721
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:45,343
They're in a chemical-induced coma.

722
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,011
They're brain-dead.

723
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,225
Look at this.

724
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,477
This the future you want?

725
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:59,065
Do you think that they have
a place for you in their future?

726
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,400
We don't have a choice.

727
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,904
They're going to win.
Can't you see that?

728
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,531
He's come back!

729
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,866
There's nothing stopping them now.

730
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,576
There's me.

731
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:12,954
Go.

732
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,332
You got 20 seconds.

733
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,503
Twenty.

734
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:29,387
Shutdown password, what is it?

735
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,347
Harvest.

736
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,391
Put it in.

737
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,616
Let's go.

738
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,965
Where'd you go?
See? I turned my back on you.

739
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,759
- You win.
- One more, one more.

740
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:12,597
"Now, Nome King, having
never tried to be good...

741
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,474
...was very bad indeed.

742
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:19,312
Having decided to conquer the land of Oz...

743
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,023
...and to destroy Emerald City..."

744
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:25,276
<i>I get that paper and I'm chillin' on the low</i>

745
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,862
<i>All I need is more money, more</i>

746
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,909
- This ain't no video game.
- This ain't no video game.

747
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,412
Oh!

748
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,039
Come on, now.

749
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,401
Dude, you're dead.

750
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,495
Mom, the lights are weird.

751
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,247
What do you mean?

752
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,916
They're going on and off.

753
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,004
Guys?

754
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:31,550
Zoe, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide, okay?

755
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:34,178
Like we talked about. Go on.

756
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:12,800
Zoe?

757
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,428
Get out of here, Zoe!

758
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:19,265
Hide! God dammit, Zoe!

759
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,771
Something's not right.

760
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,320
King!

761
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,638
Zoe?

762
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,264
Zoe.

763
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,766
Zoe?

764
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:16,186
Whistler.

765
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:33,639
Use it.

766
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:37,851
Use it.

767
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,899
Use it.

768
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,713
Back off, pooch.

769
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,803
Jesus Christ!

770
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,764
What the fuck?

771
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:19,017
- Good dog.
- What the fuck?

772
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:25,190
His name's Pac-Man.

773
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:29,153
We've been porting the vampire gene
into other species. Experimenting.

774
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:33,240
You made a goddamn vampire Pomeranian?

775
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,034
Yeah.

776
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,417
Precious, isn't he?

777
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,669
Well, that depends who you ask,
because clearly...

778
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,880
...this dog has a bigger dick than you.

779
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:52,968
And when the fuck did you
see my dick, fuck-face?

780
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:55,888
Ow!

781
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:58,474
I was talking to her!

782
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,188
Poor King.

783
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:08,275
You look so distraught.

784
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:14,156
- Unh!
- Give me that chair.

785
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,210
You're tasting a little bland, lover.

786
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,254
Are you getting enough
fatty acids in your diet?

787
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:32,299
Have you tried lake trout?

788
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,092
Mackerel?

789
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:37,513
How about you take
a sugar-frosted fuck...

790
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,681
...off the end of my dick?

791
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:44,811
And how about everyone here
not saying the word "dick" anymore?

792
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,731
It provokes my envy.

793
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,324
Tell us about Blade, King.

794
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:00,077
What's this weapon he's been planning?

795
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:02,788
I can tell you two things.

796
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:06,083
One...

797
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:10,420
...your hairdo is ridiculous.

798
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:16,593
Two, I ate a lot of garlic,
and I just farted.

799
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,262
Silent but deadly.

800
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:22,099
Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake.

801
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:25,102
All right! Fuck!
I'll tell you about the weapon.

802
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,778
It's a new flavor-crystal formula.

803
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,947
Twice the chocolatey goodness,
half the calories.

804
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,575
Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay. There.

805
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,294
You're brave, King.

806
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:51,837
I'll give you that.

807
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:56,758
But underneath all that swagger...

808
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:59,845
...I know what you really fear.

809
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:03,765
What would hurt you more
than anything else.

810
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:22,075
You don't wanna go back
to being one of us, do you?

811
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:34,421
I'm gonna bite you again, King.

812
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:39,217
And I'm gonna leave you
here while you turn.

813
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:43,055
I'm going to watch you day after day...

814
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:47,601
...as the thirst keeps building and building.

815
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,563
And then...

816
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:55,359
...when you can't stand it anymore...

817
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,700
...I'm gonna bring the little girl in here...

818
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,079
...for you to feed on.

819
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,208
Would you like that, King?

820
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,921
Would you enjoy taking her life?

821
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:34,064
Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.

822
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:57,462
Are you all right?

823
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:00,716
Yeah. I'll be fine.

824
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,429
Don't let it turn inward.

825
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,726
Ever since I can remember,
I've had this...

826
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:14,271
I've had this knife...

827
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,940
...of sadness in my heart.

828
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:26,742
And as long as it's there,
I'm strong and I'm untouchable.

829
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:32,164
But the moment that I take it out...

830
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:40,172
...I'll just die.

831
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:41,650
- He's one of ours.
- My name is Caulder.

832
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,902
I'll be your driver this evening.

833
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,122
Sommerfield left you a video message.

834
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,379
<i>If you're watching this,
I'm already dead.</i>

835
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:07,884
<i>If Zoe's alive, I want you to promise me
that you'll take care of her, okay?</i>

836
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,720
<i>I've been reading her
the Oz books every night.</i>

837
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,349
<i>We just started reading</i>
The Emerald City of Oz.

838
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,852
<i>You know, the one with the Nome King.</i>

839
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:23,358
<i>I think I've managed to cultivate
a workable strain of the DayStar virus.</i>

840
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,570
<i>As a precaution, I transmitted
the genetic sequence to Caulder...</i>

841
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,864
<i>...in case our main stock was destroyed.</i>

842
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:31,700
<i>In order for it to achieve
maximum lethality...</i>

843
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:34,202
<i>...you're gonna need
to interfuse it with Drake's blood.</i>

844
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:38,915
<i>Now, if it works, every vampire
in the immediate vicinity...</i>

845
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:40,584
<i>...should die almost instantly.</i>

846
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,420
<i>There's one other thing.</i>

847
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:46,590
<i>Blade, you need to know...</i>

848
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:49,342
<i>...there's a chance the virus
could destroy you too.</i>

849
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:50,844
<i>Because you're a hybrid...</i>

850
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:54,097
<i>...I'm not sure if your immune
system will be able to tolerate it.</i>

851
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:59,728
<i>I'm sorry. We just didn't have
enough time to properly test it.</i>

852
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:05,859
So shall we take a look
at the plague arrow?

853
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:10,530
I only had time to fabricate
a small amount of DayStar.

854
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:16,411
However, I was able to outfit it...

855
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,789
...in a compressed-gas projectile...

856
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:27,047
...that can be shot from one
of the four-barrel rifles or a bow.

857
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:33,094
Either way, you must be
sure that the shot counts.

858
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:36,473
You will simply not have
enough for a second shot.

859
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,109
Do you know who I am?

860
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:51,112
You're the Nome King.

861
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:52,781
Huh.

862
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,783
The Nome King.

863
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,826
How sweet.

864
01:30:57,035 --> 01:31:00,121
Tell me, child, do you want to die?

865
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:01,623
I'm not afraid.

866
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:03,375
I'll go to heaven.

867
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,293
There is no heaven.

868
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:08,797
No God, no angels.

869
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:12,217
The only thing in your
future is nothingness.

870
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,469
But what if you could change that?

871
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:17,472
What if you could remain a child forever?

872
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,933
Wouldn't you like that?

873
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:21,977
Wouldn't you accept that gift?

874
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:26,272
My friends are coming to kill you.

875
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,075
Gonna be sorry you did that.

876
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:43,868
Why?

877
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,997
Nobody's coming for you, King Shit.

878
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,209
Sure they are.

879
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:52,961
God.

880
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:58,550
See, one of the things you fuckheads
need to know about us Nightstalkers...

881
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:03,972
...is that when you join our club,
you get all sorts of groovy little door prizes.

882
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:08,810
And one of them is this nifty little tracking
node surgically implanted in your body.

883
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:11,980
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

884
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,485
See, when one of us goes missing...

885
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:21,489
...the others, they just dial up the satellite...

886
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:23,241
...which is in space.

887
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:24,951
And then, presto...

888
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:27,620
...instant cavalry.

889
01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:29,914
You like that, huh?

890
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:32,667
Go fuck your sister.

891
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:34,502
Okay, King.

892
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:39,340
Where is this tracking node of yours?

893
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:41,926
It's in my left ass cheek.

894
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,596
Fine.

895
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:46,514
It's in my right ass cheek.

896
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,268
Okay, I'm... Okay, seriously, now.

897
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:54,856
It's in the meat of my butt,
just below the Hello Kitty tattoo.

898
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:01,279
Seriously, just pull down my
tighty-whities and see for yourself.

899
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:04,157
Enough! It's not funny anymore!

900
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,784
No, it's not, you horse-humping bitch!

901
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:09,287
But it will be a few seconds from now.

902
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:13,541
That tickle that you're feeling
in the back of your throat right now...

903
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,712
- Unh.
- ...that's atomized colloidal silver.

904
01:35:17,921 --> 01:35:20,381
It's being pumped through
the air-conditioning system...

905
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,218
...you cock-juggling thundercunt!

906
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:35,396
Which means the fat lady
should be singing...

907
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:39,234
...right about now.

908
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,910
Heh. This is awkward.

909
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:52,413
Do you have a cell phone?

910
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,482
Um...

911
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,067
Little help here.

912
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,486
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

913
01:37:05,695 --> 01:37:06,988
- Where's Zoe?
- Drake's got her.

914
01:37:07,196 --> 01:37:08,406
Okay.

915
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:13,411
Thank you.

916
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,247
Brought your toys.

917
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:18,624
Try to keep up.

918
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:29,172
- Abby!
- Hey.

919
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,133
You okay?

920
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:34,302
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

921
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,553
Watch out!

922
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,159
Fuck me.

923
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:03,998
Fuck me sideways.

924
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:09,045
Oh, yeah.

925
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:11,881
He's a cute little guy, aren't you?

926
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:13,174
Good little puppies.

927
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:15,176
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

928
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:16,719
You stay.

929
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:20,640
Oh. There's a pretty smile. Yeah.

930
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,517
I'm going to, uh...

931
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:06,185
Hey, dickface, you seen my dog?

932
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:08,312
Have you tried the lobby?

933
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,857
Thank you.

934
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:18,906
Fuck...

935
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:21,659
- Come on, King.
- ...this.

936
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:40,553
Blade.

937
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,306
Ready to die?

938
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,185
I was born ready, motherfucker.

939
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:52,481
"Motherfucker."

940
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,108
I like that.

941
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:41,006
Broke my arm.

942
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:31,362
Are you ready to die, motherfucker?

943
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:03,662
Give it up.

944
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:05,330
Come on. Give it up, King.

945
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:08,042
Give it up. Give it up.

946
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:09,376
Give it up.

947
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:37,780
Hang in there, kitten.

948
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:39,323
I'll get help.

949
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:51,877
Funny, isn't it?

950
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:57,007
All this time, my people were trying
to create a new kind of vampire...

951
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:59,968
...when one already existed.

952
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:03,222
I don't need to survive.

953
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:06,558
The future of our race rests with you.

954
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:09,812
You fought with honor.

955
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,688
I respect that.

956
01:50:13,148 --> 01:50:15,109
Allow me a parting gift.

957
01:50:16,568 --> 01:50:18,070
But remember this:

958
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:22,074
Sooner or later...

959
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:25,661
...the thirst always wins.

960
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:26,383
<i>And Blade?</i>

961
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:29,428
<i>The virus didn't kill him.</i>

962
01:53:29,845 --> 01:53:32,514
<i>Because he was a hybrid,
his heart never stopped beating.</i>

963
01:53:32,681 --> 01:53:34,516
<i>It simply slowed down.</i>

964
01:53:34,683 --> 01:53:39,396
<i>And so he slept, waiting for the moment
he could walk the earth again.</i>

965
01:53:40,305 --> 01:54:40,604
