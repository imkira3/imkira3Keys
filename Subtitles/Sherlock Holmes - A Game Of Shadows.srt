1
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,930
The year was 1891.

2
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,850
Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.

3
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,730
France and Germany were at each others throats,

4
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,030
The result of a series of bombings.

5
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,280
Some said it was nationalists...
Others... The anarchists.

6
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:58,630
But as usual...
My friend..., Sherlock Holmes...

7
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,090
Had a different theory entirely.

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,850
Bombing in Strasbourg,
Read all about it.

9
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,300
Thank you.

10
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,930
Anarchists suspected in Strasbourg bombing.

11
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,850
When did you start working
for the postal service?

12
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,440
That was you back there?

13
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,020
A Shame your activities have landed you in the gutter.

14
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,480
A curious parcel, Who's the intended recipient?

15
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,940
Why don't we discuss that over
dinner tonight?

16
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,940
I'm free for lunch.

17
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,250
Hmm... I'm not.

18
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,820
How about at Savoy... Eight o'clock?

19
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,110
Splendid.

20
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,970
Hmm... And will you becoming as yourself?

21
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,660
Most likely.

22
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,610
Three men have been following you for the last half mile,
Their motives

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,100
Highly unsavoiry.

24
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,260
No.

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,430
Oh... And by the way,
They're not pursuing me,

26
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,980
They're escorting me, And instead of
three, There seems to be ...

27
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,230
Ah... Four

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,820
Steady hands with that Irene.

29
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,910
Oh... I don't think it's my hands you've to worry about.

30
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,280
Now, be careful with the face boys,
We do have a dinner date tonight.

31
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,240
Don't fill up on bread.

32
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,190
I've got the rest of it.

33
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,400
Uhh... It's coming back now.

34
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,470
Your payment, Doctor.
He sends his thanks.

35
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,140
One hundred... Thanks

36
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,900
Please give this to him,
He's expecting it.

37
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,150
Tell him our friend thinks
I delivered it to his sister.

38
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,040
Ah... Stay
While I check the contents.

39
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,000
I was assured full payment would be there.

40
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,920
Yes, But assured by whom?

41
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,630
Have you ever met him in person?

42
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,760
Hold it, Hold it, Hold it...Don't move it.

43
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,970
Judging by the size and weight
its not payment you were expecting.

44
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,100
I'd wager the contents are rather more incendiary.

45
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,350
Who is this?

46
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,440
Hello, darling.

47
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,570
Oh dear... I told you not to move it.

48
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,360
It seems a secondary charge has been activated.

49
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,030
Sweet thing, I might need your help
in the disposal of this parcel.

50
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,240
One hundred...

51
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,750
One million pounds!

52
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, And Um, By the way, Fire

53
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,760
Leave my side and you'll be dead within an hour.

54
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,310
And don't be late for dinner.
I expect that my schedule be quite tight

55
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,980
because of these activities here.

56
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm never late in my life.
-Only early.

57
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,150
Hmm, Hmm, Very witty,
So confident even in retreat.

58
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,900
I'll hold on to that.

59
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,950
We will read together during an aperitif.

60
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,200
Alright.

61
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,580
Dinner and a show.

62
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,370
Stay.. Trust me.

63
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,750
This is what I do for living.

64
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,170
Hey Hoffmanstahl, You should count yourself lucky.

65
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,470
This faceless man with whom you find yourself
in business is no ordinary criminal.

66
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,680
He's the Napoleon of crime.

67
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,680
Fortunately, You now have me as an ally.

68
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,390
I'm a consulting detective of some repute...

69
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,190
Perhaps you've heard of me.
My name is Sherlock Hol..

70
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,690
Holmes..

71
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,320
Ah... Fresh pot of tea, Thank you George.

72
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,700
Yes, Miss Adler.

73
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Fine choice, This place.

74
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,580
Do you have the letter?

75
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,460
It was taken.

76
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,250
Taken...?
Now that is unfortunate.

77
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,050
During the chaos created by your package.

78
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,890
Perhaps... If you had shared your plans.

79
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,060
You wish to know my plans now, Do you?

80
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,940
Did you imagine Miss Adler,
That something would happen to you?

81
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,030
Is that why you chose to
meet here, In a public place?

82
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,780
Your favorite restaurant.

83
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,350
I don't blame you,

84
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,820
I blame myself.

85
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,570
It's been apparent me for some time that you had
succumbed to your feelings for him.

86
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,450
And this isn't the first occasion Mr.
Holmes has inconvenienced me in recent months.

87
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,540
The question is ...

88
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,880
What to do about it?

89
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,670
But ...

90
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,260
That's my problem to solve now.

91
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
I no longer require your services.

92
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,030
Misses Hudson?

93
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,450
Oooh... Misses Hudson?

94
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,870
Holmes... You in there?

95
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,460
Your hedge needs trimming.

96
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,070
Remember... I have to catch the last.

97
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,370
Train.

98
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,450
You win.

99
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,420
I lose...
Game over.

100
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,300
Still don't see me?

101
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,720
♪ Speaking French... Quelle surprise ♪ What a surprise.

102
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,270
I'm not going out with you dressed like that.

103
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:22,440
Would you prefer I joined you in the fashion folk pathway and fine military dress...
With that Hedonist hand-made scarf?
Clearly... One of your fiancé early efforts.

104
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,650
Oh... How I've missed you, Holmes.

105
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,820
Have you?...

106
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,700
I've Barely of noticed your absence.

107
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,660
Then again I'm knee deep in research.

108
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,910
Extracting fluids from the adrenal glands of sheep.

109
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,750
And... Designing my own urban camouflage.

110
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,090
All the while... Verging on a decisive breakthrough, In the single most important case of my career...

111
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,260
Perhaps of all time.

112
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,090
Misses Hudson, How are you?

113
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,850
Ohh...I'm so pleased to see you Doctor,
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.

114
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,350
And thank you for looking after Gladstone.

115
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,900
Dear ... Dear... Simply sweet nanny.

116
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,860
Might I have a word?

117
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,150
Yummy!

118
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,450
Feed the snake woman.

119
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,530
You feed it.

120
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,240
Touchy... Touchy ...

121
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,080
Doctor, You must get him to a sanatorium.

122
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,000
He's been on a diet of coffee,
Tobacco, And cocoa leaves.

123
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,040
He never sleeps.

124
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,880
I hear multiple voices,
As if he's rehearsing a play.

125
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,720
Leave him to me.

126
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,760
Do not have a goat that needs... worming?

127
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,010
Oh how kind of you to remind me.

128
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,140
So much to look forward to.

129
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,390
What I would do without you?

130
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,230
Patient...? Doctor.

131
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,900
Why are you here?

132
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,320
I'm getting married.... Tomorrow?

133
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,740
Oh... Embrace me.

134
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,160
Watson's getting married.

135
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,910
You lost a few pounds.

136
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,080
And you picked them up.

137
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,870
Nurturing on Mary's muffins no doubt.

138
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,040
Pour us a brandy.

139
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,710
The stag party has begun.

140
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,300
It's our last... Adventure Watson.

141
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,050
I intend to make the most of it.

142
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,940
I see you've made good use of my old office.

143
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,480
Do you like my spider's web?

144
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,110
Is that what you call it?

145
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,320
Follow that strand.

146
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,990
Question?

147
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,740
What does a scandal about an indian cotton tycoon,

148
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,990
The overdose of a Chinese opium trader,

149
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,620
Bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna,

150
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,370
And the death of a steel magnate
in America... all have in common?

151
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,500
Well... According to your diorama.

152
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,300
Professor James Moriarty.

153
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,420
Indeed.

154
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,130
Mathematical genius.

155
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,550
Celebrated author and lecturer.

156
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,560
Boxing champion at Cambridge...
Where he'd made friends with
our current Prime Minister.

157
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,060
Do you have any evidence
to substantiate your claim?

158
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,650
♪ Taps ♪
-This

159
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,030
Now do you see?

160
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,900
Dr. Hoffmanstahl's Death?

161
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,780
Yes, I've heard you speak of him.

162
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,410
Extolling his virtues.

163
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,830
Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront of
medical innovations... A true pioneer.

164
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,160
Just the other day, I averted an
explosion that was intended for him.

165
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,330
It says here he died of heart attack.

166
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,000
Has all my instuction been for naught?

167
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,050
You still read the offical statment and believe it? It's a game... Dear man, A shadowy game.

168
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,930
We're playing cat and mouse,
the professor and I.

169
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,050
Cloak and dagger.

170
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,930
I thought it was spider and fly.

171
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,640
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.

172
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,810
Not a mouse, But a dagger.

173
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,690
You're Drinking embalming fluid.

174
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,570
Ohhh.... Yes.
Care for a drop?

175
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,740
- You do seem ...
- Excited?

176
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,950
- Maniac.
-Ecstatic

177
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,990
Psychotic.

178
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,030
I should've brought you a sedative.

179
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,790
I'll give my life to see his demise.

180
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,000
He must be stopped...
Before his evil machinations,
Come to a crescendo.

181
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,790
And how will you do all this?

182
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,920
No one...

183
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Not the victims, The
police, The governments... Not anyone!

184
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,640
Except the great Sherlock Holmes.

185
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,760
Correct.

186
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,390
On this diet.. Will work it all out.

187
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,350
-Right.

188
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,810
-Or thereabouts

189
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,730
Thereabouts.

190
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,900
Here's to your good health.

191
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,650
What you did to Gladstone now?!

192
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,950
The fruit is highly toxic.

193
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
He's barely breathing.

194
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,580
It was an excellent opportunity.

195
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,960
This may be just the thing.

196
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,210
I hope you don't mind terribly,
If I tried my adrenal extract.

197
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,590
How many times are you going
to kill my dog, Holmes...?

198
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,430
-He took off like a monkey from a box.
-Hmm

199
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,350
I may need one of those in a few hours.

200
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,350
Consider it a wedding gift.

201
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,390
Watson...

202
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,270
Might we use an alternative exit?

203
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,190
Is there something different about you?

204
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,730
I'm under observation.

205
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,190
As you should be.
You drive.

206
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,990
Will your beard, Be with us... All night?

207
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,580
I'll remove it once we're
south of Trafalgar Square.

208
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,420
If you believe Moriarty has you under observation,

209
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,340
Isn't this a bit conspicuous?

210
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,130
It's so overt, It's covert.

211
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,970
Trafalgar Square...

212
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,470
Why are you looking at me with such concern?

213
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,020
I'm so very worried...

214
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,530
Marriage... It's the end I tell you.

215
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,240
- I think of it as the beginning.
- Armageddon.

216
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,780
- Rebirth.
- Restriction.

217
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,740
Structure.

218
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,200
Answering to a woman?

219
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,790
Being in a relationship.

220
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,580
A life in matrimony,
The Possibility of a family ...

221
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,750
Who wants to die alone?

222
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,840
You'll settle down have a family and I'll...

223
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,590
Die alone.

224
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,550
Yes that's about it.

225
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,600
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone
than to... live life in eternal purgatory.

226
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,900
Anyway...

227
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Not bad... That.

228
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,780
So.... Where are we going?

229
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,370
In the future, There will be one of those machines
in every town in Europe.

230
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,540
Loitering in the woodshed again are we my king.

231
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,090
Good evening, Sherly,
I see your boot maker is ill dear brother.

232
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,630
As I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap with which you shave.

233
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,510
May I point out the chimney
in the front room of Baker Street,
Is to the need of a damn good sweeping out.

234
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,350
Are you aware that the hackney carriage,
By which you arrived had a damaged wheel.

235
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,560
Yes, The left.

236
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,060
And it's plain to the meanest intelligence that you've
recently acquired a new bow for your violin.

237
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,730
Same bow... New Strings.

238
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,530
And may I deduce.. Mycroft,
Good evening by the way.

239
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,490
No!

240
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,610
He doesn't.

241
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,700
May I deduce that you rarely strays from the path..
.

242
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,910
That runs from your home to the Diogenes Club,

243
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,040
And never on a Monday...
When they serve your favorite potted shrimps,

244
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,630
Must be here for some far more important
reason than my ... Stag party.

245
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,180
You know he's nothing like as slow witted
as been leading me to believe Shirley

246
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,140
You're quite right Dr. Watson.

247
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,430
But with all the conflict in Europe
at the monent,

248
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,720
The whole situation could...
Excuse me, Suddenly erupt...

249
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,980
I'm here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

250
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,070
If the concerns of two nations...

251
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,070
Which will remain nameless,

252
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,620
But I can tell you they
speak French and German.

253
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,700
Are not dealt with tonight I shall be forced to go to switzerland

254
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,080
Only thing nice about Switzerland is the altitude.

255
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,510
I'm so glad you invited your brother.

256
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,150
This looks promising...

257
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,820
And your poison of choice gentlemen?

258
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,780
We'll start with the champagne,

259
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
We may need several more chairs.

260
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,700
Perhaps a good cigar.

261
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,160
And Um... Don't bother with the chairs

262
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,790
What is it your brother does exactly?

263
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,250
He's... The keeper of the Broome covet of state,

264
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,710
No ambition... No energy... At yet repeatedly told,

265
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,590
That he's indispensable to the British government. Particularly the foreign office.
I would like to propose a toast.

266
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,970
To my dear friend, Doctor.

267
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:11,970
John ...

268
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,970
Hamish ...

269
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,520
Watson.

270
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,100
I'm right here.

271
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,150
On the eve of his wedding, He ...

272
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,980
Has been the best of companions

273
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,320
Shouldn't we be waiting...?

274
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,200
For the boys from my rugby club.

275
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,870
He's always kept us...

276
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,290
They couldn't attend... Flat footed on the ground. All of them ?

277
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,790
Hmmm...what about the chaps from my medical school?

278
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,250
I attempted... They declined

279
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,370
There's no man better ...

280
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,580
Who is it your looking for?

281
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,290
Worth having at your side ...

282
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,420
I don't know a single damn person here, Do I?

283
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,010
There's no need for hysterics..You know me,
And you know Mycroft, Don't be a ponce, Watson

284
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,930
You completely forgot about
my stag party didn't you?

285
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,890
-Why are we here?
-Your in very good health Doctor

286
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,350
Shame none of your friends
could make it

287
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,070
I'm going to the gaming tables

288
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,870
I refuse for this night to be a total loss,
Give me my money

289
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,080
Happily..., Give me the wedding ring

290
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,370
Oh...Now you are interested in being the best man.

291
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,500
You're suppose to keep the ring anyway.

292
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,460
Just as your suppose to organize my stag party

293
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,380
You don't want to lose it on a bet.... John.

294
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,340
And invite my friends, Which by the way
there are many

295
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,520
He all me, Me, Me isn't he ?

296
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:56,200
www.renaldomovies.blogspot.com
latest movies at smallest size and highest quality

297
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,500
Please sit

298
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,540
Put your money on the table, and we will begin.

299
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,720
Welcome, I'm madame Simza.

300
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,440
Cards can illuminate your past...

301
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,650
Clarify your present, And
show you the future.

302
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,400
If you have a specific question
hold it in your mind.

303
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,330
Holding.

304
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,090
Let me know when your ready.

305
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,420
Actually, I prefer to read ...

306
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,550
Your fortune.

307
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:56,840
Temperance...

308
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,560
Inverted, Indicitive of volatility.

309
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,270
A woman who recently taken a confident drink,

310
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,270
From what does she seek solace?,
What does she wish not to see?

311
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,650
Hmm, A fool imbarassing himself?

312
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,150
Oh, Yes the fool

313
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,530
Someone had been led astray, Involved
in something without their knowledge.

314
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,910
Not bad. But um... You have to make me believe you,

315
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,670
I have to see it in your eyes.

316
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,830
I can do better....

317
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,800
The two of cups, A powerful bond..

318
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,010
But between whom?

319
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,550
A brother and a sister perhaps?

320
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,010
And I see a name ... Yes.. it's,

321
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,470
Rene.

322
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,270
What do you want?

323
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,270
The devil.

324
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,530
Why are we playing this game?

325
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,240
Where did you get this?

326
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,910
I stole it from a woman in an auction room.

327
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,000
But I believe It was intended for you.

328
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,310
Found my purpose in life,

329
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,400
So... that question I've been holding is
what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

330
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,360
Time is up

331
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,280
I have other clients.

332
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,250
Though you may not have detected the wisp of
Astrakhan fur snagged on a nail from my left shoulder...

333
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,420
You couldn't have failed to notice
the overpowering aroma of herring pickled in vodka.

334
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:56,050
In tandem with a turely unfortunate body odor.

335
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,800
there's a man conceled in the rafters above us.

336
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,430
A CORSAC, Renouned for their infesible
acrobatic abilities, And are notorious for their hunting... Us assassins

337
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,730
So it's safe to presume your
next client is here to kill you.

338
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,610
Anything else?

339
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,770
No..?

340
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,410
First...

341
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,530
Pillage the nest.

342
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,790
Clip wings.

343
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,210
Now ...

344
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,880
Blunt his beak.

345
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,050
Crack eggs.

346
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,510
Scramble

347
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,680
Pinch of salt.

348
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,100
Touch of pepper.

349
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,060
Flip the omelette.

350
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,570
Additional seasoning required

351
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,450
Breakfast is served.

352
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,010
Come with me.

353
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,840
I need you alive.... Now!

Now... Wait a minute...

359
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,510
Your right... It is sick

360
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,470
Where were you?

361
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,770
I am so glad to see your taking
your best man duties so seriously Sherlock.

362

She biting my leg...

363
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,660
I'll have Carruthers put some
fuel into that motor carriage of yours

364
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,290
You do have a wedding to attend

365
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,580
Oh... I'll drive

366
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,920
Another drink?

367
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,670
I think you've had quite enough.

368
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,070
I've been to a wedding here before,

369
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,990
A funeral too.

370
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,670
The Professor wants to meet.

371
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,290
I'd expected to hear from him sooner.

372
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,840
In light of recent events ...

373
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,010
He was wondering if it would be convient for
you to come by the college, This afternoon.

374
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,300
His lecture concludes at four.

375
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,140
Looking forward.

376
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,020

This fish you can not cheat.

380
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,930
I hope I'm not intruding

381
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,900
Ahh.. Excuse me, Please take these up to Mr. Williams and make sure

382
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,570
he packs my white tie and tails.
-I'll take care of it professor.
-Thank you

383
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,990
I do apologize, I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.

384
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Would you care for some tea or coffee?

385
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,530
Neither.

386
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,950
Something stronger perhaps?

387
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,870
No... but might I trouble you for an inscription?

388
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,060
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today.

389
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,730
How was the service?

390
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,190
Definitive.

391
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,610
He'll no longer be party to my investigations,

392
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,070
He's out of the equation, I....

393
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,860
Trust you'll take this into consideration?

394
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,660
And what considerations will you grant me?

395
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,040
Have you actually read the book?

396
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,170
I found it compelling.

397
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,010
Thought I'm primarily intrested
in your more recent endevors...

398
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,680
I take that as a compliment.

399
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,390
I have the utmost regard
for your talents.

400
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,520
It's a pleasure...
To finally meet you.

401
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,190
Officially.

402
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,820
Are you familiar with
the study of graphology?

403
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,490
I've never given it any serious thought no.

404

Psychological Analysis of Handwriting.

405
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,460
The upward strokes on the
P, the J and M indicate,

406
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,670
A Genius level intellect.

407
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:02,710
While the flourishes on the lower zone,
Denote a highly creative yet...

408
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,010
Meticulous nature.

409
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:08,300
But... If one observes the overall slant
and the pressure of the writing...

410
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,010
There's a suggestion of acute narcissism,

411
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,760
A complete lack of empathy,

412
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,470
And a pronounced inclination toward ...

413
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,350
No!

414
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,850
Moral insanity.

415
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,020
An answer to your previous request, Regarding,

416
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,280
Doctor Watson, Not being involved the answer is...

417
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,240
No.

418
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:30,370
The laws of celestrial mechanics dictate
that when two objects collide,

419
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,620
there is always damage ...

420
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,330
Of a collateral nature.

421
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,210
Two gentlemen, Find themselfs at
cross purposes...

422
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,970
A young woman ...

423
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,050
Torn between them.

424
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,970
The strain proves to much for her

425
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,270
And she suddenly falls ill.

426
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,850
With... Tragic consequences.

427
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,320
A rare form of tuberculosis.

428
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,700
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.

429
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,910
Now ...

430
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,120
Are you sure you want to play this game?

431
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm afraid you'd lose.

432
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Rest assured...

433
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,220
If you attempt to bring destruction down upon me... I shall do the same to you.

434
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,430
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes,
Is the only reason

435
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,100
your still alive.

436
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,940
You've paid me several compliments.

437
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,570
Let me pay you one in return,

438
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,740
When I said if I were assured of the
former eventuality,

439
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,370
I will cheerfully accept the latter.

440
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,540
I'll be sure to send my regards to the happy couple.

441
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,340
Another time then...

442
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,990
Which coach are we?

443
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,030
We should be just....

444
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,360
Here.

445
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,700
Ohh..., First Class.

446
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,420

448
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,470
Ohh... First class Champagne

449
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,140
You know how to spoil a girl Mr. Watson.

450
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,060
Your not just any girl.

451
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,980
I'm Sorry madam but you can't use the lavatory
while the train is in station.

452
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,230
Your... Mrs. Watson.

453
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,530
Give me that bottle.

454
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,040
John there is no where else in the
world I'd rather be.

455
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,800
There's no one I'd rather be with.

456
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,470
Why do you have a gun stuffed down
the back of your trousers?

457
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,800
Heh, Old habits.

458
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,520
Ahem... Come in

459
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,520
-Oh yes please
-We didn't order that

460
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,150
With our Compliments sir.

461
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,780
Thank you, Put it there.

462
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,380
Open the door John.

463
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,510
I think it's time for you to leave.

464
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:21,890

468
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,630
They'll be back.

469
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,210
Ohh...John, Shut the door.

470
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,510
They'll only shoot through it my lovey.

471
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,300
He's right.

472
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,300
Huh... I understand.

Do you?

474
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,640
Terribly inconvenient.

475
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,480
We don't have much time!

476
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,190
How many are we expecting?

477
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,400
Half a dozen.

478
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,740

- A wedding present from Moriarty.

479

Lovely ceremony by the way,
Many a tears shed in joy.

480
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:23,070
Oh.. John!

481
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,700
Just a minute darling.

482
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,000
Do you trust me?

No.

484

Well, then I should have to...

485
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,000
Do something about that.

00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,150
She's safe now!

491
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,450
In my own defense... I timed it perfectly.

492
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,660
You killed my wife!

493
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,670
How do you know that when
you just threw her off a train?

494
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,000
I told you I'd timed it perfectly.

495
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,380
What does that mean?

496
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,180
Calm down!

497
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,720
Explain!

498
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,560
By the time I'd explain we'd both be dead!

499
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,240
I'm sorry madam but you can't use the lavatory
while the train is in station.

500
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,130
That was no accident.

501
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,920
It was by design.

502
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:44,670
Now ...

503
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,510
Do you need me to elaborate?

504
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,180
Or can we just crack on.

505
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,940
Come on!

506
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,360
Do not worry old boy, She's as safe as
houses, she's with my brother.

507
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,780
I'm on my honeymoon!

508
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,120
Why did you lead them here?

509
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,870
Why did you involve us?

510
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,790
There not here for me, There here for you!

511
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,050
Fortunately ...

512
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,810
So am I.

513
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,980
Now mind the door!

514
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,190
Good evening.

515
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,020
I think you'll find second class
is more comforable,

516

517
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:47,400
To the south!, Quick march!

518
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,580
Lie down with me Watson.

519
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,250
Why?

520
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,000

521

00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,180

Make it count!

529
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,310
I said make it count!

530
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,230
How many windows have I provide?

531
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,080

in Brighton was such a dangerous notion?

I've never been to Brighton.

535
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,380
Or ...

536
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,470

remember at present.

537

539
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,720
I can't do both.

540
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,140
I promise.

541
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,060
As I said, I timed it perfectly.

542
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,360
Over here... Madam.

543
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,910
I believe congratulations
are in order Mrs. Watson.

544

I'm the other Holmes.

545

Oh how marvelous, Could this evening get any better?

547

Why were Mary and I targeted at all?

548
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,800
Excellent question.

549
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:12,720
The answer is two fold.

550
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,050
He's after us...

551
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:14,970
Because of you.

552
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,510
I afraid you must bear half the responsibility.

553
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:18,760
Here ... it comes

554
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,100
Had you and Mary had not been
so hellbent on your wedding,

555
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,180
We could've already solved this case.

556
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
There it is... It's my fault now

557
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,350
All I'm saying is that the
argument could mean...

558
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,110
No, It couldn't

559
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,820
That your nuptials were rather poorly timed.

560
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,900
Thus ...

561
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,030
Our relationship ...

562
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,360
Relationship?

563
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,370
Very well.. partnership

My dear fellow if you could be bothered
to see this through to the end,

566
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,670
I shall never again ask you to assist me.

567

That's the spirit!

569
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,220
Now... To the question,

570
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,760
This is so deliciously complicated,

571
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,980
You may be asking yourself?

572
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,770
What does a crimial mastermind want
with a simple gypsy fortune teller?

573
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,400
It's about her brother I tell you.

Outside the city at Montroy,

583

There's a Gypsy camp famous for it's dried fruit,

Especially peaches.

However ...

801
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,870
The bomb was meant to conceal
the murder of just one man,

802
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,880
The man killed by the gunshot was
none other than Alfred Meinhardt.

Moriarty.

808
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,970
The clues point in one direction,

809
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,640
To avoid repeating last night's debacle,
I was obliged to collect more suffient data,

810
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:43,360
Hence my tardyness.

But ...

814
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,480
Do we have enough time for me to indulge my little habit?

815
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:24,310
Yes.

So... There are seven mainline railway stations in Paris.

But.... Taking ten minutes to get to

01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,840
Where he will be just in time to
catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.

823
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,430
It makes several stops along the way,
One of which is....

824
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:54,470
Heilbron.

825
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:56,930
Exactly ...

826
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:58,600
Where we must go.

827
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,600
Where Meinhardt's factory is.

828
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,140
It's Moriarty's factory now.

829
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,610
Unfortunately, Due to the
bombing, The crossing between,

830
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,860
France and Germany is to be closed.

831
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:12,030
I afraid our persuit is over...
Unless I can happen upon a comrade

832
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:15,530
How knows their way around borders...

833
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,290
Too English.

834
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:24,290
However you do make a fantastic Gypsy.

835
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:26,210
Certainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.

836
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,960
Now.. Now.. No need to be demeaning.

837
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,630
It is a nice scarf.

838
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,720
No no.. too English.

839
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,760
It'll suit you more

840
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,010
The black is yours... The gray one is mine,

841
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:39,810
And this is for you.

842
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,390
Ah hmm right, Where are the wagons?

843
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:47,150
The wagon's to slow,
Can't you ride?

844
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,860
It's not the he can't ride,
How is it you put it, Hon?

845
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:57,120
They're dangerous at both ends
and crafty in the middle.

846
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,580
Why would I want anything with a mind of its own
bobbing about between my legs?

847
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,750
Then I should require a bicycle, Thank you very much.

848
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,670
It's 1891.... I could've chartered a balloon.

849
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,380
How can we make this more manageable?

850
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,990
It's not as if Germany going somewhere...

851
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,750
We know another way.

852
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,590
Slow and steady wins the race.

853
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:17,820
Go on!

854
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:35,420
We slip in through the loading bay,

855
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:38,380
Find out what he's doing, And we get out.

856
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:41,470
Getting out might be tricky.

857
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,430
We will get you out.

858
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,680
If my brother is in there, Get him out alive.

859
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,320
Ahh ...You happy?

860
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:05,790
What?

861
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,710
At this moment.... Are you as happy as you
would be on your honeymoon in Brighton?

862
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:13,880
I'm not going to grace that question with an answer.

863
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,170
Are you happy?

864
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,260
- Are We here for another reason?, I think we are
- Okay.

865
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,340
Should we get on.

866
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:22,260
It was a simple question.

867
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,640
Are we gonna do something or wait here
for them to come back around.

868
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,220
What time is it?

869
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,890
Three fifteen.

870
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,270
Over in the rest of the part of the
complex should be a telegraph office,

871
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:34,730
Send this to Mycroft,
Be back here on the hour.

872
01:16:49,370 --> 01:17:05,010

latest movies at smallest size and highest quality

873
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:29,450
Thats what you get Mr. Holmes, When the
industry marries arms,

874
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,490
Now put your gun down.

875
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:34,830
It's a bit ol fashioned.

876
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:42,040
What you need is one of these...

877
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:45,050
Go on,

878
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:49,010
Pick one.

879
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,720
Machine pistol, Self repeating.

880
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:59,140
It takes 7.63 caliber rounds.

881
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:01,810
In one of these.

882
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,820
A ten shot box... Magazine.

883
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:10,780
Easy enough to load.

884
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:15,910
How should one have to retract the
bolt to ingage the first round.

885
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,910
Easier done than said.

886
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,340
Take him to the surgery,

887
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,890
I'll find the doctor.

888
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:46,110
Come at once if convenient,

889
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:51,360
If inconvenient come all the same.

890
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,170
This is schnapps.

891
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,380
A telegram was sent from here.

892
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:14,140
This isn't schnapps, It's aqua vida,
Distilled from potato mash...

893
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:17,430
A common misconception, Thank you by the way.

894
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:19,680
Who was it sent to?

895
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,060
Horror at your crimes is matched only by my

896
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:26,730
Admiration at the skill it took to achive them.

897
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,520
Who was it sent to?

898
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:33,570
you used the anarchists and their bombs
to create a crisis in Europe.

899
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:34,740
Nation against nation.

900
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:39,330
Under various pseudo names you bought, Schemed,
Or murdered your way into numerous industries,

901
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:43,830
Assuring none of it could be traced to you.

902
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:45,370
Cotton, Opium, Steel.

903
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:48,420
Now arms, Chemical weaponary all to be
shipped across Europe

904
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,090
in less than a week.

905
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,090
Everything from bullets to bandages.

906
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,340
And now that you own the supply...

907
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:57,680
You intend to create the demand.

908
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,220
A World War!

909
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,650
You are familiar with Schubert's work?

910
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:15,950
A Trout is uh... Perhaps my favorite.

911
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,410
A fisherman grows weary of
trying to catch an elusive fish.

912
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,080
Out the way... Out the way...

913
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:28,630
So he muddies the water.

914
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:30,630
I'm Warnin ya....

915
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,920
Confusses the fish...

916
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:39,550
You were warned.

917
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:43,100
He doesn't realize until too late
that he's swum into a trap...

918
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,580
Let's try this again... shall we?

919
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:34,290
To whom... Did you sent the telegram?

920
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,310
To my brother, Mycroft.

921
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:57,400
What are you planning...?

922
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:02,450
Thats not fair.

923
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:07,080
I just got one more question for you,

924
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:17,960
Which one of us is the fisherman,
And which the trout?

925
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:49,330
Holmes?

926
01:25:52,330 --> 01:25:53,960
Holmes?

927

Always good to see you Watson.

929
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:29,120
-What were you thinking?,
-Wait... Wait.

930
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,410
If you must know, I was thinking I had him,
Right were I wanted him.

931
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:42,590
Right... Crack on then

You were marrying Gladstone,

967
01:34:53,790 --> 01:34:55,460
He had a massive fork in his hoof
and he turned on me!

Your wedding present.

969
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:04,210
And Who's been dancing on my chest!?

970
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:08,090
Why is my ankle so itchy?

971
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,390
Because you have a large piece

You Tamas...I've an important job to

Probably.

01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:07,240
We're going home.

986
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:15,410
Via Switzerland.

987
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,920
What better place to start a
war... Than a peace summit...

988
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,210
We'll drop in and see my brother,

989
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,190
I still do not understand why you
simply don't cancel the summit

990
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:49,610
The fact is it's gonna happen
whether we like it or not.

991
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:51,700
Everyone has already arrived.

992
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:56,740
While ladies and gentlemen may be talking peace,
Believe me they're readying their armies at home

993
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:59,620
To cancel the summit now...
Would mean tentamental war.

994
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:01,370
The telegram wasn't it clear?

995
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:03,420
We have doubled the security, sir.

996
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:05,790
Oh... Doubled security?, Thats confident

997
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:08,130
You can't understand the
delicacy the situation.

998
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,840
I passes the telegram on to my superiors,
but they were the ones

999
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:13,930
who have brought Moriarty

1000
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:17,010
He has positioned himself brilliantly

1001
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:19,100
As one of our formost intellectuals,
he's a personal friend

1002
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,020
Personal friend of the Prime Minister, Yes..
We all know that

1003
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:23,480
I believe you.....

1004
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:25,310
But where's your evidence?

1005
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:28,730
He's too good to leave evidence....

1006
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:30,400
He doesn't leave loose ends.

1007
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:32,780
Ohh he's alive!

1008
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:34,610
Sherly, Put that down!

1009
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:36,910
What is this contraption?

1010
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:38,910
May I have it?

1011
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:41,580
The effect is most invigorating.

1012
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,000
It is my private and
personal supply of oxygen,

1013
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:44,330
And your not to touch it.

1014
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:46,540
This argument is getting us nowhere.

1015
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,630
I've arranged doctuments to be prepared
which will allow you into the ball.

1016
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:51,760
-Carruthers.
-Stanley?

1017
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:53,130
Stanley?

1018
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,760
You haven't aged a day.

1019
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,220
Is that my favorite Chutney?

1020
01:37:58,510 --> 01:37:59,720
The fact is...

1021
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,600
We don't really know what he's planning,

1022
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:03,890
It won't be another bomb.

1023
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:05,520
No... It wouldn't be another bomb.

1024
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:06,940
That doesn't make sense.

1025
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:09,110
Why would attack all the nations,
Only to unite them?

1026
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,030
It shall be an assassination.

1027
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:13,700
By a lone gunman.

1028
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:15,160
At close range.

1029
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,030
Rene.

1030
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,120
Unfortunately yes..

1031
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:21,660
You knew ?

1032
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,120
I had my suspicions.

1033
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:25,620
But having seen who'd be
attending, I'm now certain.

1034
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:29,130
Well... At least we know
who to look out for.

1035
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,250
Rene will be the evidence.

1036
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:34,470
If we find him and stop him, we will
perhaps not only save his life,

1037
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:37,180
But prevent the collapse of
western civilization.

1038
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:39,890
No pressure ...

1039
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:13,800
Welcome Ambassador.

1040
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,220
Professor James Moriarty.

1041
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:37,650
Now we're all present,
I can tell you the targets,

1042
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:39,320
Are the German Chancellor and his ambassador,

1043
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:42,370
The french Prime Minister and his man,

1044
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:44,950
And the other nations are really
working out which side to take,

1045
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,500
Should hostilities erupt.

1046
01:39:47,870 --> 01:39:50,130
Cause uh Prince Michael is a cousin
of the Tsar and the Russian ambassador,

1047
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:52,840
Archduke Karl Ludwig, and the
austro-Hungarian ambassador,

1048
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:56,380
Romanian Prime Minister
and his ambassador.

1049
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:00,300
And of course, Our Prime Minister
and the British ambassador.

1050
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,390
He'll chose a moment when all the dignitaries
are assembled... Preferably standing still,

1051
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,600
Is there to be an offical photograph?

1052
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:10,230
Indeed, Yes in uh 38 minutes.

1053
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:12,810
Then in which case...
We might as well dance.

1054
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,530
I've never done this before.

1055
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:24,160
Just.. follow.. my... lead...

1056
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:40,050
What do you see?

1057
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:41,130
Everything.

1058
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:54,020
That is my curse.

1059
01:40:55,770 --> 01:40:57,190
But you don't see what you are looking for.

1060
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,380
I thought you'd never ask.

1061
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:25,350
Over my shoulder, Young man,
German uniform, ceremonial sword.

1062
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:28,060
Got it

1063
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:30,560
Professional opinion?

1064
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:35,690
Trauma...
Major injury...

1065
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:38,900
Excellent repair work.

1066
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,070
Dr. Hoffmanstahl.

1067
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:46,370
You did say he was at the forefront
of medical inovation

1068
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:48,410
Before you'd seen an example of his skills

1069
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:52,080
Those twins weren't twins.

1070
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:55,250
My suspicions where arroused in Heilbron,

1071
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,920
When one failed to go to the aid of the other.

1072
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,920
I also noticed a descrete but
unmistakable puckering behind the ear

1073
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:04,760
Where his skin was had been drawn back.

1074
01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:08,010
I should've realized then, That
they were a surgical experiment.

1075
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:12,680
To see if it's possible to
make one man look like another?

1076
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:15,060
His face is no longer his own.

1077
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:19,480
What better way to guarantee his
world war than to make the assassin...

1078
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:23,450
One of the ambassadors.

1079
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,070
That narrows down the
possibility to one of six.

1080
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:32,120
You and Sim shall find her brother....

1081
01:42:33,410 --> 01:42:34,410
Of this I have no doubt.

1082
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:35,210
Holmes.

1083
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:36,540
You know my methods.

1084
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:40,340
And I know where you'll be.

1085
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,800
No possible solution could be more
congenial to me than this

1086
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:47,930
By the way, Who taught you how to dance?

1087
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:50,810
You did, Heh...

1088
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,680
Well, I've done a fine job.

1089
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:56,640
Be careful.

1090
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:36,180
Shall we go to work?

1091
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:41,770
Ladies and Gentlemen, Please
gather for the portrait.

1092
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:54,450
I'm sorry...
Is this a bad time?

1093
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:57,830
Never better.

1094
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:00,750
Would you bring that clock?

1095
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,260
We get to play that game after all.

1096
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:24,820
Here we are...

1097
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:32,990
Don't want you to catch cold.

1098
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:39,910
A five minute game?

1099
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,670
If you think you can manage it.

1100
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:08,940
We both have two bishops, I may be
absent from the room... But my methods are not.

1101
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:11,490
You can't mean Dr. Watson... Surely?

1102
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:15,120
So it doesn't seem fair.

1103
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,750
Right ...

1104
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,460
The surgury would've left scars.

1105
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,590
Only four of them have
the hair line to hide them.

1106
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:34,680
The Ambassador that you've replaced
With Rene, Is he still alive?

1107
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:40,600
Would you like me to recommend your next move?

1108
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,690
They're all my brother's height,

1109
01:45:43,190 --> 01:45:44,350
Right build, But...

1110
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:46,150
Their eyes,

1111
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:48,320
Their eyes are wrong.

1112
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:50,190
Rene has blue eyes.

1113
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:54,860
He could be wearing glass lenses
To change the color...

1114
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:58,410
In which case, His eyes will be hurting.

1115
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:02,500
Rene is left handed.

1116
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,380
Perhaps the assassin would take measures
to ensure

1117
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:08,250
he doesn't give himself away,

1118
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:10,380
Like a gambler... Concealing a tell.

1119
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:17,760
I think... it might be him.

1120
01:46:19,470 --> 01:46:20,390
You think?

1121
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:22,140
You clock is ticking.

1122
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,350
You have to be sure.

1123
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:25,810
May I remind you this is blitz chess,

1124
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,650
A single miscalculation will cost you the game.

1125
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:34,780
If tackle the wrong man to the ground,
I could start a war.

1126
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,700
Maybe it's less obvious... A nervous tic.

1127
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:40,790
A flutter of anxiety.

1128
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:43,620
I'd expect everyone has a reason to be nervous tonight.

1129
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,500
I don't know.

1130
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,010
So perhaps it's the opposite...

1131
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,600
A failure to behave naturally.

1132
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:06,390
An actor so consumed with his performance that..

1133
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:09,360
The one characteristic he can not accommodate,

1134
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:11,150
Is spontaneous reaction.

1135
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,520
♪ Speaking french ♪ Brother.

1136
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:48,560
♪ Speaking french ♪ I beg you.

1137
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:58,860
♪ Speaking french ♪ Sorry, sister.

1138
01:48:13,210 --> 01:48:14,550
Germany will pay... Mark my word.

1139
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:18,550
That doesn't boat well does it?

1140
01:48:20,930 --> 01:48:22,720
Seems your bishop was of some benefit.. After all

1141
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:26,930
The game is still young.

1142
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:29,310
Actually it's in it adolescence.

1143
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:50,120
No loose ends.

1144
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:57,800
What happened....I'm a doctor, A Doctor!

1145
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:21,570
♪ Speaking french ♪ Brother!

1146
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:25,620
It's poison.

1147
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:26,950
Do something!

1148
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,210
Do something!

1149
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:55,230
I... Think you've just lost
your most valuable piece.

1150
01:49:56,730 --> 01:49:59,030
A winning strategy sometimes
necessitates sacrifice.

1151
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:16,790
You see ...

1152
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:22,840
Hidden within the unconscious.....
Is an insatiable desire for conflict.

1153
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:28,300
So your not... Fighting me,

1154
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:31,220
So much as you are the human condition.

1155
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:36,230
All I want to do is to is...
Own the bullets and bandages.

1156
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:43,570
War... on an industrial scale is inevitable.

1157
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:46,740
They'll do it themselfs within few years.

1158
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:50,490
All I have to do...

1159
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:51,580
Is wait.

1160
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:57,420
I like Switzerland.

1161
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:00,920
They respect a man's privacy here.

1162
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:03,970
Particularly if he has a fortune.

1163
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:15,100
Bishop takes knight to check.

1164
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:16,890
The game is over,

1165
01:51:18,350 --> 01:51:20,440
You should get that shoulder looked at.

1166
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:22,530
About that fortune of yours...

1167
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,740
I believe it's ...Just been substantially reduced

1168
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:29,820
King to rook two.

1169
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:31,870
I attended several of your lectures.

1170
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:34,830
The equations of motion, Which you
will find in my book ...

1171
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,750
The energy that is required to
release these explosions ...

1172
01:51:38,580 --> 01:51:41,250
It was in Oslo, when I first caught a
glimpse of your little notebook....

1173
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:42,880
Red leather bound, From
Smythson on avon street

1174
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:48,260
Rook to kings rook 3.. Check!

1175
01:51:57,390 --> 01:51:58,690
Bishop to rook 3.

1176
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:02,650
It's importance was not fully
aparent to me.. untill I observed your

1177
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:04,190
for feeding pigeons.

1178
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:06,070
Then it occurred....

1179
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:10,160
With an empire so enormous...
Even You ...

1180
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:11,950
Must keep a record of it somewhere.

1181
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:13,240
Bishop takes bishop.

1182
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:15,410
Rook to bishop 4.

1183
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:18,080
I then only required the notebook itself.

1184
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,120
You didn't make it easy...

1185
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:24,460
I'd need to endure a
considerable amount of pain.

1186
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:29,680
Mycroft ...

1187
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,390
Kill her Majesty's Secret Service.

1188
01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:38,730
But notebook would undoubtedly be encoded,
So how then to break the code?

1189
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:41,190
Rook takes rook.

1190
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:42,440
Pawn takes rook.

1191
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:43,980
Bishop to Bishop 7.

1192
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,320
Queen takes knight pawn.

1193
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:49,900
Does the art of domestic horticulture,
Mean anything to you?

1194
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:55,830
How could a man as meticulous
as you... Own such a book,

1195
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:58,200
And yet completely neglect the
Flowers in his own window box?

1196
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,920
Irony bounds.

1197
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,140
Nevermind... It's safe.

1198
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:08,770
In London.

1199
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:12,200
Where my colleagues are making good use of it.

1200
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,300
The most formidable criminal mind in
Europe, has just had all his money stolen,

1201
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:22,150
By perhaps the most inept... inspector
in the history of Scotland Yard.

1202
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:24,330
Any chance of a cup of tea.

1203
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:31,140
How much more is there?

1204
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:33,270
Thats the end of the page 2,

1205
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:35,480
Page three.

1206
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:43,370
♪Be careful what you fish for♪

1207
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:49,650
You'll be making an anonymous donation
to the widows and orphans of war fund.

1208
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:53,650
Bishop to bishop 8.

1209
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:55,210
Discover check..

1210
01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:58,690
And incidentally.... Mate!

1211
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:03,650
I've seemed to've injured my shoulder, Would you mind?

1212
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,010
Will be my pleasure.

1213
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:17,150
Once we concluded... Our business here,

1214
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:22,470
It important you know.. I shall endevor to find the most creative of endings

1215
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:29,950
for the doctor,
And his wife.

1216
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:38,920
His advantage my injury,

1217
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:41,200
My advantage, His rage...

1218
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,940
Incoming assault, Feral...
But experienced.

1219
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,650
Use his Momentum, To counter.

1220
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:00,450
Come now... You really think your..
The only one who can play this game?

1221
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:05,080
Trap arm... Target weakness...

1222
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:07,980
Follow with haymaker.

1223
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:09,990
Ahh..There we find the boxing
champion of Cambridge.

1224
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:13,040
Competent... But predictable.

1225
01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:18,050
Now... Allow me to reply.

1226
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:23,030
Also running dry, Adjust strategy

1227
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:29,080
Wound taking it's toll.

1228
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:33,300
As I feared...Injury
makes denfense untenable.

1229
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:40,180
Prognosis ...

1230
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,580
Increasingly negative.

1231
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:50,270
Let's not waste anymore
Of one anothers time.

1232
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:57,750
We both know how this ends.

1233
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,090
Conclusion.... Inevitable.

1234
01:56:17,290 --> 01:56:18,180
Unless ...

1235
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:31,020
A few words may suffice,
To tell the little that remains.

1236
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:43,610
Any attempt at finding the
Bodies was absolutely hopeless.

1237
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:53,840
I'm still there... Deep down in that dreadful
culdron of swirling water and seathing foam.

1238
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:04,110
Alive, For all time...

1239
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:08,880
The most dangerous criminal...

1240
01:58:11,230 --> 01:58:14,150
And the foremost champion of the law...

1241
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:15,230
Of their generation.

1242
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:23,190
I shall ever regard him as the best!

1243
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:33,380
And the wisest man whom I've ever known.

1244
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,020
John,

1245
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,770
You should probably pack.

1246
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:43,740
It's half past two, And the carriage
is coming at four.

1247
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:48,510
It's gonna be a beautiful week in Brighton.

1248
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:50,330
Yes, It'll be fun.

1249
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:52,470
I'm looking forward to it.

1250
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,400
You know, I miss him too,

1251
01:58:57,740 --> 01:58:59,060
In my own way.

1252
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:08,050
He would've wanted us to go.

1253
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,550
He would've wanted to come with us.

1254
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,480
Whens Mrs. Hudson coming for Gladstone?

1255
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:19,920
Oh... Soon.

1256
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:22,530
Three o'clock.

1257
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:49,910
Mary?!

1258
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:53,270
Who delivered this parcel?

1259
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:55,160
The Postman.

1260
01:59:57,730 --> 01:59:59,310
The usual chap?, Or....

1261
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:02,640
Did he look.... Peculiar?
