1
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,666
Really? Is she hot?

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,085
How old are you now,
Scott? Like, 28?

3
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,003
I'm not playing your little games, kids.

4
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,464
So, you've been out of high
school for, like, 13 years.

5
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,217
I'm 22. Twenty-two.

6
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,680
And you're dating a high-school girl.
Not bad, not bad.

7
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,724
Thank you,
thank you.

8
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,186
So, did you guys, like,
you know, do it yet?

9
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,605
We have done many things.

10
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,149
We ride the bus together.

11
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:10,570
And we have meaningful conversations
about how yearbook club went

12
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,781
and about her friends
and, you know, drama.

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,575
Have you even kissed her?

14
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,035
We almost held hands once,
but then she got embarrassed.

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,454
Well, aren't you pleased as punch.

16
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,705
I don't know what you're talking about.

17
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,831
So, what's her name?

18
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,542
Knives Chau.

19
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,502
She's Chinese.

20
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,338
Wicked.

21
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,590
So, when do we get to meet her?

22
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,258
Oh, please,
let it be soon.

23
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,177
That's for me.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,806
Hi.
You promise to be good?

25
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,099
Of course I'll be good.

26
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,434
Seriously, please be good.

27
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,102
Am I normally not?

28
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,814
Hey, Knives, this is Stephen Stills.
He's the talent.

29
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,192
Hey.

30
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:50,985
Is she gonna geek out on us?

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,195
She'll just sit in the corner, man.

32
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,322
I mean, I want her
to geek out on us.

33
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,617
She'll geek. She geeks.
She has the capacity to geek.

34
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:58,868
Okay.

35
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,287
You're good.

36
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,751
Wow.

37
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,877
Here, let me get your coat.

38
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,170
Hi.

39
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,713
Knives, that's Kim.

40
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,007
Sorry, what was your name?

41
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,300
Kim.

42
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,010
And you play the drums?

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,762
Yes.

44
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,722
That is so awesome.

45
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,557
Knives, that's Young Neil.

46
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,602
Hi.

47
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,479
What do you play?

48
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:33,236
Wow, Zelda, Tetris.

49
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,863
That's kind of a big question.

50
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,116
Okay, let's start with
Launchpad McQuack.

51
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,701
That's not the actual title of the...

52
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,537
We are Sex Bob-Omb!

53
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,038
One, two, three, four!

54
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,380
Yeah, yeah

55
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,757
Yeah, yeah

56
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,760
Laminate the stasis

57
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,638
Mama, mama serpentine

58
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,307
I got a breathalyzer

59
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,852
And my body's clean

60
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,027
Yeah! Yeah!

61
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,179
Thank you!

62
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,494
Get ready

63
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,623
Yeah

64
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,517
Yeah, yeah

65
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,317
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

66
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,777
Yeah!

67
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,910
You guys are so

68
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,122
amazing.

69
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,624
She seems nice.
Yeah.

70
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,833
Yeah, she seems awesome.

71
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,085
Yeah.

72
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,629
Scott, if your life had a face,
I would punch it.

73
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,756
Yeah. Wait, what?

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,801
I mean, are you really happy
or are you really evil?

75
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,220
Like, do I have ulterior
motives or something?

76
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,429
I'm offended, Kim.

77
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,722
Wounded, even?

78
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,307
Hurt, Kim.

79
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,850
You? Hurt?

80
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,354
Neil, you were saying
about "she seems awesome."

81
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,106
Yeah, she seems awesome.

82
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,482
Yeah.

83
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,614
Before you hear some dirty
lies from someone else,

84
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,241
yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old.

85
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,659
Oh, is he cute?

86
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,287
Does this mean we have to
stop sleeping together?

87
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,665
You see another bed in here?

88
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,793
Yeah. You're totally
my bitch forever.

89
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,930
So, the whole 17-year-old thing,
don't tell too many people.

90
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,724
Hey, you know me.

91
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,017
I mean,
don't tell my sister.

92
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,978
You know me.

93
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,271
Who are you texting?

94
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,817
Seventeen years old?
Scandal!

95
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,610
That's not true.
Who told you?

96
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,695
Wallace. Duh.

97
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,071
That gossipy bitch.

98
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,489
You know me.

99
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,574
Wallace!

100
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,701
Who is this mystery child you date?

101
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,995
Her name's Knives Chau.
She's Chinese.

102
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:16,250
A 17-year-old Chinese schoolgirl?
You're ridiculous.

103
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,877
It's a Catholic school, too.

104
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,253
With the uniform and everything?

105
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,713
Yeah.
The whole deal.

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,340
Oh, my God.
You guys haven't...

107
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,177
No, no, no, no.
We haven't even held hands yet.

108
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,262
I think she hugged me once.

109
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,389
Scott, why are you doing this?

110
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,143
I don't know. It's just nice,
you know? It's just simple.

111
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,644
It's been over a year
since you got dumped

112
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,980
by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named.
So...

113
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,733
Are you legitimately moving on

114
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,526
or is this just you being insane?

115
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,570
Can I get back to you on that?

116
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,575
I do not wanna be here at all.

117
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,660
This school has boys, too.

118
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:56,248
I hate you. Even I would think
twice about dating a 17-year-old.

119
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,541
Well, she's only allowed out

120
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,668
when the sun is up,
so I wouldn't call it dating.

121
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,046
It's more like... Playtime?

122
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,798
That doesn't sound so good, either. No.

123
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,049
Scott!

124
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,467
Hey, Knives.

125
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,636
This is my cool,
gay roommate, Wallace Wells.

126
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,887
Hi.
He's gay.

127
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,640
Oh, do you wanna know
who in my class is gay?

128
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,225
Yes, does he wear glasses?

129
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,560
Wallace, you go now.
Begone.

130
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,649
You're too good
for him. Run.

131
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,028
Get ready!

132
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,738
Here we go!

133
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,287
Did you know that the original
name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?

134
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,581
You'd think it was because
he looks like a hockey puck,

135
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,084
but it actually comes from the
Japanese phrase "paku-paku,"

136
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,919
which means,
"to flap one's mouth open and closed."

137
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,755
They changed it because
they thought that

138
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,590
"Puck-Man" would be
too easy to vandalize.

139
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,758
You know,
people could just scratch off

140
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,510
the "P" and turn it
into an "F" or whatever.

141
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,180
Oh, my God!
Like, wow!

142
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,557
Combo!

143
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,186
Yeah. Wow.

144
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,312
Continue?

145
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:05,776
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

146
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,153
three...
Oh, I got it.

147
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,487
...two, one.

148
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,326
I don't listen to that much music.

149
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,538
I mean, I know a lot of kids who play
piano or whatever, but you guys...

150
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,207
You guys rock.

151
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,792
Well, I knew I personally rocked,

152
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,461
but I never suspected
that we rocked as a unit.

153
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,713
So, thank you, Knives.

154
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,048
I mean, you guys
are gonna be huge.

155
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,884
Well, we're already pretty big,

156
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,468
but, yeah, I guess
it'd be cool

157
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,804
if cool people started wearing
our T-shirt or whatever.

158
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,598
Cool.
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,976
Excuse me, do you have anything
by The Clash at Demonhead?

160
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,479
Have you tried the section
marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?

161
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,064
Thank you, Julie.

162
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,649
Are you coming to my party Friday,

163
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,611
or will you be busy babysitting?

164
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,363
Thank you, Julie.

165
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,032
You don't want to listen to her.

166
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,868
And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.

167
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,661
Oh, I heart them so much.

168
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,248
Yeah, I hearted them, too,
until they signed to a major label,

169
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,044
and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.

170
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,670
But that's just me.

171
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,174
Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?

172
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,800
Sorry, you were saying about me?

173
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,803
I mean, I've never gone out
with anyone so talented.

174
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,180
Go out with a lot of guys?

175
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,264
No.

176
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,683
Yeah, so, whatever, man.

177
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,602
I've never even kissed a guy.

178
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,649
Hey,

179
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,692
me, neither.

180
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,331
Here you go.

181
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,749
So, this is your secret lair?

182
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,584
Yeah, yeah.
Can I come in?

183
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,629
My secret lair is one of those

184
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,464
"No girls allowed"-type deals.

185
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,799
Okay.

186
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,384
But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?

187
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,052
Sure!
Come on.

188
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,305
There you go.

189
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,141
Wow.

190
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,476
Yeah.

191
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,812
Wow.

192
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,821
Oh, God.

193
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,117
So alone.

194
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,161
You're not alone.

195
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,621
What?

196
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,457
You're just having some idiotic dream.

197
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,085
Does that mean we can make out?

198
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,962
Oh, God!

199
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,088
What is it, Scott?

200
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,298
I had this totally weird dream.

201
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,590
Oh, God.

202
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,925
What is it,
Other Scott?

203
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,304
Can we skip the dreamtime?
Color me not interested.

204
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,680
But there was this girl.

205
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,056
Girl?

206
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,599
Was this an Envy-related dream?

207
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,268
We don't use the E-word in this house.

208
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,438
No, it wasn't her.
It was somebody new.

209
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,481
Yay for that.

210
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,774
Speaking of new,

211
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,735
weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend

212
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,403
to the library a half-hour ago?

213
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,989
What? It's like 6:00
in the morning.

214
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,828
It's weird.

215
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,455
What's weird?

216
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,291
Libraries remind me of grade school.

217
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,793
That must seem like a
really long time ago.

218
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,546
Yeah, let's talk about something else.

219
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,108
Do you know that girl?

220
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,111
Scott!
What?

221
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,989
You only played one note
for that entire song.

222
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,075
My hand slipped.

223
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,910
Is your girlfriend distracting you?

224
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,745
My girlfriend?

225
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,163
I'll be quieter.

226
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,540
Let's do that one again.

227
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,875
Sorry, what are we doing?

228
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,293
I told you, like,
50 times!

229
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,170
We're going to this party, retard.

230
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,422
Party?
At Julie's.

231
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,507
I thought you guys split up.

232
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,051
We did, but there might be some
label guys there, so, you know...

233
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,011
Oh, man,
this is gonna suck. Suck!

234
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,263
At least it'll give us
something to complain about.

235
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,431
Oh, man!

236
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,641
This sucks!

237
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,809
Sucks!

238
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,937
I'm gonna go pee due to boredom.

239
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,481
I have to pee.

240
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,149
You know, so I told him you've
got a really good sound,

241
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,692
and I think that you
should market your sound

242
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,237
to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!

243
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,321
Hey, Comeau.

244
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,198
How about this party?
You getting your drink on here?

245
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,117
No, I don't drink.
This is just Coke Zero.

246
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,493
What do you mean,
you don't drink?

247
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,912
I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...

248
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,372
Hey, Comeau,
you know everyone, right?

249
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,499
Yeah, pretty much,
I do.

250
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,251
You know this one girl
with hair like this?

251
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,752
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

252
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,838
Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.

253
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,214
What?
Oh, Scott.

254
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,383
You have the hots for her or something?
I gotta tell you though,

255
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,926
I hear that she's a little hardcore.

256
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,969
Hey, what's up?

257
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,387
Nothing.

258
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,763
Hey, you know Pac-Man?

259
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,348
I know of him.

260
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,019
Well, Pac-Man was
originally called Puck-Man.

261
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,605
They changed it because...

262
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,773
Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.

263
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,276
"Paku-paku" means "flap your mouth,"

264
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,945
and that they were afraid
people would change...

265
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,824
Scratch out the "P" and
turn it into an "F," like...

266
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,703
Yeah, that's amazing.

267
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,246
Um...

268
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,624
Am I dreaming?

269
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,669
I'll leave you alone forever now.

270
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,837
Thanks.

271
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,346
Dude!
What?

272
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,680
She's totally real!
Who?

273
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,307
Ramona Flowers.
What?

274
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,476
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

275
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,186
All I know is that she is American.

276
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,312
American.

277
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,813
Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?

278
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,981
They know a lot more.

279
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,150
Lady-dudes.
What do you know about Ramona Flowers?

280
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,527
I heard she has a boyfriend.

281
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,028
Yeah. Some guy
back in New York.

282
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,821
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What else?

283
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,324
I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.

284
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,910
She's on another level.

285
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,870
She has men dying at her feet.

286
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,581
She's got some battle scars, dude.

287
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,166
What about Ramona Flowers?

288
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,251
You know her?
Tell me now.

289
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,335
She just moved here.

290
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,962
Got a job at Amazon.
Comes into my work.

291
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,004
Does she really?

292
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,756
Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?

293
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,882
Did she really?

294
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,217
They had a huge fight,
or whatever.

295
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,301
Did they really?

296
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,762
Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.

297
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,806
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

298
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,058
Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,

299
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,435
even if you haven't had a real
girlfriend in over a year.

300
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,940
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.

301
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,608
He's totally dating a high-schooler.

302
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,652
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

303
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,861
She's got a point.

304
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,029
I thought you guys broke up.

305
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,865
I don't want you scaring off the
coolest girl at my party, Scott.

306
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,535
We all know you're a total
lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.

307
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,036
That's completely untrue.

308
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,871
That time with Lisa?
That was a misunderstanding.

309
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,915
That time with Hollie?
That wasn't what it looked like.

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,041
That time you dumped Kim for...

311
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,918
Okay. Me and Kim are
all good now, all right?

312
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,715
Whatever! Ramona's out of your league.
Let's just leave it at that.

313
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,092
Besides, I'm not even sure
she did have a big breakup.

314
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,344
She keeps mentioning
some guy named Gideon.

315
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,887
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

316
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,306
Forget it, Scott!

317
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,686
Guess who's drunk?

318
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,980
I guess Wallace.

319
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:41,857
You guess right.

320
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,903
So, that girl from my dream...

321
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,238
Girl. Okay.

322
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,740
I saw her at the library.

323
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,451
Library. Can I pretend
we're talking about a guy?

324
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,412
And then I'm at this party
and, hey, there she is.

325
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,747
Hey, there he is.

326
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:57,789
I think she's...

327
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,915
I think he's...

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,126
I think she's the girl of my dreams.

329
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,210
Mmm.

330
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,671
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

331
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,465
I've never been so sure about something.

332
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,051
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

333
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,427
What's that?

334
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,430
You should break up with your
fake high-school girlfriend.

335
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,848
I'm not getting it, friend.

336
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,851
You're thinking of juggling two chicks?

337
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,977
Not even!

338
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,396
Well, you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

339
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,522
Wait, who told you?

340
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,899
Wallace. Duh!

341
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,692
He's not even conscious.
Whatever.

342
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,695
You of all people should know how
sucky it is to get cheated on.

343
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,946
Don't you have a job to do?

344
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,783
You're right. I should send out
a mass text about this. Bye.

345
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,954
Wallace, how do you do that?

346
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,331
Wallace!

347
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,250
Amazon.ca, what's the website for that?

348
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,795
"Amazon.ca."

349
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,130
I have to order something really cool.

350
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,882
You've got mail.

351
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,384
Dude, this thing claims I have mail.

352
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,928
It's amazing what we can do
with computers these days.

353
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,471
Dude, now I'm reading it.

354
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,889
So happy for you.

355
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,517
"Dear Mr. Pilgrim,
it has come to my attention

356
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,935
"that we will be fighting soon.

357
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,063
"My name is Matthew Patel,
and..." Blah, blah, blah...

358
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:08,276
"Fair warning... Mano y mano...
Seven evil..." Blah, blah.

359
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:14,157
This is...
This is... This is...

360
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,575
What?

361
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,577
This is boring.

362
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,621
Delete.

363
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,584
Scott,

364
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,046
are you waiting for the
package you just ordered?

365
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,715
Maybe.

366
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,843
It's the weekend. It won't ship
until Monday at the earliest.

367
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,386
You were saying?

368
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,555
Attack hug!
Hey!

369
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,683
Attack hug.
That's so cute. So cute.

370
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,767
You don't remember?

371
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,437
You're supposed to meet me at
the bus stop a half-hour ago.

372
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,188
How could I possibly forget?

373
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,651
Yearbook club is so boring.

374
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,987
I cannot believe the music
they put on while we work.

375
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,071
That's sucky.

376
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,324
Hannah broke up with Alan
and now she's all into Derek.

377
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,702
But then Tamara claims
she has dibs on Derek.

378
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,786
I tell you.

379
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,581
Bad!

380
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:10,297
Bad!

381
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,591
Okay. I'm sorry,
that was all me.

382
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,967
Solo round!

383
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:15,844
Uh-oh.

384
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,429
Nega ninja.

385
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,014
Nega ninja!

386
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,432
I can never get past that guy.

387
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,477
Don't beat yourself up about it.

388
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,728
Game over!

389
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,105
Do you want to keep going?

390
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,566
Continue?
Nine, eight,

391
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,736
seven, six, five...
I think...

392
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,862
...four, three...

393
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,238
I think that we should...

394
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,282
...two, one.

395
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,083
Game on, everybody.
Game on.

396
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,460
I got us a show.

397
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,836
Oh, my gosh, when?

398
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,213
Wednesday.

399
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,924
The Rockit. And even better,
it's the T. I. B. B.

400
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,008
Whoa!

401
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,593
The Toronto International
Battle of the Bands?

402
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,677
That's right.

403
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,305
This guy at work was like, "Steve,
you know anybody in a band?"

404
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,098
And I was like,
"I'm in a band."

405
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,850
And he was like,
"You're in a band?"

406
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,269
And I was like, "Yeah,
I am totally in a band."

407
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,437
Great story, man.

408
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,855
Is there a prize or something?

409
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,358
Only a record deal with G-Man Graves.

410
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,902
Who's that?
You don't know?

411
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,779
Indie producer of the millennium.

412
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,868
If we win, it won't just be
Knives wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts.

413
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,538
It'll be the cool kids, too.

414
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,622
I promise

415
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,501
I will do everything I can to get
out of the study group and come.

416
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,128
I have to pee.

417
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,797
Oh, my gosh,
who are you battling?

418
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,549
Crash and the Boys.

419
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,343
That one band with Crash,
and those boys?

420
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,594
Yeah, that's the one.

421
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,804
I hate them.

422
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,180
Oh, my gosh,
I hate them, too.

423
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,306
Yeah, they suck.

424
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,391
They suck bad.

425
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:23,346
Hey!

426
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,561
Uh, Scott Pilgrim?

427
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,271
Hi, I was thinking about asking you out,

428
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,106
but then I realized how
stupid that would be.

429
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,733
So, do you want to go out sometime?

430
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,861
No, that's okay.
You can just sign for this, all right?

431
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,905
I just woke up,
and you were in my dream.

432
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,824
I dreamt that you were delivering
me this package. Is that weird?

433
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,159
It's not weird at all.

434
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,243
It's not?

435
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,620
No, it's just that you
have this really convenient

436
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,705
subspace highway running through
your head that I like to use.

437
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,332
It's, like,
three miles in 15 seconds.

438
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,374
Right, right.

439
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,251
I forgot you guys don't
have that in Canada.

440
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,544
You don't
remember me, do you?

441
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,754
We met at the party the other day.

442
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,797
Were you the Pac-Man guy?
No.

443
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,883
Not even.
That was some total ass.

444
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,551
I was the other guy.

445
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,887
You know, you need to sign for this,
whatever this is.

446
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,096
But if I sign for it,
you'll leave.

447
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,306
Yeah, it's how it works.

448
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,308
Okay, well, maybe,

449
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,186
do you wanna hang out sometime?
Get to know each other?

450
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,229
You're the new kid on the block, right?

451
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:18,526
I've lived here forever, so there are
reasons for you to hang out with me.

452
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,488
You want me to hang out with you?

453
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,658
Yeah, if that's cool.

454
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,994
If I say yes, will you sign
for your damn package?

455
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,872
So, yeah, 8:00?

456
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,002
Why are you just standing there?

457
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,129
Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.

458
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,715
I'm sorry, I just assumed you
were too cool to be here on time.

459
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,634
Oh, you assumed wrong.

460
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,012
So, how did you end up in Toronto?

461
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,430
Just needed
to escape, I guess.

462
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,890
Yeah.

463
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,600
I got this job here,
and Gideon had always said

464
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,144
Toronto was one of the
great cities, so...

465
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,271
Is Gideon your boyfriend?

466
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,358
He's a friend.

467
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,111
Was he your boyfriend?

468
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,613
Do you mind if I don't
get into that right now?

469
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,074
It's so not interesting to me.

470
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,910
So, what about you?
What do you do?

471
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,037
I'm in between jobs at the moment.

472
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,164
Between what and what?

473
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:18,378
Well, my last job was a long
story filled with sighs.

474
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,547
I know plenty of those.

475
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,881
Is that why you left New York?

476
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,550
Pretty much.

477
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,677
It was just time to head
somewhere a little more chilled.

478
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,846
Well, it's certainly chilled here.

479
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,139
Yeah.

480
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,558
It's chilled,
as in cold.

481
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,059
Yeah.

482
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,523
This is ridiculous.
Isn't it, like, April?

483
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,691
I know.

484
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,735
I can barely see you.

485
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,487
This whole thing is an
unmitigated disaster.

486
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,408
I think act of God is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.

487
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,368
So this is a date, eh?

488
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,412
Did I say date?

489
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,372
Slip of the tongue.

490
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,999
Tongue.

491
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,668
Anyway, night's not over yet.

492
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,670
I think there's a thingy
over here, somewhere.

493
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:01,755
A thingy?

494
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,466
A door.

495
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,012
Come on.

496
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,945
What kind of tea do you want?

497
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,530
There's more than one kind?

498
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,284
We have blueberry, raspberry,
ginseng, Sleepytime,

499
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,494
green tea,
green tea with lemon,

500
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,079
green tea with lemon and honey,
liver disaster,

501
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,497
ginger with honey,
ginger without honey,

502
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,540
vanilla-almond, white
truffle, blueberry-chamomile,

503
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,918
vanilla-walnut, Constant Comment

504
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,544
and Earl Grey.

505
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,421
Did you make some of those up?

506
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,924
I think I'll have Sleepytime.

507
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,592
That sounds good to me.

508
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,887
Let me get you a blanket.

509
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,140
That would actually be awesome.

510
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:05,985
Dude, I'm changing.

511
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,822
Sorry.
I'm just cold.

512
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,949
Here, does that help?

513
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,701
Yeah, that's very warm.
What is that?

514
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,496
Okay.

515
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,682
Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

516
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,016
I guess.

517
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:41,688
Maybe we should both get under it,
since we're so cold.

518
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,024
What about our tea?

519
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,278
I can

520
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,072
not have tea.

521
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,623
I changed my mind.

522
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,293
Changed it to what?
From what?

523
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,880
I don't wanna have sex with
you, Pilgrim. Not right now.

524
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,798
Okay.

525
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,134
It's not like I'm gonna send you
home in a snowstorm or anything.

526
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,760
You can sleep in my bed.

527
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,722
And I reserve the right to change
my mind about the sex later.

528
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:19,392
Well, this is nice.
Just this.

529
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,936
It's been, like,
a really long time,

530
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,439
so I think I needed this,
whatever it is,

531
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,608
so thank you.

532
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,445
You're welcome.

533
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,910
Hey, so, can this
not be a one-night stand?

534
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,704
For one thing, I didn't even get any.
That was a joke.

535
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:41,915
What did you have in mind?

536
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,959
Come to the first round of
this Battle of the Bands thing.

537
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,252
You have a band?

538
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,629
Yeah, we're terrible.
Please, come?

539
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,589
Sure.

540
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,800
Oh! Wait. Can I get
your number?

541
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,429
Wow. Girl number.

542
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,973
See you at the show,
Scott Pilgrim.

543
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,934
Hey, it's tonight.
At the...

544
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,650
Hey.
You totally came.

545
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,778
Yes.
I did totally come.

546
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,577
Please excuse my brother.
He is chronically enfeebled.

547
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,079
I'm Stacey.
Hey.

548
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,747
This is Wallace,
his roommate. Hey.

549
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,082
This is my boyfriend, Jimmy.

550
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,166
Hey.

551
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,252
Oh, and this is Knives.

552
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,087
Hey!
Hey!

553
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,385
So, do you like?

554
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,470
Well, I...

555
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,525
Have to go.

556
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,072
Okay, this next band is from Brampton,

557
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,742
and they are Crash and the Boys.

558
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,870
God!
This is a nightmare.

559
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,207
Is this a nightmare?
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

560
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,667
Once we're on stage,
you'll be fine.

561
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,170
We were just on stage for sound check,
and the sound guy hated us.

562
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,465
It's just nerves.
Pre-show jitters.

563
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,717
People love us, right?

564
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,051
Oh, man,
this is bad.

565
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,637
This is so, so bad.

566
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,932
Hey, Jimmy,
do they rock or suck?

567
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,519
They have not started playing yet.

568
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,147
That was a test, Jimmy.
- One, two.

569
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,773
You passed.

570
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,275
Okay.

571
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,609
Good evening.

572
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,987
My name is Crash.
These are the Boys.

573
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,780
Is that girl a boy, too?

574
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,865
Yes.

575
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,118
They have a girl drummer?

576
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:46,748
This song is called I Am So Sad,
I Am So Very Very Sad.

577
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,207
Goes a little something like this.

578
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,546
So sad!

579
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,882
Thank you.

580
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,343
It's not a race, guys.

581
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,927
All right, this next song
goes out to the guy

582
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,512
who keeps yelling from the balcony.

583
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,681
It's called
We Hate You, Please Die.

584
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,641
Sweet.
Love this one.

585
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,071
I can feel ya,
I can hear ya...

586
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,046
Thank you.

587
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,925
So, how do you know Scott?

588
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,552
He's a friend.

589
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,097
It's hard for me to
keep track sometimes,

590
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,307
because he has so many friends.

591
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,020
Knives, how did you meet Scott?

592
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,313
Well...

593
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,273
Oh, no.

594
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,778
This is a nightmare.

595
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,740
We need to play now and loud.

596
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:03,866
Okay.

597
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,328
So, I was on the bus with my mom...

598
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,290
Is that seriously the end of the story?

599
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,792
Oh, my gosh!

600
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,876
Okay.

601
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,044
They're on!

602
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,004
This next band is from Toronto.

603
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:22,635
And, yeah.
Give it up for Sex Bob-Omb.

604
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,554
I heart you,
Sex Bob-Omb!

605
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,516
Scott, are you ready?

606
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,059
Okay. Kim?
Are you...

607
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:33,813
We are Sex Bob-Omb!
One, two, three, four!

608
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,657
I'll take you for a ride

609
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,827
On my garbage truck

610
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,497
Oh, no

611
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,834
I'll take you to the dump

612
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,422
'Cause you're my queen

613
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,842
I'll take you uptown

614
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,972
I'll show you the sites
You know you wanna ride

615
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,933
On my garbage truck

616
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,145
Truck, truck, truck

617
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,607
We'll pass the mansions by

618
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,110
Drive right through the needle's eye

619
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,278
Oh, my

620
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,446
Oh, no... My...

621
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,656
My, my, my, my

622
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,870
I've got a stereo

623
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,999
You've just got to turn the knob

624
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,336
And maybe we'll go

625
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,630
As far as we can

626
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,716
I'll be your garbage man

627
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,553
I'll take out your junk

628
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,139
And I'll crush it...

629
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,726
Mr. Pilgrim.

630
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,898
It is I,
Matthew Patel.

631
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,610
Consider our fight begun.

632
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,488
What did I do?

633
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,824
What do I do?

634
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,786
Fight!

635
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:29,303
All right.

636
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,931
Watch out!
It's that one guy.

637
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,299
Well, well, well,

638
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,386
you're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.

639
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,887
Who the hell are you, anyway?

640
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,974
My name is Matthew Patel!

641
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,771
And I'm Ramona's first
evil ex-boyfriend.

642
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,691
Her what?

643
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,736
Anyone need another drink?

644
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,249
Wait. We're fighting
over Ramona?

645
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,669
Didn't you get my e-mail
explaining the situation?

646
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,129
I skimmed it.

647
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,422
Mmm-mmm.

648
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,966
You will pay for your insolence!

649
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,743
Hey, what's up with his outfit?

650
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,621
Yeah, is he a pirate?

651
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,539
Are you a pirate?

652
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,041
Pirates are in this year.

653
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:32,927
You really went out with this guy?

654
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,846
Yeah.

655
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,933
In the seventh grade.

656
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,143
And?

657
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,316
It was football season
and for some reason,

658
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,068
all the little jocks wanted me.

659
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,823
Matthew was the only non-white,
non-jock boy in town.

660
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:57,535
So, the two of us joined forces
and we took 'em all down.

661
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:01,205
We brawled and scrapped
and fought for hours.

662
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,457
Nothing could beat
Matthew's mystical powers.

663
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,210
We only kissed once.

664
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,463
After a week and a half,
I told him to hit the showers.

665
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,133
Dude, wait.
Mystical powers?

666
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,097
You'll pay for this, Flowers.

667
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,851
If you want to fight me

668
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:22,977
What?

669
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,730
Ha!
You're not the brightest

670
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,068
You won't know what hit
you in the slightest

671
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,366
This guy's good.

672
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,785
Me and my fireballs

673
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,621
My Demon Hipster Chicks

674
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,206
Tell him, Matty.
Tell him, Matty.

675
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,417
I'm talking the talk

676
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,545
Because I know I'm slick

677
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,880
S-L-ick

678
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,257
Fireballs

679
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,676
Take this sucker down

680
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:04,018
Let us show him what we're all about

681
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,270
That doesn't even rhyme.

682
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:12,651
This is impossible.
How can this be?

683
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,946
Open your eyes,
maybe you'll see.

684
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,909
K-O!

685
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,710
Sweet! Coins.

686
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,587
God, is that allowed?

687
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,299
Well, it was nice meeting you.

688
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,843
Tell your gay friends I said bye.

689
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,386
Gay friends?

690
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,806
Wallace! Again?

691
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,141
- Get a room, guys!
- Oh, my God!

692
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,521
Oh, man, $2.40?
That's not even enough for the bus home.

693
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,773
I'll lend you the 35 cents.

694
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,443
Yeah, so,
Sex Bob-Omb wins.

695
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,239
Sex Bob-Omb won?

696
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,874
So, what was all that all about?

697
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,045
I guess

698
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,299
if we're gonna date, you may have
to defeat my seven evil exes.

699
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,634
You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?

700
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,885
Seven evil exes, yes.

701
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,512
And I have to fight... Defeat.

702
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:26,141
Defeat your seven evil exes if
we're going to continue to date?

703
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,268
Pretty much.

704
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:32,064
So, what you're saying
right now is we are dating?

705
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,401
I guess.

706
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,610
Does that mean we can make out?

707
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,946
Sure.

708
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,155
Cool.

709
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,084
Someone's happy.

710
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,503
Well, someone got to
second base last night.

711
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,840
And someone has a second date tonight.

712
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,550
Someone's lucky, then.

713
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,761
You know when I say "someone,"
I mean "me," right?

714
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,221
I got to second base last night.

715
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Maybe first-and-a-half.

716
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:13,856
So, I invited Ramona over for dinner
tonight, so you can't be here.

717
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,482
I don't want you gaying up the place.

718
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,153
Okay, Scott.

719
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,906
But in return,
I have to issue an ultimatum.

720
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,616
One of your famous ultimatums?

721
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,576
It may live in infamy.

722
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:30,623
You have to break up with Knives,
that poor angel, today.

723
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,877
But it's hard.

724
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,379
If you don't,
I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives.

725
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,505
I swear to God, Scott.

726
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,632
What? You...

727
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,467
Hi. Morning.

728
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,218
Hey, Jimmy.
Double standard!

729
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,720
I didn't make up the gay rulebook.

730
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,180
You got a problem with it... Stop.

731
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,723
Take it up with Liberace's ghost.

732
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,891
You're a monster.

733
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,643
Give me the bacon,
and go do your dirt

734
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,936
while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon.

735
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,103
Who's Lucas Lee?

736
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,188
Oh!

737
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,523
He was this pretty good skater.

738
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,983
Now he's this pretty good actor.

739
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,069
He's filming a Winifred Hailey
movie in Toronto right now.

740
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,278
They make movies in Toronto?

741
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,488
Yes.

742
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,114
I'm stalking him later.

743
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,199
So, this Lucas Lee...

744
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,326
Lucas Lee is not important
to you right now. Get out.

745
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,497
You suck.

746
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,790
Out.

747
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:13,999
Surprising no one.

748
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,084
Out.

749
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,089
Now, you listen close,
and you listen hard, bucko.

750
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,591
The next click you'll
hear is me hanging up.

751
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:26,971
The one after that is
me pulling the trigger.

752
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,684
Hey, Knives.

753
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,521
Hey, do you wanna,
like, talk or whatever?

754
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:40,859
Are you wearing a tan jacket, like,
a spring jacket, and a hoodie?

755
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,487
And a dorky hat?

756
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,656
It's not dorky.
Why are you psychic?

757
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,782
Hey!

758
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,117
Hey. Hey.

759
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:50,953
Hey.

760
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,248
Oh, my God.

761
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,293
I can't believe TCAD's coming to town.
Will you take me to the show?

762
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,671
Yeah, listen...

763
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,216
Hey, I wanted to invite
you over for dinner.

764
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,301
Like, Chinese food?

765
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,138
To meet my parents.
It's my birthday dinner.

766
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,765
I think that's a really bad idea.

767
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,685
No, it's okay. Why?

768
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,353
I'm too old for you.

769
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:19,690
No, you're not.
My dad is nine years older than my mom.

770
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,985
Are you even allowed to date
outside your race or whatever?

771
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,030
I don't care. I'm...

772
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,741
I'm in...

773
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,415
Uh...

774
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,459
Listen,

775
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,462
I was thinking

776
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:46,133
we should break up or whatever.

777
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,386
Really?

778
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:50,971
Yeah.

779
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,058
It's not gonna work out.

780
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,811
Oh.

781
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,426
Where's Knives.
Not coming tonight?

782
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,552
No, we broke up.

783
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:33,222
Hey, check it out, I learned the
bass line from Final Fantasy II.

784
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,562
Scott, you are the salt of the earth.

785
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,647
Thanks.

786
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,524
I meant scum of the earth.

787
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:44,942
Thanks.

788
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,401
You broke up with Knives?

789
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,237
Yeah, but don't worry.

790
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,823
Maybe soon you'll meet
my new-new girlfriend.

791
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:51,949
New-new.

792
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:58,413
Okay, from here on out, no girlfriends
or girlfriend talk at practice.

793
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,165
Whether they're old, new, or

794
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,375
New-new.
New-new.

795
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,752
We were lucky to survive the last round.

796
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,462
It's sudden death now, okay?

797
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,755
Okay.

798
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,764
That's for me.
That's for me. That's for me.

799
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,517
Hey, you're here.

800
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,311
Yes, like you said.

801
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:23,981
You know your hair?

802
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,107
I know of it.

803
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,316
It's all blue.

804
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,570
I change my hair every week and
a half, dude. Get used to it.

805
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,030
So...

806
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,741
How do you guys all know each other?

807
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,036
High school,
I guess.

808
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,413
What Neil said.

809
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,664
I'm Neil.

810
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,458
Believe it or not,
I actually dated Scott in high school.

811
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,252
Got any embarrassing stories?

812
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,962
Yeah, he's an idiot.

813
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,006
Okay, bye.
See you guys tomorrow.

814
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,132
What about rehearsal?

815
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,300
Neil knows my parts.

816
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,887
I'm Neil.

817
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,146
You doing okay, there?

818
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,856
Yeah, good, good, good.

819
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,235
She changed her hair.

820
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,570
So?
It looks nice blue.

821
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,071
Yeah, I know,
but she did it without even making

822
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,281
a big deal of it or anything.

823
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,075
She's fickle.
Impulsive. Spontaneous.

824
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,744
God, what am I gonna do?

825
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:22,998
Can't believe you're worried
about me gaying up the place.

826
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,000
So, how's dinner coming along?

827
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,919
Yeah, good, good, good.

828
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,506
Okay, well,
I'm gonna leave you lovebirds to it.

829
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,177
I am heading up to Casa Loma
to stalk my hetero crush.

830
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,303
Don't go!

831
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,763
Will you man the hell up?

832
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,223
You can get to second
and a half base tonight.

833
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,432
You think so?

834
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,435
Well, if you strike out in the next
hour, come find me at the castle.

835
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:44,770
If I strike out?

836
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,188
Okay, when.
See you in 60.

837
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:52,694
This is actually really
good garlic bread.

838
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,363
Garlic bread is my favorite food.

839
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,156
I could honestly eat it for every meal.

840
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,909
Or just eat it all the time
without even stopping.

841
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,077
You'd get fat.

842
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,286
No, why would I get fat?

843
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,412
Bread makes you fat.

844
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,747
Bread makes you fat?

845
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,793
I wrote a song about you.

846
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:08,961
You did?

847
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,128
Yeah, it goes like this.

848
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,882
Ramona

849
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,305
Ramona

850
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,434
On my mind

851
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:29,606
Ramona

852
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,446
Can't wait to hear it
when it's finished.

853
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,323
Finished?

854
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,498
Your hair's pretty shaggy.

855
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,583
Oh, God,
I need a haircut, don't I?

856
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:49,626
What?

857
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,003
No, sorry. I just...

858
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,840
I got a bad haircut right before
me and my big ex broke up,

859
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,426
but that was so long ago
now I can barely remember.

860
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,262
Scott is acutely aware that his
last salon haircut took place

861
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:04,182
exactly 431 days ago,
three hours before his big breakup.

862
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,435
He's been cutting his
own hair ever since.

863
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,644
So long ago.

864
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,314
Sounds like a bad time.

865
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,232
Bad time?
Not really.

866
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,400
It was.

867
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,693
It was a mutual thing.

868
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,861
It wasn't.

869
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,905
I mean,
she told me it was mutual.

870
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,366
She dumped him.
It was brutal.

871
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,659
What was her name?

872
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,036
She was Nat,
when I knew her,

873
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,204
but she stopped liking that name.

874
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,956
Then she stopped liking me.

875
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,916
Your hair is cute.
I like it long.

876
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,793
But it would be cuter short,
wouldn't it?

877
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,712
What?
What?

878
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,464
Why are you wearing that hat?

879
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:36,757
I thought we could go for a walk.

880
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,926
Tell me we didn't come
out here in the cold

881
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,303
so you could cover your
hair with that hat.

882
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,972
No, no. I just love me
some walking, you know.

883
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:49,061
Just putting one leg in front of
the other, like this. Walking.

884
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,104
You seem a little heightened.

885
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,231
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.

886
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,901
I just sort of feel like I'm
on drugs when I'm with you.

887
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,486
Not that I do drugs,
unless you do drugs,

888
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,488
in which case I do drugs all the time.

889
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:00,572
Every drug.

890
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,326
Yeah, I don't know.
Just when I'm with you,

891
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,120
things sort of seem a little brighter.

892
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,205
What is this place?

893
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,831
It's a totally awesome castle.

894
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,500
They're shooting this
movie here right now.

895
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:14,211
Okay, everybody, let's do this.
Lots to do, everyone.

896
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,295
Lots to do.

897
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,130
Did you find the guy you were stalking?

898
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,840
I think I'm about to right now.

899
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,509
Mr. Lee is traveling.

900
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:21,635
Mr. Lee?

901
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,053
Lucas Lee.

902
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,137
Oh.

903
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,639
Oh?

904
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,349
And roll sound.

905
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,441
I wanna have his adopted babies.

906
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:38,777
Here we go.

907
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,280
All right,
on your marks, everyone.

908
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:43,698
Oh, man,
we got to go.

909
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,033
What? Why?

910
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,411
I used to date that clown.

911
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,537
And...

912
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,663
Action.

913
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,581
Oh, my God.

914
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,833
Hey.

915
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,252
The only thing keeping me and her apart

916
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,629
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

917
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,381
You dated a famous guy?

918
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,174
In ninth grade.
We had drama.

919
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,551
Actually, it might have been math.

920
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,010
I just remember there
being a lot of drama.

921
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,053
Hey!

922
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,055
He was a snot-nosed little brat.
He just followed me around.

923
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,891
He had snot in his nose?
But he's famous.

924
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,477
Hey! I'm talking to you,
Scott Pilgrim.

925
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,146
He's famous and he talked to me.

926
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,356
The only thing keeping me and her apart

927
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,984
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

928
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,778
Can I have your...
Can I have your autograph, please?

929
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,241
What's up?

930
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,535
How's life?
He seems nice.

931
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,373
Boom!

932
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,962
And that's a cut!

933
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,383
Scott, evil ex.
Fight.

934
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:46,094
Let's get ready to go again, please.
Let's get ready to go again.

935
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,804
Hey, hombre.

936
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,808
You really think you can stand a
chance against an A-lister, bro?

937
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,939
Some competish you are.

938
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,525
Hey!

939
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,652
Hey!

940
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,697
Hey, I'm not done with you.

941
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,203
Looks like you're seeing double.

942
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:14,206
He's good, right?

943
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,249
Sometimes I let him do the wide shots

944
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,920
when I feel like getting
blazed back in my Winnie.

945
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,259
What can I say?

946
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,888
I'm nothing without my stunt team.

947
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,688
Hey! Ask them how it feels to
always get his sloppy seconds.

948
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:39,773
How does it...

949
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,142
Hey, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You homies want anything?

950
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,103
No, I just ate.
Negative.

951
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,445
That's actually hilarious.

952
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,114
Ah.

953
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,615
Hilarious.

954
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,451
Mr. Lee!

955
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,125
You're needed back on set.

956
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,154
Prepare...

957
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:13,992
Prepare to feel the wrath
of the League of Evil Exes.

958
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,827
The League of Evil Axes?

959
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,704
You really don't know about the League?

960
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,167
The seven evil exes?
Coming to kill you?

961
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,545
Controlling the future
of Ramona's love life?

962
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,755
No.

963
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,506
Oh, well, hey, listen, man.
Don't worry about it.

964
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,467
Really? Yeah.
Let's go get a beer.

965
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,551
That's great...

966
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:32,969
Boom!

967
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,266
You are a pretty good actor.

968
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:39,684
I'm going for the Oscar this year.

969
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,896
But are you a pretty good skater?

970
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,148
I'm more than pretty good, ese.

971
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,233
I have my own skate company.

972
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,780
But can you do a thingy on that rail?

973
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,034
It's called a grind, bro.

974
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,954
So, can you do a grindy thingy now?

975
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,375
Are you serious?

976
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,213
There are, like, 200 steps,
and the rails are garbage.

977
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,423
Well, hey,
if it's too hardcore then...

978
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,469
You really think you can goad
me into doing a trick like that?

979
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,012
There are girls watching.

980
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:21,017
Somebody get me my board.

981
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,396
Hi. Big fan.

982
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,607
Why wouldn't you be?

983
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:58,054
Wow.

984
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,848
Yes!
He totally bailed.

985
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,434
Ah! I didn't get
his autograph.

986
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:03,560
No.

987
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,895
And that's a wrap, everybody.

988
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,857
Hey, where's Ramona.
Is she still here?

989
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,192
No.
She totally bailed.

990
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,820
What's the deal?
Seriously.

991
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,822
Let's move, people,
the sun is coming up.

992
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:22,036
Hey, it's me again. Scott.
Give me a call when you get this.

993
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,872
Scott Pilgrim.

994
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,375
What's the deal?
Seriously.

995
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,711
Yep. You said that
last night.

996
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,004
You know what really sucks, though?

997
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,505
What?

998
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,591
Everything.

999
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,301
Come on, guy.

1000
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,678
You can't say you
didn't see this coming.

1001
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:39,804
What?

1002
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,266
What did you think these were?

1003
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,811
Kisses?
Seven little kisses?

1004
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,981
Seven deadly X's.

1005
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,904
Why does everything have
to be so complicated?

1006
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,199
If you want something bad,
you have to fight for it.

1007
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:00,992
Step up your game, Scott.

1008
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,535
Break out the L-word.

1009
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,828
"Lesbian?"

1010
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,288
The other L-word.

1011
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,582
"Lesbians?"

1012
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,293
It's "love," Scott.
I wasn't trying to trick you.

1013
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,629
Hey, buddy, look,

1014
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,965
if she really is the
girl of your dreams,

1015
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,509
then you have to let her know.

1016
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,262
You have to overcome any and all
obstacles that lie in your path.

1017
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,432
You can do it. Be with her!
It's your destiny!

1018
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:27,435
Plus, I need you to move out.

1019
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,603
What?
Yeah.

1020
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,021
I'm kind of banking on
her calling you back

1021
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,440
so I don't have to evict you
and feel all guilty and shit.

1022
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:34,943
I have a feeling that's for you, guy.

1023
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,570
Hey.

1024
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:38,696
Hey, Scott.

1025
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,573
Envy?
Oh, shit.

1026
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,408
Been a while.

1027
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,451
Yeah.

1028
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,744
A year, I think.

1029
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,162
Approximately.

1030
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,455
How are you?

1031
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,957
I'm not doing so good right now.

1032
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:53,461
Oh, that's too bad.
Still breaking hearts?

1033
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:57,549
What? No. I've been...
It's been different. You have no idea.

1034
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,176
Probably not.
Do you have a girlfriend?

1035
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,303
Should I be jealous?

1036
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,639
Yes, you should.
I have this totally awesome girlfriend

1037
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,267
who calls me all the
time and she's America.

1038
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,351
She's American.

1039
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,602
What's her name?

1040
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,396
I'm not telling you that.
Ramona.

1041
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,480
Oh.

1042
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:13,815
What?
Do you know her?

1043
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,316
What? No.

1044
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,193
It sounded like you did.

1045
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,821
I got to go.
It's been nice chatting with you.

1046
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,072
Wait.

1047
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,079
Okay.

1048
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,624
Everything does suck.

1049
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,419
Or does it? Hello?

1050
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,379
Hey, Knives.

1051
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,008
What's that?
You're outside?

1052
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,552
Is Scott here?

1053
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,263
You know what?
He just left.

1054
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,224
Really?

1055
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,392
Yeah.

1056
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,687
Sorry.

1057
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,025
Do you have a girlfriend?

1058
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:00,153
Seven deadly X's.

1059
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,864
You may have to defeat
my seven evil exes.

1060
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,159
It's sudden death now, okay?

1061
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,494
She's got some battle scars, dude.

1062
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,455
You can't say you
didn't see this coming.

1063
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,667
Dude.

1064
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:18,796
Please.

1065
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,424
I'm really not in the mood for this.

1066
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,053
Okay, enough!

1067
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,353
You punched me in the boob!

1068
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,023
Prepare to die, obviously.

1069
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,359
Look, I've had it today.
Can we not do this right now?

1070
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,527
I'd love to postpone, darling,

1071
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,905
but I just cashed my last rain check.

1072
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,615
What's that from?
My brain!

1073
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:49,202
I'm really, really not up for this.
Whatever it is.

1074
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,747
Okay, little chicken.
I'll see you later.

1075
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,499
But you won't see me,

1076
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:58,211
because next time,
I'll be deadly serious next time.

1077
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,545
What?

1078
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,755
Never mind!

1079
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,509
Man.
Someone help me.

1080
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,095
Hello.
It's Scott.

1081
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,346
What did he do this time?

1082
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,973
No, it's Scott.
It's actually me.

1083
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,099
What did you do this time?

1084
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,850
I didn't do anything.
It's everyone else that's crazy.

1085
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,936
Look, I'm having a meltdown or whatever.
Are you still working?

1086
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,145
I'm literally about to leave.

1087
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,397
Cool, I'm coming in.

1088
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,363
I think I'll make it a decaf today.

1089
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,698
Scott Pilgrim!

1090
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,533
What did you do with my sister?

1091
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,536
Sorry, I had to go.

1092
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,871
So, what can I get you?

1093
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,206
Is there anywhere you don't work?

1094
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,418
They're called jobs. Something a like
you wouldn't know anything about.

1095
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,712
And by the way, I can't
believe you asked Ramona out

1096
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,339
after I specifically
told you not to do that.

1097
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:44,799
How are you doing that with your mouth?

1098
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,926
Never mind how I'm doing it!

1099
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,386
What do you have to say for yourself?

1100
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,179
Can I get a caramel macchiato?

1101
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,725
You know what, maybe it's high
time you took a look in a mirror

1102
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,476
before you wreak havoc on another girl.

1103
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:56,686
Me? Wreak havoc?

1104
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,979
And speaking of which,

1105
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,188
I hear the girl that kicked
your heart in the ass

1106
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,898
is walking the streets of Toronto again.

1107
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,818
So, I can just get my coffee over here?

1108
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,489
Sorry that got a little
crazy last night.

1109
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,825
Yeah, you kind of disappeared.

1110
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,745
Yeah, I do that.

1111
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:18,833
Listen, I know I can be
hard to be around sometimes.

1112
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,502
I totally understand if you
don't want to hang out anymore.

1113
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,629
No, no,
I want to hang.

1114
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,840
You know, the whole
evil ex-boyfriend thing...

1115
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:26,924
Exes.

1116
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,009
It's no biggie.

1117
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,179
I know it's early,

1118
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,723
but I don't think anything
can get in the way of how I...

1119
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,932
Shit!

1120
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,393
It's my ex.

1121
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:38,728
A big one?
Mmm-hmm.

1122
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,855
Envy.

1123
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:44,776
I'm gonna...

1124
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,445
Excuse me.

1125
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,032
Your hair is getting shaggy.

1126
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,116
Yeah?

1127
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,743
So, that's Ramona.

1128
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,869
Yeah.

1129
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,537
Okay, I'm jealous.

1130
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,663
You're jealous?

1131
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:58,956
I'm allowed.

1132
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,375
You left me for that cocky pretty boy.

1133
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,127
You haven't even seen him.

1134
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,546
I know, you left me for
someone I've never even seen.

1135
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,424
Maybe you will see him.
We're playing Lee's Palace.

1136
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,344
You should so totally come.

1137
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,930
That's so not going to happen.

1138
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,932
Great, you're so on the list.

1139
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:21,229
Caramel macchiato for Pilgrim.

1140
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,356
So, that was Envy.

1141
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,067
What happened with the two of you?

1142
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,069
Do you mind if we don't
get into it right now?

1143
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,654
She wanted to move to Montreal,

1144
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,155
because she missed her best friend.

1145
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,032
This guy, Todd.

1146
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,076
And two weeks later,
they were sleeping together, I guess?

1147
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,744
Basically.

1148
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,997
Dated a Todd once.
Didn't end well, either.

1149
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:43,835
I can see how it sucks.
Having the past come back to haunt you.

1150
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,587
Is it wrong that I try
not to think about it?

1151
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,214
What do you want to think about?

1152
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,591
How warm my place is right now.

1153
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:51,676
Oh.

1154
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,847
And you didn't bang her?
Are you gay?

1155
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,683
I couldn't stop thinking
about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

1156
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,226
Is that the Uma Thurman movie?

1157
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,605
Scott, just because Envy is back
in town doesn't make it not over.

1158
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,774
Double negative.
It's tricky.

1159
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,734
It's over. Move on.

1160
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,777
Word.

1161
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,572
Right. I'm not going
to let her toy with me.

1162
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:14,949
From this moment on,

1163
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,785
I will think of Envy Adams no more!

1164
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,371
I have distressing news.

1165
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,416
Is it news that we suck, because I
really don't think I can take it.

1166
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,502
No. The Clash at Demonhead are
doing a secret show tomorrow night

1167
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,671
and Envy asked us to open for them.

1168
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,797
I hate you.

1169
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,049
A gig is a gig,
is a gig, is a gig.

1170
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,509
Maybe you can put your history aside

1171
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,428
until we get through
this thing, for the band.

1172
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,471
For the band?
For the band?

1173
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,931
Can't we do our...
For the band?

1174
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,141
Can't we do our own secret shows?

1175
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,934
All our shows are secret shows.

1176
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:45,146
We're doing it.
G-Man might be there.

1177
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,148
We play the next round
of the battle on Tuesday.

1178
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,568
We have to get some buzz going.
We need groundswell.

1179
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,195
We need stalkers.

1180
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,078
What would you do if
your ex was in a band

1181
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,872
and they wanted you to open for them?

1182
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,749
If my ex was in a band?

1183
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:05,833
Mmm-hmm.

1184
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:07,919
Might be a little
awkward, but maybe

1185
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,670
it's the grown-up thing to do.

1186
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,590
Yeah. We're all
adults here, right?

1187
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,885
Oh, my God!

1188
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,970
He's dating a fat-ass hipster chick!

1189
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,597
I hate her stupid guts!

1190
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:24,894
He only likes her because she's old.
She's probably, like, 25!

1191
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,563
She's just some fat-ass
white girl, you know?

1192
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:29,565
I think you mentioned she was fat.

1193
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:30,983
She's got a head start.

1194
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,445
I mean, I didn't even know there
was good music until two months ago!

1195
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,571
Hey, this really burns.

1196
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:36,697
You should rinse.

1197
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,409
When I got this idea,
I just thought, "I have to do it!"

1198
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,328
I can't hear anything you're saying.

1199
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,289
Oh, God! I look so

1200
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,626
good.

1201
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,587
Ramona Flowers stole my Scott.

1202
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,715
But I know how to get him back.

1203
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,259
How?

1204
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,022
Come on,
come on

1205
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,904
Thank you,
we were Sex Bob-Omb.

1206
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,447
Yeah!

1207
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,741
We have some merch at the back, so...

1208
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,828
Okay, bar? Now?

1209
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,751
Level with me.
Did we suck?

1210
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,962
I don't know.
Did you?

1211
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,383
She has to go.
She knows we suck.

1212
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,014
Hey, Ramona.

1213
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,309
Hey.

1214
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,270
What the hell?

1215
01:00:58,238 --> 01:00:59,572
Hey.

1216
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,032
Hey, Scott.

1217
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,242
What the hell?

1218
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,077
Look who Knives is hanging out with.

1219
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:06,871
Who is that girl again?

1220
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:07,955
Scott dated her.

1221
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,081
Briefly, briefly.

1222
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,791
How old is she?

1223
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,505
I gotta pee on her.

1224
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,467
I mean, I gotta pee.
Pee time.

1225
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:24,388
And then it was time

1226
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:28,142
for Toronto to drown in the sweet sorrow

1227
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:32,897
of The Clash at Demonhead!

1228
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,569
Envy! Envy!

1229
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,323
That guy on bass...

1230
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,657
Oh, yeah

1231
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,034
...that's Todd.

1232
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,202
I know.

1233
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,787
Oh, yeah?

1234
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:49,997
You know?

1235
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:52,291
Oh, yeah!

1236
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,585
Oh, no.

1237
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,631
Hello, again,
friend of a friend

1238
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,549
I knew you well

1239
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,512
Our common goal

1240
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:09,100
was waiting for the world to end

1241
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,269
Now that the truth

1242
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:16,899
is just a rule that you demand

1243
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,860
You crack the whip

1244
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:24,198
Shape-shift and trick the past again

1245
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:28,577
Send you my love on the wire

1246
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,997
Lift you up,
every time

1247
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,750
Everyone

1248
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,837
pulls away

1249
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,633
from you

1250
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:45,428
That was...
That was devastating.

1251
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,471
Oh, my God.
Just, oh, my God.

1252
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:50,558
Yeah, you should see them live.
They're much better live.

1253
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:51,892
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1254
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,813
I can't even believe I'm saying this,

1255
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,649
but Envy Adams would like
you all to come backstage.

1256
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,109
All of us?

1257
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,652
Did I stutter?

1258
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,408
Wait, how do you know Envy?

1259
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,576
Scott dated her.

1260
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,957
Hey, Ramona.

1261
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,042
Hey, Todd.

1262
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,086
It's been awhile.

1263
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:20,546
Mmm-hmm.

1264
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,047
Mmm-hmm?

1265
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,175
I think we should get out of here.

1266
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,218
So, how was the tour?
You guys play with the Pixies?

1267
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,803
You're like a superstar now.

1268
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:30,598
Yeah, it's not really
something I can put into words.

1269
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:31,682
Um, Envy...

1270
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,393
I read your blog.

1271
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:37,771
So, Scott and Ramona, eh?

1272
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:38,939
What of it?

1273
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,107
You guys make a cute couple,
you know?

1274
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,485
Suit each other.

1275
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,820
You're my role model, Envy.

1276
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:47,114
Ramona, I like your outfit.
Affordable?

1277
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,200
Envy, I was just gonna say did
you get those jeans in New York?

1278
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:51,494
I'm talking to Ramona right now.

1279
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:52,995
Ramona lived in New York.

1280
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,163
Did she?

1281
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:57,625
I was just there.
Played the Chaos Theatre, for Gideon.

1282
01:03:58,126 --> 01:03:59,210
You know him, right?

1283
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,296
I've kissed the lips that kissed you!

1284
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,344
Knives!

1285
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,304
What?

1286
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:11,555
I'm not afraid to hit a girl.

1287
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,017
I'm a rock star.

1288
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,268
Oh, my God!

1289
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,647
You punched the highlights
out of her hair.

1290
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,901
He punched the highlights
out of her hair!

1291
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:26,028
You are incorrigible.

1292
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,197
I don't know the meaning of the word.

1293
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:34,912
So, you guys doing anything
fun while you're in town?

1294
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,831
Fun? In Toronto?

1295
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,168
That's it!
You cocky cock!

1296
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,879
You'll pay for your
crimes against humanity.

1297
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,434
My neck.

1298
01:04:58,728 --> 01:04:59,812
Your hair.

1299
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,273
Didn't you know?

1300
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:03,732
Todd's vegan.

1301
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,489
Vegan?

1302
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,867
It's not really that big of a deal.

1303
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:16,912
No kidding.

1304
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,416
Anyone can be vegan.

1305
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,335
Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

1306
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:24,628
Ovo-what?

1307
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:29,466
I partake not in the meat,
nor the breast milk, nor the ovum

1308
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,635
of any creature with a face.

1309
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,886
Short answer,

1310
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,472
being vegan just makes you
better than most people.

1311
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:36,640
Bingo.

1312
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,562
Hey, man, question.

1313
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,398
I always wondered,
how does not eating dairy products

1314
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,317
give you psychic powers?

1315
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:47,901
Okay.

1316
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,362
You know how you only
use 10% of your brain?

1317
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,740
That's because the other 90%
is filled with curds and whey.

1318
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,908
Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?

1319
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,410
Go ahead and get snippy, baby.

1320
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,954
If you knew the science, maybe I'd
listen to a word you're saying.

1321
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,545
If I peed my pants, would you
pretend I just got wet from the rain?

1322
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:07,671
It's not raining.

1323
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:08,756
Oh.

1324
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,633
Then why don't you
give me the Cliff Notes

1325
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,344
on how and why you ended
up dating this A-hole.

1326
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:14,762
Is that really important right now?

1327
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,764
Well, if there's a key
element in his backstory

1328
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,142
that's gonna help me out in a
critical moment of not dying, yes.

1329
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:25,230
I was only dating Lucas until
the minute Todd walked by.

1330
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:29,526
Guess that's not very nice,
but I used to be, kind of like that.

1331
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,614
We hated everyone.
We wrecked stuff. Nobody cared.

1332
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,866
He punched a hole in the moon for me.

1333
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,785
It was pretty crazy.

1334
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,078
A week and a half later he told me

1335
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,954
his dad was sending
him to Vegan Academy,

1336
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,040
so I dumped him.

1337
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,918
Have you dumped everyone
you've ever been with?

1338
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,836
You've never been the dumpee?

1339
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:51,048
Look, I've dabbled in being a bitch.

1340
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,925
It's part of the reason I moved here.

1341
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,303
I was really hoping to just
leave it all behind me.

1342
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:57,763
Hey, lovebirds...

1343
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,058
We have unfinished business,
I and he.

1344
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:02,976
He and me.

1345
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:04,520
Don't you talk to me about grammar.

1346
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,480
I dislike you, capisce?

1347
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,315
Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

1348
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,483
What?

1349
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,068
Because you'll be dust by Monday.

1350
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:12,778
Um...

1351
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,905
Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.

1352
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:18,242
And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.

1353
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,411
She dusts.

1354
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,997
So, what's on Monday?

1355
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:29,169
Because it's Friday now.
She has the weekends off, so...

1356
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,714
Monday. Right?

1357
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,716
Basically, you can't win this fight.

1358
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,967
You're gonna have to give up this girl,

1359
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,385
because Todd's gonna kill you.

1360
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,679
You used to be so nice!

1361
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,944
Scott, we're gonna go to
Pizza Pizza for a slice.

1362
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,446
Call us when you're done.

1363
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,115
He'll be done.
Real soon.

1364
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:04,788
Sounds like someone wants to get funky.

1365
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:32,042
I can read your thoughts.
Your will is broken. You're through.

1366
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:34,378
What say we drink to my memory?

1367
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:36,421
Fair trade blend with soy milk?

1368
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,924
I'm sorry,
but that's pathetic.

1369
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,009
Dude, I can see in your mind's eye.

1370
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,220
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

1371
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,514
in an attempt to make
me break vegan edge.

1372
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,391
I'll take the one with soy.

1373
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:52,062
Thanks, tool.

1374
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,650
Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.

1375
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,528
But I thought real hard
about pouring it in that cup.

1376
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,531
You know,
in my mind's eye or whatever.

1377
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:05,075
What are you talking about?

1378
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,577
You just drank half-and-half, baby.

1379
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,705
Freeze!
Vegan police!

1380
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:10,998
Vegan police!

1381
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:14,585
Todd Ingram, you're under
arrest for veganity violation,

1382
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:17,921
code number 827,
imbibement of half-and-half.

1383
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,548
That's bullroar!

1384
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,550
No vegan diet,
no vegan powers!

1385
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,802
But it's only my first offense.

1386
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,012
Don't I get three strikes?
I mean...

1387
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,471
Take it.

1388
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,017
At 12:27 a.m. on February 1 st,

1389
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:31,393
you knowingly ingested gelato.

1390
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,353
Gelato isn't vegan?

1391
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,855
It's milk and eggs, bitch.

1392
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:38,066
On April 4th, 7:30 p.m.,
you partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

1393
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:40,944
Chicken isn't vegan?

1394
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:43,655
The de-veganizing ray.
Hit him.

1395
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,256
Oh, my God!

1396
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:03,884
No. No.

1397
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,346
You once were a vegone,

1398
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,640
but now you will be gone.

1399
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:10,974
Vegone?

1400
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:28,075
Yeah!
Yeah!

1401
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,999
Sorry, I guess.

1402
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,002
Sorry?

1403
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,547
You just headbutted my
boyfriend so hard he burst.

1404
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:47,219
You kicked my heart in the ass,
so I guess we're even.

1405
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,180
Natalie.

1406
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,352
Natalie? No one
calls me that anymore.

1407
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,188
Maybe they should.

1408
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,901
Let's get out of here.

1409
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:13,370
For the record,
I am so pissed off for you, right now.

1410
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,288
Shut the up, Julie.

1411
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,665
Okay.

1412
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,501
We're still going to
the after-party, right?

1413
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,378
I'm not sure there's going
to be much of a party.

1414
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,130
I think a third of the
band just went "poom."

1415
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,841
Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

1416
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,677
Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the label guys.

1417
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,721
Then why would we... Oh.

1418
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,889
Neil, you down?

1419
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,266
Scott, you're in, right?

1420
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:36,393
You wanna go?

1421
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:39,771
Well, I kind of almost died back there.

1422
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:40,897
I'm not saying I want to go.

1423
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,107
Yeah.
We can totally go.

1424
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,191
I'll do whatever you want to do.

1425
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,276
So, let's go.

1426
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,237
We really don't have
to go to this thing.

1427
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,114
It'll probably be a
bad scene all around.

1428
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,533
No, I'm fine.
It's just...

1429
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,243
It's just... Well...

1430
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:57,497
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

1431
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,332
So far,
you're not a total ass.

1432
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,584
But I'm part ass?

1433
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,794
If it makes you feel better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

1434
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:03,879
Wait, is that good?

1435
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,130
It's what I need right now.

1436
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,214
But not later?

1437
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,133
Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?

1438
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,927
I'd just like to try and
live in the moment if I can.

1439
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:12,596
I'd just like to live.

1440
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:14,514
Look, I know Todd was bad news,

1441
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,016
but are you saying Envy wasn't?

1442
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,434
We all have baggage.

1443
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,562
Well, my baggage doesn't try
and kill me every five minutes.

1444
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,522
What did you do to make
your ex-boyfriend so insane?

1445
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:23,899
Exes.
Whatever.

1446
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,151
No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.

1447
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,779
What about you and that girl, Knives?
Who broke up with who?

1448
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,448
I believe I broke up with her.

1449
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,824
And was she cool with that?

1450
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,368
Knives is with Young Neil now.
She's totally cool with it.

1451
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,453
You sure about that?

1452
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,080
Yeah, she's very mature for her age.

1453
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,414
We had a very healthy breakup.

1454
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,707
We're all peaches and gravy.

1455
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,084
No!

1456
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,710
What about you and Kim?

1457
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,962
Me and Kim?
I can barely remember.

1458
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,048
It was high school.
She had freckles.

1459
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,299
That's it?

1460
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,385
Yeah, it kind of ended.
We changed.

1461
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:53,553
That's really the whole story?

1462
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,514
Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?

1463
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:58,225
I fought a crazy, 80-foot-tall,
purple-suited dude

1464
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,393
and I had to fight 96
guys to get to him.

1465
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:03,105
He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?

1466
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:05,607
And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.

1467
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,110
Does that make you feel any better?

1468
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,987
Well, now you are being a total ass.
Welcome to the club.

1469
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:14,032
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

1470
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:17,661
Hey, don't worry.
I don't even know what I'm like anymore.

1471
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:21,331
I think this ex-boyfriends
thing is messing with my head.

1472
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,791
Exes.
Why do you keep saying that?

1473
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,008
The girl from earlier?

1474
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,594
Roxy?
You know this girl?

1475
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,681
Boy, does she know me.

1476
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,100
What is she talking about?

1477
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,893
He really doesn't know?

1478
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,354
Wait.

1479
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:46,231
Hmm?

1480
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,111
You and her?
It was just a phase.

1481
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,821
Just a phase?
You had a sexy phase?

1482
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,406
It meant nothing.
I didn't think it would count.

1483
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,532
It meant nothing?

1484
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:56,825
I was just a little bi-curious.

1485
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,451
Well, honey,

1486
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:01,413
I'm a little bi-furious.

1487
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,177
Do that again and I will end you.

1488
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:16,720
Back off, hasbian.

1489
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,723
If Gideon can't have you,
no one can.

1490
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,476
The League has spoken.

1491
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,646
Well, then Gideon best get
his pretentious ass up here

1492
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:29,399
because I'm about to kick yours
out of the Great White North.

1493
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:44,998
Wallace?
Uh-huh?

1494
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,292
This is happening, right?
Oh, yeah.

1495
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,002
Kick her in the balls.

1496
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:12,901
I'm sending you back to Gideon

1497
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,736
in a thousand pieces,
you slag!

1498
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,198
Ha!

1499
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,372
I'd rather be dead than go back.

1500
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,790
He's a creep,
you're a bitch,

1501
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,041
and you all deserve each other.

1502
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,293
Give it a rest, Ramona.
This is a League game.

1503
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,461
Meaning?

1504
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:35,131
Meaning your precious Scott must
defeat me with his own fists.

1505
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,512
I don't think I can hit a girl.
They're soft.

1506
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:41,721
You don't have a choice.

1507
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:02,993
Fight your own battles,
lazy ass!

1508
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,709
Lazy ass!

1509
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,676
Every Pilgrim reaches
the end of his journey.

1510
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,678
Some sooner than others.

1511
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:28,685
Your BF's about to get F'd in the B.

1512
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,813
Her weak point is the back of her knees.

1513
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,606
Wait, how does that work?

1514
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:36,276
Whenever we were making
out I would just...

1515
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,819
Okay, enough.

1516
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:51,750
You'll never be able to do this to her.

1517
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:06,890
So...

1518
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,391
Two gin-and-tonics, please?

1519
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:09,642
I thought you didn't drink.

1520
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:12,562
Only on special occasions.
Why? Did you want one?

1521
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,607
Guess we really don't know that
much about each other, do we?

1522
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,651
Maybe you could just give me
a list of all of your exes

1523
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:20,362
so that I can at least
know who's going to

1524
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,030
beat my ass into the ground next.

1525
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:24,783
Like a handy little laminate or
something? Let me see if I have one.

1526
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,326
Maybe we could exchange our information.

1527
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,787
Hey, just out of sheer
curiosity and concern

1528
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,121
for my mortal well-being,

1529
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:33,249
is there anyone at this party
that you haven't slept with?

1530
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,672
I think we should split.

1531
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:42,175
As in get out of here,
or as in split, split?

1532
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,718
I'd hope you could figure that out.

1533
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:45,762
Or did you miss the part
where I saved your ass?

1534
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:48,556
How could I? I feel like we just
washed our sexy laundry in public.

1535
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:49,891
Dirty laundry.
You're drunk.

1536
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:51,226
I had, like,
one drink.

1537
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:55,021
I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all
this, Scott. In fact, I'm sick of it.

1538
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:56,106
I thought you might be
more understanding.

1539
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,357
I just...

1540
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,943
You're just another evil
ex waiting to happen.

1541
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,572
That was harsh.

1542
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,909
That was not good.

1543
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,121
That was embarrassing.

1544
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:13,498
One more.

1545
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,583
P.S. Here's your stupid list.

1546
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,213
Matthew Patel, Lucas Lee,
Todd Ingram, Roxy Richter.

1547
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:23,007
Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?

1548
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:26,803
You don't know?

1549
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,221
The Katayanagi Twins

1550
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,723
just happen to be the
next band in the battle.

1551
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,519
They are totally bad-ass.

1552
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,563
Ramona dated twins?
Apparently.

1553
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:37,730
At the same time?

1554
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:38,815
You know what?

1555
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,233
I don't know and I don't want to know.

1556
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:43,069
Good. Because you know how I feel
about girls blocking the rock.

1557
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:44,737
Good, I play better
when I'm in a bad mood.

1558
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:45,947
If it's gonna be an issue though,

1559
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,073
Young Neil can fill in for you.

1560
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:48,491
It's not an issue.
You know bands,

1561
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:49,993
I know battles.
We got it covered.

1562
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,995
But we'd understand if you
didn't want to take part.

1563
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,371
Not only do I want to take part

1564
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:55,248
I want to take them apart.

1565
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,709
Okay, I'm getting tingles.

1566
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:58,877
Whoa!

1567
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:02,422
Okay, we're doomed.
Oh!

1568
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,799
That poster needs more
exclamation marks.

1569
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:06,843
Oh, man,
we're gonna get killed.

1570
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,511
Come on, we're going
on in five minutes.

1571
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,972
Wait, aren't the
Katayanagis going on first?

1572
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,516
I think you're both on first.

1573
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,102
Wait, "Amp versus amp"?

1574
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:17,812
We're going on stage at the same time?

1575
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,230
That's impossible.

1576
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:21,983
Okay, my bad.

1577
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:24,110
Your bad is
saying, "My bad."

1578
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:28,114
We shouldn't even be here.
We shouldn't even be here!

1579
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,533
Come on, man!
I put my problems aside for the music.

1580
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:31,951
If I can do that,
we can do anything.

1581
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,578
Did you speak to Ramona, then?

1582
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,539
What? No. I haven't seen
her since the other night.

1583
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:37,624
Oh.

1584
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,000
She's totally here.

1585
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:43,046
Scott?

1586
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:45,423
Not that I care,

1587
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,550
but you should go talk
to her before she's gone.

1588
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:49,135
Thanks, Kim.

1589
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,345
And I really don't care.

1590
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:53,681
I didn't mean to put
you through all that.

1591
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,309
I only did it because I love you.
You know that.

1592
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,598
Okay, gang,
can we do this?

1593
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,433
I mean,
we can do this, right?

1594
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:38,601
Right.

1595
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:39,936
Scott?

1596
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:42,939
Scott!

1597
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,458
They tore the roof off!

1598
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:07,797
We are Sex Bob-Omb

1599
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,842
and we're here to make you think
about death and get sad and stuff!

1600
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,597
This is the beginning of the song.

1601
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:19,225
I'm hearing voices,
animal noises

1602
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,643
The crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me

1603
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:22,228
The feminine abyss

1604
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:25,815
And reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind

1605
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,319
My body's stupid

1606
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:30,737
Stereo putrid

1607
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,363
Spilling out music

1608
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,781
Into raw sewage

1609
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:37,035
Reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind

1610
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:47,879
My threshold

1611
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,089
Reaching

1612
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,760
My threshold

1613
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:07,899
Let's just break up now
and get it over with.

1614
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,486
We screwed the pooch in front
of Gideon Graves. We're done!

1615
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,488
Gideon's here?
Where?

1616
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,698
That geeky guy next to your girlfriend.

1617
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,410
That's Gideon?

1618
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,704
Gideon is G-Man?

1619
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,040
All right,
let's do this.

1620
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,961
Reaching my threshold

1621
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:37,512
My threshold

1622
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:24,726
We're out.

1623
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:30,648
What are you doing?

1624
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:31,941
Getting a life.

1625
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,999
I just came to see your show.

1626
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:52,378
I have to...

1627
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:01,888
Ramona.

1628
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:05,516
Ramona, I need to tell you something.

1629
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:06,893
Yeah, I have something
I have to tell you, too.

1630
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:09,020
Great. Listen, I know you
play mysterious and aloof

1631
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,521
just to avoid getting hurt.

1632
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:14,692
I know you have reasons for not
wanting to talk about your past.

1633
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:18,404
I want you to know I don't
care about any of that stuff

1634
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:20,406
because I'm in lesbians with you.

1635
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:21,908
What?

1636
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:23,326
I really,
really mean it.

1637
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,330
Oh! Okay.

1638
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:28,956
It's your turn.
What did you want to tell me?

1639
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,293
That we have to break up.

1640
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:34,545
What?

1641
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,088
It's Gideon.

1642
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,591
I just can't...

1643
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:42,428
I can't help myself around him.

1644
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:44,388
That's the bad news.

1645
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:46,432
Hey.

1646
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:49,894
The good news is that I'm
officially loving the Sex-Bombs.

1647
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,562
Bob-Omb.
Three-piece rock outfit

1648
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,023
with a smoking hot red-head on drums.

1649
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,942
Music to my ear-holes.

1650
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:58,986
You know what?
I'm not even going to wait

1651
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,530
to see how you guys do in the final.

1652
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:03,032
I'm signing you right now
for a three-album contract.

1653
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,577
See? I'm not such
a bad guy after all.

1654
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,956
You think we're going to sell our
souls to you? Well, guess again.

1655
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,376
No, I can't be a part of the
band with this douche in charge.

1656
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:15,586
Ow! Scott.

1657
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,756
You got to try and keep
your emotions in check, man.

1658
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:21,509
Don't let what's past ruin your future.

1659
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,177
The people need to hear us, Scott.

1660
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:25,847
Then you're gonna have to find
someone else to play bass.

1661
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:28,683
Whoops.

1662
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:33,479
Sign, sign, sign,
and we are all set.

1663
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,982
Sweetie, shall we?

1664
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,657
Oh! Scott.

1665
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,493
You know,
we really should be thanking each other.

1666
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:50,288
I mean, if it wasn't for me,
Ramona would never have been with you

1667
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:52,373
but if it wasn't for you she
wouldn't have gotten back with me,

1668
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,333
so I guess it all shakes out.

1669
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,628
Scotty, buddy,

1670
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:03,718
between you and I,
the whole League of Evil Exes thing?

1671
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:07,680
I was in a really dark place
when I put that together, so...

1672
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,932
Forgiven?

1673
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:12,226
All right, let's go.

1674
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:14,145
Yes!

1675
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:18,024
This is it, guys.
We are on our way.

1676
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,446
I said "lesbians."

1677
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:53,434
Scott.

1678
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,811
Was she really the one?

1679
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:57,730
The what?

1680
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:00,149
I mean, did you really see
a future with this girl?

1681
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:04,654
Like, with jetpacks.

1682
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:13,621
Time heals all wounds,
little brother.

1683
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:18,167
Maybe next time we don't date the
girl with 11 evil ex-boyfriends.

1684
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:19,502
Seven.

1685
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:20,711
That's not that bad.

1686
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,757
Hey. Yeah, I know.

1687
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:27,343
It's so pathetic!

1688
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,931
Turn off the light!

1689
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,728
Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk

1690
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:39,271
and I apologize for that.

1691
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:40,398
Okay.

1692
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:42,191
And he apologizes, too.

1693
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:43,359
Sorry.

1694
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,655
Scott, you know I love you.

1695
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,324
But I'm gonna need my own bed tonight.

1696
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,535
It's for sex.

1697
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:54,245
Right.

1698
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:58,040
I may need it for the
rest of the week, too.

1699
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:59,583
Right.

1700
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:00,751
And the year.

1701
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:02,628
I get it.

1702
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:04,422
Maybe you can move in with Ramona.

1703
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,133
She's with Gideon.

1704
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:08,467
Oh, man.

1705
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,636
That's probably just because
he's better than you.

1706
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:11,804
Mmm.

1707
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,849
Either way,
this fight is over.

1708
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:16,308
Mmm-hmm.

1709
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,360
It's for Scott.

1710
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,571
It's for you,
big guy.

1711
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:31,657
Hello.

1712
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:32,908
Hey, pal.

1713
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,828
I just want to say I feel
terrible about earlier.

1714
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,913
I don't want any hard feelings.

1715
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:41,417
So I figured, why not be the bigger
man and just give you a call.

1716
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,002
Is Ramona with you?

1717
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:46,505
I don't know.
Are you with me?

1718
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,133
Yeah.

1719
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,262
Geez, buddy,
it's gonna be all right.

1720
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,140
No, I just spilled hot
cocoa on my crotch.

1721
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,308
Mmm-hmm.

1722
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,768
Listen, as you know,

1723
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:00,853
I'm opening a new Chaos
Theatre in Toronto.

1724
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,189
And the Sex-Bobs are playing
our grand opening tonight.

1725
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:06,108
It would feel really weird for
all of us if you weren't there.

1726
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:09,987
They just did a sound check and
the acoustics in here are amazing!

1727
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:11,405
Yeah?
Maybe I'll see you there.

1728
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,865
I hope so, amigo.

1729
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,618
I don't want any more
bad blood between exes.

1730
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:16,744
What do you say?

1731
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:17,870
Mmm.

1732
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,205
Okay, laters.

1733
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,290
What a perfect asshole.

1734
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:26,670
Forget what I said earlier.
Finish him.

1735
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:52,321
Password?

1736
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:53,489
Whatever.

1737
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:55,116
Cool.

1738
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:00,871
Second password?

1739
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:04,708
Cool.

1740
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:11,423
We're not having no fun
We're not having no fun

1741
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:14,969
No. The first album is much
better than the first album.

1742
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:17,179
Fun

1743
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:20,516
No fun

1744
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:27,898
Scott! Let it go.

1745
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,109
Don't give him the satisfaction.

1746
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:32,319
What if I want the satisfaction?

1747
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:33,737
Scott Pilgrim!

1748
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,825
Buddy, welcome to the Chaos Theatre.

1749
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:41,704
Somebody get this man a drink.
A Coke Zero, right?

1750
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,961
I'm not here to drink.

1751
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:51,338
Whoa, I've got no beef with you.

1752
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:54,884
What if I have a beef with you?

1753
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:58,053
Are you still mad about the
whole thing with The Guild?

1754
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,471
You mean The League?

1755
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:01,974
The Guild, League, whatever.
It's ancient history.

1756
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,726
I'll show you how
ancient of history it is!

1757
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,060
Wait, wait, wait!

1758
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:08,230
There's no use crying
over spilt Coke, buddy.

1759
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:12,943
The lady made her choice and we're
all just gonna have to move on.

1760
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:14,987
Well, I ain't moving, buddy.

1761
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:19,366
You wanna fight me for her?

1762
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:25,080
Was that not clear?

1763
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:26,248
I don't know.

1764
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:31,503
Now, why on earth would
you want to do that?

1765
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:33,589
Because I'm in love with her.

1766
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,603
Aw! I think this
deserves a song.

1767
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:48,938
Kimberly!

1768
01:32:49,272 --> 01:32:51,190
We are Sex Bob-Omb.

1769
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:54,610
We are here to make money
and sell out and stuff.

1770
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:55,903
One, two, three, four!

1771
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:54,878
Your club sucks,
by the way.

1772
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:59,550
Well, if my cathedral of
cutting-edge taste holds no interest

1773
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:02,428
for your tragically
Canadian sensibilities,

1774
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:07,182
then I shall be forced to grant
you a swift exit from the premises.

1775
01:34:08,435 --> 01:34:11,312
And a fast entrance into hell!

1776
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:13,355
Scott!

1777
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,028
Knives?

1778
01:34:19,112 --> 01:34:20,404
That's priceless.

1779
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,323
You'll pay for what you did to him.

1780
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,450
Listen, Kung Pao Chicken,

1781
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:27,328
your old, old boyfriend
brought this all on himself.

1782
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:30,205
He was warned plenty of times,
but did he listen? No.

1783
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,791
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her!

1784
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:35,127
What?

1785
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,920
You broke the heart that broke mine.

1786
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:39,298
Get ready to Chau down!

1787
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:45,763
You're kidding, right?

1788
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:50,142
Wow!

1789
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:53,354
I mean, you can't say I don't
know how to put on a show, right?

1790
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:54,855
That's incredible.

1791
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,743
What the hell is your deal?

1792
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:11,497
You stole him!

1793
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,166
Stole him!

1794
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,043
I don't know what you're talking about.

1795
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,587
You liar! Liar!

1796
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,257
I didn't steal your boyfriend!
I didn't steal Scott!

1797
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:24,760
I didn't steal anyone!

1798
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:34,937
You steal my boyfriend!

1799
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:36,188
Wait! Wait!

1800
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:39,233
Can we please stop all this fighting?
Nobody stole anybody.

1801
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:42,152
Knives, I dated you and
then I dated Ramona, okay?

1802
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:48,492
Maybe I forgot to tell
Knives right away.

1803
01:35:49,536 --> 01:35:50,994
You cheated on me, Scott?

1804
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,706
You cheated on both of us?

1805
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:56,500
You cheated on me with Knives?

1806
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,168
No,

1807
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:02,005
I cheated on Knives with you.

1808
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:03,590
Is there a difference?

1809
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:05,551
You weren't wronged?

1810
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:08,178
Right?

1811
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:12,182
Game over.

1812
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,313
Scotty,

1813
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:21,817
you can cheat on these
ladies all you like.

1814
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:25,070
But you can't cheat

1815
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:27,448
death.

1816
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,290
Oh, man.

1817
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,544
Sorry.
Dying's got to suck.

1818
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:44,256
You know what sucks?
Getting killed by that guy.

1819
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:47,134
Why him?

1820
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:48,802
It's complicated.

1821
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:51,013
Well, I'm not going anywhere,

1822
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:54,349
so now might be a good
time to get into it.

1823
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:59,563
Truth is, it was me
who was obsessed.

1824
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:04,651
I was crazy about him.
But he ignored me.

1825
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,823
I was more alone when we were
together than I ever was on my own.

1826
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:13,035
That's why I had to leave.

1827
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:16,246
And that's when he
started paying attention.

1828
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:17,956
So, why go back?

1829
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,875
I can't help myself around him, Scott,

1830
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:23,879
he just has this way of
getting into my head.

1831
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:27,049
Well, that's legitimately disappointing.

1832
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,259
I really will leave
you alone forever now.

1833
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,887
No, he literally has a way
of getting into my head.

1834
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:35,390
That is evil.

1835
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:40,270
I didn't mean for you to get
dragged into this, Scott.

1836
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:43,315
I just wanted something simple.

1837
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:46,818
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

1838
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:49,404
Well, I really fought for you.

1839
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:52,407
Maybe I'm not the one you
should have been fighting for.

1840
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:57,246
What? Wait.

1841
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:02,000
But I feel like I learned something.

1842
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:05,587
Which would be great if I wasn't dead.

1843
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,009
So alone.

1844
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,302
You're not alone.

1845
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:16,181
Right!

1846
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,317
Your hair looks stupid.

1847
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:30,988
Second password?

1848
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:35,951
Yeah, I saw it.

1849
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:38,161
It's just the comic book
is better than the movie.

1850
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:39,621
No fun

1851
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:42,040
Scott! Let it go.

1852
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,417
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

1853
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:44,668
Stephen, the new lineup rocks.

1854
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,128
You guys sound way better without me.

1855
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,088
Young Neil,
you have learned well.

1856
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:51,550
From this point forward you
will be known as "Neil."

1857
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,010
And, Kim,

1858
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:56,096
I'm sorry about everything.

1859
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,807
I'm sorry about me.

1860
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:02,352
Scott Pilgrim!
Hey, buddy!

1861
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:05,897
Save it! You're pretentious!
This club sucks!

1862
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:07,482
I've got beef.
Let's do it.

1863
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:09,234
Wait, wait, wait!

1864
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:14,281
You want to fight me for her?

1865
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:15,657
No.

1866
01:39:16,326 --> 01:39:17,701
I want to fight you for me.

1867
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,500
Um... Kim!

1868
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:28,086
We are Sex Bob-Omb and
we are here to watch

1869
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:30,589
Scott Pilgrim kick your teeth in!

1870
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:31,798
One! Two!
Three! Four!

1871
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,404
How's it going back there?

1872
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,866
You dick!

1873
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,160
Knives?

1874
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,787
I know you're in here.
Don't attack...

1875
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:03,580
Scott!

1876
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:07,542
Steal my boyfriend!

1877
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:08,919
Taste my steel!

1878
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:10,962
Enough!

1879
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:12,172
No, Scott.

1880
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:15,133
This fat-ass hurt me and
I will have my revenge!

1881
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:19,054
No, Knives, I hurt you.
I cheated on you.

1882
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:22,724
I cheated on both of you.

1883
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:26,478
I'm really sorry.

1884
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:28,563
And you're not a fat-ass.

1885
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:31,024
She didn't mean that.

1886
01:40:33,403 --> 01:40:34,778
So, are we all good?

1887
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:39,491
Never felt better.

1888
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:40,992
Yoo-hoo!

1889
01:40:42,078 --> 01:40:44,621
Are we done with the
hugging and learning?

1890
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:47,958
I thought we had a fight going on here!

1891
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,584
You've got a fight,
all right!

1892
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:52,421
Wrong move, baby.

1893
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:09,938
Hey.

1894
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:27,330
You made me swallow my gum.

1895
01:41:29,584 --> 01:41:32,627
It's gonna be in my digestive
tract for seven years.

1896
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:19,049
Yeah, still my girl.

1897
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:23,512
Let's both be girls.

1898
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,977
Bad! Bad!

1899
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,115
What?

1900
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,367
Get ready!

1901
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:47,536
Here we go!

1902
01:42:56,712 --> 01:42:59,047
Good! Good! Good!

1903
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:00,757
Combo!

1904
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:06,179
Perfect!

1905
01:43:18,776 --> 01:43:21,903
Who do you think you are, Pilgrim?

1906
01:43:21,988 --> 01:43:24,406
You think you're better than me?

1907
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:27,617
I'll tell you what you are.

1908
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:29,703
A pain in my ass!

1909
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:34,082
You know how long it took

1910
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:36,877
to get all the evil exes'
contact information

1911
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:39,546
so I could form this stupid league?

1912
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:43,216
Like, two hours!
Two hours!

1913
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:47,929
You're not cool enough for Ramona.

1914
01:43:48,306 --> 01:43:50,599
You're zero!
You're nothing!

1915
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:53,101
Me? I'm what's hip.

1916
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:54,603
I'm what's happening!

1917
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:56,605
I'm blowing up right now!

1918
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:58,648
You are blowing up.

1919
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:00,609
Right now!

1920
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:04,446
K-O!

1921
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:16,583
Wow!

1922
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:23,465
Yeah, wow.

1923
01:44:29,889 --> 01:44:31,389
There goes our deal!

1924
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:33,600
We're still getting paid, right?

1925
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:36,061
There goes our deal.

1926
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,688
Oh! Oh, God!

1927
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:50,909
You two make a good combo.

1928
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:53,078
Yeah?

1929
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,080
Yeah.

1930
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:58,333
Scott Pilgrim.

1931
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:04,214
You can defeat me, Scott,

1932
01:45:04,674 --> 01:45:08,218
but can you defeat yourself?

1933
01:45:15,685 --> 01:45:16,851
Nega Scott.

1934
01:45:16,978 --> 01:45:18,520
Nega Scott!

1935
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:23,817
No.

1936
01:45:24,026 --> 01:45:25,944
This is something I have to face.

1937
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:30,323
Myself.

1938
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:34,703
Solo round!

1939
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:39,624
They have this incredible
French toast with bananas on it

1940
01:45:39,709 --> 01:45:40,917
and you get bacon on the side.

1941
01:45:41,002 --> 01:45:42,127
I'm liking that.

1942
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:43,878
Let's do it next week.
Yeah, Tuesday.

1943
01:45:43,963 --> 01:45:45,088
Yeah, all right.
Be good.

1944
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:46,256
Yeah, yeah.

1945
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:47,632
Hey.

1946
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:50,468
What happened?

1947
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:53,471
Nothing, we just shot the shit.
He's just a really nice guy.

1948
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,265
We're gonna get brunch next week.

1949
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,142
We actually have a lot in common.

1950
01:45:57,226 --> 01:46:00,228
Your hair,
it's getting really shaggy.

1951
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:02,522
It is?
Yeah.

1952
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:06,234
You should probably get it cut.

1953
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,528
Yeah, you're right.

1954
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:09,988
I should get it cut.

1955
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,573
At a salon.

1956
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:13,992
Salon, yeah.
That sounds really nice.

1957
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,493
Hey.

1958
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:18,038
You're going?

1959
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:20,540
I should probably disappear.

1960
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,333
After all that?

1961
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:25,086
I still need a new life.

1962
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:29,424
I came here to escape,
but the past keeps catching up.

1963
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:32,510
I'm tired of people
getting hurt because of me.

1964
01:46:32,595 --> 01:46:34,929
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get over it.

1965
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:37,599
I don't mean just you.

1966
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:42,145
I understand.

1967
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:45,732
I should thank you, though.

1968
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:47,233
For what?

1969
01:46:49,361 --> 01:46:52,322
For being the nicest guy I ever dated.

1970
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:56,117
That's kind of sad.

1971
01:46:58,662 --> 01:47:00,455
It is kind of sad.

1972
01:47:03,793 --> 01:47:05,293
Bye, and stuff.

1973
01:47:06,504 --> 01:47:09,923
Yeah. And stuff.

1974
01:47:15,304 --> 01:47:17,222
Go, get her.

1975
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,599
What?

1976
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:22,435
You've been fighting for her all along.

1977
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:26,147
But what about you?

1978
01:47:26,982 --> 01:47:28,775
I'll be fine.

1979
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:35,448
I'm too cool for you anyway.

1980
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:41,162
Ciao, Knives.

1981
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,081
Go.

1982
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:49,963
Hey.

1983
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:52,423
Hey, mind if I tag along?

1984
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,469
You want to come with me?

1985
01:47:56,846 --> 01:48:00,974
Yeah, I thought maybe
we could try again.

1986
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:29,711
Continue?
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1987
01:48:29,795 --> 01:48:34,257
five, four, three, two, one.

1988
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,082
