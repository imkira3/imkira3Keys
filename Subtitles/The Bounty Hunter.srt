1
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,126
Nic?

2
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,757
Nicole!

3
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:53,224
Holy shit.

4
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:15,711
Did you really think I was gonna stay
in there the whole time?

5
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,724
Come back here.

6
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:22,185
- Bingo.
- Jackpot.

7
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,849
Hey, Sam!

8
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,090
- Hey!
- Yeah, you, you ding-dong.

9
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,159
- Come here.
- Surprise.

10
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:32,827
- Not now, Dwight. I'm kind of busy.
- You owe my boss money.

11
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,830
Hey, I owe everybody money.

12
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,400
Hey!

13
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,339
Hey!

14
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,603
You hit my leg, you dummy.

15
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,303
You really gonna
make me chase you?

16
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,091
Excuse me.

17
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,390
Get back here!

18
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,132
Hands behind your head. Now.

19
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:48,797
Take it easy, skippy.

20
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,603
I'm on the job.

21
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,313
Oh, wow, look at this. Bounty hunter.

22
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:00,080
Figures. Why don't you get
a real job?

23
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,084
Why don't you kiss my ass?

24
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,084
Come here.

25
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,195
Oh, your mother
must be very, very proud.

26
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:13,093
Oh, I'm so insulted.
You know, for your information...

27
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,826
...I don't even know who my mother is.
So joke's on you.

28
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,766
- Turn around. Hands behind your back.
- What?

29
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,830
You heard me. Let's go.

30
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,601
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

31
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:37,152
- Hey, Gary. You get my e-mail?
- About the suicide, yeah?

32
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:40,191
He's got a sister in Atlantic City.
Address is on your desk.

33
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,987
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

34
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,360
Day or night.

35
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,168
Very funny.

36
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,248
Who's Mr. Ed?

37
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,485
I actually think it's sexy
that you're out on bail.

38
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:10,387
- Stewart, get off my desk.
- Right. Oh, sorry. l forgot.

39
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:13,492
Ridiculous that I was even arrested
in the first place.

40
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,686
I mean, assaulting an officer?
It's a joke.

41
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:20,060
Yeah. Oh, tell me about it.
Been there.

42
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,997
Did you ever get anything going
on that suicide story?

43
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,833
- No.
- Because know what I was thinking?

44
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:30,408
Maybe we should work together on it,
as a team.

45
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:32,943
You know?
Woodward-Bernstein style. Yeah.

46
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,843
That way, you can knock it out
just that much faster.

47
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:39,713
Plus, it would give us time
to reconnect in our relationship.

48
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:42,719
Stewart, we are not in a relationship.

49
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,517
We made out one time
at the Christmas party.

50
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:49,928
I was very drunk.
And l was heartbroken.

51
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,586
I would've made out with Terry.

52
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:56,097
Wait, you mean Terry the guy
or Terry the girl?

53
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,203
Exactly.
Really wouldn't have mattered.

54
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,396
You're right.
Because you made out with me.

55
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:04,100
Yes, I did.
All right, l'm gonna use the bathroom.

56
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:10,940
- This is Jimmy.
- <i>Jimmy, Nicole from the</i> Daily News.

57
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:12,641
Nicole?

58
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,887
Long time no talk.
Where you been hiding yourself?

59
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,115
I'm actually hiding
in the bathroom at work.

60
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,318
Listen, I need you to ask around
about a suicide.

61
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,260
A Walter Lilly, Rivington Street...

62
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,957
...the night of June 23rd.

63
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,762
Twenty-three. Anything else?

64
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:34,634
Yes. Yes. I have proof
that there was a black SUV...

65
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:37,140
...with stolen plates
parked at the scene.

66
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,005
Might be something.
You never know.

67
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,909
All right. Cool.
I hear anything, l'll give you a shout.

68
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,913
Okay, great. Thanks.

69
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,808
Who you talking to?

70
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:48,247
Stewart.

71
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,251
What are you doing
in the ladies room?

72
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:53,824
You see, I wa...

73
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:58,461
I... Well, you know, I was standing
out front there, by the door.

74
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:01,498
- But I started to feel creepy.
- And this is less creepy?

75
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:02,992
Yeah, I think so.

76
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:04,693
- Get out of here.
- Oh, come on.

77
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,270
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

78
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,430
- I have a date.
- I didn't say what night.

79
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,098
Then I have a date every night.

80
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,107
Every night until the end of time.

81
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:15,111
Okay? So just please
stop asking me.

82
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,387
Love is so funny. Isn't it?

83
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:43,073
- Hi, Ma.
- <i>Is this a bad time?</i>

84
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:47,009
Well, yeah, I'm actually
kind of in the middle of something.

85
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,671
But you know what,
while I have you on the phone....

86
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,840
If you were gonna
jump off a building...

87
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,714
...would you choose the side
with trees?

88
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:58,187
Or would you choose the side
that's a straight shot to the cement?

89
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:01,327
Well, the trees would certainly be
prettier on the way down.

90
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,325
Kind of a nice last picture.

91
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:06,192
It might break your fall.
You could end up a vegetable.

92
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:09,358
- I don't think l could take that on.
- So the cement?

93
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,265
Definitely. Why do you ask?

94
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:14,167
I'm on a rooftop at 6th and Rivington.
I was wondering...

95
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,864
Now, you listen here, young lady.

96
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,340
- You have every right to hate your life.
- Mom.

97
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:20,945
Who wouldn't after some
of the choices you've made.

98
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:22,614
- <i>Mom?</i>
- That thing with Milo...

99
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:23,942
- Mom.
- <i>What?</i>

100
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,174
I'm working.

101
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,214
<i>I'm gonna call you later.</i>

102
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,549
Well, okay.
Well, just to clarify, you know...

103
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:34,557
...we all make mistakes, but you
married a man who made you crazy...

104
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,390
<i>...and divorced him for the same</i>
<i>reason. You just have to</i>--

105
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,097
I'll take the big ugly one.

106
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:54,573
I do not like getting
these phone calls.

107
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:58,216
I'd bail you out
if you ever got in trouble.

108
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:00,750
But you can't,
because you ain't no cop anymore.

109
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,548
And what do you mean,
"these calls," huh?

110
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,748
That's the second time
you bailed me out.

111
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,825
"These" implies way more than two.

112
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:11,555
Look, I know that this is a very tough
time of the year for you.

113
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,894
What are you talking about? It's
summer. Who doesn't love summer?

114
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:17,901
And I am trying to be sensitive
to your situation.

115
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:23,398
What, a guy who works his own hours?
Has his freedom? Lives the high life?

116
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,811
Have you talked to her?

117
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,718
- Talked to who?
- Katie Couric. Who do you think?

118
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,420
- Why the hell would l talk to her?
- You know what?

119
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,787
- Maybe I should've left your ass in jail.
- Would you relax? I'm fine.

120
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,363
Oh, you're... No. You are not fine,
okay? You are a man in pain.

121
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:48,864
How do you think that makes me feel
since I'm the one who set you up?

122
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:52,095
Well, I guess that makes
this whole thing your fault, huh?

123
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,137
Hey. Where are you?

124
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:58,743
I told you to be here
half an hour early.

125
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:00,370
Now I see you.

126
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:03,037
I'm still leaving you this message
to let you know...

127
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:07,379
...that I hate being your lawyer
and you're killing me. Goodbye.

128
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:10,351
- Hello. You're late.
- But only fashionably.

129
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:13,788
Better take this seriously, Miss Hurley.
It's you against the N.Y.P.D.

130
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,827
How can l take this seriously, Arthur?
It's a fender bender.

131
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:20,159
- Well, we got four minutes.
- Oh, wait, hold on. l gotta take this.

132
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,301
No. Four minutes.

133
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,631
This will take one,
and then we'll have three.

134
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:28,497
- Hello.
- It's Jimmy. I got something for you.

135
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:33,502
Oh, hi. Great. Listen,
I need to call you back in an hour.

136
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,843
Can't wait, Nicole. I might already
be in trouble with this shit.

137
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:41,248
Wha...? Jimmy, well, I'm kind of in
some hot water myself over here.

138
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:45,517
Dunkin' Donuts, Sunset Park
under the BQE. Half an hour.

139
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:49,685
Bring cash. Five hundred,
or I'm selling it to somebody else.

140
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,762
- No, Jimmy. Wait...
- Okay. Let's go.

141
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,990
Wait. I have to make
one more phone call.

142
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,259
- Nicole.
- Just go on in.

143
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,835
I will... I promise,
I will be right behind you.

144
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:01,997
When the judge calls your case,
you better be sitting right next to me.

145
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,608
And your client is where?

146
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:07,779
Well, she was here, Your Honor.

147
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,915
And I think
she deserves points for that.

148
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:13,110
I'm sure she'll be coming
through that door any second.

149
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:19,923
Any second.

150
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,221
Rather than keep the court waiting,
if we could set another date.

151
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,728
Counsel, your client's bail
is revoked.

152
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:29,095
A bench warrant is hereby ordered
by this court.

153
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:30,737
Next case.

154
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:50,213
- Come here.
- Okay. All right. Okay.

155
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,119
Get in the car.

156
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,883
And don't move.

157
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:13,470
Goddamn it. I mean,
how many retainers do I have to buy?

158
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:16,114
- They're twins, for God's sake.
- It's not my fault.

159
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:19,683
Tell him to borrow
his brother's. Man.

160
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:43,436
Hey, princess.
You're drooling on my sofa.

161
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:48,542
You do have an apartment, don't you?
With a bed of some kind?

162
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:53,111
Teresa should be in any second.

163
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:58,955
- I suppose you wanna get paid.
- Yep. Well, I got him, didn't I?

164
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:02,559
I said, "They're my kids. If anyone's
gonna take them camping...

165
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,720
...I am," which she took literally,
as opposed to the spirit...

166
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,400
- ...in which it was said.
- The spirit of bullshit?

167
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:11,366
- Any plans for the long weekend?
- The usual.

168
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:15,337
What, getting drunk on cheap whiskey
and smashing your fist through a wall?

169
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:16,532
Jealous?

170
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,075
No, I understand.
Fourth of July and all.

171
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:21,213
Don't worry. I'll get somebody else.

172
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:24,539
- Somebody else for what?
- An open bond just came in.

173
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:27,747
But you know what?
Your thing sounds a lot more fun.

174
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:30,514
Don't worry about it.
I mean, I'll find somebody else.

175
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,649
Whoa, hold up, Heidi. I need this gig.
Come on, man, I'm in the hole.

176
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:37,728
- You're always in the hole.
- What's your point?

177
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:40,991
My point is I don't know
if you're the right person for the job.

178
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,998
This thing could be a disaster.

179
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:45,668
But you asked for it.

180
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,703
- Is this a joke?
- Nope.

181
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,413
She got arrested?

182
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,383
I don't understand it myself,
but all I know is that she skipped bail.

183
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,855
Well, why the hell did you post it?

184
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:07,356
Hey, I'm a businessman.
I don't have time to wait for you.

185
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,018
All I know is, is that I'm out 50,000...

186
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,130
...if she's not
in that courtroom Monday.

187
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:15,756
You're telling me
that I'll get 5 grand...

188
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:18,802
...to go pick up my ex-wife
and bring her to jail.

189
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,772
You're a good listener.

190
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,077
- Yes. Yes.
- I take it you're interested?

191
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:31,106
- Am I interested?
- Oh, God. Okay.

192
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,548
- You are the best friend...
- All right. Okay.

193
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:36,711
- ...any guy could ever have.
- Milo. Check.

194
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:47,293
Okay. Can I have my gum back?

195
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:54,003
You know what this is?
This, baby, is karma.

196
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:57,267
- Are you sure you can handle this?
- Why wouldn't I?

197
00:14:57,443 --> 00:15:00,139
Because it's her, and around her
you're not rational.

198
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,476
Sweetheart,
I won't even break a sweat.

199
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:39,981
Oh, shit.

200
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,434
Hello, love.

201
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,433
Oh, Jesus.

202
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,539
Oh, God. Kitty?

203
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,077
I was in the neighborhood...

204
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:18,478
...and I had lent her
some paintbrushes months ago.

205
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:21,084
And she just refuses to...
Okay, okay, okay.

206
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,914
She didn't show up to court today.

207
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,752
And I think it's because she has a lead
on some story.

208
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:31,090
And I wanna work on it with her
as a team because l....

209
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:34,789
Because I'm kind of hoping
it would help solidify...

210
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,798
...our thing.

211
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,501
Are you sleeping with her, Stewart?

212
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:47,306
- We have a history.
- A history, huh?

213
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,748
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

214
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,350
Don't be such a wuss.
Come on, I'm sorry.

215
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,510
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.

216
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,985
- You're not Jimmy.
- Oh, God. No, I'm not.

217
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:01,092
- But I'm looking for him.
- Under the chair?

218
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,990
- Maybe you could help me.
- I can't fit under there.

219
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,596
- No...
- Who are you?

220
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:10,099
- I'm... I'm his girlfriend.
- You're Lakeisha?

221
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,696
Yeah, that would be me. Lakeisha.

222
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:17,639
Named after my Aunt Lakeisha.

223
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,211
- Well, maybe I should call the cops.
- No, no, no. Jimmy's in trouble.

224
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,009
What kind of trouble?
Money trouble? Drug trouble?

225
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:27,982
- I don't...
- Sex-change trouble?

226
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:31,887
I don't really know.
I just know that he's missing.

227
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,719
Yeah, well, I had a lousy week too.

228
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,056
My cousin Linda
fell off the cruise ship.

229
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,823
I'm so sorry.

230
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,764
Well, a grown woman
ought to know how to swim.

231
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,839
Yes, I hear you.

232
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,999
Now would you mind
if I just took a quick look around...

233
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:54,169
...just to see if I can find some clue
as to where he might be?

234
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:58,146
Thing is, Stew, she'll make you think
she's interested in you.

235
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:02,047
But really she's only interested
in her big hotshot career.

236
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,155
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,083
Wait a minute. Wait, you're Milo.

238
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:11,354
You're Milo, right?
She talks about you all the time.

239
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:16,358
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, man, absolutely.

240
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:17,559
Yeah, she hates you.

241
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,938
Wait, what do you mean?
She hates me?

242
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:24,371
Oh, yeah. Big time. Yeah.

243
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:29,412
She says... She says you're, like,
the most selfish, immature...

244
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:31,846
- Wait, I'm selfish?
- Yeah. Stubborn.

245
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:34,451
- I'm immature?
- I don't know. That's what she says.

246
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,417
You know what? Forget it. Okay?

247
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm not even gonna
dignify that with... Whatever.

248
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,692
Oh, yeah.
Hey, look, I'm on your team, man.

249
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:45,422
No, you're not, Geraldo.
I don't allow reporters on my team.

250
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:48,624
Oh, and for the record,
I'm the one who hates her.

251
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,894
Okay? So just shut up
and stop pissing me off.

252
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,966
Okay. Sorry.

253
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:03,111
<i>Borgata Hotel, Atlantic City.</i>
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

254
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,280
Figures. Run home to Mommy.

255
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,765
What audit?

256
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:27,101
<i>Jimmy? You mean the bartender</i>
<i>from O'Doul's?</i>

257
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:31,266
I'm really worried about him. His car
was there. His window was smashed.

258
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,308
There was something not right.

259
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:38,112
What was he looking into?

260
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:40,582
<i>That suicide on Rivington</i>
<i>a couple of weeks ago.</i>

261
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,986
<i>Something about it</i>
<i>just does not add up.</i>

262
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:47,148
- Why? What do you got?
- <i>I was at traffic court the other day...</i>

263
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:51,160
...and I met this guy who swears
that his car was parked at JFK...

264
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,322
...the night that he got a ticket
on Rivington.

265
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,264
- Stolen plates.
- Yeah, well, that's what I'm thinking.

266
00:20:57,436 --> 00:21:01,133
Look, if I hear anything on the kid
I'll let you know, but you...

267
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:04,333
- ...be careful, okay?
- Okay, great. Bobby, thanks.

268
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:40,139
More pink, Tony.
Way the hell more pink.

269
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:43,577
I wanna sparkle
with the illusion of youth.

270
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:46,148
And in a room this small,
hell, forget lighting.

271
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,309
We might have to use nerve gas.

272
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:51,513
Hello, Kitty.

273
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,181
Milo?

274
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,754
Milo, sweetheart.

275
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:02,331
Come and give your mother-in-law
a hug.

276
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:03,695
A long time.

277
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,562
That's for being a shit
and for ruining my daughter's life.

278
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:11,873
- Your daughter's fine.
- Well, then that's for ruining my life.

279
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:14,073
Come here.

280
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:17,739
It still kills me,
you and Nicole splitting up.

281
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,350
What happened between you
devastated her.

282
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,683
- Yeah, devastated her right to the top.
- She has done well, hasn't she?

283
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:29,554
Listen, Nicky may be a strong,
independent woman on the outside...

284
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:33,926
...but on the inside, she's just a girl
wanting to be loved by her man.

285
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,932
l mean, come on.
Such a beautiful couple...

286
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:39,229
...and you threw it away.

287
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,929
The grandchildren
would have been angels.

288
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:45,201
Not that l wanted grandchildren.
You prick.

289
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:47,640
I've missed you, Kitty.

290
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,438
I'm gonna pretend l believe you.

291
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,512
l'm looking for your girl.

292
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,279
- I know she called here.
- We were gonna grab a bite.

293
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:58,150
She blew me off
for some interview.

294
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:01,588
Said she needed to go somewhere
to suck up some luck.

295
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,661
Like I'm supposed to know
what that means.

296
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,187
- Hello.
- Listen, you're in trouble.

297
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:42,800
- Now, where are you?
- I'm in the city, actually.

298
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,798
No, you're not. No, you're not.
You're here. You're at the track.

299
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:51,636
You're here?
How did you know where I was?

300
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,209
Hello, Nic.

301
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,778
<i>Let's just say</i>
<i>Stewart knows what he's doing...</i>

302
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:59,611
<i>...when it comes to following people.</i>

303
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:02,119
Hi, Milo.

304
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:05,623
Fancy meeting you here.

305
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:08,591
Yeah.

306
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:11,830
Fancy. Fancy that.

307
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,661
How are you?

308
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,465
Good. You?

309
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:19,798
Swell.

310
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,131
Beautiful day.

311
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:31,742
You look great.

312
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:34,749
As beautiful as the day we first met.

313
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:39,753
This has been grand.

314
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:43,156
I don't know what you're up to,
but l'm working.

315
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:44,693
Oh, working?

316
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:46,023
Me too.

317
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,997
I heard you got kicked off the force.

318
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:50,635
You been checking up on me?

319
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:53,001
- Nope.
- Concerned about me?

320
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:56,072
I haven't given you
a thought, actually.

321
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,703
Trying to keep some small connection
alive between us.

322
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,714
Are you gonna move this leg?

323
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:07,708
No.

324
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,122
I thought we'd be adults the first time
we saw each other after the divorce.

325
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:16,523
But why would l think that when
only one of us is actually an adult?

326
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:21,291
Like I said, I've been working.
And what I do is l hunt down criminals.

327
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:24,230
Idiots who jump bail, specifically.

328
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,734
- You are a bounty hunter?
- Yep.

329
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:31,307
And much as it pains me to say this,
and it really does...

330
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:33,467
...I gotta take you to jail.

331
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:42,953
Oh, God. All right.
Come on, who put you up to this?

332
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,988
- Somebody at the paper?
- No, just the old State of New York.

333
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:48,591
- Are you...? Don't you touch me.
- Shall we?

334
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,785
You really think
you're taking me anywhere?

335
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,261
No, not anywhere. Just jail.

336
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:55,900
Oh, goddamn it, Milo.
You don't seem to understand.

337
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:58,764
I am in the middle of something
really important.

338
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,167
Tell you what.
You wanna make a break for it...

339
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,774
...I will give you
a 1 0-second head start.

340
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:07,571
- I am an adult, Milo. I'm--
- Ten.

341
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:09,611
- Nine. Eight.
- Do you really think I...?

342
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:11,812
Seven.

343
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:15,320
Six.

344
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,318
Five. Four.

345
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,955
Three. Two.

346
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:23,951
One.

347
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,998
Try again.

348
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:51,182
- God.
- Extra salt, just the way you like it.

349
00:26:54,693 --> 00:26:57,526
- Jesus. Stewart, no.
- I wanna help. Let me help. Please.

350
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,494
Why'd you hang up on me?

351
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:05,292
Taxi.

352
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:10,636
Oh, shit.

353
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:13,736
- Get in the car.
- I am not going to jail.

354
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:15,880
Oh, I beg to differ.

355
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:22,549
- Oh, what, you're gonna shoot me?
- Nope.

356
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:26,987
- I'm gonna shoot a cab driver.
- No, he's kidd... He doesn't mean it.

357
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,854
No, I mean it.

358
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,526
Chickenshits!

359
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:35,727
All right.
Can we just talk about this?

360
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,526
Fine.

361
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:40,396
What do you wanna say?

362
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:49,110
I'm not letting you take me to jail.

363
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:51,676
- Duly noted.
- And I'm...

364
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:56,211
Milo. Oh, my...
You have got to be kidding me.

365
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,913
You have got to be kidding me.
Don't you--

366
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:02,288
Milo, stop it.
Seriously, put me down.

367
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:03,689
Milo, goddamn it.

368
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:09,227
You cannot be putting me in a trunk.
You cannot be seri...

369
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:11,892
I'm dead "seri."

370
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:15,904
Hey, Mi... Hey!

371
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:19,737
Oh, my God. I'm gonna have
a panic attack. Oh, my God. Milo!

372
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:22,880
Milo. Goddamn it!
Open this trunk, Milo.

373
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,811
Right now. Milo.

374
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:27,611
Okay. Okay.

375
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:33,720
Yeah, I've got
a couple of small tats myself.

376
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:38,153
But I'm still amazed at the level of pain
people will go through...

377
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:41,298
...to make an impression.
Do you know what l mean?

378
00:28:42,434 --> 00:28:44,664
I was just asking around.

379
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,964
Okay? l swear to God,
I don't know anything.

380
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,439
What if I tattoo the word "snitch"
on your eyelids?

381
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,944
- Or better yet, "dead snitch."
- Look, okay, look. Look.

382
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:58,981
All I know
is there's this reporter, okay?

383
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:03,679
And she said something about
a car with stolen plates at a suicide.

384
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,255
What's her name?

385
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,929
Sid's Bail Bonds.

386
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:15,430
<i>Guess what I've got in my trunk.</i>

387
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,535
Is that some sort
of perverted innuendo? Who is this?

388
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:21,263
Oh, come on, Teresa, it's me.
You know it's me.

389
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,603
- Hey, I need to talk to Sid.
- Yeah, Sid's not available right now.

390
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:28,644
Last I heard, he was trying to start
a fire with two sticks and pure rage.

391
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:31,715
Just tell him that I got her,
all right? I'm bringing her in.

392
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,876
I'll be back in two hours, and I want
a bonus for bringing her in so quick.

393
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:40,115
Well, I want a bonus for getting through
the week without stabbing somebody.

394
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,151
Week's not over yet.

395
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:45,454
I got another call.

396
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,656
Yeah, I gotta go too.
Very busy. Bye-bye.

397
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:53,626
This is Milo. I'm sorry, but I'm not in
at the moment to take your call.

398
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:57,571
Milo, get me out of the trunk. Please.

399
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:02,874
Nope. Oh, by the way, your boyfriend
Stewart's been following me.

400
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:07,074
- He is not my boyfriend.
- Well, he seems to think he is.

401
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:10,312
Well, I remember a time
I thought you were quite the catch...

402
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,856
- ...and that didn't pan out, either.
- He doesn't really seem your type.

403
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:18,018
Listen. Okay, Milo, please. Please.

404
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:20,892
I shouldn't have run. That was...

405
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,590
Look, you caught me off-guard.

406
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:26,259
To tell you the truth, l think l really
need your advice about something.

407
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:27,529
That's a real shame...

408
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:31,437
...because I wouldn't help you
if you were the last baby sea turtle...

409
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,444
...dragging your tiny little body
across the burning sand...

410
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:38,378
...whilst hungry seagulls
circled overhead.

411
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,018
Nope, I'd just pull up a chair...

412
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:45,350
...sip a <i>piña colada,</i>
and watch nature take its course.

413
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:51,925
- Hello?
- You stop.

414
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:53,530
<i>Hello?</i>

415
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,360
Nic?

416
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,194
Nicole?

417
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:00,730
What?

418
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,609
Hey, remember
how we used to be in love?

419
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:07,773
Yeah.

420
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:10,540
Well, that means l know
when you're crying for real...

421
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:15,118
...and when you're faking it. Bye-bye.

422
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,753
What?

423
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:18,480
God, Milo!

424
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:21,490
- Do you hear the tone of my voice?
- Oh, God. So good.

425
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,326
Milo! Oh, shoot. Milo? Milo?

426
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:30,926
Hello, Nicole Hurley.

427
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:32,626
<i>Hey, hey, it's me. Jimmy.</i>

428
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:34,931
Jimmy. Oh, my God.

429
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:37,131
Oh, my God, Jimmy,
I thought you were dead.

430
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,609
Where are you?
I've left you like 40 messages.

431
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,647
Yeah, sorry. My phone ran out.

432
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:46,147
Listen, about this story...

433
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:48,252
Jimmy. What happened
at Dunkin' Donuts?

434
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,012
Oh, nothing.

435
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:53,680
My friend showed up, and he
needed my help with something.

436
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:55,849
Was that before
he busted your window?

437
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:58,621
I locked my keys in--
Whatever. It's a piece of shit.

438
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:02,164
Listen, hey, where are you?
You sound like you're in a closet.

439
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:06,501
I'm... I'm in Atlantic City.

440
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:11,199
Listen, Jimmy, I went to your apartment,
and I found the coaster.

441
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:14,641
<i>Has there been evidence stolen</i>
<i>from the depository?</i>

442
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:17,441
Well, that's kind of why l'm calling.

443
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:20,608
The whole thing turned out
to be nothing but a waste of time...

444
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:24,152
- ...for everybody involved.
- Who else is involved, Jimmy?

445
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:26,848
Very good.

446
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:29,220
Jimmy... Jimmy?

447
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:32,020
Listen, I need a favor.

448
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,862
Nicole Hurley, 134 Perry Street.

449
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:37,797
Credit check
and her recent activity, okay?

450
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:40,529
Beautiful. Thanks.

451
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:52,543
Nic?

452
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,709
- What the hell happened to you?
- Milo Boyd. Asshole head-butted me.

453
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:28,148
If only I gave a shit.

454
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,285
Did you get my money?

455
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:33,513
Ray!

456
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:37,020
Milo Boyd. Ex-cop.

457
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:39,288
Fired last year for neglect of duty.

458
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,365
His current gambling debt
is just over 11 grand.

459
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:45,765
We haven't seen a penny
in two months.

460
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:47,798
This is not good.

461
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:51,908
We let this bum slide, people gonna
start thinking lrene's gone soft...

462
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,738
...they don't have to pay up.

463
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:57,146
Get him in here, Dwight,
break some part of his person...

464
00:33:57,315 --> 00:34:00,409
...I'll get my money, and we'll have
a nice holiday weekend.

465
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,643
Swear to God.

466
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:04,254
Unbelievable.

467
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:06,284
How did you find me?

468
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:11,418
Well, I knew you called your mother,
so I went to see her.

469
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:15,088
You went to see my mother?
She didn't know l was there.

470
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:18,064
Yeah, she said you went to
"suck up some luck."

471
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:21,103
And I remembered your dad
had some crazy theory...

472
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:26,141
...about how all the losing at the track
must leave this extra luck lying around.

473
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:29,508
I knew you'd be in section D
because D is your lucky letter.

474
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:32,012
I mean, who has a lucky letter?

475
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:36,583
I had no idea
you knew all that stuff about me.

476
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:38,587
Of course. We were married.

477
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:44,660
But honestly, I love being single.
I love everything about my life.

478
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,262
Great job...

479
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:47,455
...good friends...

480
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,429
...hot girlfriend.

481
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,432
- Girlfriend?
- Oh, you didn't know?

482
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:57,041
Oh, yeah, I've had a number of casual,
crazy, sex-filled relationships...

483
00:34:57,242 --> 00:35:00,643
...since you and l crapped out.
But I think this lady might be the one.

484
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,808
What's her name?

485
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:08,750
Teresa.

486
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:13,149
Smoking hot body.
Yeah. Great cook.

487
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,789
Smart. Very, very smart.

488
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,258
- Smart for a stripper.
- She's not a stripper.

489
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,826
Well, then, what does Teresa do?

490
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:23,328
- Judge.
- What?

491
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:25,962
Circuit court of appeals judge.

492
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:28,901
Oh, bullshit. Bullshit.

493
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:33,533
No, I'm not bullshitting.
She really is a judge.

494
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:37,804
Actually, just like the one
you skipped out on.

495
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:43,178
It's funny,
the little coincidences in life.

496
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:56,558
All right, that's it. I'm done.

497
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:59,999
I give up. I give up.
Just... I don't wanna play anymore.

498
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,433
Here. Take it.

499
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:05,070
- What's that?
- Five hundred dollars.

500
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:07,734
Take it and dump me anywhere
on the side of the road.

501
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:08,936
Here. I don't care.

502
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:12,947
Honey, I'm getting 5 grand just to
bring your ass to justice. Do the math.

503
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:16,018
- No. You do it.
- No.

504
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:17,415
The Milo Boyd that I knew?

505
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:20,717
He could take $500,
walk into any casino...

506
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:23,918
...turn it into $5000 like that.

507
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:27,087
- He could turn it into $ 10,000.
- Yeah, try 50.

508
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,631
I don't know. I wouldn't go that far.

509
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:34,405
- Why not?
- I don't know. You think you still got it?

510
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:36,540
Hell, yeah, I still got it.

511
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:42,535
You know,
this isn't about the money.

512
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:46,605
No, this is about me doing my job.

513
00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:58,622
All right. Now, listen.
- you win, you let me go.

514
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,593
That's our deal. Right?

515
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:02,665
You get what you want,
and I get to go...

516
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:07,895
Don't tell me your story.
How could I forget? Come on.

517
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:17,142
Yeah, I found you.
God, Stewart, you are a huge stud.

518
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:21,012
Dwight, be honest. Apart from chasing
some guy down, breaking his legs...

519
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:25,281
...beating his face to a bloody pulp,
you don't get a lot of aerobic exercise.

520
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:28,323
- Why we talking about this?
- You're gonna get me killed...

521
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:31,485
...when you're too slow to react
in a life-and-death situation.

522
00:37:31,663 --> 00:37:33,290
I am not too slow.

523
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,696
It's lrene.

524
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:39,429
- Yeah?
- <i>They spotted Boyd at the Taj.</i>

525
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:42,198
- <i>He's driving a blue Delta 88.</i>
- I'm on it.

526
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:44,170
Okay, listen, there's this kid.

527
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:47,505
He works at O'Doul's.
He gives me information sometimes.

528
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,647
- You mean he's a snitch.
- Yes.

529
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:51,441
I think he's in a lot of trouble.

530
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:55,108
I had him ask about this suicide,
this guy that dove off of a roof.

531
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:56,446
Shows me what you know.

532
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:59,419
- What?
- Suicides don't dive. They go feet-first.

533
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:02,322
Is that true? How do you know that?

534
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,222
Every cop knows that.

535
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:08,388
Well, if every cop
knows that a suicide goes feet-first...

536
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:13,003
...and this guy went headfirst, then
why would a cop rule it as a suicide?

537
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,900
- How the hell should I know?
- Well...

538
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,940
Why don't you ask the cop
that filled out the report?

539
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:28,843
Nicole.

540
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:32,179
Nicole, it's Stewart.
I'm here to save you.

541
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:36,750
Oh, my God. She's passed out.

542
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:39,691
All right, hero time. Let's go, buddy.

543
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:43,022
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

544
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,930
Okay, here you go. I got you.

545
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:48,402
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

546
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:50,831
Hey.

547
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,934
It's a Delta 88.

548
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,272
- Yeah.
- It's a nice car.

549
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,539
Oh, thank you. Yeah, no, this is....

550
00:38:57,715 --> 00:38:59,740
This is my car,
in case you were wondering.

551
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,548
Yeah.

552
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:05,280
It was once used in
a lce Cube video.

553
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,889
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

554
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:09,288
Yeah. You a big fan of cars?

555
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:13,990
What I love about it is that it actually...
The steering wheel...

556
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:19,292
Five hundred on the pass line.

557
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:21,631
New shooter.
Five hundred on the line.

558
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:24,707
Wait a minute. You're betting all of it?
What if you lose?

559
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,707
Then we're back in the car.

560
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,812
So if I lose, I still win.

561
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:32,446
- Here. Blow on them.
- No.

562
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:35,215
- You always did before.
- Oh, come on.

563
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:38,753
You want me to win, don't you?
If I win, you go free, remember?

564
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:42,119
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go, shooter. Coming out.

565
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,422
Here we go.

566
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,602
- Winner. Seven.
- Seven. Big winner.

567
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:58,633
Winner. Eleven.

568
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,608
- Yes. Eleven.
- Front-line winner.

569
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,248
Winner, seven.

570
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,187
Seven.

571
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:20,630
Winner, eleven.

572
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,698
Count it out nice and slow.

573
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,598
Eight grand. It's so beautiful.

574
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,705
You did it.
I said you could and you did.

575
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:30,534
I'm out of here. You win, l walk.

576
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,699
What? Wait.
What are you talking about?

577
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:34,538
- Where you going?
- Are you kidding?

578
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:36,270
We had a deal.

579
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:38,506
You win 5 and I get to walk.

580
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:39,877
No, you said 10.

581
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:42,786
I said 5, Milo.

582
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:47,186
In the car, you said I could turn 500
into 10,000.

583
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:49,690
- Yes. But first I had said...
- No "buts."

584
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:52,159
Come on. Why would I try
and win 5 thousand...

585
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,628
...when l get 5 thousand
for turning you in?

586
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:57,290
- Doesn't make sense.
- You know what does make sense?

587
00:40:57,468 --> 00:41:03,168
- I'm leaving. That's it. I'm out of here.
- Hey, no. You will stay here...

588
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:06,640
...until I win 10 grand
and then you walk. Okay?

589
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:08,836
You have my word. Now blow.

590
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:10,844
Your word is worth shit.

591
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,346
Let's go, shooter.

592
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:19,685
You know what? Fine. I can
do this myself. It's all me, anyway.

593
00:41:19,857 --> 00:41:22,189
Watch. Milo Boyd
makes his own luck.

594
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:23,751
Yeah, here we go.

595
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:27,931
Four. Easy. The point is four.

596
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:29,497
Okay, four. It's okay.

597
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:34,229
No worries. I can do four.
That's two twos...

598
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:37,863
- ...a three and a one.
- Yeah. Or a four and a zero.

599
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,134
Shut up.

600
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:41,212
Of course you're to blame.
A four and a zero?

601
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:43,407
Of course you're to blame.
A four and a zero?

602
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:45,674
- God.
- You mocked the gods of craps.

603
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,943
"The gods of craps"?
Do you hear yourself?

604
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:52,521
No. All I hear is the sound of $8000
in chips being swept away from me.

605
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,022
Milo. Milo, you have got to let me go.

606
00:41:55,193 --> 00:41:58,060
No, I don't have to do anything
except win my money back...

607
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:01,460
...which I will do
as soon as I can find the damn room.

608
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:15,545
This place is nice.

609
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:17,772
Yeah. Glad you like it.

610
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:19,211
Because you paid for it.

611
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,817
- I...? Me?
- Yeah. I lifted your credit card.

612
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:24,819
Pretty shitty thing to do.
I feel better now that you know.

613
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:29,153
- You stole my credit card?
- See, that's what you always do.

614
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:32,057
You know, I borrow your card,
and it turns into stealing.

615
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,221
You always blow things
out of proportion.

616
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:37,458
You know what, would you stop it
with this "always" crap?

617
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:41,731
We dated for six months.
We were married for nine months.

618
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:44,067
That is 15 months, okay?

619
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,403
That is not "always," champ.

620
00:42:46,577 --> 00:42:50,138
You don't even know "always."
Hey, what are you doing? What's...?

621
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:51,941
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

622
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:54,812
Milo, don't you dare
leave me here like this. Milo.

623
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:00,986
- You'll probably have to pay for that.
- You know what?

624
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:21,144
Don't let me down.

625
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:53,867
- What are you doing?
- What?

626
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:58,764
Are you trying to seduce me?

627
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:06,043
Yeah. I am.

628
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:17,360
What would you like to touch first?

629
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:19,787
You always loved my shoulders.

630
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:22,228
Oh, yes, your shoulders.

631
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,099
And especially in the right jacket?
So impressive.

632
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:28,295
My chest.

633
00:45:30,374 --> 00:45:33,275
So strong, so solid.

634
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:38,271
- My lips.
- Your lips.

635
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:42,681
A perfect match for mine.

636
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:47,422
What you'd really like
to touch first...

637
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:50,626
...is powerful.

638
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:53,659
Sometimes dangerous.

639
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:57,393
- It's hard.
- Yes.

640
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:01,268
And that would be my gun.

641
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:07,100
Oh, you're such a dick.
You are such a dick.

642
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:09,940
Yeah. But in the right jacket....

643
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:27,019
Ray wants to show you something.

644
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:37,629
Okay. All right. Okay, yeah.
Okay, bring your buddies in.

645
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:39,400
Now that l have your attention...

646
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:42,671
...I will have you know that my
college roommate is a partner...

647
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:45,748
...at the biggest law firm
in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

648
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,215
All right, and while they specialize
primarily in real estate law...

649
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:52,150
...I am calling him <i>mañana.</i>

650
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:54,985
And he will be on your asses
like white on rice.

651
00:46:55,826 --> 00:46:57,521
Pick something and break it.

652
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,021
No, hold on one sec.
I don't know him that well.

653
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:04,827
We're not... We dated
some of the same girls in college.

654
00:47:05,002 --> 00:47:08,904
Hey. Hey, is that a Ping?
A Rapture? I had...

655
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:14,511
Oh, shit. God. Shit.

656
00:47:14,678 --> 00:47:16,942
- Feel better?
- Yeah, l do, actually.

657
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:18,775
- Damn it.
- Who is this guy, anyway?

658
00:47:18,983 --> 00:47:21,383
- Where's Boyd?
- That's Boyd.

659
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:22,712
That's not Milo Boyd.

660
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:24,878
- I'm not Boyd.
- He was in Boyd's Oldsmobile.

661
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:26,522
I'm not Boyd.

662
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,682
The two of you go together
this time. Morons.

663
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:37,899
- Housekeeping.
- Oh, good, yes. Come in.

664
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,231
Good morning.

665
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:46,065
You're probably wondering
why I'm handcuffed to the bed.

666
00:47:46,243 --> 00:47:49,770
I just came from a room where a man
was lying in a bathtub of mayonnaise...

667
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:51,073
...wearing a dog collar.

668
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:54,577
- Well, to each his own.
- You're not the one...

669
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:57,550
- ...who has to clean the tub.
- That's a very good point.

670
00:47:57,721 --> 00:47:59,052
- I'll come back.
- No. Please.

671
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:02,317
Would you mind grabbing my bag
from over there, please.

672
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:30,979
What was that?

673
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:33,816
What? Sorry? What? What was what?

674
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:36,816
That.

675
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:42,191
Listen, I have to
go to the bathroom, please.

676
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:43,458
Can you...?

677
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,869
How did you sleep?

678
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:49,931
- Better than you.
- Jerk.

679
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:53,499
- Would you...?
- Sorry.

680
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:03,111
What are you doing?
Can l have some privacy?

681
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:05,221
Something tells me
I should frisk you.

682
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:06,617
Oh, right.

683
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,350
Do I look like I'm hiding a weapon
between my breasts?

684
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:16,964
Seriously.

685
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:20,629
- Do you mind?
- Okay, okay.

686
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:22,629
God.

687
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:26,872
"Max power button.

688
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:30,343
Put open end in direct contact
with the skin.

689
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:32,243
Press button."

690
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:35,214
- Hey, who you talking to?
- Nobody.

691
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:38,553
Who would I be talking to
in a bathroom, anyway? God.

692
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:41,020
Okay, you're up to something.
I'm coming in.

693
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:42,988
- No, i'm not done, Milo.
- You're done.

694
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,253
Nope, i'm not. Jesus.

695
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:08,052
Son of a...

696
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:10,114
<i>Did you really jump bail?</i>

697
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:13,279
Gary, i need the name of the cop
who signed off on the suicide.

698
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:17,723
Okay. Looking like...

699
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:21,296
- ...Bobby Jenkins.
- Bobby?

700
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:22,591
Are you sure?

701
00:50:22,651 --> 00:50:23,791
I'm reading it right here.

702
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:26,897
- Do you know where Stewart is?
- Why would I know that?

703
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:28,868
I thought you two were together.

704
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,735
We are not together.
We made out once.

705
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:35,877
I meant together on the story.

706
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:40,608
- You made out with Stewart?
- Hey, you know... Gary, that's it.

707
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:44,920
- Need a lift?
- What?

708
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:49,483
Yes, yes, I do. Oh, God.

709
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:53,291
What a nightmare.

710
00:50:53,497 --> 00:50:55,488
Don't get married.

711
00:50:55,766 --> 00:51:00,635
I'm 17. I don't even have a girlfriend.
I'm saving all my money for college.

712
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:08,811
You know what? I just gave
all of my money to my ex-husband.

713
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:11,277
I don't know
how l'm gonna pay you.

714
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:14,240
You could show me your boobs.

715
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:15,442
Excuse me?

716
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,179
I told you I don't have a girlfriend.
Give me a break.

717
00:51:18,355 --> 00:51:20,516
Show me your boobs.

718
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:24,255
All right, pull over.

719
00:51:26,163 --> 00:51:27,528
You serious?

720
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:32,135
Watch out. Watch out, watch out.

721
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:35,430
Come on, bring it back.
My boss, she's gonna kill me.

722
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:37,597
Show her your penis.

723
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,803
Taser this, baby.

724
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:42,530
Get in the car.

725
00:52:47,711 --> 00:52:49,008
Come on, come on.

726
00:52:56,587 --> 00:52:59,784
Are you serious? Really?
Right now, you're gonna do this?

727
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:03,916
I promise,
I promise l won't do it again.

728
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:06,128
Come on.

729
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:21,202
Cannot believe
I was ever married to you.

730
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:24,905
I don't know why you keep falling
for that old "get in the car" trick.

731
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,457
What?

732
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:40,157
Oh, what are you doing?

733
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:46,733
No. No, no, no.
No, I'm not buying it. No--

734
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,444
Oh, shit. That's real.

735
00:54:01,184 --> 00:54:03,584
Nicole, come on, let's go.

736
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:12,519
- Look, I was just fooling around.
- Not because of you, jerk.

737
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:36,485
Shit.

738
00:55:06,516 --> 00:55:08,541
Oh, thank God. A doctor.

739
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:11,153
Sir, my leg, I think it's broken...

740
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:16,088
...and all I've eaten today is a
doughnut. That is... That is quite large.

741
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:18,420
Wait a minute.
Wait, you are a doctor, right?

742
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:21,996
Of course. I'm the track vet
at Atlantic City Race Course.

743
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:23,689
- What?
- He's very good.

744
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:26,199
He just put down
one of our horses last week.

745
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,998
- I don't think it felt a thing.
- But I'm not a horse.

746
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:33,438
Well, actually, in that case,
it did feel it. A lot.

747
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,407
Well, those are the tough ones.

748
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:39,242
Okay, you are gonna feel
a massive pinch.

749
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:41,748
But then your leg
should feel just fine.

750
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:43,215
Don't... Don't...

751
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:53,290
Come on, is this really necessary?

752
00:55:53,497 --> 00:55:56,864
After 250 volts through my neck?
You're lucky you're not in the trunk.

753
00:55:57,034 --> 00:55:59,468
I feel like I got a hickey
from jumper cables.

754
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:03,128
- You know, I could arrest you for this.
- Great. Do it, I dare you.

755
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:05,968
Wait, you'd have to be a real cop.
Which, by the way...

756
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,543
...was the single most attractive thing
about you.

757
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:11,146
I can go back to being a cop
any time l want.

758
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:12,804
Yeah, right.

759
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:14,483
- You know why?
- Why?

760
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:17,017
Because I'm good at it, that's why.

761
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:21,887
I disagree with you.

762
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:24,391
- And you're basing that on?
- Based on the fact...

763
00:56:24,561 --> 00:56:27,894
...that there's a black SUV following us,
and you haven't even noticed.

764
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:32,295
- Who says he's following us?
- It's the same one l saw...

765
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:34,733
...at Dunkin' Donuts
when l went to meet Jimmy.

766
00:56:34,905 --> 00:56:38,397
There are a million black SUVs
and 20 million Dunkin' Donuts...

767
00:56:38,575 --> 00:56:40,941
- ...and that's just in New Jersey.
- Listen.

768
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:44,274
There is a very good chance
cops are involved in the story...

769
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:46,075
- ...that I'm working on.
- Suicide?

770
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:49,514
They grabbed Jimmy. Jimmy may have
given them my name. I don't know.

771
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:52,280
- They may wanna kill me.
- You think you're hot shit...

772
00:56:52,456 --> 00:56:55,619
...but I'm sure the only person
that wants to kill you is me.

773
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:58,260
- God! Look out. Go.
- What the hell are you doing?

774
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:04,925
God. Shit.

775
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:10,034
Why don't you ever listen to me?

776
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:11,936
- I do listen, but...
- No, you don't.

777
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:22,612
Look out.

778
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:32,456
Don't stop.

779
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,327
Milo!

780
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:55,983
- Yes. I am so onto some--
- Only you could be happy right now.

781
00:57:56,153 --> 00:57:57,177
- Milo...
- Stay here.

782
00:57:57,354 --> 00:58:00,414
No, don't you leave me here, Milo.
Get me out of here. Milo.

783
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:03,417
Shit.

784
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:31,249
- Jesus.
- Christ.

785
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,082
I told you to stay in the car.

786
00:58:33,256 --> 00:58:35,247
So, what?
You are not the boss of me.

787
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:37,916
- You're gonna pay for that.
- I owe you a nickel.

788
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:41,222
Stop the car. Get out.
Get out of there.

789
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:42,660
Shit.

790
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,127
What the hell
have you gotten yourself into?

791
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:49,704
- Really? Now you're interested?
- Yeah, hell, yeah. He shot up my car.

792
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,474
I told you
someone was following me.

793
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:55,372
Did you listen to me? No.
Do you ever listen to me?

794
00:58:55,545 --> 00:58:57,945
You told me
somebody jumped off a roof.

795
00:58:58,114 --> 00:59:01,572
He worked for the N.Y.P.D.
in the evidence depository.

796
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:05,619
He was afraid of heights and
it's still ruled as a suicide? Come on.

797
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:08,553
You know, you can tell me all this
on the way to jail.

798
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:11,057
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, you wanna bet?

799
00:59:11,228 --> 00:59:12,559
Bobby signed the report.

800
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:15,291
What?

801
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:18,093
Bobby was the cop who signed off
on the suicide.

802
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:22,170
- The same one that you said--
- Watch yourself. Very thin ice here.

803
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:25,672
- He is my friend too.
- What is this? A friendly accusation?

804
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:29,243
No, this is not an accusation.
This is simply connecting the dots.

805
00:59:29,412 --> 00:59:31,778
No, this is about you
caring about someone...

806
00:59:31,948 --> 00:59:33,347
...then, all of a sudden...

807
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:36,815
...no warning, you don't care
about him and you're out the door.

808
00:59:36,987 --> 00:59:39,820
- This is not about us, Milo.
- Bobby.

809
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,617
Bobby walked you down the aisle.

810
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:44,919
I know. I will be heartbroken.
But I am not gonna stand around...

811
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:46,426
...with my head in the sand.

812
00:59:46,596 --> 00:59:49,429
I know where your head is,
and it ain't in the sand.

813
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,863
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna find this prick.

814
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:54,128
When I do,
I'm gonna prove Bobby innocent...

815
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:57,171
...and show you
exactly what loyalty looks like.

816
00:59:59,342 --> 01:00:02,368
No VlN number. No registration.

817
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:05,878
Yeah, this guy was definitely a pro.

818
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:08,984
Well, I got a Starbucks cup
with the name Earl on it.

819
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:12,986
Well, maybe it's not his cup.
Is that all you've got?

820
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:16,057
More than you've got, Kojak.

821
01:00:18,194 --> 01:00:21,391
- I got these.
- What does it matter that he plays golf?

822
01:00:21,564 --> 01:00:23,327
You see, I don't think he does.

823
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:26,128
These clubs have barely been used.

824
01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:29,067
Plus, they're lefties.

825
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:31,001
The guy who shot at us was a righty.

826
01:00:31,174 --> 01:00:34,575
Not to mention the fact
that all the pockets are empty.

827
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:35,802
So what?

828
01:00:35,979 --> 01:00:37,742
There is not a golfer in the world...

829
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:42,248
...who doesn't have tees and pencils
and balls, shoes, you name it.

830
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,744
Why is he a member...

831
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:48,880
- ...at the Castle Hill Country Club?
- That is a good question.

832
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:50,856
That's why I asked it.

833
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:53,392
For once, that is a good question.

834
01:01:05,408 --> 01:01:07,535
All right, here's the deal.

835
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,578
We're interested
in becoming members of the club...

836
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:12,874
...and we are friends with John.

837
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:14,678
Okay. John who?

838
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:18,582
Just say John.
They fill in the last name.

839
01:01:19,322 --> 01:01:22,587
- Clever.
- Thank you. Works every time.

840
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:25,557
All right, now you have to come up
with an occupation.

841
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:27,890
Why can't I be who I am?

842
01:01:28,231 --> 01:01:29,721
A bounty hunter?

843
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:33,391
We're trying to get into a private club,
not a tractor pull.

844
01:01:35,705 --> 01:01:37,969
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

845
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:41,235
The club's closed today
for a private event for members.

846
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:43,345
It's the Fourth of July.

847
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,107
Is it?

848
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:51,117
It's already the fourth, honey.

849
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,152
I can't believe it, honey.

850
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:54,755
Well, honey, neither can l.

851
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:58,223
See, the thing is John actually said
that it would be all right...

852
01:01:58,395 --> 01:01:59,623
...if we stopped by today.

853
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:01,457
John...?

854
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:03,792
He's a member here.

855
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:06,759
You know John.

856
01:02:06,936 --> 01:02:09,404
- Everybody knows John.
- Big John.

857
01:02:09,572 --> 01:02:11,631
I'm actually
the membership director here...

858
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:14,641
...and I don't believe we have
a single member named John.

859
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,409
That's weird, honey.

860
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:21,141
- This never fails.
- Oh, wait.

861
01:02:21,317 --> 01:02:24,980
Do you mean Jack Willit? They call him
Jack, but I think his name's John.

862
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:29,421
- Yes. Big John Jack Willit.
- Big John. Yeah, how could I forget.

863
01:02:29,592 --> 01:02:32,857
After all the years that John and I
have actually worked together...

864
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:36,988
- ...I forget people still call him Jack.
- Jack.

865
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:40,261
Oh, you're also in the Senate?

866
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:43,196
Yes.

867
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:45,975
Which state?

868
01:02:47,143 --> 01:02:48,633
- Okla...
- Kansas.

869
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,674
Kansas.

870
01:02:55,418 --> 01:02:59,411
Well, what a pleasure,
Senator and Mrs. Boyd.

871
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:03,824
Let me find someone who'll give you
the grand tour. Lucky us...

872
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:06,359
...another celebrity at Castle Hill.

873
01:03:08,231 --> 01:03:09,892
I'm actually a former model.

874
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:11,624
Really?

875
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:13,534
How long ago was that?

876
01:03:15,138 --> 01:03:19,074
Why don't you just find that person
that will be giving us the tour.

877
01:03:20,343 --> 01:03:22,368
Just stay right here.

878
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:25,170
I'll be back in two shakes.

879
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,981
All right, so let's split up.

880
01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:32,986
I take the tennis courts and the pool,
and you take the pro shop.

881
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:36,922
You're just gonna run around asking
people if they know a guy named Earl?

882
01:03:37,093 --> 01:03:39,891
Well, do you have a better idea?

883
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:43,590
Learn from me, honey. You wanna
know every dirty little thing...

884
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:47,395
...that goes on at a country club,
you gotta ask the right people.

885
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,595
Who would that be?

886
01:03:50,907 --> 01:03:51,999
The caddies.

887
01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:53,766
- Hey there.
- Yeah?

888
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:55,376
- What's going on?
- Hey.

889
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:59,345
Hey, do any of you fellas
know a guy named Earl?

890
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,281
No?

891
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:04,386
Hey.

892
01:04:05,688 --> 01:04:08,248
- I'll take that as a yes.
- Wait. Where are you...?

893
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:10,722
Milo!

894
01:04:22,438 --> 01:04:23,496
Shit.

895
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:31,945
A little out of shape there, senator?

896
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:33,742
The kid's got 20 years on me.

897
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:36,715
- Oh, come on, get in the cart.
- Only if you let me drive.

898
01:04:36,886 --> 01:04:39,753
- What is that supposed to mean?
- That you're a sucky driver.

899
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:43,256
I am... I am not a sucky driver.
I'm a great driver.

900
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:46,520
You know what? l don't have time
for this. Get in here. Come on.

901
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:52,394
How could we lose him?

902
01:04:52,769 --> 01:04:55,260
He knows the course
better than we do.

903
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:57,562
Gentlemen.

904
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,971
There.

905
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:13,286
Stay with him.

906
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:16,020
- God. Milo.
- Get right up next to him.

907
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,059
- We're moving too fast. Oh, no.
- No.

908
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:21,994
I got you. I got you.

909
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:26,829
That was not my fault.

910
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:29,028
I don't know anything.
The drugs, the cash.

911
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:32,538
- I didn't know anything about it.
- I didn't ask about drugs or money.

912
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:34,802
Good. I don't know anything.
I'm a caddy.

913
01:05:34,978 --> 01:05:39,278
- Well, then why were you running?
- Look, I'm just a kid saving for college.

914
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:41,007
Fine!

915
01:05:41,184 --> 01:05:43,516
A Jet Ski, I'm saving for a Jet Ski.

916
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:44,778
Who's Earl?

917
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:47,783
Okay, look, all I know is,
he plays here...

918
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:51,154
...with a couple big shots
every three or four months.

919
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:54,524
Dude doesn't know the difference
between a wedge and a paddle.

920
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:56,028
What's his last name?

921
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:58,167
I don't know anything about him.

922
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,894
Why don't you use your college brain
and think.

923
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:04,005
You can drown me.
I'm not gonna know his last name.

924
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:06,232
And he's a big tipper,
sometimes 100 bucks.

925
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:09,378
Oh, he got me this.

926
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:10,909
He got you a tattoo?

927
01:06:11,114 --> 01:06:13,048
When my girlfriend
dumped me, yeah.

928
01:06:13,216 --> 01:06:15,411
He sent me to this place in Queens.
Blue lnk.

929
01:06:15,618 --> 01:06:17,643
I don't know, maybe he owns it.

930
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:23,819
Blue Ink Tattoo.

931
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:25,324
<i>Yeah, let me speak to Earl.</i>

932
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:26,519
Not in.

933
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:30,257
- We got him.
- Tell him a Walter Lilly called.

934
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:33,831
Tell him Walter Lilly called,
all right?

935
01:06:34,003 --> 01:06:37,564
All right. Walter Lilly? Thanks.

936
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,573
Very nice work, detective.

937
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:42,711
Hey, you--

938
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:45,511
- You got some...
- What?

939
01:06:45,682 --> 01:06:46,706
- Some...
- What?

940
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:48,180
- On your neck.
- What is it?

941
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:50,114
- It's pond scum.
- Get it off. Oh, God.

942
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:52,880
- Looks good.
- Get it off. Milo, get it off. Not funny.

943
01:06:53,056 --> 01:06:56,150
- Okay. Calm down, calm down.
- Get it.

944
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:58,719
What else? Where else is it?

945
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:01,386
- Wanna see it? Look.
- Just get it out of the car.

946
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:04,431
- I'm gonna keep it. Press it in a book.
- Oh, Jesus.

947
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,262
I'll always remember the special day
we just had.

948
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:10,133
See, you joke, Milo,
but just look at us.

949
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:14,572
We're this close to solving a murder
that nobody even knows has happened.

950
01:07:17,046 --> 01:07:19,981
- Speak of the devil.
- Really?

951
01:07:21,284 --> 01:07:23,149
Hey, Bobby, what's up?

952
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,253
Get off the road, and l mean now.

953
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:28,413
Yeah, this holiday traffic's...

954
01:07:28,591 --> 01:07:31,560
- It's a real bitch.
- Half of New Jersey is looking for you.

955
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:34,993
The other half is looking for your ex,
who is apparently a felon.

956
01:07:35,198 --> 01:07:36,426
For what, I have no idea.

957
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:39,727
So much for "what happens
in Jersey, stays in Jersey."

958
01:07:39,902 --> 01:07:41,597
Where are you, man? Exactly?

959
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,739
What?

960
01:07:45,908 --> 01:07:49,400
Listen, Bobby, maybe you and I
should meet for a beer later.

961
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:52,070
You know, talk about old times.

962
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:55,581
Goddamn it, Milo. I can only
protect you if you do what I say.

963
01:07:55,752 --> 01:07:59,210
lay low, stay there.

964
01:08:01,758 --> 01:08:04,352
- What?
- He says we should get off the road.

965
01:08:04,527 --> 01:08:07,758
- I believe him.
- We are in the middle of nowhere.

966
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:09,754
You know what?

967
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:13,662
I know exactly where we are.

968
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:23,804
Really? Here?

969
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,505
Couldn't have driven five minutes,
found a Best Western?

970
01:08:27,617 --> 01:08:30,051
We'll be safe here
until we figure out what's what.

971
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:31,550
Think they remember us?

972
01:08:31,754 --> 01:08:35,349
You kidding? Do you know how many
honeymooners they've had since us?

973
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,185
Hey, can l help...?

974
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:40,891
Wait.

975
01:08:41,063 --> 01:08:42,496
lt can't be.

976
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:45,133
Edmund. Edmund. Come quick.

977
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:48,133
- Looks like they remember us.
- You think?

978
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,636
Be still, my beating heart.

979
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,705
Oh, my.

980
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:56,902
Listen, we get a lot
of young marrieds here, but you two....

981
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:01,140
Have we ever had a couple
more madly in love than these two?

982
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:04,013
No. No, we still talk about you two...

983
01:09:04,187 --> 01:09:08,214
...honest to Betsy, as the
quintessential Cupid's couple Cabin.

984
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:09,881
Cupid's Cabin couple.

985
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:11,822
Oh, you know.

986
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:14,485
Let's get you a nice room.
Come on inside.

987
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:19,728
Welcome back.

988
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:21,392
Welcome. Welcome, welcome.

989
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:23,664
Oh, look, here's....

990
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,804
Oh, my goodness.

991
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:30,668
What, it's been three years?

992
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:35,750
- Three years. Has it?
- Oh, my God. I don't even remember.

993
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:39,752
So you came back
for your anniversary.

994
01:09:41,424 --> 01:09:44,723
I do have to ask you
my favorite question.

995
01:09:44,894 --> 01:09:48,091
How do you keep
your romance alive?

996
01:09:51,834 --> 01:09:55,429
Well, I gotta tell you, Dawn...

997
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:58,472
...I'm not naturally
a romantic kind of guy.

998
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:00,432
True. He's not.

999
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:04,774
I mean, I don't tend to go
for cards or flowers.

1000
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:06,278
Actually, gifts of any kind.

1001
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:10,476
If it's your birthday, Milo thinks
the best surprise is the gift of nothing.

1002
01:10:11,754 --> 01:10:14,621
And you'd probably have to put a gun
to old Nic's head here...

1003
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,224
...to get her to actually say,
"I love you."

1004
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:23,457
Well, that's true love.

1005
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:30,300
That is right. Two people who know
all each other's faults...

1006
01:10:30,473 --> 01:10:33,965
- ...and weaknesses, and yet...
- They just love each other all the more.

1007
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:35,633
Thank you.

1008
01:10:36,812 --> 01:10:38,803
Oh, gosh.

1009
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:41,612
The cesspool's backed up.
Gotta call the guy.

1010
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:44,810
No, honey, l think it's them.
They're a little stinky.

1011
01:10:44,987 --> 01:10:48,423
Well, we actually...
We crashed into a pond.

1012
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:49,949
She was driving.

1013
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:52,322
Oh, my goodness, you two.

1014
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:55,794
Let's get you settled, and then you
can come back down for dinner.

1015
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:57,432
We'll get you fresh duds.

1016
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,296
Pop those in the wash,
have them back by bedtime.

1017
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:03,768
Excuse me,
but what happened to your neck?

1018
01:11:04,407 --> 01:11:06,307
She Tasered me.

1019
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:12,672
She Tase... He's too funny.

1020
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:15,612
"She Tasered me."

1021
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:21,789
- What?
- Oh, just....

1022
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:23,992
This whole situation.

1023
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,685
I mean, really,
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

1024
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:29,296
If you could see yourself
in that dress, cry.

1025
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:30,796
What?

1026
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:36,169
Said the man who couldn't decide what
color to wear, so he wore them all.

1027
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,908
Do you remember
when we broke that...?

1028
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:42,044
Yeah, I do.

1029
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:45,573
Although I tried very hard
to block that out, to be honest.

1030
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:47,841
Oh, really?
How's that working out for you?

1031
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:50,144
- What, being honest?
- Denial.

1032
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:52,310
Great. Yeah.

1033
01:11:53,456 --> 01:11:55,981
Until about an hour ago.

1034
01:11:56,659 --> 01:11:58,320
Yeah.

1035
01:12:01,364 --> 01:12:04,026
Why...? Why do people do that?

1036
01:12:05,368 --> 01:12:06,392
Why do people do what?

1037
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:09,902
Deny that they've ever done
anything wrong in the relationship.

1038
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:14,566
Why can't people take responsibility
for their shit and move on?

1039
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,372
Which people are you talking about?

1040
01:12:19,248 --> 01:12:20,272
- I don't know.
- What?

1041
01:12:20,483 --> 01:12:21,973
I don't know.

1042
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:25,847
You. Me.

1043
01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:28,080
Everybody.

1044
01:12:28,257 --> 01:12:30,384
Well, maybe everybody's afraid...

1045
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:34,427
...that any admission of guilt
would be seen as a sign of weakness.

1046
01:12:34,597 --> 01:12:37,088
You know,
that's where everybody's wrong.

1047
01:12:37,266 --> 01:12:39,461
I see it as a sign of maturity.

1048
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,364
Don't you think?

1049
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:44,431
- Absolutely.
- I mean, life...

1050
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:48,566
Life is about making mistakes.

1051
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:50,302
Right?

1052
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:54,039
And death is about
wishing you made a whole lot more.

1053
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:00,415
Hey, I just made that up.

1054
01:13:01,624 --> 01:13:04,115
Look at you, Milo Boyd.

1055
01:13:05,227 --> 01:13:06,819
Well....

1056
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,458
Well, then.

1057
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:11,599
Here...

1058
01:13:12,134 --> 01:13:16,332
...is to our big, fat, ugly mistake.

1059
01:13:16,539 --> 01:13:18,905
The kind
that knocks you on your ass.

1060
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:23,138
And makes you wanna
do them all over again.

1061
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:29,675
What do you mean?

1062
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:32,814
Well, I...

1063
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,755
Well, wait, wait.
What mistake were you talking about?

1064
01:13:37,927 --> 01:13:41,090
No, you just said
you had made a mistake.

1065
01:13:42,331 --> 01:13:43,355
I did.

1066
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:46,259
So we're in agreement?

1067
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:51,067
But so did you.

1068
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:58,170
Yeah, so we both
made a huge mistake.

1069
01:14:02,017 --> 01:14:03,882
By getting married.

1070
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:06,850
Oh, yeah, that. Yeah.

1071
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:11,085
And getting divorced.

1072
01:14:14,196 --> 01:14:16,323
But you know what?
Hey, l screwed up.

1073
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:21,095
I screwed up, and I'm sorry.

1074
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:28,976
Sometimes I...

1075
01:14:31,614 --> 01:14:34,549
Sometimes I really think
it was all me.

1076
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:39,812
This is crazy.

1077
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:41,513
I know.

1078
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:44,521
But l kind of....

1079
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:47,025
I kind of miss it.

1080
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:51,258
- What?
- This.

1081
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:54,259
Us. You know, you.

1082
01:14:57,873 --> 01:14:59,704
But you don't even like me.

1083
01:15:01,777 --> 01:15:03,870
Are you kidding me?

1084
01:15:04,246 --> 01:15:06,578
Of course I like you.

1085
01:15:29,271 --> 01:15:31,296
What are you thinking about?

1086
01:15:34,977 --> 01:15:36,774
Nothing.

1087
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:46,748
Liar.

1088
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:51,256
That's the nicest thing
you've said to me all weekend.

1089
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:05,673
Okay. Here you go, Kitty.

1090
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:08,207
- <i>Hi, it's me.</i>
- Oh, Steve?

1091
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:11,009
No, it's Nicole. It's your daughter.
Who's Steve?

1092
01:16:11,213 --> 01:16:14,148
The drag queen who does
Sunday nights. What's up, kitten?

1093
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:17,114
Mom, advice, advice.
I need your advice.

1094
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:20,778
Listen, l am locked in the bathroom
of the honeymoon suite...

1095
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:22,753
...at Cupid's Cabin...

1096
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:26,122
- ...and Milo is right outside the door.
- Lord in heaven.

1097
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:28,786
You've barricaded
yourself from him?

1098
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:30,124
That's hot.

1099
01:16:30,299 --> 01:16:33,234
No, Mom... Okay. Focus.

1100
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:35,671
Room service.

1101
01:16:37,473 --> 01:16:40,306
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Dawn wanted me to make sure...

1102
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:44,776
- ...you got the rest of your champagne.
- Great. Hang on.

1103
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,181
Your clothes are almost dry.
I'll have them up in a jiffy.

1104
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,786
No rush. Might not need them
for a little bit, if you know what I mean.

1105
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:54,255
She must have
a couple of bucks in here.

1106
01:16:58,494 --> 01:17:00,121
What's this?

1107
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:07,568
Yeah, thanks for the champagne.

1108
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:09,863
Oh, you forgot my...

1109
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:18,340
So what was this moment
of honesty?

1110
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:20,345
I don't know.
We were down at dinner...

1111
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:24,008
...and then all of a sudden
I could not remember why I hate him.

1112
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:25,244
Well, what did he say?

1113
01:17:25,421 --> 01:17:27,412
- He said he missed me.
- What?

1114
01:17:27,589 --> 01:17:30,319
He said he missed me
and that he was sorry.

1115
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:33,088
He actually said he was sorry?

1116
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:35,923
Was he taking your clothes off?
How naked were you?

1117
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:39,192
- Mom, we were on the patio.
- You were naked on the patio?

1118
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:42,098
What can I say,
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

1119
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:46,104
Ma, we were at dinner on the patio.
There was no sex.

1120
01:17:46,308 --> 01:17:48,674
- And he said "I'm sorry"?
- <i>Twice.</i>

1121
01:17:48,844 --> 01:17:51,745
- With no sex?
- Yeah.

1122
01:17:51,914 --> 01:17:53,506
Hold on a sec.

1123
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:00,582
Yeah. Continue.

1124
01:18:00,756 --> 01:18:04,385
I don't know.
Like, she's acting really weird.

1125
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,724
I mean, she admitted for the first time
that the divorce was all her fault.

1126
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:13,458
- Yeah? What'd she say?
- Well, I said I screwed up a little bit.

1127
01:18:13,635 --> 01:18:17,901
But then she said,
"No, Milo, it was me."

1128
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:20,439
And then I find this picture?

1129
01:18:20,609 --> 01:18:23,373
Tell me, do you keep your ex's picture
in your wallet?

1130
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:27,276
Number of times I've been married,
they don't make a wallet that big.

1131
01:18:27,783 --> 01:18:29,944
Come on, pick it up. Let's go.

1132
01:18:30,486 --> 01:18:34,286
- I wanna do more camping.
- This is camping.

1133
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:37,425
We're camping in Dad's office.

1134
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:40,585
- Just don't tell your mother about this.
- It's Milo.

1135
01:18:41,864 --> 01:18:42,956
What's the problem now?

1136
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:45,566
Nicole keeps the wedding photo
in the wallet.

1137
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:47,895
Numb nuts wants to know
what that means.

1138
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:52,404
I'll tell you what it means. It means she
hasn't cleaned out her wallet in a year.

1139
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:56,510
You know, I'm pretty sure I'm carrying
around a condom from 1987.

1140
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:58,669
Don't tell your mother that, either.

1141
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:01,873
You know something?
I think that means she loves you.

1142
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:04,747
I think so too.

1143
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,353
Open your eyes, honey.

1144
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:09,082
<i>How often</i>
<i>do people get second chances?</i>

1145
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:11,988
<i>I say get naked and get busy.</i>

1146
01:19:12,161 --> 01:19:13,958
You're right.

1147
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:16,597
- I'm gonna go for it.
- <i>You do that.</i>

1148
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:19,199
Oh, and take your phone with you.

1149
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:21,767
One picture of his ass,
that's all l'm asking.

1150
01:19:21,937 --> 01:19:25,168
- Mother, you are so dirty.
- Thank you.

1151
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:28,207
- I love you, sweetie.
- I love you.

1152
01:19:31,313 --> 01:19:33,508
Boy. Okay.

1153
01:19:33,682 --> 01:19:36,947
Well, why do you care?
This woman makes you crazy.

1154
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:39,349
You drunk yourself out of a job
because of her.

1155
01:19:39,521 --> 01:19:42,012
- No. I quit my job.
- You were fired.

1156
01:19:42,191 --> 01:19:44,421
I quit by getting myself fired.

1157
01:19:50,132 --> 01:19:52,623
Okay, you're thinking with your dick.

1158
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:56,828
How many times I gotta tell you?
Stop thinking with your dick, all right?

1159
01:19:58,073 --> 01:20:00,337
I am not thinking with my dick.

1160
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:03,876
Listen, even if I do get laid tonight,
then it doesn't change a thing.

1161
01:20:04,046 --> 01:20:08,380
I'm still bringing her ass to jail, okay?
So just chill out.

1162
01:20:17,226 --> 01:20:18,693
Hey.

1163
01:20:19,361 --> 01:20:20,953
Hey.

1164
01:20:28,737 --> 01:20:30,034
Is everything okay?

1165
01:20:31,173 --> 01:20:33,038
Why wouldn't it be?

1166
01:20:36,778 --> 01:20:38,109
They brought champagne.

1167
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,113
- I thought maybe you and I...
- Well, you thought wrong.

1168
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,211
What are you doing?

1169
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:47,489
I'm going to bed.
What does it look like?

1170
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:52,586
A great big blast from the past,
that's what.

1171
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:57,926
Oh, Nic shuts down again.
Oh, boy, does this take me back.

1172
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,124
Goddamn it.

1173
01:21:08,644 --> 01:21:11,442
If it's so familiar, you know
you're sleeping on the couch.

1174
01:21:11,613 --> 01:21:13,478
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1175
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:15,446
The hell I am.

1176
01:21:35,671 --> 01:21:38,731
Are you gonna swallow that
any time soon?

1177
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:42,343
- Tastes great.
- Oh, God, you are so... That's it.

1178
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:46,144
That is it.

1179
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:56,815
Are you happy now?

1180
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:01,122
Overjoyed.

1181
01:22:13,842 --> 01:22:15,537
Oh, sorry, did l wake you?

1182
01:22:15,711 --> 01:22:17,338
I just wanna say thank you...

1183
01:22:17,512 --> 01:22:20,675
- ...for a really lovely, lovely evening.
- No, Nic.

1184
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:25,886
- What? No, Nic. Wait.
- Tickles, huh?

1185
01:22:26,388 --> 01:22:28,219
Hey, come back here.

1186
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,620
Nic. I swear to God.

1187
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:32,485
Shit.

1188
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,031
Shit.

1189
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:48,670
Hey. No. Wait. Nic.
Nic, get back here.

1190
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:50,971
Don't you dare, you--

1191
01:22:53,548 --> 01:22:54,606
Shit.

1192
01:22:57,219 --> 01:23:00,052
- What are you doing?
- I forgot my wallet.

1193
01:23:03,392 --> 01:23:04,416
That's Irene's money.

1194
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:07,557
- lt's $ 10.
- lt's lrene's money.

1195
01:23:07,729 --> 01:23:10,220
- I will pay it back.
- Irene will kill you.

1196
01:23:10,932 --> 01:23:12,365
Irene will have me kill you.

1197
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:21,031
Dwight! Dwight!

1198
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:23,609
- Yeah.
- It's Milo's car.

1199
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:25,007
No, I...

1200
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,707
Listen, here is a list of the other
bed and breakfasts in the area...

1201
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:30,613
...for your next visit.

1202
01:23:30,786 --> 01:23:32,344
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

1203
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:33,782
Thank you.

1204
01:23:35,357 --> 01:23:36,881
I'm sorry.

1205
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:46,694
- Park that for you, sir?
- Don't scratch it.

1206
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:48,165
Roger that.

1207
01:23:58,313 --> 01:24:00,304
Shoot. Okay.

1208
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:11,957
Excuse me.

1209
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:14,989
Pilates World is across the street.

1210
01:24:17,132 --> 01:24:18,156
Well, no.

1211
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:22,292
Actually, I want a tattoo.

1212
01:24:22,471 --> 01:24:25,338
Let me guess. A cute little butterfly
on your shoulder?

1213
01:24:26,975 --> 01:24:29,637
- Well...
- We're by appointment only.

1214
01:24:30,746 --> 01:24:31,804
Darla...

1215
01:24:32,481 --> 01:24:33,709
...go get me some beers.

1216
01:24:35,817 --> 01:24:37,284
What do you want?

1217
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:41,221
I want a panther...

1218
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:45,688
...down the length of my body.

1219
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:49,262
I'd like the paws
to be about right here.

1220
01:24:49,431 --> 01:24:53,367
Then l was thinking the mouth,
the teeth...

1221
01:24:53,535 --> 01:24:54,763
...about right here.

1222
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:58,997
And then the tail....

1223
01:25:00,842 --> 01:25:03,242
I'll let you figure that out.

1224
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:05,545
Cancel my appointments.

1225
01:25:08,617 --> 01:25:10,244
Darla.

1226
01:25:13,188 --> 01:25:15,156
I'm Bone.

1227
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:17,122
Bone?

1228
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:19,453
Is that short for something?

1229
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:21,522
Boner.

1230
01:25:22,063 --> 01:25:23,223
Boner.

1231
01:25:23,398 --> 01:25:25,958
Boner. That's catchy.

1232
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:29,861
- Is Earl here?
- Haven't seen him.

1233
01:25:30,906 --> 01:25:32,464
Now...

1234
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:35,673
...pull up your shirt.

1235
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:39,547
Give me a look at the canvas.

1236
01:25:40,816 --> 01:25:42,374
Yes.

1237
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:46,214
Yes, but do you mind, though,
if I hit the head first?

1238
01:25:46,388 --> 01:25:47,514
Make it quick.

1239
01:26:38,707 --> 01:26:40,265
Oh, my God.

1240
01:26:41,643 --> 01:26:43,474
Bobby.

1241
01:27:06,001 --> 01:27:07,468
Jimmy. Oh, my God.

1242
01:27:09,504 --> 01:27:12,098
- Earl. What happened?
- Give me the keys to your pickup.

1243
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:13,866
I need to get some junk
out of my office.

1244
01:27:14,509 --> 01:27:17,239
- Okay.
- Okay. Come on.

1245
01:27:18,146 --> 01:27:20,774
- Wait.
- Oh, and a Walter Lilly called.

1246
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:22,280
He didn't leave a number.

1247
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:24,145
Come here, this way.

1248
01:27:36,765 --> 01:27:38,289
Son of a bitch.

1249
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:40,297
- The guy's a cop.
- I know.

1250
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:42,197
- And a drug dealer.
- l know.

1251
01:27:42,404 --> 01:27:45,498
- lsn't that against the law?
- Yeah, last l checked.

1252
01:27:48,443 --> 01:27:51,276
It's Earl. Call me back
as soon as you get this, all right?

1253
01:27:51,446 --> 01:27:52,640
I heard him on the phone.

1254
01:27:52,814 --> 01:27:55,510
He was arranging some meeting
with a guy named Bobby.

1255
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:57,679
Bobby?

1256
01:27:58,453 --> 01:27:59,784
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1257
01:27:59,955 --> 01:28:01,047
I got a better question.

1258
01:28:01,222 --> 01:28:02,553
Where the hell is Milo?

1259
01:28:03,124 --> 01:28:07,060
- I'm having the worst weekend.
- Who is this person?

1260
01:28:07,228 --> 01:28:10,527
- How would l know that?
- Nobody. Nobody. I'm nobody.

1261
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:14,226
Well, that's wonderful. Now, is
Nobody gonna get out of this car?

1262
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:17,803
Or are we gonna put a big hole
in Nobody's head?

1263
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:21,040
Run.

1264
01:28:22,344 --> 01:28:24,335
- No. Jimmy.
- I can't.

1265
01:28:29,551 --> 01:28:34,181
Your hair shimmers
like sunlight on the ocean.

1266
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:02,076
- <i>You are such a jerk.</i>
- You know what you are?

1267
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,275
You're an emotional cripple,
that's what.

1268
01:29:04,486 --> 01:29:07,114
You'd rather hunt down a guy
who's trying to kill you...

1269
01:29:07,288 --> 01:29:10,121
...than deal with the guy
who vowed to put up with your shit...

1270
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,521
- ...for the rest of his life.
- You know what?

1271
01:29:12,694 --> 01:29:15,527
An $ 11 ,000 gambling debt.
Call that getting a handle on it?

1272
01:29:17,098 --> 01:29:18,759
- <i>Not what I told you to say.</i>
- <i>Sorry.</i>

1273
01:29:18,933 --> 01:29:22,198
- Hello. We have your girlfriend.
- I'm not his girlfriend.

1274
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:23,632
No, she is my girlfriend.

1275
01:29:23,805 --> 01:29:28,105
But I'll tell you what,
why don't you keep her. Call it square.

1276
01:29:29,944 --> 01:29:31,639
- He hung up.
- What?

1277
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:41,385
Holy shit.

1278
01:29:41,556 --> 01:29:43,456
What the...?

1279
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:52,591
Let me guess,
she's driven you nuts already.

1280
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:56,828
- Damn it, Milo, they are not kidding.
- I wish I could help you. I really do.

1281
01:29:57,038 --> 01:29:59,632
There's just one small problem.

1282
01:30:00,775 --> 01:30:02,970
You handcuffed me
to Cupid, remember?

1283
01:30:03,144 --> 01:30:06,272
How was I to know that a couple
of Neanderthals wanted you dead?

1284
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:09,440
- Whoa, not a couple.
- Why would you think we're a couple?

1285
01:30:09,617 --> 01:30:11,778
You know what?
Put Chubby on the phone.

1286
01:30:13,154 --> 01:30:15,418
- Hello?
- Really, Dwight?

1287
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:17,683
Since when do bookies
kidnap people?

1288
01:30:17,859 --> 01:30:21,522
It's a little outside of my jurisdiction,
but we're under new management.

1289
01:30:21,696 --> 01:30:24,597
Tell your partner he's got
about five seconds to release her...

1290
01:30:24,766 --> 01:30:26,495
...or I'm gonna ruin his life.

1291
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:29,629
He says release her or else.
I'm paraphrasing.

1292
01:30:29,804 --> 01:30:31,135
Bring it on.

1293
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,707
- Did you hear that?
- You know what? Put Nic on the phone.

1294
01:30:36,945 --> 01:30:39,607
- What?
- Tell your pals I'll be there in 20.

1295
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:43,512
- He said he'll be here in 20 minutes.
- That's good. That's good.

1296
01:30:43,685 --> 01:30:47,280
- Wait, Milo, I...
- Stop shifting in your seat.

1297
01:30:47,455 --> 01:30:48,945
Tell them you have to
use the bathroom.

1298
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:50,989
Don't look around. Just do it.

1299
01:30:55,196 --> 01:30:57,664
Okay, if he's not here
in 20 minutes...

1300
01:30:57,832 --> 01:30:59,026
I need to pee.

1301
01:31:00,535 --> 01:31:01,729
You need...?

1302
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:03,869
- Let's go pee.
- Okay.

1303
01:31:04,038 --> 01:31:05,198
Yeah?

1304
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,347
Oh, God.

1305
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:23,714
Yep.

1306
01:31:24,225 --> 01:31:27,592
- Oh, please tell me you have a plan.
- Stay put until I come get you.

1307
01:31:27,762 --> 01:31:30,026
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1308
01:31:30,198 --> 01:31:32,758
She said he'd be here
in 20 minutes.

1309
01:31:32,934 --> 01:31:35,027
- So?
- So...

1310
01:31:35,203 --> 01:31:37,933
...she never told him where she was.

1311
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:42,507
Here, folks. Some money.
There you go. Yeah.

1312
01:31:43,077 --> 01:31:47,514
- Ho, ho, ho, ladies. Happy Fourth.
- Oh, shit. That is Milo Boyd.

1313
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:49,616
Grab some of this, girls.

1314
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:51,012
- Holy shit.
- What?

1315
01:31:51,186 --> 01:31:54,349
- Everybody have a good time.
- That's Irene's money.

1316
01:31:54,522 --> 01:31:56,956
Step over here.
Come on, come on.

1317
01:31:58,693 --> 01:32:00,718
Yes, here we go.

1318
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:04,089
Plenty for everybody.

1319
01:32:06,034 --> 01:32:07,968
Ladies, ladies. Here you go, ladies.

1320
01:32:08,169 --> 01:32:09,193
That's my money.

1321
01:32:09,737 --> 01:32:12,729
Get your hands off my dough!

1322
01:32:15,777 --> 01:32:18,109
Time to go. You all right?
Car keys in the bag?

1323
01:32:18,279 --> 01:32:20,110
- Yeah.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

1324
01:32:24,919 --> 01:32:26,944
Why can't you be this guy
all the time?

1325
01:32:27,121 --> 01:32:29,316
I am this guy all the time.

1326
01:32:29,557 --> 01:32:33,823
No. A hotshot detective
that I fell so madly in love with.

1327
01:32:34,629 --> 01:32:37,996
lnstead, this bounty hunter who's
always bragging about getting laid.

1328
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:41,095
Oh, wait.

1329
01:32:41,636 --> 01:32:45,003
Is that what you're pissed about?
I was talking to Sid.

1330
01:32:45,206 --> 01:32:48,471
What am l supposed to say,
that I'm sweet on my girl again?

1331
01:32:49,143 --> 01:32:50,405
Yeah.

1332
01:32:50,578 --> 01:32:53,979
Yes, you say it.
If that's what you mean, you say it.

1333
01:32:54,148 --> 01:32:55,911
You were honest
about your feelings?

1334
01:32:56,818 --> 01:33:01,482
All I'm saying is this night could've
gone a lot differently if you had.

1335
01:33:02,357 --> 01:33:04,757
Yeah. Just like our marriage.

1336
01:33:07,128 --> 01:33:08,527
Maybe.

1337
01:33:10,431 --> 01:33:13,958
Some detective I turned out to be.
Can't even figure you out.

1338
01:33:17,338 --> 01:33:19,738
She's strong for a stripper.

1339
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:24,373
Watch it, Ray.

1340
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:28,846
That was very painful.

1341
01:33:30,518 --> 01:33:34,318
- I'm gonna kick your Amazo...
- Shut up, you little pussy.

1342
01:33:37,692 --> 01:33:40,991
- Twenty Seventh squad, Griswald.
- Hey, Kenny, it's Milo.

1343
01:33:41,195 --> 01:33:44,062
Hey, Mr. Boyd. What's up?

1344
01:33:44,265 --> 01:33:48,167
I'm looking for Bobby. I called his cell,
but he's not picking up. ls he there?

1345
01:33:48,336 --> 01:33:51,032
With you not being on the force
anymore and everything...

1346
01:33:51,205 --> 01:33:54,697
- ...I'm not really supposed to...
- Hey, Kenny, I don't have a lot of time.

1347
01:33:54,876 --> 01:33:58,869
Now, you used to follow me around,
kiss my ass. You still into that?

1348
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:00,173
Yes, sir.

1349
01:34:00,348 --> 01:34:04,011
- Well, pucker up. Where's Bobby?
- On his way to the depository.

1350
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,920
Why? It's the middle of the night.

1351
01:34:08,089 --> 01:34:11,252
Lieutenant's got us working double
to complete the move.

1352
01:34:11,426 --> 01:34:13,189
- What move?
- <i>To the new facility.</i>

1353
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:16,159
I heard they had to inventory
something like 194,000...

1354
01:34:16,331 --> 01:34:19,892
- ...pieces of evidence.
- Thank you. Take it easy.

1355
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:24,331
That must have been quite an audit.

1356
01:34:25,573 --> 01:34:29,009
Do you know what happens to evidence
when the case doesn't go to trial?

1357
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:32,445
- What?
- Not a damn thing.

1358
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,910
So it just sits there?

1359
01:34:36,584 --> 01:34:37,676
Forever?

1360
01:34:37,852 --> 01:34:39,843
Ripe for the picking.

1361
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:57,428
I'm hungry.

1362
01:34:57,939 --> 01:34:59,600
I'll wait here for Bobby.

1363
01:34:59,774 --> 01:35:04,268
Take the car. There's a pizza parlor
on Yonkers. Anything but peppers.

1364
01:35:04,445 --> 01:35:06,640
There is no way
you're getting rid of me.

1365
01:35:06,848 --> 01:35:09,282
I wouldn't let you drive
my car, anyway.

1366
01:35:10,485 --> 01:35:11,782
That was an accident.

1367
01:35:13,654 --> 01:35:15,986
- What?
- The whole N.Y.P.D. thing.

1368
01:35:16,157 --> 01:35:18,990
Reason I got arrested.
You can make all the jokes you want.

1369
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:22,220
- But I'm an excellent driver.
- Wait.

1370
01:35:22,563 --> 01:35:24,963
Your rap sheet
said you assaulted an officer.

1371
01:35:25,133 --> 01:35:27,795
What--? Are you saying
you ran over a cop?

1372
01:35:27,969 --> 01:35:30,733
l didn't run over anything.

1373
01:35:32,173 --> 01:35:34,164
- Then what did you do?
- Nothing.

1374
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:36,570
I was late for a press conference.

1375
01:35:36,744 --> 01:35:37,938
Traffic was stopped...

1376
01:35:38,112 --> 01:35:41,240
...so I thought I could squeeze by...

1377
01:35:41,416 --> 01:35:43,145
...and I grazed it.

1378
01:35:43,918 --> 01:35:45,078
You grazed a cop.

1379
01:35:45,653 --> 01:35:47,416
No, I grazed a horse.

1380
01:35:48,122 --> 01:35:52,286
Okay? Are you happy?
A big, dumb, old police horse...

1381
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,360
...whose big, dumb, old police ass...

1382
01:35:54,529 --> 01:35:58,295
...swayed in front of my car
as I was trying to pass it.

1383
01:35:58,466 --> 01:36:00,457
- You hit a horse?
- I tapped him.

1384
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:06,103
Tapped him. There was one little,
little tuft of hair on my bumper.

1385
01:36:06,274 --> 01:36:09,300
It was... Seriously. I can go to jail.

1386
01:36:09,477 --> 01:36:13,504
- Yeah, for like... years.
- You're just... You know...

1387
01:36:13,681 --> 01:36:15,342
You're the world's worst driver.

1388
01:36:15,516 --> 01:36:18,041
Will you just be quiet?

1389
01:36:25,726 --> 01:36:29,184
Now, listen. We don't know
anything for sure, all right?

1390
01:36:29,363 --> 01:36:33,959
- Maybe it's not what it looks like.
- It's almost always what it looks like.

1391
01:36:40,341 --> 01:36:43,071
Hey, Bobby.
Been looking all over for you.

1392
01:36:43,244 --> 01:36:45,804
- You get my message?
- About the missing drugs? Yeah.

1393
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:47,641
We got a problem. You know that?

1394
01:36:49,984 --> 01:36:51,385
Yeah, yeah, we do.

1395
01:36:56,524 --> 01:36:59,152
- Can I help you?
- We're here to see Bobby Jenkins.

1396
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:00,988
Can I tell him what it's regarding?

1397
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,028
- Put the bag down, Earl.
- What, this?

1398
01:37:04,832 --> 01:37:07,232
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't make this harder...

1399
01:37:07,401 --> 01:37:09,392
- ...than it has to be.
- The bag's down.

1400
01:37:10,738 --> 01:37:11,864
You know, I gotta...

1401
01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:16,334
Buzz me in. Now.

1402
01:37:20,681 --> 01:37:22,205
Got it.

1403
01:37:36,397 --> 01:37:37,887
Sorry.

1404
01:37:57,118 --> 01:37:59,086
Jesus.

1405
01:37:59,387 --> 01:38:00,945
- What?
- There's blood.

1406
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:11,095
Oh, my God.

1407
01:38:11,532 --> 01:38:13,727
- Bobby.
- You okay, partner?

1408
01:38:13,901 --> 01:38:16,802
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Looking for some answers.

1409
01:38:16,971 --> 01:38:19,496
- Who shot you?
- Earl Mahler.

1410
01:38:19,674 --> 01:38:22,472
Yeah, I've been tracking him
for the last couple of weeks.

1411
01:38:23,544 --> 01:38:26,104
After he murdered Walter.
Walter Lilly.

1412
01:38:28,282 --> 01:38:29,579
Yeah, he's got my gun.

1413
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,842
- What...?
- Stay with him.

1414
01:38:31,052 --> 01:38:32,178
Where are you going?

1415
01:38:32,353 --> 01:38:34,116
- Stay with him.
- Where are you going?

1416
01:38:34,288 --> 01:38:36,153
Baby, I'll be back. All right.

1417
01:38:41,462 --> 01:38:44,693
Hey, he's gonna be all right.
He's a good cop.

1418
01:38:45,366 --> 01:38:47,960
You're a good cop.
Look what happened to you.

1419
01:38:49,704 --> 01:38:51,934
Oh, yeah. You got a point.

1420
01:39:05,686 --> 01:39:07,210
Hey. Hey, where you going?

1421
01:39:33,381 --> 01:39:34,405
Drop it.

1422
01:39:38,419 --> 01:39:40,216
You were easy.

1423
01:39:41,822 --> 01:39:43,187
Oh, God.

1424
01:39:45,259 --> 01:39:48,160
You already shot one cop.
Shooting another one's...

1425
01:39:48,329 --> 01:39:52,163
- ...not gonna help things with the jury.
- You're not a cop.

1426
01:39:52,733 --> 01:39:55,725
- Well, that's just hurtful.
- Get down on your knees.

1427
01:39:56,437 --> 01:39:59,565
My knees, they're not so great,
you know. Took a jump off a roof.

1428
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:02,766
The last thing I care about
is your knees, your health.

1429
01:40:03,411 --> 01:40:06,073
Now get down on your knees.

1430
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:11,541
Now what?

1431
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:13,380
Should have minded
your own business.

1432
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:19,223
- Not concerned about your future?
- It's time for you to go, asshole.

1433
01:40:20,461 --> 01:40:23,555
Drop it. And I'm the only one
who gets to call him "asshole."

1434
01:40:26,534 --> 01:40:27,865
You better tell your girl...

1435
01:40:31,238 --> 01:40:32,865
That's for calling me a girl.

1436
01:40:35,710 --> 01:40:39,578
That's for shooting at my wife.

1437
01:40:50,224 --> 01:40:54,752
So Earl Mahler was using Walter Lilly
to gain access to the narcotics cage.

1438
01:40:54,929 --> 01:40:58,763
That's right. He was gonna come clean,
but by the time I got to his apartment...

1439
01:40:58,933 --> 01:41:00,059
...he was already dead.

1440
01:41:00,234 --> 01:41:02,498
- But there was no proof it was Mahler.
- Right.

1441
01:41:02,703 --> 01:41:06,639
If it wasn't for that parking ticket,
he might have gotten away with it.

1442
01:41:06,807 --> 01:41:09,139
That's because
she's a hell of a reporter.

1443
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:10,334
Thank you.

1444
01:41:11,145 --> 01:41:13,113
But you did get one thing wrong.

1445
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,339
Oh, are you kidding? Come on.

1446
01:41:15,516 --> 01:41:17,108
I'm just saying.

1447
01:41:17,618 --> 01:41:21,281
Bobby, it looked really bad.
It really did.

1448
01:41:21,455 --> 01:41:23,753
I mean, your name
was on the suicide report.

1449
01:41:23,924 --> 01:41:26,950
- The bowling alley photo.
- I walked you down the goddamn aisle.

1450
01:41:27,128 --> 01:41:29,460
- That's what I said.
- Great. That's what he said.

1451
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:32,292
Wait. You serious?
She really thought I was involved?

1452
01:41:32,466 --> 01:41:34,934
Yeah. But then, you know,
she never liked you.

1453
01:41:35,102 --> 01:41:37,536
You know what?
Never liked your ass, either.

1454
01:41:40,508 --> 01:41:42,601
I gotta get this story in.

1455
01:41:47,748 --> 01:41:52,481
- Hello?
- I just want you to know that it is over.

1456
01:41:52,653 --> 01:41:54,621
You and me, we are through.

1457
01:41:55,289 --> 01:41:56,881
Stewart, are you drunk?

1458
01:41:57,057 --> 01:42:00,618
No, that is the aftereffects
of horse tranquilizers...

1459
01:42:00,795 --> 01:42:03,662
...that were injected
into my now-broken leg...

1460
01:42:03,831 --> 01:42:07,665
...by a local veterinarian, Nicole.

1461
01:42:07,835 --> 01:42:11,828
<i>Oh, we had something beautiful</i>
<i>and special and rare...</i>

1462
01:42:12,006 --> 01:42:16,375
...but if these are the kinds of people
you hang out with, you can forget it.

1463
01:42:16,544 --> 01:42:18,341
If that's the way you really feel....

1464
01:42:18,512 --> 01:42:21,072
Wait, no, no, no. Wait, no, hold on.
No, no, no, stop.

1465
01:42:21,282 --> 01:42:25,810
Are you admitting that we had
something beautiful, special and rare?

1466
01:42:25,986 --> 01:42:27,544
Stewart, I gotta go, okay?

1467
01:42:27,721 --> 01:42:31,384
Okay, you go. But just know
you have given my heart wings.

1468
01:42:31,559 --> 01:42:34,687
For moments ago,
I was barely able to walk...

1469
01:42:34,862 --> 01:42:39,094
...but now, now I will run to your side
with the...

1470
01:42:39,934 --> 01:42:42,528
- <i>Goddamn!</i>
- Stewart?

1471
01:42:42,703 --> 01:42:44,568
Hello?

1472
01:42:47,942 --> 01:42:51,105
- Do you know what I really wanna do?
- What?

1473
01:42:51,312 --> 01:42:54,543
I wanna blow off this story,
and I wanna take you home.

1474
01:42:57,551 --> 01:42:59,451
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

1475
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:01,247
Yeah.

1476
01:43:01,422 --> 01:43:06,086
But I gotta get this story in before
anybody gets wind of it. I just have to.

1477
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:09,195
- You understand that, right?
- Oh, totally. Don't...

1478
01:43:09,363 --> 01:43:10,523
- Listen, I get it.
- Yeah?

1479
01:43:10,698 --> 01:43:12,461
I get it. You're just doing your job.

1480
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,300
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1481
01:43:15,469 --> 01:43:16,766
Thank you.

1482
01:43:16,937 --> 01:43:18,768
That's not gonna be
an issue this time.

1483
01:43:18,939 --> 01:43:23,035
We both will sometimes
have to put our job first.

1484
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:25,269
It's like that, right?

1485
01:43:25,446 --> 01:43:27,038
Yeah.

1486
01:43:27,381 --> 01:43:30,282
Yep. But after....

1487
01:43:35,489 --> 01:43:37,081
We're actually doing this.

1488
01:43:37,591 --> 01:43:39,058
Yes, we are.

1489
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:47,793
Why are we pulling over here?

1490
01:43:50,671 --> 01:43:51,933
Here?

1491
01:43:54,441 --> 01:43:56,136
No.

1492
01:43:56,644 --> 01:43:58,236
You wouldn't.

1493
01:43:59,246 --> 01:44:01,305
I told you l was bringing you in.

1494
01:44:01,482 --> 01:44:05,009
And we have, oh,
five minutes to spare.

1495
01:44:05,786 --> 01:44:08,186
Now, don't be mad, babe...

1496
01:44:08,389 --> 01:44:11,290
...because we're never gonna get this
marriage going again...

1497
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:13,926
...if you come into it
with anger and resentment.

1498
01:44:14,094 --> 01:44:16,289
l would like to be
taken into custody, please.

1499
01:44:16,997 --> 01:44:18,589
Officer?

1500
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,967
Let's go.

1501
01:44:34,181 --> 01:44:37,708
This is ridiculous. Unbelievable.

1502
01:44:38,619 --> 01:44:40,348
Where did you...?

1503
01:44:41,422 --> 01:44:43,652
Aren't l entitled to a phone call?

1504
01:44:53,033 --> 01:44:55,001
It's the bounty hunter.

1505
01:44:55,169 --> 01:44:59,538
How was your weekend, asshole?
Did you set any more parades on fire?

1506
01:45:01,875 --> 01:45:05,140
Actually, Gelman, the rest
of my weekend was pretty quiet.

1507
01:45:05,312 --> 01:45:07,940
- Yeah?
- Until now.

1508
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,081
It'll go to the Internet edition...

1509
01:45:12,252 --> 01:45:16,484
...and then all media outlets will have
to come through us directly for details.

1510
01:45:16,657 --> 01:45:19,148
Great. Thanks.

1511
01:45:20,661 --> 01:45:25,098
Using your one call
to phone in a story. That is so you.

1512
01:45:25,265 --> 01:45:26,596
What are you doing here?

1513
01:45:26,767 --> 01:45:28,359
It's a special night, remember?

1514
01:45:28,969 --> 01:45:30,732
No way we're not
spending it together.

1515
01:45:30,904 --> 01:45:33,202
Hey, can we go
in the same cell together?

1516
01:45:33,374 --> 01:45:34,602
Get in the cell, dickhead.

1517
01:45:34,775 --> 01:45:36,766
- Let's go.
- I'm going.

1518
01:45:45,753 --> 01:45:47,220
You're crazy.

1519
01:45:47,921 --> 01:45:49,013
Maybe I am.

1520
01:45:51,392 --> 01:45:52,552
Come here.

1521
01:46:08,776 --> 01:46:10,641
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

1522
01:46:11,612 --> 01:46:14,445
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

1523
