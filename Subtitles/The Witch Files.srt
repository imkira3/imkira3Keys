Okay.

5
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:23,153
Detention.

6
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:25,982
Necessary evil, or an outdated
mode of incarceration--

7
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:30,856
Okay.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,902
In three, two...

9
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:35,035
Detention.

10
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,601
Still an important part
of modern school discipline,

11
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,386
or an antiquated vestige?

12
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,518
From Brunswick High News,
I'm Claire Mclaskey and--

13
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:41,911
No, no, no!

14
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,394
Okay,
lets start with your name.

15
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:47,482
People know me.

16
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:49,397
Totally,
but for posterity.

17
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,138
Brooke Cabot.

18
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,748
And what are you in
detention for?

19
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,359
You know how
to work this thing?

20
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:56,534
I do. Yeah.

21
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,188
The school paper
got us a new camera

22
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,060
but not new tripods.

23
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,844
Our school has a paper?

24
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:04,977
Yeah, a paper and
a weekly news show, too.

25
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,850
I was in Algebra
and Mr. Clark,

26
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:08,981
since he's an old perv...

27
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:11,027
asked me what I was
doing this weekend.

28
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,725
I said, "Your mom"
and he got all flus-ltrated.

29
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,727
And would you say
detention is worthwhile?

30
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:16,946
Rehabilitation-wise?

31
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:19,079
It's a huge
pain in my dick.

32
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,558
We done, Spielsberg?

33
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:22,734
You can state your name
whenever you're ready.

34
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,736
Uh, Mary Jane LaFont.

35
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:26,521
Call me MJ.

36
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:28,697
I was making out with
someone in the hallway.

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,307
Oh,
anyone's in particular? Or...

38
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:32,440
Yes. Darren.

39
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:36,139
My boyfriend of two years,
thank you very much.

40
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:37,749
He's in detention
across the hall.

41
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,403
That is what you
should do a story about.

42
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:41,231
How the people in this town
are still just as Puritan

43
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,190
as they were when they
murdered all of those witches.

44
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,061
Oh no, that's actually
never been proven.

45
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,018
The townspeople...
Okay. That's fine.

46
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,237
Look, I'm just saying,

47
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,239
why separate the boys
from the girls?

48
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,589
It is wicked sexist.

49
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:54,505
Does detention work?

50
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,203
Will you rethink your
actions in the future?

51
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:57,291
No, he's my boyfriend,

52
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,336
I'm gonna kiss him
when I want to.

53
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,382
Besides, we're gonna
get married soon

54
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,949
and put this whole state
in our rearview.

55
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:05,125
Okay.

56
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,387
Greta.

57
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,780
Here because I ditched
AP Chem yesterday.

58
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,131
And there's nothing
redeeming about detention.

59
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,044
Why'd you skip
your class?

60
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,176
Commitments...

61
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,439
are more important
to me than neutrons.

62
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,441
We had a game against
Westbrook last night,

63
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,747
and I've got
a fullback sweeper

64
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,444
who's been having
trouble with her flick.

65
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:21,793
She was worried
since we wouldn't have

66
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,621
much of a warm-up
given the drive to their field,

67
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,233
so she asked if I could give
her a one-on-one refresher.

68
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:28,104
Can you say that
in English?

69
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,801
I'm captain of the
field hockey team.

70
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:30,933
Those are hockey terms.

71
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,630
Well, did we win?
Against Westbrook?

72
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,066
Ms. Mclaskey?
No. The Ref was an idiot.

73
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,111
Yeah?

74
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,634
How much longer
will this take?

75
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:38,288
Um, I have permission
from the principal

76
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,420
to conduct these interviews

77
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:41,291
And that's why
I'm allowing them.

78
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:42,858
I asked you how long.

79
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,773
Another twenty minutes?

80
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,122
Make it five.
Okay.

81
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,168
This shouldn't be
a social call.

82
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,735
I'm pretty much done.

83
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,998
Unless... you'd like
to say something.

84
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,348
In the black hoodie.

85
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,827
Sorry,
I don't know your name.

86
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,046
Don't bother.

87
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:59,135
She's new, and she doesn't
talk to anybody.

88
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,399
She just creeps around being
all grim and premenstrual.

89
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,619
I hear she worships Satan, too.

90
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:05,620
Oh!

91
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:06,795
Hi.

92
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,057
I'm Jules.

93
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,450
I'm a Leo.

94
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:11,582
I think detention is
a great way to meet people.

95
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,280
You're kidding, right?

96
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:15,151
I'm also not new.

97
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,980
I was born in Brunswick
and just moved back.

98
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,809
My family's been part
of this town since, like,

99
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:22,332
pre-Revolutionary War.

100
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,291
What got in detention?

101
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:25,640
Nate Aldrich?

00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:27,990
I call him "The Groper."

104
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,122
He's been at it
since like the third grade.

105
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,037
Yeah, he tried to
feel me up in Physics,

106
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,474
so I pushed him.

107
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:35,650
Wait, are you the reason
he's on crutches today?

108
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:37,478
He's like over
two hundred pounds.

109
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:39,219
How did you you push him?

110
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:41,351
I just...

111
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:42,787
believed I could.

112
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,833
Are you a Scientologist?

113
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,356
No.
I get it.

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,053
It's like "The Secret"
type stuff.

115
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,098
I've been telling
my teammates

116
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,317
all about the law
of attraction...

117
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,535
how it can help us
score more.

118
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,189
All you--
Yeah, that's not it, either.

119
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,192
You realize a girl like you
comes along every year, right?

120
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,454
Trying to be a witch
in Brunswick

121
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,935
is like wearing mouse ears
at Disney.

122
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,023
Oooh.

123
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,025
I'm not trying
to be anything.

124
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,027

full of crap,

superpowers to good use

127

Okay.

I'm with you.
Me, too.

132

Wait.
Don't do something crazy,

133
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:19,955

134

So let me guess,

150
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,084
you coordinated that with
one of your emo friends?

151
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,651
Yeah, because I have
so many friends

to plan stuff with.

153
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,523
Then how did you do it?

154
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,264

You helped.

Thoughts have power,
especially in a group.

160
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,533
I've read about that theory.

161
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:17,752
Like, how big groups
get together

162
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,319
and meditate on peace

163
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,886
and it briefly lowers
crime rates in the area.

164
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,367
Yeah, there's people who
believe they can fly, too.

165
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,760
And then they eat pavement.

166
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:28,415
This is just messing
with your world-view, huh?

167
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,982
I mean, it's warping your
skinny, rich-bitch mind.

168
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,333
Okay, first of all,
thanks for calling me skinny.

169
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:34,551
And secondly, no,

170
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,292
I don't believe anything
magical happened.

171
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
Okay, well I do

172
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,425
and I wanna learn
how to do that.

173
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:39,600
Like, can do that on my own?

174
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:42,342
God, you scared me, dip-shits.

175
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,432
Um, awkward.
Um, gross.

176
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,737
Claire, right?
Yeah?

177
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,305
I'm Jason,
we take trig class together.

178
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,307
Oh.
We're free to go.

179
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,309
There, uh, isn't not enough time
to reset the alarm

180
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,963
so detention's over.

181
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:56,660
Really? Sweet.
Wow.

182
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,054
Can I actually
meet you at the car?

183
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,664
We're finishing up something.

184
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:02,405
He's quite the catch.

185
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,798
You're damn right.

186
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,452
Hey, how... hey!

187
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,932
Hey, can you teach us
that stuff?

188
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,370
If you're serious.
I can try.

189
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,284
But it's more religion
than hobby,

190
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,764
and it's not for everyone.

191
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,636
You said we could be more
powerful in a group, right?

192
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,246
Um-hm.

193
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,596
I'll be in Merrymeeting Park
tonight if you're interested.

194
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,815
At Hag's Rock.

195
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,207
Midnight.

196
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,295
And it has
to be midnight,

197
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,819
because that's so much
"witchier."

198
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:26,821
Midnight is transitional.

199
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:28,257
And Hag's Rock is special

200
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,433
because the places where
people were brutally killed

201
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,653
can hold onto
residual energy.

202
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,306

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,790
<font color="#FFFF00">(SCOFFS)</font>
We wouldn't want that.

326
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,140
Hey, what's
your malfunction?

327
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:07,014
If you're drinking, stop.

328
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,493
Or leave.

329
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,844
Your desire and intention
need to be crystal clear.

330
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:13,629
Wait. Brooke?

331
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,586
Let her go.

332
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,458
Relax.
I'm draining the weasel.

333

<font color="#FFFF00">(DISTANT OWL HOOTS)</font>

334
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:29,166
Looks kinda...
Satanic.

335
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,777
Satanists use
the pentagram

336
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,909
with its two points up,

337
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,390
representing devil's horns.

338
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:38,741
Which is why people think
that witches worship Satan...

339
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,308
they're looking at it wrong.

340
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,179
From where I'm standing,

341
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:44,965
it symbolizes the four
primal elements

342
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,227
earth,

343
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,882
wind,

344
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,448
fire,

345
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,754
and water.

346
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,843
What's the fifth?
School spirit?

347
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,019
You're actually close
for once.

348
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,804
It's just Spirit,

349
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,893
it represents those
who've lived before us

350
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,808
and passed on...

351
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,593
since their energy can
never truly be extinguished.

352
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,334
Grab a tool

353
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:09,163
and dig a hole
at one of the five points.

354
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,078
Then we'll cut off
a lock of hair,

355
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,819
and bury it as an offering.

356
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,256
I don't think
extensions count.

357
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,127
Um, I don't think
you count.

358
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,568
I came up here in fifth grade
once for a field trip.

359
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,179
Oh yeah.
Me too.

360
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,485
Hold still.

361
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:32,926
Is anyone else
getting eaten alive?

362
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,799
These instructions
have been in my family

363
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:37,931
for generations.

364
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,976
What are those?
Spells?

365
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:41,935
Two chants.

366
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:44,328
One of which we'll do tonight,
is called "Bonding."

367
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,940
It's a way of sealing a group
of like-minded souls.

368
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:47,941
Hate to break it to you,

369
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,681
but we couldn't
be more different.

370
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,814
We're all here,
aren't we?

371
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,121
What do you mean chants?

372
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,297
Words we say in unison.

373
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,473
It's a way of focusing
a coven's intention.

374
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:01,215
Is that what we are?
A coven?

375
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:02,477
Not yet.

376
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,001
<font color="#FFFF00">(ALL IN UNISON)</font>
By the air of our breath.

377
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:07,264
The fire in our blood.

378
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,484
The water of our wombs.

379
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,703
The earth in our bodies.

380
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:14,358
May this circle
be sanctioned,

381
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,491
welcomed, and bonded.

382
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:18,928
Are these like,
Girl Scout cookies

383
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,582
or did you get them
from the store?

384
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,193
I think just from the store.

385
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,760
How long should we give it?

386
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,240
Doesn't say.

387
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:28,546
Maybe it's dumb to wait.
Maybe it's not that literal.

388
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,200
Well, Claire?

389
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,245
You said that the town

390
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,899
didn't really burn
witches here?

391
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,552
From what I've read,
yeah.

392
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,164
It's well documented
that these woods were used

393
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:40,123
as a meeting place for Pagan
and Wiccan ritual practices,

394
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,995
hence the term,
Merrymeeting Park.

395
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,997
Did you just say
"hence"?

396
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,999
And it's true that
several women died here

397
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:49,698
in late 1600's,
pre Salem Witch Trials.

398
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:52,832
But diaries of the town Pastor
and local officials

399
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,486
say that they were
found dead at Hag's Rock.

400
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,010
And history remembers
them as witches

401
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,708
when they were probably just,
like, outspoken women.

402
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:00,927
Right?

403
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,145
Like, they just mentioned
to the mens folk

404
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:03,712
a few things that
could've been run better

405
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,018
around town and then...
whuddya know...

406
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,194
were later found decapitated.

407
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,718
I always try to remember
the one bright spot.

408
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,459
Mary Perkins.

409
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,548
She was found
among the dead...

410
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,767
cold and shivering with
rope burns around her neck

411
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,291
but she was still alive.

412
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,466
Really?

413
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:19,641
I don't know about her.

414
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,512
Well did she ever
say what happened?

415
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:22,774
No.
She was unable to speak

416
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:24,559
because of the damage
to her throat,

417
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:27,562
so they jailed her
for the murders.

418
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,912
Later she escaped
and blamed the town.

419
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,610
Said they tried to form a mob
and tried to kill them.

420
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,656
I'm with her.
This town blows.

421

422
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:37,702
Holy crap.

423
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:40,009
MJ, did you tell Darren
you were coming up here?

424
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,445
No.

425
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:45,058
Check it out!
Oh my God.

426
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,016
Where's our hair?
That is messed up.

427
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,322
Were any of you followed?

428
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,585
Ah, man.
We should leave.

429
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:51,412
Now.

430
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:52,674
Guys.

431
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,371
Didn't we want
something to happen?

432
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,334
So the hunter
has become the hunted.

433
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,510
Tell us, how does it feel
to be on camera, Claire?

434
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,642
She plans on being
a national news anchor, Pete.

435
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:05,774
I think she's fine.

436
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:06,862
You're not filming over

437
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,994
anything I've already shot,
right?

438
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,430
I'm not a complete idiot.

439
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:10,910
Hey, that detention story,

440
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,694
can you get it to me tomorrow,
before press-time?

441
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,478
Uh, it's kinda
become a bigger deal.

442
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,611
I know you're gunning
for a Pulitzer Prize,

443
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:17,873
but we have a quota--
Give it.

444
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,920
Eating alone.
Mm-hmm.

445
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,965
Is this by choice?

446
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,185
Everything you say
sounds like a news teaser.

447
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:26,926
Dining solo...
tonight at eleven.

448
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,275
Is it weird for you
to be back?

449
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:30,625
I mean, are any of your
friends still around?

450
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,148
Nah, it's been too long.

451
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,237
Well, you could've
sat with me.

452
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm okay with
not having friends.

453
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,634
You're in my History class,
right?

454
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,897
Mrs. Fuller's?
Mm-hmm.

455
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,377
That's awful,

456
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,728
especially since I pride myself
on being observant.

457
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,860
To be fair...
this is a new do.

458
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:49,992
Okay, so someone
must have been

459
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,820
screwing with us
last night, right?

460
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:53,256
How did they know
where to dig?

461
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,737
Uh, they were watching us
from the woods.

462
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,482
Okay, it says here that,

463
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,787
if our coven were
deemed worthy,

464
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,224
our offerings would then be--

465
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,616
Darren. Don't--

466
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,140
What's so important you
can't sit with me, babe?

467
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,532
Just leave it.
Give it.

468
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,449
You plannin' some kinda
medieval surprise party for me?

469
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,711
Hand it over.
Ow.

470
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,409
I'm just foolin'.

471
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:19,369
Darren, just go sit,
I'll join you in a minute.

472
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:20,501
MJ, c'mon.

473
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,894
Darren. Sit!

474
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,680
Hey Claire,

475
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:26,724
you crack that trig homework?

476
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,335
I haven't even started it.

477
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:29,945
It's next period.

478
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,468
I work fast.
Did he rip it, Jules?

479
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:32,513
Its fine.
Okay. Awesome.

480
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,080
Well I feel super dumb.

481
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:36,125
What a douche.

482
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,735
You better not
mean my Darren.

483
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,389
What if I do?

484
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:41,565
Hey Brooke,
you wanna sit with me?

485
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,219
No, I have
a seat already.

486
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,916
You guys,
here comes Brooke.

487
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,876
It's like, you're obviously
horrific looking.

488
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,660
Why do you think
you can speak to me?

489
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,271
Brooke, what do you
think happened last night?

490
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,099
I know what happened.

491
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,404
it worked.

492
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,363
Right?

493
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,321
Mm-hmm.
Our offers were accepted.

494
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,323
So what happens now?

495
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,673
The second chant is called
"Commencement."

496
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,240
There's nothing else on there?

497
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:05,546
It's torn off.

498
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,547
I mean, there might have
been something, but...

499
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,506
So let's do it,
let's commence.

500
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,812
Do you wanna sit?

501
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:13,119
No.
I have an image to protect.

502
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,555
But we can use my house.

503
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,078
My mom will be out.

504
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,427
Eleven pm?

505
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:18,733
Can't we just
meet after school?

506
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,040
Sneaking out really
isn't easy for me.

507
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,215
I got a game,

508
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,520
then after that all
the varsity teams

509
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,914
are decorating the gym
for the Spring Fling.

510
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,525
Guys, I can't.
What? C'mon.

511
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,918
I'm sorry,
am I the only one

512
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:32,442
who couldn't sleep
last night?

513
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,228
I thought this is
something I wanted but...

514
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,577
I'm sorry.

515
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,969
So, you're just pussing out?

516
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:40,363
Look, I don't know
where it comes from.

517
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:41,190
The magic.

518
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,235
I don't want to be in league

519
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,671
with like some demon
or something.

520
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:45,107
You're not.

521
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,718
We're tapping into
natural vibrations.

522
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,372
But from where?

523
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,895
All around.

524
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,767
Nature.
The sky.

525
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,421
Even spirits of past witches.

526
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,945
So ghosts?
That's comforting.

527
00:17:56,988 --> 00:18:00,122
Look, MJ, I can't
tell you not to bail,

528
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,082
but we're bonded now.

529
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,474
If you decide
not to commence,

530
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,433
then there is no coven.

531
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:10,001
Don't let Brooke pressure you
into becoming a witch.

532
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,917
I just, I just don't want
to disappoint anyone.

533
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,876
Not a sentence
I thought I'd ever say.

You did.
Before I wanted to.

541
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,852
That was mean.
How well do you know MJ?

542
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,332
As well as you do.

543

Mr. Dwyer?

546
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:45,385
Why must you insist
on speaking during my lectures?

547
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,952
Why do you lecture
during my conversations?

I mean an
energetic purification.

555
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,713
The base energy here
is very selfish.

556
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,280
Shallow even.

557

Now I'm casting the circle,

the salt in the forest.

559

Like a spell or whatever.

But there were only two
chants on the paper, right?

So, do we

Leave.
I think we do.

00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:12,712
Oh my God.
That was awesome!

685
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,757
Maybe I don't need
that part-time job, after all.

Mm-hmm.

Wait, what was that?
How'd it work?

I mean, we didn't

00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:33,080
You're over-thinking it.

Since you're so

He was such
a creepy mo-fo.

that it effected his dating life
and he stayed single.

That's clever.

743
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,783
That's really clever,
but your witticisms

744
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,785
aren't going to help you

Poe basically thought
stories were best when

00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,617
they achieved a single emotional 
effect on the reader.

when your smarter friend
isn't around to help you?

No. I beat him at tennis

we shook hands after,

00:28:58,475 --> 00:28:59,650
he asked me.

800
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:01,130
I figured he was gay...

00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:08,355
I actually think he's prettier
than Justin Beebs.

805
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:10,009
Alright, witches.

806
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:12,054
We all have things
that we all want, right?

807
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:14,056
And I'm not just talking
about shopping anymore.

808
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,318
I think this group
should be about

809
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,320
helping each other
get what we want.

810
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:19,627
So let's meet tonight
with lists.

811
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,021
Let me guess, midnight?

812
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:36,731
Greta's pretty good, huh?

813
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,081
She's great.

814
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,387
I never cared about
any of our sports

815
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,389
because I never knew
any of the players.

816
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,827
Hey, uh
I'm walkin' home.

817
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:47,524
Wanna join?

818
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,831
Has the town changed a lot
since you were last here?

819
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,703
Yeah,
somehow its even lamer.

820
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:55,489
What does that say
about me that I like it?

821
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,056
It says that you're
a Labra-Doodle.

822
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,579
<font color="#FFFF00">(BOTH LAUGH)</font>

823
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,016
Hold up.
Say that again?

824
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,757
Not while you're recording.

825
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,021
Claire just explained to me
why witches ride brooms.

826
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:08,284
A theory I read.
That's all.

827
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:09,808
They were drug addicts?

828
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,419
Okay, there's this mold

829
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:14,508
that grows on
really old rye bread.

830
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:17,032
And if you eat it,
you hallucinate,

831
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:19,730
but if you swallow too much,
than you'll die.

832
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:23,038
So to get the fun effects
without the danger,

833
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:26,041
you can let it seep through
your bloodstream via...

834
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,173
another area.

835
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,349
Oh, like your vagina!

836
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:30,916
<font color="#FFFF00">(NERVOUS LAUGHING)</font>

837
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,876
Well they may have
wiped the mold

838
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,052
on things like
broom handles,

839
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:40,099
and rubbed it
between their legs.

840
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:44,016
Hence the reports
of ladies in fields

841
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,495
"riding" their brooms.

842
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,019
Gross.

843
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:49,760
I'd at least have the decency
to do that indoors.

844
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,762
So, what happens if
your parents catch you

845
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,329
sneaking out at night?

846
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:56,115
That would be really creepy
because they're both dead.

847
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,074
Oh, man.

848
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,771
Open mouth, insert foot.

849
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,948
Nah.
It's ancient history.

850
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,385
At the moment I'm living
with foster parents who are--

851
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,344
Get off her!
What're you doing?

852
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,651
Let me go.
Hey!

853
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:14,263
Oh.
Let's make sure
she's not following us.

854
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:15,874
What the hell was that?

855
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:18,050
<font color="#FFFF00">(NERVOUS LAUGH)</font>

856
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,401
That was insane?
Should we call the cops?

857
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:23,446
How is it,
are you okay?

858
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,449
Yeah, just...
freaked out.

859
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,712
How'd you do that?

860
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,279
I dunno.
I just...

861
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:32,716
wanted her away from you
and suddenly she was.

862
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,501
Wow. Reflex.

863
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:35,067
Yeah.

864
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,678
1971.
Stanford University.

865
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:39,985
An experiment, divided
students into two groups,

866
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:41,769
prisoners and guards.

867
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:44,337
Those acting as guards
soon became so abusive,

868
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,208
the experiment was terminated.

869
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:47,775
What would stop the
same thing from happening,

870
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:49,908
say, to a teacher
asked to preside over

871
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,605
high school detention?

872
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:53,520
The psychologist
who created the experiment,

873
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:54,956
was quoted as saying,

874
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,610
"Only a few people
were able to resist

875
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,090
"the situational temptations

876
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,309
to yield to power
and dominance."

877
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:02,094
Ha!

878
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,531
Remember our talk,
about knocking?

879
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:05,793
My name is Emily,

880
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:08,839
and I enjoy l-l-long
walks on the b-beach.

881
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:10,363
Emily!?

882
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:12,974
A-are you m-m-making
a sex-tape?

883
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,759
No! You're gross.
Get out!

884
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:19,024
I see Claire's working,

885
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,199
have you done
your homework?

886
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:22,244
Kinda.
N-no.

887
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:23,463
Go.

888
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:25,160
Yeah, go.

889
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:27,815
I'll g-get you in your sleep.

890
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,382
Are you pulling
another late one?

891
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:30,861
Have to.

892
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,559
Hey, um...

893
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:34,953
could they've
messed up my glasses?

894
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,171
What're you talking about?

895
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:38,130
At the lens place
or whatever?

896
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:39,870
Why?

897
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,090
Why's she waiting outside?

898
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:43,918
Hey girl, what's up?

899
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,094
We need a new locale.

900
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:48,140
My mom's has that same
ass-clown over again.

901
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,880
Gross.
Get your ass in the car.

902
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:53,058
Okay, lists.
Who has one?

903
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:55,060
Jules?
Now you're filming, too?
Mm-hmm.

904
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,626
You created a monster.

905
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,237
Just read your list.

906
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,586
Okay.

907
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,849
Number one.
Darren proposes to me.

908
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:02,981
Aw.
Aw. C'mon.

909
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:03,851
What!?

910
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:05,026
He's gonna do that anyway!

911
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,462
I don't know.

912
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:08,247
He's talkin' about
the Army after school.

913
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,292
Life could pull him
in all sorts of directions.

914
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:13,034
That's not a bad thing.
That's life.

915
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:15,384
You said make a list!

916
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:16,690
What else is on there?

917
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,039
Thank you.

918
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:20,607
Thighs.

919
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,695
Butt.

920
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:24,045
Boobs.
That's the big one.

921
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:27,048
Okay, I got food.
Y'all witches ready to eat?

922
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:28,963
I wanna beat
Westbrook tomorrow.

923
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,704
Won't that happen anyway?

924
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:33,489
They got this new goalie.
She's like a brick wall.

925
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:36,318
But if we beat them, we can
make it all the way to State.

926
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:40,018
Oh, and another thing,
I want a new car.

927
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,237
Since I keep driving around
this cracker-ass coven

928
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,065
like some kinda
Driving Miss Daisy sequel.

929
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,197
They have their own trailer,

930
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,503
and they feed them like,
filet mignon.

931
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,810
So what if, on the way
to one of these shows,

932
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:52,465
the Dobermans just...
turned on her?

933
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:53,553
Bit her in the face?

934
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:55,207
I'm not chanting
for show dogs

935
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,817
to kill your dad's girlfriend.

936
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,297
Who said kill?

937
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,951
I'm just talking a few nips
to the head and neck,

938
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:02,301
some light scarring,

939
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,129
maybe a temporary
eye patch.

940
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,218
I also want my mom
to lay off the booze.

941
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,958
It's outta control.

942
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,222
...Turn this thing on?
Oh, wait I got it.

943
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:12,746
Claire,
you're such a girl scout!

944
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:13,747
What?

945
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,965
Oh, come on.

946
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,532
Nothing for yourself?

947
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,056
Just a job for dear 'ol dad

948
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,405
and no stuttering
for little sister?

949
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:20,928
Guys, I really thought about

950
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:22,408
what would make
my life better.

951
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,714
And it's these two things,
trust me.

952
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:27,195
Jules, how about you?
What do you want?

953
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,284
First thing on my list
is to fly.

954
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:30,764
Whoa.

955
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,026
Can we really?

956
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,593
We're witches.

957
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:35,073
What's the second?

958
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,815
At this year's Spring Fling,

959
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,643
I want to be crowned
Flower Queen.

961
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,125
What?
It's never someone like me.

962
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,432
It's always some
stuck-up bulimic bitch.

963
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,303
Um, it was me last year?

964
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:51,437
But you really think
I could pass for bulimic?

965
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,134
Wow.
Thank you.

966
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:56,442
I just think it'd be cool
for people on the fringes.

967
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,487
That'd be a big spell,
right?

968
00:34:58,531 --> 00:34:59,967
The entire school
would have to think

969
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,621
you're the best candidate.

970
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:03,840
That doesn't feel right.

971
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:06,408
It's like giving everyone
a date rape drug.

972

973
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,238
Yeah, who made you
Spell Sheriff?

974
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,631
No one.

975
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:13,285
And we've proven that
it doesn't take all of us

976
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:16,244

Well, there's just
things that I think

979
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,161
we should mess with.

980
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:21,467

989
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,054

Alright.

991
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,666
How about we limit
this first session

00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:47,928
to two things each.

993
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,712
Would that un-knot
your panties?

994
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,149
It might.

995
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,933
And I don't want
the dog attack anymore,

996
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:54,848

997

I'm not asking for the whole

1000

just vote for me and put
that stupid tiara on my head.

1001

I'm so proud of you, dad.

No, she said she might
catch up with us later.

doesn't require a party hat.

So...
Any tips?

We're on public property,

00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:39,693
It's about time I got on

1263
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,566
So, you girls were shopping

1264
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,831
you left Kurier with some

00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:49,485
Would you happen
to have the receipts?

1266
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:51,923
Is there a problem
with them?

1267
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:56,275
Security footage shows
you just... walking out.

1268
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:57,842
Not paying.

1269
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,582

1270
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:01,193
He says you paid.

1271
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:02,760
Because we did.

1272
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:05,545
Cash or credit?

1273
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:07,242
Credit.
Cash.

1274
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:11,899
The drawer came up short,

Let me get this straight?

1277
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,339
If you're tight with
some local detective,

1278
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:19,124

See, now I'm surprised
this is unpleasant.

1281
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:26,000

clear this up quickly.

at the lake last night...

1442
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,199
that was a surprise
to me, too. Okay?

1443
00:53:22,242 --> 00:53:24,331
My plan was to actually
see if you'd be my date

1444
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,377
to the Spring Fling
tomorrow night.

1445
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:29,206
Terrible timing.
I'm now a lesbian.

1446
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:32,383
Is that's supposed
to be a deterrent?

1447
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:34,123
Look, okay,

1448
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,169
I won't get into
who kissed who first,

1449
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,737
it was dumb,
and I regret it.

1450
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,608
Would you give me a chance
to make it up to you?

1451
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:43,089
Look, you seem like a great guy but--
Uh-oh.

1452
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:45,265
That's like starting a sentence,
"With all due respect."

1453
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:46,658
But I'm just,

1454
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,747
I'm dealing with a lot
of heavy stuff right now.

1455
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,227
Anything I can lift for you?

1456
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,445
I've seen the way
you pick things up,

1457
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:53,491
so no thanks.

1458
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:56,929
Well, if you get your stuff
figured out by tomorrow,

1459
00:53:56,972 --> 00:53:58,235
call me?

1460
00:53:58,278 --> 00:53:59,801
Please?

1461
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:01,586
Pretty please?

We chant for our powers
to go away.

1463
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:05,372
For everything
to return to normal.

1464
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:07,113
And where does the energy
for that spell come from?

1465
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:09,420
I mean, it could
make us sicker, right?

1466
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:11,030
We go to Hag's Rock tonight,

1467
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:12,814
because it's
a powerful place...

1468
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:16,296
and we chant to diminish
just Brooke's ability.

1469
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,993
Yeah, I just...
I don't know.

1470
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:22,215
There has to be a way
to unlink ourselves,

1471
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,478
to reverse the bonding.

1472
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,611
You really don't trust Brooke?

1473
00:54:26,654 --> 00:54:28,265
I do actually

1474
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:30,789
and she was very clear
about not stopping

1475
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:34,532
and doing anything
to keep her powers.

Well he did a few things.

1500
00:55:25,104 --> 00:55:26,497
One was a big PR move.

1501
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,237
He downplayed public fears

1502
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:30,588
by keeping confidence
in the economy up

1503
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:32,938
and then he tried to get
across this idea of...

So is the detention story
not happening?

a random home invasion?

else to tell the cops.

Thought we weren't
doing magic anymore, Claire.

1601
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:03,164
Thought the price
was too high.

Here's a tip.

1603
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,951
If you're gonna disappear,

1604
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,431
drop the camera.

You get that lightning

1613
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:35,675
is shooting outta my
finger tips, right?

1614
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,808
And you're hiding behind
a propane truck?

1615

I'm not afraid of you,

And you can't surprise me
like you did Jules.

Oh, whoa.

That's big of you, Claire.

I don't wanna hurt you.

Nice redirect.

1630
01:01:28,467 --> 01:01:30,382
I woke up this morning
with the word "Slut"

1631
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:31,775
all over my skin.

1632
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:34,647
Tiny tattoo's that took
forever to wash off.

1633
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,345
I didn't put
any words on you.

1634
01:01:38,346 --> 01:01:41,436
Jules had some of your hair
from wrestling with you.

1635
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,612
My hair?

1636
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:45,484
I didn't wrestle with--

1637
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:48,008
The only hair I left behind
was what we buried.

1638
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,883
Possible for us
to come see you?

No.

What would you call that?

Because I might
call that a witch's wart.

1650

Let's never fight again, huh?

1651
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:22,782
Hey, I just thought
of something.

1652
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:25,176
Your hearing,
my crappy vision...

1653
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:27,744
but what did Jules say
her issue was?

1654
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:30,007
It was like, uterus stuff,
right?

1655
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:33,575
It was all internal.

1656
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:35,577
Stuff we could only
take her word for.

1657
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,362
There you are.

1658
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:38,972
She'll see you now.

01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,978
Some wild reports from
the village center tonight.

1660
01:02:45,022 --> 01:02:47,938
Lot like the calls I heard
come in seventeen years ago.

1661
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:52,812
So why the sudden interest
in those girls I mentioned?

1662
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,683
You said it ended badly?

1663
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:57,382
Three of them are dead...

1664
01:02:57,425 --> 01:02:59,819
the other two missing,
presumed dead.

1665
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,908
There were five of them.
Like us.

1666
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:05,172
Hey, any clearer ones of her?

1667
01:03:05,216 --> 01:03:06,521
Not really.

1668
01:03:06,565 --> 01:03:08,785
There's that...
and this one.

1669
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:12,049
Abby Butcher.
One of the missing.

1670
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:14,355
I tried to get more
info from next of kin,

1671
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:16,401
but she was
a foster kid and frankly,

1672
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:19,447
nobody seemed to care
that she was gone, so...

1673
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,233
It's been a cold case
around here

1674
01:03:22,276 --> 01:03:23,800
for everyone but me.

1675
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,584
So why do you
stick with it?

1676
01:03:25,627 --> 01:03:27,238
It's my job.

1677
01:03:33,026 --> 01:03:34,811
That's Lisa Strauss.

1678
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:36,595
She's been missing
since 1983,

1679
01:03:36,638 --> 01:03:38,858
when she got involved
with another group of girls

1680
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:41,252
who used to gather up
at Hag's Rock.

1681
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:43,471
She's a Strauss, too?

1682
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:44,951
She's my older sister.

1683
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:46,866
Isn't that, like,
a conflict of interest

1684
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,302
or something?

1685
01:03:48,346 --> 01:03:50,739
Would you rather no one
be working on this case?

1686
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,089
Guess I'm okay with it.

1687
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:53,438
Well that's a load off.

1688
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:55,962
Hey, take away
this bad haircut

1689
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:58,269
and replace it with
a try-hard hombre dye job,

1690
01:03:58,312 --> 01:03:59,531
and who do you have?

1691
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:00,749
What?

1692
01:04:00,793 --> 01:04:01,925
She would've been,
a baby back then.

1693
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:03,491
Okay, who're we
talking about, here?

1694
01:04:03,535 --> 01:04:05,015
Our friend Jules.

1695
01:04:05,058 --> 01:04:07,669
Well "Friend"
is an overstatement.

1696
01:04:07,713 --> 01:04:10,020
The three girls who died,
they...

1697
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:11,499
Poison.

1698
01:04:11,543 --> 01:04:13,893
We sent blood samples
to the forensic labs upstate,

1699
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:16,287
they pinpointed a rare
type of mold

1700
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,767
that I don't believe
they ate accidentally.

1701
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:20,900
Huh?

1702
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:23,381
Does, that mean
something to you?

1703
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:33,173
If the principal
ever finds out I let you in,

1704
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:34,740
there go my privileges.

1705
01:04:34,783 --> 01:04:35,959
I wouldn't have gotten
you out of bed

1706
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:37,743
if this weren't really
important.

1707
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:39,658
Well there's no use
in my going back home now,

1708
01:04:39,701 --> 01:04:41,834
so is there anything
I can help you with?

1709
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,445
We need our yearbook
from seventeen years ago.

1710
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:47,100
Look out for any blurry
photos of her, too.

1711
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:48,493
That could easily be a spell.

1712
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:49,886
Here we go.

1713
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:52,236
Who does this
look like to you?

1714
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:53,193
Whoa?

1715
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:54,499
Claire,
that name you gave me,

1716
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:55,500
is that a joke?

1717
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:56,762
Why?

1718
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:58,807
Well Abby Butcher
is an old Brunswick name.

1719
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,722
So old
that this list came up.

1720
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:06,250
Women found dead
in Merrymeeting Park in 1689.

1721
01:05:06,293 --> 01:05:08,861
That can't be...
the name in the middle.

1722
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,341
Julia Sutton.

1723
01:05:10,384 --> 01:05:12,430
Isn't that the same--
Whoa, what picture is that?

1724
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:15,172
It's a woodcut depicting
the supposed rituals

1725
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:16,434
at Merrymeeting.

1726
01:05:16,477 --> 01:05:17,696
Can you
cross-reference that list

1727
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:18,697
with students enrolled here?

1728
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,177
Holy crap.

1729
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,831
Look who was Flower Queen
seventeen years ago.

1730
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:24,529
Abby F'ing Butcher.

1731
01:05:24,572 --> 01:05:25,834
Oh my gosh.

1732
01:05:25,878 --> 01:05:28,359
Here she is again.
In 1966.

1733
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:30,535
Using the name
Susannah Martin.

1734
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:33,755
This is our oldest one,
from 1932.

1735
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:35,801
And here's a girl
named Martha Carrier,

1736
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:38,891
same name as one of the
accused Brunswick witches.

1737
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,414
Similar features.

1738
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:42,764
I'm confused.

1739
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,636
What do these girls
have in common?

1740
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:48,596
They might be
the same person.

1741
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,643
They might even be a witch

1742
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,906
who is three-hundred
plus years old.

1743
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:57,866
One who returns to Brunswick
every seventeen years

1744
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:02,480
and uses the names of her
original victims as aliases.

1745
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:04,308
This is a show
you've been binging

1746
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:06,397
or this is real life?

1747
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,355
Wanna see something sad?

1748
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:10,531
A dedication page for the
other girl who went missing

1749
01:06:10,575 --> 01:06:12,185
seventeen years ago.

1750
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:13,273
Sarah Gould.

1751
01:06:13,317 --> 01:06:15,058
What the...?
Easy.

1752
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:16,059
What's up?

1753
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,539
She's not missing.

1754
01:06:24,415 --> 01:06:26,069
Have you been here
all night?

1755
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:30,725
Brought you your cup of sugar
with a splash of coffee.

1756
01:06:30,769 --> 01:06:32,336
Just like you like it.

1757
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:39,082

01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:14,244
Victims of Jules,
across time and space.

2078
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:16,855
Help us now,
to wipe her off the face.

2079
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:19,510
Victims of Jules,
across time and space.

2080
01:20:19,553 --> 01:20:20,816
Where are they going?

2081
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,644
They're going after her,
I bet.

2082
01:20:24,907 --> 01:20:27,779
C'mon, let's...
Wha, we lost them?

2083
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,259
Shh. Listen.

2084
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:31,478
This way.

2085
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:35,569
Leave me to my
work now, Constable.

There's nothing you can--

2087
01:20:40,792 --> 01:20:42,054
You can't be here.

2088
01:20:43,055 --> 01:20:44,709
You're not real!

2089
01:20:46,145 --> 01:20:47,407
Nice try, Claire,

2090
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,061
but I've come up against
smarter people than you.

2091
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:51,281
I'm sure.
But all at once?

Whoa!

I'm gonna...

Of course.

We'll be happy to.

Yeah.
Yeah.

I'm fine.

that tape, too.

Oh, um, it's not
really tape any more.

not seem fair,

Thanks.

But, it doesn't really
have an ending.

I'm left with
all these questions.

Hey there, news geeks.

2125

Claire,
you need a ride home?

2126
01:22:42,174 --> 01:22:44,481
Uh, yeah.
Sure.

2127
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:46,874
Hey, can you keep
shooting on this?

2128
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:48,137
Maybe add
something to it?

2129
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,529
I mean,
we don't tell people

2130

if detention is good
or bad.

That's not our job.

Yeah. Sure.

why are you still filming?

Hi.

2140
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:12,639
So I told Darren that I
needed a ladies' night...

2141
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:14,119
so what're we doing?

2142
01:23:14,163 --> 01:23:16,556
Dinner at the diner?
Then a movie?

2143
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,123
Yeah.
Hey, Claire?

2144
01:23:21,561 --> 01:23:24,477
There's a lot about last night
that I don't really remember.

2145
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:26,305
That's probably
for the best.

2146
01:23:26,349 --> 01:23:28,612

caught on camera

01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:32,529
No, don't worry.
