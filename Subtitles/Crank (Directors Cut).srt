2
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,752
Hector, are we spinning yet?
Nice.

3
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,380
Chelios! How we doing, baby?
And you never call me no more.

4
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:09,925
Come on, what is that?
Where's the love?

5
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,010
How are you feeling?

6
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:15,096
I guess you're feeling like shit
right about now.

7
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:16,431
You can't...

8
00:02:16,723 --> 00:02:18,725
You can't move too good, huh?

9
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:22,020
You can't breathe too good.
What's wrong with you?

10
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:24,397
Wait' wait, wait' wait!
What is this?

11
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:28,109
Oh, fuck!

12
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:31,530
Can you guess what this is?
I bet you can, Chelios.

13
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:34,032
Hold on, check this out.

14
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:43,250
Oh! This is plain sick, man!

15
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:46,586
I must be the motherfucking genius of sick!

16
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:52,592
Poison Chev Chelios in his sleep?
That's like some Shakespeare or some shit.

17
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,806
You knocked this dude out pretty good!
About to get you a spot on the Dodgers, son.

18
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:01,142
Maybe you don't
understand what just happened.

19
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:04,271
I just fucking killed you.

20
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:08,400
Try not to embarrass yourself
because you're on 'Candid Camera'!

21
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:11,570
This shit here I gave you!
This is some...

22
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:15,782
high-tech sci-fi,
Chinese synthetic bullshit!

23
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,119
I don't exactly know
what's in this shit, dude!

24
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:23,790
All I know is that once this shit
has binded with your blood cells,

25
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:26,835
you're fucked, baby,
and believe me it's binded.

26
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:30,964
Yeah' you got yourself about an hour, max.
Tick-tock.

27
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:35,343
Yeah, baby... sexy...
Oh' it's been real.

28
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,098
This shit's been real. You should've thought
twice before you whacked Don Kim.

29
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:45,145
Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

30
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,980
I thought so.

31
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:51,193
Now' you have yourself a nice death.

32
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:55,614
Asshole!

33
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:04,539
You like that, huh?
Home run!

34
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:05,851
What do you think you're doing?
You can't just walk on my car!

35
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:09,604
What do you think you're doing,
motherfucker' walking on my car?

36
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:37,966
<i>It's Eve.
I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.</i>

37
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:42,804
<i>Leave a message, unless you're
selling something 'cause I'm not interested.</i>

38
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:46,725
<i>If you're not, then just...
Wait, time's up.</i>

39
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,479
Get a cell phone' honey.
Please?

40
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,444
Come on.

41
00:05:57,652 --> 00:05:58,945
Come on.

42
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,742
Dr' Miles office' may I help you?
- Yeah' let me speak to him.

43
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,454
<i>I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in.
May I take a message?</i>

44
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:10,248
Where is he?
- I beg your pardon' sir?

45
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,250
Where the fuck is he?

46
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,835
No... yeah!

47
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:19,132
Wow!

48
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:24,846
Where you from?

49
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:28,433
I don't know, sir.
This is his answering service.

50
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,811
<i>Jesus fucking Christ.
- Would you like me to page him?</i>

51
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:33,355
Yeah, fine.

52
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,484
Please let the doctor know
that Chev Chelios is a dead man,

53
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:42,030
if he can't call me back within the hour.
- Could you spell that?

54
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:45,784
<i>Yeah' D-E-A-D! Chelios.
- Yes, sir.</i>

55
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,869
Thank you.

56
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:32,747
Hello.
- Kaylo, where were you last night?

57
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:36,877
What's up' Chev?
- I said' where were you last night?

58
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:39,087
I...

59
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:50,932
<i>Well, want to know what I was doing?
- What?</i>

60
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:53,226
Getting killed' you plum.
- What?

61
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:57,230
Yeah' you heard me.
Ricky fuckin' Verona...

62
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:59,357
<i>Ricky Verona?
- Who'd a thought...</i>

63
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:03,028
that little bitch had the stones
to wet me in my own crib?

64
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:07,199
<i>I mean, it's inconceivable. Yet, here we are.
- Where are we?</i>

65
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:12,871
I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen to me.
Put the word out I'm looking for Verona.

66
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,291
<i>Anyone sees him you call me, understand?
- I...</i>

67
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,128
I'm gonna get that little fucker
if it's the last thing I do.

68
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:23,632
It may actually be the last thing I do.

69
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,717
You understand?
- Ricky Verona.

70
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,427
<i>You copy?
- Yeah.</i>

71
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,804
Find him!

72
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,916
Hey, man!

73
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,671
What the fuck you doing? Where am I going?
- Fuck you!

74
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:05,465
Bathroom don't work.
What you doing?

75
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,759
Yo, Chevy...
- Where's Verona?

76
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,469
Talk!
- What about?

77
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,472
Don't fuck with me!
- I'm not! Just calm down!

78
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,266
Don't tell me to calm down!

79
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,643
Fuck, man!
- Orlando? You all right?

80
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,940
Hey, there's a white nigger with a gun
up in here! Just be still' motherfuckers!

81
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:26,278
You see that?
I'm trying to help you here' man.

82
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:27,988
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

83
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:31,157
Why would I know where Verona is?
- Yeah, yeah.

84
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:33,869
You don't know, but you're gonna tell me.

85
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,539
Or I'm gonna
blow your brains into the fuckin' toilet!

86
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,542
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

87
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:44,838
Whoa! Put your guns down!
The white man is cool!

88
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:48,633
The white man is...
The white man is cool!

89
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:53,054
Y'all like them Somalia niggers.

90
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:57,017
Now look, Chevy
came here to discuss something.

91
00:09:57,184 --> 00:10:00,562
We gonna discuss
this shit in a civilized manner. Chevy?

92
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:04,900
You had a question? Or a point to make?
- Where's Verona?

93
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:08,737
Okay' I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.

94
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:12,741
You pulled the Anselmo job together.
Don't fuckin' bullshit me!

95
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,493
Easy! Easy! Easy!

96
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,872
All right?
Things are beginning to clarify.

97
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:22,209
See how that works' D?
Discussion leads to clarity.

98
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,669
That's what I was telling you before.

99
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:29,341
Look' you're operating under a false
pretence. Ricky and I did not pull...

100
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:33,220
the Anselmo job together.
Ricky fucked me on the Anselmo job.

101
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:37,265
In fact, Ricky Verona still owes me $7,500.

102
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:40,435
Not how I heard it.
- But that's the way it is.

103
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,064
So, you see' I don't know where Verona is.
If I did,

104
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:47,943
I'd probably be there right now'
beating the Gucci off his ass.

105
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:51,029
All right.

106
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:54,950
All right.

107
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,412
That's what I'm talking about.
That's almost civilized.

108
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:09,923
Shit' dude.
What's wrong with you?

109
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:14,094
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

110
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:19,766
Well' obviously. You've made that point
abundantly clear to all of us here' today.

111
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:24,437
How can I help you?
- Just give me some coke. You got any coke?

112
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:28,149
Now you're just going to
come in here and insult me?

113
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:31,069
I know you got coke.
- You think every brother's carrying?

114
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:32,904
Come on, I don't have time!

115
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:36,616
Just give me something.

116
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:39,327
I'm really dying, here.
- I can see that.

117
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:42,163
No, I'm really fucking dying!

118
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,958
Look, if I don't find Ricky Verona...

119
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:49,588
May I please have some coke?

120
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:55,302
You saying this is medicinal-use coke?
- That's right.

121
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,975
Well?

122
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:07,647
What?
- This shit ain't free, nigger.

123
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:14,487
That's enough.

124
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:24,956
What' you gonna do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man!

125
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,211
Oh' God!

126
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,505
Chevy...

127
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:33,131
What the...

128
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:37,719
Oh' that's good. That's good.
- That's good' right?

129
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,142
Why you looking for Verona' anyway?

130
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:56,530
Some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me.

131
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,741
This is about Don Kim.
- What do you know about it?

132
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:04,079
I know you pulled the trigger.
- Of course' I pulled the trigger.

133
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:07,165
Why wouldn't I pull the fuckin' trigger?

134
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:13,338
Whoa... Yo, Chelios, you good?

135
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:16,091
This shit ain't working.
- Excuse me?

136
00:13:16,716 --> 00:13:18,385
I know what I have to do.

137
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:24,599
Well, shit.
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.

138
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,520
What is it you gotta do?
- I gotta kick some black ass.

139
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:30,272
What?

140
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:35,068
Shit!
- There he goes again.

141
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:38,947
Who wants white meat?

142
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:49,416
You ain't got shit, motherfucker!

143
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,752
Put that fuckin' twig down, bitch!
- Faggot!

144
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:58,800
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

145
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:07,559
<i>Doc?
- What's up, Doc?</i>

146
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,729
You motherfucker!
- Why aren't you dead yet?

147
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:13,315
<i>What the fuck you doing?
- Coming for you.</i>

148
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,567
Fucking believe me.
- Whatever.

149
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:18,153
I'll be waiting,
but you won't make it.

150
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:24,159
You should know that I'm all about hooking up
with that mystery girl, you've been banging.

151
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:30,457
<i>Soon as you're underground. I forgot
to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left.</i>

152
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:35,337
What' and then you're gonna rape my
grandmother? Bla' bla' fuckin' bla.

153
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:40,425
You listen to me. What do you think Carlito
will do when he finds out what you did?

154
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,511
<i>Your whole crew is history!</i>

155
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,679
<i>Driver, pull over!
- Fuck!</i>

156
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:47,015
Great.

157
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:51,811
<i>You talking about Carlito?
Because me and Carlito, we're boys now.</i>

158
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,104
We're tight.

159
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:56,483
Tight, like when your brother
fucked you in 3rd grade?

160
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:01,530
That's snappy. But I did you pretty good,
didn't I Chelios?

161
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:03,156
<i>Admit it.
- We'll see.</i>

162
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:04,658
<i>Pull over!</i>

163
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:12,332
Know what the best part is?
- Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.

164
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,461
Yeah.
- Doctor Miles.

165
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:19,130
<i>Fuck! What took you so long?
Jesus Christ.</i>

166
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:23,677
Sorry' Chevy' I just got the message.
- Okay. Forget it. Listen, I'm dying!

167
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:26,388
I've been poisoned
with some Chinese synthetic shit.

168
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,141
<i>What?
- You've gotta fucking do something for me.</i>

169
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:33,562
<i>What are your symptoms?
- It's like I'm slowing down.</i>

170
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,689
<i>Stuck in tar.
- Blurred vision?</i>

171
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,691
<i>Yeah.
- Dizzy?</i>

172
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,068
<i>Sure.
- Any pain in your chest?</i>

173
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:42,571
Not really.
I feel good' right now.

174
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:48,076
What are you doing?
- Driving through a mall' cops chasing me.

175
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:59,421
The adrenaline is what's keeping you alive.

176
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:04,676
<i>Having a little trouble hearing you.
- You got to keep moving, Chevy.</i>

177
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:09,389
Explain.

178
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:13,018
If I'm right'
they gave you the Beijing cocktail.

179
00:16:13,393 --> 00:16:16,021
<i>It's very nasty shit.</i>

180
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:22,027
<i>It works on the adrenal gland,
blocks it's receptors.</i>

181
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:29,784
<i>The only thing you can do to slow it down,
is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant.</i>

182
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:34,122
Meaning' if you stop' you die.

183
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,373
Hang on.

184
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:39,961
<i>Jesus! What...</i>

185
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:42,130
<i>Are you there?
Are you okay?</i>

186
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:48,261
<i>What'd you say' Doc?
- If you stop, you die!</i>

187
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:56,144
That's what I'm trying to do.
Keep moving, keep the blood pumping.

188
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,898
<i>Chevy, you there?</i>

189
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,654
Every time I slow down'
it's like my veins start to rust.

190
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:09,449
<i>Did you take anything?
- Couple grams of coke.</i>

191
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:12,619
<i>That's a start.
I'll be in L.A. In an hour.</i>

192
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:16,915
<i>I'll call you as soon as I get there.
Do not stop moving!</i>

193
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:25,257
Taxi! Yo' yo' yo!

194
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:30,637
Go!
- Where we go?

195
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:33,473
Just drive!

196
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:39,020
Would you mind...
- Where you want to go' man?

197
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,189
Right.

198
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,155
Oh' shit!
- Go right!

199
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:51,992
Okay! Yes!
- Go fucking right!

200
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:05,547
Crank the music.

201
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:12,179
Crank it!

202
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:17,851
<i>But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart</i>

203
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:21,813
<i>I just don't think he'd understand</i>

204
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,859
<i>And if you tell my heart,
my achy breaky heart</i>

205
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:30,322
<i>It might blow up and kill this man</i>

206
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,080
Pull over' pull over.

207
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:45,712
Thanks, mate. I'll be back in one minute.
- Okay, cowboy.

208
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,344
Hey' buddy!

209
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:58,016
You move' you die.

210
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:43,478
<i>Hey, it's Eve. I'm glad you called...
- Fuck!</i>

211
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,450
Where to' man?

212
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:00,787
Beverly Hills.

213
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,901
Chevy!
- Hey, boss.

214
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:15,737
What a surprise.

215
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:19,908
Something urgent has come up.
- So I've heard.

216
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,911
Word travels fast.

217
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,041
Well' then you know what happened.
- You amaze me, my friend.

218
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,585
Well, what can I say?

219
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,922
Carlito' I need your help.
I don't have a lot of time.

220
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:39,094
No' not much.
- Yeah, we...

221
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:42,597
We've gotta find an antidote, or something.

222
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:48,186
What's the matter?
- That shit they gave you...

223
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:50,438
It's that Chinese shit.

224
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:54,943
There is no antidote.
I wish there was something I could do.

225
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,571
What, that's it?
- Honestly,

226
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:01,074
you should be dead already.

227
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,243
It's a miracle.
- A miracle?

228
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,120
We give that shit to horses.

229
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:09,124
I don't fucking believe this.
- I'm sorry.

230
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,377
You don't have to be
so damn fucking cool about it!

231
00:22:15,046 --> 00:22:19,050
What do you expect me to do?
- Find that punk Verona,

232
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:23,805
and his whole fucking crew'
and feed them to a cage of wolverines.

233
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,978
What is this?
What' are you boys now or something?

234
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,980
Verona?

235
00:22:33,064 --> 00:22:34,774
That's a small time punk.

236
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:39,613
Not to say that this isn't an opportunity.
- Opportunity?

237
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:42,991
Everyone knows
the love I have for you' Chev.

238
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:47,078
But maybe this
makes up for the Don Kim hit which was...

239
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:50,165
perhaps ill-advised.
- Fuckin' Ill-advised?

240
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:56,171
The heat from Hong Kong was
much more than we anticipated.

241
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:58,673
Well' that's outstanding' Carlito.

242
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:02,761
Glad to know my death
can be of some use to you.

243
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,932
Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.

244
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:11,603
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm
having a difficult fucking day' brother!

245
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:15,815
Are you disrespecting me?

246
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:20,153
Is that what you're doing?

247
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:30,455
Forget it.
I'm out of here.

248
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:02,237
You're not getting in my cab' wet!

249
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:07,826
I just gave you $200 to wait for 3 minutes.
- You're not getting in my car' no way!

250
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:10,912
Yeah' you're right.

251
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,542
Al-Qaeda!
Al-Qaeda!

252
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:20,255
I love America!
I love Bush!

253
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,591
I Voted Bush!

254
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:41,902
Yeah.
- Hey' Chev. My flight's delayed.

255
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:44,446
<i>Shit!
- It's all right. Relax.</i>

256
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:49,743
I mean' don't relax. That shit they
gave you is cutting off your adrenaline.

257
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:55,749
<i>Excitement, fear, danger. It causes your
body to make a chemical called ephedrine.</i>

258
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,586
<i>They introduced an inhibitor to your system.
- Fuck!</i>

259
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:03,798
<i>You've got to massively
increase the ephedrine level in your body,</i>

260
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:06,635
<i>to force out the inhibitors.
Go to a hospital.</i>

261
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:09,304
Get epinephrine' an artificial adrenaline.

262
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:12,641
<i>It comes in 10-milligram syringes.</i>

263
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:16,603
A 5th of an injection will do.
It's potent, so don't overdo it.

264
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,773
Chevy? Did you get that?

265
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:24,569
<i>Did you get that?
- Yeah, epi-something.</i>

266
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,572
Okay' okay. I've gotta go.

267
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:31,743
<i>Now, I'll call you when I get there.</i>

268
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,830
<i>Yeah?
- Chev.</i>

269
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:35,997
Yeah?

270
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:37,791
Chev?
- What?

271
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,669
<i>Hello?</i>

272
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:43,964
Come on!

273
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,507
Mother!

274
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:49,678
<i>Chev?
- Yes' fuck?</i>

275
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:54,099
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.

276
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,976
The Prince.
- Yeah.

277
00:25:56,142 --> 00:26:00,355
I was just down here getting a taco'
and he walked in' 2 minutes ago.

278
00:26:04,818 --> 00:26:08,196
Where are you' now?
- Across the street, getting a taco.

279
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:12,450
Where are you?
- I'm there. Meet me on 7th and Catalina.

280
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:37,726
Is he in there, now?

281
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:40,228
Did anyone go in with him?

282
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:45,984
Right' wait here.

283
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:05,105
How'd you like that one' tough guy?
How frickin' awesome was that' huh?

284
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:09,776
Well, well.

285
00:28:10,735 --> 00:28:13,947
You feel like talking?
Where's your fuckin' brother?

286
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:17,617
Doing your mother like a whore, you bitch!

287
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:23,248
Nice. I wonder
how many steaks I could carve out of you.

288
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:25,292
You died' motherfucker!

289
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,809
Yeah' wanna fuck with me' ese?

290
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:46,021
What, you rolling pin mighty good?

291
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:49,691
What the hell you think you doing, huh?

292
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:55,030
What,
you want to dance with me' motherfucker?

293
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:59,826
I'll fuck you up!
Come on!

294
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:16,968
Jesus!
Nothing's easy.

295
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,556
Wanna hold hands?

296
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:43,829
<i>Hey, talk to me' bro.
- Hey, Ricky.</i>

297
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:46,581
<i>You in the mood for sucking me off?</i>

298
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:50,043
<i>Maybe let me lick your ass or something?</i>

299
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,921
<i>Who is this?
Shit! Chelios?</i>

300
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:56,091
<i>Is this fucking Chelios?
- That's right, bro.</i>

301
00:29:56,216 --> 00:30:00,720
<i>Guess how I got your brother's phone.
I'm sure you have it all figured out.</i>

302
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:05,892
Looks like you should've
cut me up when you had the chance.

303
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:13,191
I'm having a little trouble hearing you.
You experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

304
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:15,694
You're supposed to be fucking dead!

305
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:20,240
<i>You know, I kind of like that shit you put in
me. Gonna give me some more?</i>

306
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:24,619
Well' I'm... I'm...
- I know, I know. Hey...

307
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,538
What's this?

308
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:34,963
A necklace! You guys
really are faggots, aren't you?

309
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:40,760
You motherfucker! My grandfather gave
that medallion to my father and then he...

310
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:42,304
Fuck!

311
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:48,476
Fuck you, man! Shove that thing up your ass!
- No thanks.

312
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:54,441
You know' I believe I'll hang on to it.
You'll have to come find me' after all.

313
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:59,279
Fucked up that you killed your own brother.
- You...

314
00:31:04,117 --> 00:31:08,788
What's that shit?
Epi... 10 milligrams?

315
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:10,749
Good work, Kaylo.

316
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:35,148
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

317
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:38,360
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

318
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:45,700
Asshole!
- No need to push.

319
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:50,163
I'm looking for
something that starts with "E".

320
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,456
England?

321
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:55,669
Very funny. No.
Some kind of artificial adrenaline.

322
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:02,175
Artificial adrenaline?
- Yeah, I've got heart problems.

323
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:06,221
Epinephrine.
- Yes! Epinephrine.

324
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,723
I love you. Epinephrine.

325
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:12,519
I can't give you epinephrine.
- Why?

326
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:15,021
Just a minute.

327
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,899
Oi! What do you mean...

328
00:32:18,024 --> 00:32:20,068
What is this shit?
- Nasal spray.

329
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:22,153
Miserable bitch!
What?

330
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:27,742
Nasal spray. It's got epinephrine in it.
It'll get you tweaked, man.

331
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:42,090
Hey!

332
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:51,766
Sure that's the guy?
- Yeah.

333
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:59,000
This room's clear.

334
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:27,445
<i>Could anyone
speaking Korean please come to ER?</i>

335
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,531
<i>Anyone speaking Korean...</i>

336
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,831
Yo, yo, yo!

337
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:39,708
Yo!

338
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,168
Stop!

339
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,338
Stop!

340
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:47,340
Jerk-off!

341
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:58,310
Coming through!

342
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:04,357
I know you motherfuckers have epinephrine.

343
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:10,197
Clear the hallway!
- Corner. Is the OR ready?

344
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:16,244
I'm having a bad day.
Tell me you've got epinephrine on this cart!

345
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,246
You all right?

346
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:20,332
Tell me you've got epinephrine!

347
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:23,001
Motherfucker!
- I don't know. I'll check.

348
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,420
Get back!
- Take it easy!

349
00:35:25,587 --> 00:35:30,592
Do you understand fucking English?
- Yes' I just don't know which draw it's in.

350
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:31,843
Look!

351
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:36,348
Give me the fucking epinephrine!
- I don't know where it is' man!

352
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:39,726
What is this, a rest home?
- What are you doing back there?

353
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:41,269
Hurry up!

354
00:35:41,436 --> 00:35:44,189
Get back!
- We can't treat without insurance.

355
00:35:44,397 --> 00:35:48,944
I don't know if I have it. Give me a second!
- Put the weapon down!

356
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,613
What the fuck!
Where the fuck is it?

357
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:55,283
My heart!
- What?

358
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,619
My heart!
- Yeah, yeah.

359
00:35:57,786 --> 00:36:00,539
Drop your weapon' now!

360
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:06,378
What do you think you're doing? This is...
- Shut up! You!

361
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:09,631
Gimme the epinephrine?

362
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:14,427
Don't even think about it!

363
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:19,599
Albuterol... Flortab... Epinephrine!
Here it is! I've got it!

364
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,103
Here you go.
- Gimme that.

365
00:36:23,603 --> 00:36:26,106
Asshole.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

366
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:28,775
...all right? Just be quiet.

367
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,987
Juice me.

368
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:34,948
Juice?

369
00:36:35,115 --> 00:36:36,783
Do it.

370
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,160
All right.
- Come on!

371
00:36:39,452 --> 00:36:41,496
I haven't got all day.

372
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:46,251
Okay, I need both of them to...
Give them to me.

373
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:50,672
One.

374
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:53,508
Two. Clear!

375
00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:58,430
Get the fuck back!

376
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:02,184
Get out!

377
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:55,362
How much of this stuff did he say to take?

378
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,625
<i>Chevy, we're in the air, man.</i>

379
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:52,794
<i>Did you get the stuff?
- Got it.</i>

380
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:54,421
Did you take it?
- Yup.

381
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:56,548
<i>You took the whole thing.
- Yup.</i>

382
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:59,926
I said one 5th. The shit's gonna kill you.
- Right.

383
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:01,553
<i>Chest on fire?
- Check.</i>

384
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,096
<i>But you're cold.
- Check.</i>

385
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:07,434
And you've got a steel hard on, don't you?
- Let me check.

386
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,604
Check.
- Your blood vessels are stimulated.

387
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,733
Urinary sphincter's so tight'
you couldn't piss to save your life.

388
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,401
Urinary sphincter' check!

389
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:20,614
<i>Get some Vicodin. You at the hospital?
- Negative.</i>

390
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,785
<i>Get some grass. That shit'll be out of
your system in 30 minutes, or it'll kill you.</i>

391
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,332
This is costing me a fortune.
I'll call you in 20 minutes when we land.

392
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:31,958
<i>Copy.
- Hey, Chevy?</i>

393
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:36,129
You're a good dude.
Been nice knowing you.

394
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,589
Copy, out.

395
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:40,842
Some medical emergency.

396
00:39:42,302 --> 00:39:46,431
<i>Police have declined to name
the man they say is still at large,</i>

397
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:49,267
<i>on a citywide rampage
that has left one man dead,</i>

398
00:39:49,476 --> 00:39:53,772
<i>dozens injured, and hundreds
of thousands of dollars of damage...</i>

399
00:39:53,939 --> 00:39:58,485
<i>in it's smoking, bloody wake.
The suspect is a professional killer...</i>

400
00:39:58,652 --> 00:40:01,655
<i>with ties to organized crime
and a long police record.</i>

401
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,950
<i>He is considered armed and highly dangerous.</i>

402
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:08,829
<i>We now continue with regularly
scheduled programming,</i>

403
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:14,000
<i>but stay tuned for continuing coverage
of this bizarre story, as it unfolds.</i>

404
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:19,047
<i>What your saying is that next to olives,
onions, lemons and limes...</i>

405
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:37,232
Oh' shit!
Take it easy.

406
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:38,859
Get back, pig!

407
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:41,486
I... just give me the...

408
00:40:41,653 --> 00:40:44,072
Come on, then.
Let's see you run, piggy.

409
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,532
Come on' piggy.

410
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:48,702
Give me the gun.
Let's talk this over.

411
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:53,081
Yeah' you want it?
There.

412
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:28,343
Honey, let's go. Come on.
- Be careful.

413
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:34,307
All right.
I'm gonna get some help' all right?

414
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:36,810
<i>Yeah.</i>

415
00:42:36,977 --> 00:42:40,814
<i>Hey, did you try to call?
- You've been home all day?</i>

416
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:47,154
I was sleeping in.
- Sleeping in. That's great' Eve.

417
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,989
Super great.

418
00:42:49,156 --> 00:42:52,159
<i>You all rested, now?
Glad to hear it.</i>

419
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:56,288
Listen' I've been fatally poisoned.

420
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:59,624
A psychopath's on his way over
to torture and kill you,

421
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:04,671
but don't get out of bed' I'll be
over in a flash. Could you fry up a waffle?

422
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:10,343
Sure, yeah. Come on over. I'll be here.
- Right, you'll be there. Okay.

423
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:12,012
Bye.

424
00:44:08,068 --> 00:44:09,778
So, let's go get the bitch!

425
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:26,127
I hate you.

426
00:44:31,758 --> 00:44:33,802
Second.

427
00:44:34,928 --> 00:44:36,930
Come on!

428
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:40,892
Come on, please!

429
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:46,147
All right' all right. Jesus!

430
00:44:47,607 --> 00:44:49,568
Oh my God!

431
00:44:53,113 --> 00:44:56,491
Is this your new look or something?
- Yeah, you into it?

432
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:58,160
It's gross.

433
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,833
Are you looking for my other boyfriend?

434
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,751
Yes!

435
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:12,299
You haven't watched TV today' right?
- No' why?

436
00:45:12,465 --> 00:45:16,011
Didn't think so. Come on, we're leaving.
- Don't be a freak.

437
00:45:16,178 --> 00:45:17,679
Get dressed.

438
00:45:17,846 --> 00:45:22,309
Actually, can you change the clock on the
microwave? I never changed it back.

439
00:45:22,475 --> 00:45:24,769
What?
- The microwave.

440
00:45:24,978 --> 00:45:29,482
Change the clock. The daylight
savings time, I never changed it back.

441
00:45:29,649 --> 00:45:32,486
The microwave?
- Yes.

442
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:36,823
Listen' I bought you some flowers.
They got fucked up on the way over.

443
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:41,703
That's sweet! You okay?
You look like you're on drugs or something.

444
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:44,831
You love me' yeah?

445
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,460
Yes.

446
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:52,506
Then I need you to do something for me.
- What? What's wrong?

447
00:45:52,672 --> 00:45:58,011
I need you to put some clothes on
and come with me, right now.

448
00:45:58,178 --> 00:46:01,181
No.
- I'll change the clock on the microwave.

449
00:46:01,348 --> 00:46:03,517
Okay. All right.

450
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:24,204
Shit's wearing off.

451
00:46:25,038 --> 00:46:29,835
The waffle iron's on if you want to make one.
- Great.

452
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:33,213
Great.

453
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:58,280
You're so stressed out.
Want some pot?

454
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:01,074
Yeah! No!

455
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:06,079
Ready! What's wrong?
- I burned my hand.

456
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:10,876
Oh, my God! Let me see it!
- Don't worry about it. Hey!

457
00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:13,461
What the...

458
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,549
I'm sorry.
- That was completely uncalled for.

459
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:20,802
Can we just...

460
00:47:20,844 --> 00:47:21,845
Fine.

461
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,485
Parked out the back.
- Oh.

462
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:40,363
Darn! That... thing.
- What thing?

463
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:43,366
The waffle thing.
I gotta turn it off.

464
00:47:58,507 --> 00:47:59,716
Hello?

465
00:48:00,717 --> 00:48:02,344
Hello?

466
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:10,185
<i>All right, very funny.</i>

467
00:48:13,021 --> 00:48:14,523
God' I hate that.

468
00:48:17,526 --> 00:48:20,403
Do you want to burn the building down?

469
00:48:29,204 --> 00:48:31,331
Ouch!
- Sorry, honey.

470
00:48:31,748 --> 00:48:34,167
Nice one. Chev?

471
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:36,920
Oh, there's my Tiger Balm.

472
00:48:38,088 --> 00:48:39,548
I swear to God' Chev.

473
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:44,010
I don't know what you're on,
but it isn't working for you.

474
00:48:48,181 --> 00:48:51,017
My hand cream!
That's where you went.

475
00:49:00,026 --> 00:49:02,904
Chev? Can I have some help, here?

476
00:49:07,617 --> 00:49:11,788
Where's your car?
- Actually, I took a cab.

477
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,570
You're embarrassing me.

478
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:47,073
I didn't have
a lot of time to pick this out.

479
00:49:51,286 --> 00:49:53,788
So' why are we here?

480
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:15,602
This isn't gonna be...
This isn't gonna be easy' as they say.

481
00:50:18,688 --> 00:50:19,981
Oh, fucker.

482
00:50:20,148 --> 00:50:23,652
All right' here it is.
- Sorry.

483
00:50:28,448 --> 00:50:31,785
I told you I was a video game programmer.
- Yeah?

484
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:34,204
That was a lie.

485
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:36,206
Actually...

486
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,877
I kill people.

487
00:50:41,545 --> 00:50:46,174
Professional hitman. I freelance
for a major West Coast crime syndicate.

488
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:50,554
Last night was a job like 100 others.
High dollar hit' nothing special.

489
00:50:51,888 --> 00:50:56,059
<i>The Triads, from Hong Kong,
had been moving in on the local drug cartels.</i>

490
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,064
<i>My target was
the number 1 man in Los Angeles, Don Kim.</i>

491
00:51:09,906 --> 00:51:11,741
Well?

492
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,578
What are you waiting for?

493
00:51:15,162 --> 00:51:22,335
<i>Then, this insane idea comes through the back
of my head, like a.45 slug at close range.</i>

494
00:51:24,254 --> 00:51:26,756
Congratulations.

495
00:51:27,424 --> 00:51:31,386
Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.

496
00:51:33,013 --> 00:51:37,100
100 grand wants you dead.
So' sooner or later it's gonna happen,...

497
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:39,769
but I'm not doing it.

498
00:51:40,395 --> 00:51:42,272
I see.

499
00:51:42,898 --> 00:51:47,903
Instead you're gonna do something for me.
You're gonna get out of town. Disappear.

500
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:51,364
I don't care where you go or what you do'

501
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:56,453
so long as you're invisible for 48 hours.
That's all I ask.

502
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,122
48 hours?

503
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,084
Or, if you prefer,
we can do it the other way.

504
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:08,590
The way where I go to work.
and you meet Buddha.

505
00:52:23,396 --> 00:52:26,316
You see?
I quit.

506
00:52:26,441 --> 00:52:29,653
I quit the business' for you.

507
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:34,115
For me?
- Yeah.

508
00:52:34,282 --> 00:52:37,661
I figure I call you that night
and tell you everything.

509
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:40,997
We get on a plane'
leave this shit' never come back.

510
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:45,585
Pretty crazy, huh?
- You are so weird.

511
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:51,007
Are we going on a trip?
- Well...

512
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:56,930
I might be going on a trip,
but you're not coming with me...

513
00:52:57,347 --> 00:53:00,684
Please! Wait' please!
- Mob hits, Chev?

514
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:04,688
Chinese poison?
Do you know how ridiculous you sound?

515
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:07,440
If you're leaving me'
then tell me the truth!

516
00:53:07,774 --> 00:53:10,026
Oh' right.
You think it sounds crazy.

517
00:53:10,193 --> 00:53:13,822
How do you think I feel?
I have to live this shit!

518
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:17,826
Chev? Chev?

519
00:53:20,162 --> 00:53:21,663
What's wrong?

520
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:27,002
Wait a minute' you trust me?
- No.

521
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:30,172
Make love to me.
- What?

522
00:53:30,672 --> 00:53:34,676
I think it'll help.
- What? Are you kidding? Get off me!

523
00:53:34,843 --> 00:53:38,972
Take your clothes off.
- No!

524
00:53:39,347 --> 00:53:40,348
No!

525
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:44,311
You said you wanted to be more spontaneous.
- You're crazy!

526
00:53:44,477 --> 00:53:47,314
You're an adrenaline junkie with no soul!

527
00:53:47,814 --> 00:53:50,901
Save me, Eve. Save my life!
- Stop it!

528
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:58,825
I'm sorry.
Oh my God' are you okay?

529
00:53:58,992 --> 00:54:00,702
Are you okay?

530
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:07,834
No! No!

531
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,253
Shit!

532
00:54:13,006 --> 00:54:15,509
Get off!

533
00:54:25,602 --> 00:54:27,687
You filthy animal!

534
00:54:28,396 --> 00:54:32,067
Take me right here' in front of everyone!

535
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:35,403
That's it!

536
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,572
Come on! Do it!

537
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:39,699
What are you waiting for?
- Jesus!

538
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:41,618
Come on!
- I'm trying!

539
00:54:43,537 --> 00:54:47,040
Oh' God!
Now you can't get it up?

540
00:54:47,749 --> 00:54:50,961
Come on' get it up!
- I'll fucking get it up!

541
00:54:59,427 --> 00:55:01,555
Goddamnit, Chev!
- Shut up!

542
00:55:15,235 --> 00:55:17,237
I'm alive! I'm alive!

543
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:19,948
I'm alive, you motherfuckers!

544
00:55:21,116 --> 00:55:24,119
Oh' my God! Wow!

545
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:31,835
Oh, my God! Yes!

546
00:55:34,129 --> 00:55:36,965
Yeah?
- What are you doing?

547
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:39,926
<i>I've got Verona.
- Kaylo?</i>

548
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:42,846
<i>I've got Verona, man.</i>

549
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:47,184
What?
- No shit?

550
00:55:47,517 --> 00:55:51,021
<i>Where are you?
- Don Kim's shirt factory, upstairs.</i>

551
00:55:51,188 --> 00:55:55,108
What's the matter with you?
- 5th and Alameda?

552
00:55:55,859 --> 00:56:00,822
Who's at 5th and Alameda?
- Don't let that fucker out of your sight!

553
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:05,452
Hear me? With you in 10 minutes. You got it?
- Yeah' Chev.

554
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:09,498
Honey, I gotta go.
Please understand.

555
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:12,834
No, Chev, I do not understand!

556
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,337
Oh, baby!

557
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:17,797
I'll call you!

558
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:22,552
What are you looking at?

559
00:56:35,148 --> 00:56:38,527
Hey man' what's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?

560
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:44,741
Right' just step on it' all right?
- You're won't die in my cab, crackhead.

561
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:46,743
I got something for you.

562
00:56:51,665 --> 00:56:53,250
Take this Haitian shit.

563
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:58,171
This shit is some hardcore shit.
It's made from plant shit.

564
00:57:01,591 --> 00:57:06,012
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Look at this. You see that?

565
00:57:06,263 --> 00:57:09,558
That's what a man look like, crackhead.
That's power.

566
00:57:10,892 --> 00:57:13,436
Now look at you.

567
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:19,568
What the hell.

568
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:30,912
Yeah.

569
00:57:31,746 --> 00:57:35,959
It tastes like ass.

570
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:40,046
That's right' devil. You wait.

571
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:16,750
Shut the fuck up!
- No!

572
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:19,252
No!
- Shut the fuck up!

573
00:58:27,677 --> 00:58:30,931
Whoop, there it is!
Fuck him!

574
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:38,855
We're here.

575
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:49,825
What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you' it's hardcore.

576
00:58:55,872 --> 00:58:59,209
It'll be $5.55.

577
00:59:01,378 --> 00:59:06,216
It's all you, man.
- Have a nice day, devil.

578
00:59:12,055 --> 00:59:13,557
This is fucked.

579
00:59:16,017 --> 00:59:17,227
Where's he going?

580
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:27,237
Yeah' okay. How the fuck you
going to call me' talking shit?

581
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:31,366
I'm gonna smack the hell out of you.
I don't know where he at...

582
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:34,077
Fucking call me talking shit!

583
00:59:36,997 --> 00:59:39,749
I'm doing my job.
I'm doing my shit.

584
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:44,921
I'm out here,
doing what I do. I'm a rooftop mother...

585
00:59:45,714 --> 00:59:47,716
Hey, Chevy!
What's up' dog?

586
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:50,218
Everything okay?
You chillin'? You good?

587
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:53,054
What a coincidence!
- What do you mean?

588
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:57,225
What, you waiting for a bus?
- Actually' I thought a helicopter...

589
00:59:57,392 --> 00:59:58,894
What is this?
- What?

590
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,438
You working for the Chinese?
- The Chinese?

591
01:00:01,605 --> 01:00:05,734
You crazy? I wouldn't do that to you.
- I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?

592
01:00:07,277 --> 01:00:10,280
Okay' ding. Time's up.
- What do you mean' "ding"?

593
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:12,949
What do you mean, "ding"?

594
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:20,749
Where is that motherfucker?

595
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:22,584
Chev.

596
01:00:24,586 --> 01:00:28,465
What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.

597
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:31,593
Oh' you mean like this?

598
01:00:33,762 --> 01:00:38,475
Now you tell me where that
little toe-rag motherfucker is. Verona.

599
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:41,311
Verona's got nothing to do with this.

600
01:00:42,729 --> 01:00:43,980
What?

601
01:00:44,731 --> 01:00:48,819
Don Carlos wants you off the streets.
- Carlito?

602
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:52,113
You've totally lost your shit, dog.

603
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,409
You're all over TV. Destroying property,
making unauthorized hits...

604
01:00:56,993 --> 01:01:01,748
You're causing the organization
a great deal of embarrassment.

605
01:01:01,915 --> 01:01:04,751
You're telling me Carlito wanted this?
- Look'

606
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:07,671
don't worry'
we'll take care of Verona.

607
01:01:07,796 --> 01:01:13,009
The best thing for you to do
is find some nice' dark' quiet place and...

608
01:01:13,635 --> 01:01:14,845
just die.

609
01:01:21,977 --> 01:01:26,356
Just die. You think
I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?

610
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:36,616
Maybe you're right.

611
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:41,621
We all got to die sometime, right?
- Yeah.

612
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:45,041
We all got to die sometime.

613
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:48,128
So' I'll just die.

614
01:01:52,382 --> 01:01:54,217
What the...

615
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:23,747
Of all the fuckin'...
- You got shot!

616
01:02:23,997 --> 01:02:25,248
Mother...

617
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,752
Jesus!
Eve, move!

618
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:47,604
You' asshole!
- Don't talk to him like that!

619
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:50,857
My boyfriend kills people!
- Nice.

620
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:21,531
Oh' God!

621
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:26,536
I had to see if you were telling the truth.

622
01:04:29,331 --> 01:04:31,041
Come on.

623
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:33,543
No, wait!

624
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:40,717
Now, come on.

625
01:04:43,303 --> 01:04:45,472
Oh' God!

626
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:49,309
Oh, dammit!

627
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:52,979
I forgot to take my birth control pills.
- What?

628
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:57,150
Where are the keys? The keys!
- Here.

629
01:05:01,988 --> 01:05:03,657
Come! Come!
- My stuff!

630
01:05:05,742 --> 01:05:07,327
All my stuff!

631
01:05:36,857 --> 01:05:39,276
You weren't lying!
- Welcome to my life.

632
01:05:41,236 --> 01:05:45,031
No, I mean...
that you would give it all up for me.

633
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:47,200
Yeah.

634
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,872
And the other part?
- The poison's true' too.

635
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:56,084
Then... that means...

636
01:05:56,459 --> 01:05:58,044
Pretty much, Eve.

637
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:05,594
How can we stop it?
- Only adrenaline can slow it down.

638
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:12,559
So, when we were in Chinatown?
- Yeah. Sorry.

639
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:18,273
What are you doing?

640
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,817
This'll get you going.
- What?

641
01:06:20,984 --> 01:06:24,946
Come on, let's finish what you started.
- Oh, boy.

642
01:06:27,115 --> 01:06:30,118
Oh, that's it.
That's really working for me.

643
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:36,124
You like that?
- Stay down!

644
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:41,963
Motherfuck!

645
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:48,970
Jesus! Yeah, that's it' baby.
Just a little more.

646
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:56,019
Stay down, Eve.

647
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:07,364
Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big!

648
01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:10,200
Oh my God!

649
01:07:14,538 --> 01:07:16,456
Just a touch...

650
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:21,795
What's that matter?
- So you can fall asleep like always?

651
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:25,131
I don't think so.

652
01:07:25,465 --> 01:07:26,883
Jesus! Fuck!

653
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:11,344
Are they really...

654
01:08:11,511 --> 01:08:14,055
They're dead.

655
01:08:14,556 --> 01:08:17,559
How do you...
How can you do that?

656
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:22,564
I told you, baby. I quit.

657
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:31,364
Where are you going?
- Stay there, honey.

658
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:36,244
Jesus! Fuck!
- Chev!

659
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,040
Asshole!

660
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,114
I can't feel my leg.

661
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:26,127
Shit!
I've been trying to call you for a half hour.

662
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:28,797
<i>Where the fuck have you been?
- In my office.</i>

663
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:31,925
<i>Can you make it over here?
- Sure' why not?</i>

664
01:09:36,638 --> 01:09:41,476
Chocolate' what's this fucking receipt
from Gold Foods Market for $254?

665
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:44,604
Snacks.

666
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,996
I hate television.

667
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:02,998
I owe you again, Doc.

668
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:07,043
Chevy' you're my best customer.

669
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,548
What is this stuff?
- Synthetic epinephrine...

670
01:10:11,673 --> 01:10:15,886
diluted with some saline.
- Feels sort of good.

671
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:21,391
Well, I got a little meth in there' too.
You're feeling the endorphins.

672
01:10:25,312 --> 01:10:27,230
Wait a minute.
I'm not better?

673
01:10:28,523 --> 01:10:30,066
No' you're not better.

674
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:35,864
You're in such shit shape' it's stunning.
I can't believe your heart's beating.

675
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,242
You should be in a fucking medical journal.

676
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,086
So, what are you going to do?
- The solution acts as a competing inhibitor.

677
01:10:50,337 --> 01:10:53,089
It's pushing
the poison out of your receptors.

678
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,718
and replacing it with a chemical.
It's just a temporary fix.

679
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:58,053
Then what?

680
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,056
Then you're fucked.

681
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:07,562
I can put you on life support
and string this out for a few days.

682
01:11:07,729 --> 01:11:11,399
But you're going to
go into a comma at some point.

683
01:11:11,566 --> 01:11:13,443
Does she know?

684
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:22,410
Why don't I load you up with something,
and you can go out in a beautiful dream.

685
01:11:24,538 --> 01:11:26,414
A dream.

686
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:31,461
Can I do that for you?

687
01:11:33,046 --> 01:11:37,425
No, no, no.
That's not what I want.

688
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,803
What do you want?

689
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,764
One hour.

690
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:48,145
I want one hour.

691
01:11:57,154 --> 01:11:58,822
Give me a fuckin' break.

692
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:09,332
<i>So, the wild rampage that began 9am in
L.A. Continues. The suspect, still at large.</i>

693
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:13,670
We didn't give him
enough of the Chinese shit.

694
01:12:14,629 --> 01:12:17,007
You think?

695
01:12:21,344 --> 01:12:23,513
Dude, it's him!

696
01:12:26,349 --> 01:12:29,436
<i>What's up, corpse?
- Bonjour, douche bag,</i>

697
01:12:29,603 --> 01:12:34,441
<i>Thought you might be interested in a deal.
- Oh, you a dealer, now?</i>

698
01:12:34,608 --> 01:12:36,693
Don't you worry about what I am.

699
01:12:37,027 --> 01:12:42,115
<i>Listen, I want the antidote.
- Oh, the antidote?</i>

700
01:12:42,282 --> 01:12:46,119
<i>That's right, the antidote.
- What you prepared to give me?</i>

701
01:12:46,286 --> 01:12:51,625
How about the jewelry I got off that
faggot brother of yours you cocksucker?

702
01:12:52,209 --> 01:12:55,795
<i>Don't pop a blood vessel, you little penis.
- Okay.</i>

703
01:12:55,962 --> 01:12:57,881
<i>You like the deal?
- Whatever!</i>

704
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,634
Be at the downtown Lint in 20 minutes.

705
01:13:00,842 --> 01:13:02,552
<i>You know the spot?
- Yeah.</i>

706
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:06,556
<i>Don't be late, or I'll trade the
thing to a whore for a hand job.</i>

707
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:10,143
Look' I said I said I'd fuckin' be...
Fuck!

708
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:13,355
See you later, sunshine.
...turn that shit off.

709
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,524
Dammit! Fuck!

710
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:25,492
Yo' it's Verona.
You won't believe this call I just got.

711
01:13:40,715 --> 01:13:42,884
<i>It's gonna be all right, baby.</i>

712
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:46,096
<i>But you said...
- No, no.</i>

713
01:13:46,263 --> 01:13:47,931
<i>Things have changed.</i>

714
01:13:48,098 --> 01:13:52,727
<i>There's an antidote. I can
make a deal for it, but I got to go alone.</i>

715
01:13:53,687 --> 01:13:56,731
<i>I'm scared.
- Of course.</i>

716
01:13:57,399 --> 01:14:00,110
<i>You'll be safe, now.
And I'll be back.</i>

717
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:03,238
Promise?

718
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,574
I promise.

719
01:15:14,184 --> 01:15:17,938
What's happening' bro?

720
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:42,379
<i>Where did I go wrong?
- You fuckin' just say something?</i>

721
01:15:42,546 --> 01:15:44,798
<i>It's like talking to the wall.</i>

722
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:51,137
<i>Mom?
- I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.</i>

723
01:15:51,304 --> 01:15:53,306
<i>You never call, you never write.</i>

724
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:56,810
<i>I haven't seen you
since you ran out at 16.</i>

725
01:15:56,977 --> 01:16:01,064
Yeah, yeah. Right Mom.
With you popping Valium like tic tacs'

726
01:16:01,231 --> 01:16:06,570
boning a new asshole every 2 weeks, why
wouldn't I stick around with fun like that?

727
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:13,410
<i>Please, I haven't got time for this.
- You got no time, period.</i>

728
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:17,205
<i>Orlando?
- You're a persistent motherfucker, Chelios.</i>

729
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:20,000
<i>I give you that.
- This is weird.</i>

730
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:24,212
<i>I know this is weird,
but this has got to stop sometimes...</i>

731
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,342
<i>They pop you and you keep getting up?</i>

732
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:34,556
<i>I'm the terminator.
- You was, but here's a new gun in town.</i>

733
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,559
You know, I just don't get it.

734
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,729
Why didn't you just cut me up
when you had the chance?

735
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,231
<i>Too easy, motherfucker.
Look at you.</i>

736
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:49,779
<i>Bi-polar, sadomasochistic tendencies...
- Adrenaline junkie, addicted to violence...</i>

737
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:54,075
<i>Probably spends every day
of his life looking for the big rush.</i>

738
01:16:54,242 --> 01:17:00,123
<i>Carving up a guy, while he screams in
his own blood and excrement, would be like...</i>

739
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:03,376
<i>like a gift.
A warriors death.</i>

740
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,214
<i>Hell, you'd probably get off on it.</i>

741
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:10,926
What' did you rehearse this?
- No' no.

742
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,932
<i>This was the best way for a guy like you.
Slow ticking clock, winding down.</i>

743
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:20,977
<i>Inevitable, non-negotiable, until...
- Who the hell are you?</i>

744
01:17:25,065 --> 01:17:28,652
<i>I think I'm starting to figure it out.
- Better late than never.</i>

745
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:31,404
<i>You know you're gonna die up there.</i>

746
01:17:31,571 --> 01:17:35,909
Yeah, maybe.
But I'm taking you with me.

747
01:17:48,839 --> 01:17:50,465
Some pills' Doc.

748
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:09,943
Chelios?
- Hello, girls.

749
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:18,785
Hold up.

750
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:23,498
Give me the piece.

751
01:18:42,642 --> 01:18:46,062
Now, isn't that a fucking picture?
- Chelios.

752
01:18:47,147 --> 01:18:49,149
What a fucking nightmare you are.

753
01:18:49,733 --> 01:18:50,817
No shit.

754
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,527
Sit down.

755
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:56,656
Whoa! Wait a minute.
You pat him down, again.

756
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,242
I know he's carrying something.

757
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:04,498
Let me see it.

758
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:09,586
Motherfucker.

759
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:12,672
Clever.
What is this, an insulin pump?

760
01:19:13,006 --> 01:19:14,049
Basically.

761
01:19:14,424 --> 01:19:16,092
What the fuck is insulin?

762
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:18,428
Ephedrine' right?

763
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:22,432
Yeah.
- You're very resourceful.

764
01:19:25,519 --> 01:19:28,855
Found a new master' little bitch?
- I'm nobody's bitch.

765
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:33,902
You'll be a bitch when Carlito
hires you for half what he paid me.

766
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:35,445
That's enough.

767
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:39,449
You'll throw boss a reach-around,
show him you're a good bitch.

768
01:19:39,616 --> 01:19:42,035
I'm nobody's little bitch!

769
01:19:42,202 --> 01:19:44,037
You fuckin' hear me?

770
01:19:44,204 --> 01:19:46,915
He'll pay what I tell him to pay!
- Enough!

771
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,625
Sit down!

772
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:56,299
It's been a long fucking day.

773
01:19:56,466 --> 01:20:00,303
In the end' you have to admit
it all works out quite nicely.

774
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:03,807
Don Kim gets his bullet,
thanks to you,

775
01:20:03,974 --> 01:20:07,435
and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall.

776
01:20:08,562 --> 01:20:13,066
Please understand' it's nothing personal.
- Speak for yourself.

777
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:17,946
That what I think it is?

778
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,576
It's the Chinese shit.

779
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,620
Hold him down.

780
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:30,292
Not so fast, motherfucker!

781
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,795
He's gone dipsy-do, yo!

782
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:37,966
Whatever, psycho.

783
01:20:40,677 --> 01:20:44,431
I'm afraid the Houdini act is over'
my friend.

784
01:20:52,355 --> 01:20:54,483
Our Father' who art in...
- Shut up!

785
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:57,694
So, this is how it is.

786
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:03,533
It's Don Kim! He's supposed to be dead!
- Presto.

787
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:29,726
<i>Police have moved
to surround the Hotel Lint,</i>

788
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,521
<i>where the madman
behind today's mayhem...</i>

789
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:36,066
<i>is holed up
and making a desperate last stand.</i>

790
01:21:36,566 --> 01:21:39,569
<i>Officials have confirmed
gunfire on the sundeck.</i>

791
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:45,075
<i>Our news chopper will bring live,
uncensored coverage from above the hotel.</i>

792
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:52,207
<i>Again, this coverage is uncensored, so any
small children present should leave the room.</i>

793
01:22:06,763 --> 01:22:08,390
Get me out of here, now!

794
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:19,568
I'll kill you Chelios!

795
01:22:20,193 --> 01:22:21,444
Too late!

796
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:29,744
Look out!

797
01:22:30,787 --> 01:22:32,205
Thanks boss.

798
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:56,039
Let's get the fuck out of here, now!
Let's go!

799
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,880
Present from Kaylo.

800
01:24:12,556 --> 01:24:14,516
Now what?
Now you say shit!

801
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,184
Where the fuck were you?

802
01:24:17,394 --> 01:24:18,895
Who's the bitch now?

803
01:24:26,236 --> 01:24:28,405
No, no! You fly, motherfucker!

804
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:31,700
Motherfuckin fly!

805
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,542
You're dead!

806
01:25:24,044 --> 01:25:25,795
Oh my God!

807
01:25:39,392 --> 01:25:41,311
You're dead, motherfucker!

808
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:14,344
I told you I'd kill you, you little bitch!

809
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:40,328
<i>Hey, its Eve.
I'm glad you called but I'm not here.</i>

810
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:45,125
<i>Leave a message, unless you're
selling something 'cause I'm not interested.</i>

811
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:49,212
<i>If you're not, then just...
Wait, time's up.</i>

812
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:51,840
Hey' doll...

813
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:56,803
Looks like I let you down again.

814
01:26:57,471 --> 01:27:02,058
<i>Seems like all my life
I've just been going... going...</i>

815
01:27:02,851 --> 01:27:04,519
<i>going...</i>

816
01:27:04,978 --> 01:27:09,524
I wish I'd taken more time to
stop and smell the roses, so to speak.

817
01:27:11,651 --> 01:27:15,906
Well' I guess it's too late for that now.

818
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:24,372
You're the greatest, baby.

819
01:27:25,305 --> 01:28:25,475
