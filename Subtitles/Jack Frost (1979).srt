before Christmas,

a team of horses

the folks of January Junction

was because of that ice money

Daughter, why are you
headed toward the gate?

I'm going out into
the countryside.

It's so beautiful

There must be
another reason.

From that moment on,

your wish.

You may become

and if by the first
sign of spring

344
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,462
you have accumulated
the basic human essentials--

345
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:46,133
a house to shelter you,
a horse to bear you,

00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:49,068
a bag of gold
to sustain you,

347
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,572
and a wife to make it
all worth the while,

348
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,476
then you will be

Kubla Kraus owns
all the timber

and the brick.

frightens him?

815
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,393
But I can't just let

816
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,629
January Junction
be destroyed!

817
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:13,031
Let me be human again.

818
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:17,468
You promised me humanity
until spring comes.

819
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,172
Very well, Jack Frost.

820
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,941
You have until 12 noon,

821
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,544
and if you wish
to remain human...

822
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:31,149
you have one hour to get
your house, horse,

823
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:33,418
bag of gold, and wife.

824
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:36,421
But first
I've got to stop Kubla.

825
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:38,423
Somehow.

826
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:42,961
Gee, the snow's
half-melted already!

827
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:45,931
KUBLA KRAUS: Dommy,
look, we're melting!

828
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,433
Soon I will
destroy the town

829
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,468
and get my bride.

830
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:52,503
Oh ho ho! What happiness!

831
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,073
What joy! What glee!

832
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,042
Ha ha ha!

833
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:00,111
Ho ho ho!

834
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,047
[Creaking]

835
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:05,851
PETE: The melting snow
collapsed the rotting roof

836
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:08,987
and Kubla was knocked
unconscious.

837
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:10,555
Ha ha ha!

838
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:13,158
Now I know what to do.

839
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,559
Right, Dommy?

840
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,129
Anything you say,
Jack Frost.

841
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:23,234
PETE: He could imitate
Kubla's Dommy voice perfectly,

842
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:26,872
and what's more,
Jack Frost didn't move his lips.

843
00:43:26,872 --> 00:43:29,941
All you knights
down there,

844
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,843
halt!

845
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:35,613
Now, those knights thought
Kubla was doing the talking

846
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,749
for Dommy, so they obeyed.

847
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:41,152
No time to use
the secret passage.

848
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:44,790
Down the mountainside!
Forward! March!

849
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,258
On the double!

850
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:50,261
PETE: Of course that mountain
was still slippery as ever,

851
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:52,497
and once they hit
those ice slopes,

852
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:53,765
down they went!

853
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:56,167
They landed on
the others down below,

854
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:59,170
and soon the valley
was filled to the top

855
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,572
with a junk heap
of 10,000 knights!

856
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,375
Blast you!

857
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,444
Unh!

858
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:10,248
Who you like best,
me or Frost?

859
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,383
Oh, you, Kubla.

860
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,319
He's got
cold fingers.

861
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,254
Let's get him.

862
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,331
I--I guess this counts
as a house.

863

[Clanking]

864
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:30,869
Uh-oh.

[Steam hissing]

866
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,842
I guess I have
a horse, too.

867
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:39,377
Look, gold!

868
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:42,280
Enough for
a hundred bags!

869
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,885
PETE: To stay human, Jack Frost
needed one more thing.

870
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:51,022
And he only had till noon

871
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,892
to make Elisa his wife.

872
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:59,330
[Cheering]

873
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,434
PETE: Yes, sir, that town's
troubles were over for good.

874
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,070
Jack Frost was sure

875
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,006
everything would be
happy ever after, until...

876
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:12,110
You want my daughter's
hand in marriage?

877
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,480
I only have
one daughter and--

878
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,649
Well, look for yourself.

879
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:23,755
PAPA: And would you believe
a knight for a son-in-law?

880
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:27,793
The ceremony is at 12 noon,

881
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:30,461
at the first stroke
of spring.

882
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,098
You're invited, kid.

883
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:36,134
I thought she loved me.

884
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:41,006
I never heard her say she loved
anyone before Sir Ravenal.

885
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:43,341
Except Jack Frost.

886
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,143
He is just a dream,

887
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:49,114
but she'll always
love Jack Frost.

888
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:54,886
But, no, I never heard her say
she loved you, Jack Snip.

[Chiming]

12 noon!
The big moment!

891
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,095
Spring is here!

892

Hey, where did that
little tailor go?

[Wedding March playing]

894
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:21,112
What was that?

895
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:25,350
An old friend
kissed the bride.

896
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:37,295
Run! It wouldn't be
winter without you!

* If you try to turn around *

* When you hear his icy sound *

* He's sure to disappear *

* But you know,
yes, you know *

901

* Then you know
Jack Frost is here *

902

And that's
the story of Jack Frost.

Well, I gotta catch
6 weeks of shut-eye.
