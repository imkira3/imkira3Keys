1
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,557
Idiots.

2
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,406
Take the captain beyond the reef till
we get permission to bring him ashore.

3
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,407
For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

4
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:06,874
Fernand Mondego does not abandon his friends
in the face of stupid, suicidal danger.

5
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:11,621
However, as Monsieur Morell's official
representative on this voyage, Edmond,

6
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,752
I must officially tell you you have
overstepped your bounds as second mate.

7
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,550
Officially. There.
I've covered myself.

8
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,261
If we don't get him to a doctor,
he will die. Do you understand?

9
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,257
Of course I understand. Just
don't expect me to do this sober.

10
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,259
Right.

11
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,603
English dragoons.

12
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,393
Hello!

13
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,726
Dantes, don't.

14
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,774
- A little careless, don't you think?
- We have to talk to someone.

15
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,401
Well, I know, but...

16
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,777
We're French sailors!

17
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,329
- We seek medical attention!
- Come on. Come on.

18
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,951
- We come in peace.
- Come on.

19
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,244
We mean no harm!

20
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,250
Edmond!

21
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,095
Come on! Climb!

22
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,270
Look out!

23
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,462
Fernand!

24
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,974
Good. You finally
hit something.

25
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,648
Lieutenant Graypool.

26
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,359
If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools,

27
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,524
then by all means
shoot them.

28
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,652
But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

29
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,821
Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

30
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,575
Sir, I am Edmond Dantes,

31
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,329
second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

32
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,540
This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego,

33
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,212
son of the Count Mondego.

34
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,841
Our captain has contracted brain
fever, so we put in here for help.

35
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,682
If his coma is genuine, he won't
feel my knife point, will he?

36
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,020
Only a scratch.

37
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,026
Edmond!

38
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,529
- Lieutenant Graypool!
- We came to you in good faith!

39
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:55,209
- That's for my wounded men.
- And wounded pride, no doubt.

40
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,929
It has been an eventful evening.

41
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:21,068
If I hadn't have shot those dragoons, you
might by lying in pieces on the beach right now.

42
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:25,405
- I almost got us killed.
- Yes, you did.

43
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,780
Yet... we survive.

44
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,112
# Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin #

45
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,114
Whoo-hoo!

46
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,619
# Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin ##

47
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,916
King's to you, Mondego.

48
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,587
Being your friend
is always an adventure.

49
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,086
Yes, it is, isn't it?

50
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,430
It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

51
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,969
What?

52
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,302
Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

53
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,640
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Drink up.

54
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,602
We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

55
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,609
I think you'll find
the 1: The finer vintage.

56
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,529
As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes, I wonder...

57
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,952
if I might have
a word with you.

58
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,786
I'm curious. What's the significance
of the chess piece?

59
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,789
It's just something
we've done since childhood.

60
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,169
Whenever one of us has had a victory,
king of the moment.

61
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,465
- King of the moment?
- Yes.

62
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:35,388
In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

63
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,812
I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

64
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,313
He is my captain...
and my friend, Your Majesty.

65
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,815
Loyal friends
are rare indeed.

66
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,485
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

67
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,656
I have written a rather sentimental
letter to an old comrade in Marseilles.

68
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,329
It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

69
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,408
Since they have a habit
of opening my mail,

70
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,370
I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

71
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,542
Oh, I-I don't...

72
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,546
It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

73
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,549
It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

74
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:15,014
But more important, it is the price
I demand for the use of my physician.

75
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,016
Then I agree.

76
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,015
Good.

77
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,234
You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

78
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,564
- Can you remember that name?
- Monsieur Clarion. How will I find him?

79
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,571
Oh, he will find you.

80
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:37,405
Now, I do not wish this letter's
existence to be known to anyone else.

81
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,787
Not even your boon companion back there.
Do you understand?

82
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,243
I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

83
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,997
Yes, I, uh...
I believe you are.

84
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,431
What did he want?

85
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:09,527
Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

86
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:33,085
Time you were on your way. Your
captain has been dead for half an hour.

87
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,133
Are you sure?

88
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,762
When you have walked as many
battlefields as I, young Dantes,

89
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,767
you can feel death.

90
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,984
Kings and pawns, Marchand.

91
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:57,488
Emperors... and fools.

92
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,961
Come about!

93
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,518
Drive faster.

94
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,987
Danglars, what's happened?

95
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,540
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,

96
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,000
and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

97
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,997
Come to my office
and report, Danglars.

98
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,842
- And you, Edmond.
- Will you be needing me, Monsieur Morell?

99
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,005
Go.

100
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,845
Mercedes.

101
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,852
- Where is he? Where is Edmond?
- How lovely to see you too.

102
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,183
You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

103
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,856
Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

104
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,899
He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

105
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,072
I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

106
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,408
Is this true?

107
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,868
I accept
all responsibility.

108
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,410
As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

109
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,251
It should have
been your idea.

110
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,747
Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

111
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,921
- I was protectin' the merchandise.
- You were protecting yourself...

112
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,799
by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

113
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:46,385
Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

114
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,599
You presume to demote me?

115
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,605
There is no demotion.

116
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,780
You will remain first mate
under Captain Dantes.

117
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,234
Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

118
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,960
Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

119
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,255
who will want
to hear this news.

120
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,761
Thank you.

121
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,147
Monsieur Morell?

122
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:41,649
- I understand you had a ship
just returned from Elba, monsieur. - Yes.

123
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:46,449
Did anyone aboard
get ashore there by any chance?

124
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,074
They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

125
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,288
Thank you, monsieur.

126
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,958
- May I say who has called upon them?
- Clarion.

127
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,791
The name is Clarion.

128
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,342
- Make love to me.
- Will you ever give up?

129
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,973
- He doesn't have to know.
- I'd know.

130
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,392
So would I.

131
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,317
- It'd be our little secret.
- I don't believe in secrets.

132
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,155
You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

133
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,484
- I know what you want, Fernand.
- You do?

134
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,368
Remember when we were kids and Edmond got that
whistle for his birthday, and you got a pony?

135
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,163
You were so mad Edmond was happier with
his whistle than you were with your pony.

136
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,997
I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

137
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,877
How long do you think it's going
to be before he can afford a wife?

138
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:48,011
Two years.
Two years. That's all.

139
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,093
Then he gets his captain's
papers, and we can marry.

140
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,226
Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything,

141
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,474
particularly
a bride like you.

142
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,689
Hey!

143
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,858
- There he is.
- Hey!

144
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,156
- Whoo!
- Mercedes!

145
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,373
I missed you so.

146
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,872
The missing is over now.

147
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,872
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm captain. Come on.

148
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,213
Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

149
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,886
Edmond!

150
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,054
King's to me.

151
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:38,102
Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

152
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,771
Come on.

153
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,074
- You're still the best man.
- I know.

154
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,193
Come on!

155
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,941
Stop that.
You'll go bald.

156
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,158
Do you keep secrets from me?

157
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,283
Secrets? No.

158
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,246
Why?

159
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,958
Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

160
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,295
We don't have to wait
two years anymore.

161
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:55,846
- As soon as I can afford the ring,
we'll wed... - I don't need a ring. I don't.

162
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,519
This will be my ring.

163
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,569
And no matter what happens,

164
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,028
you will never see it
off my finger.

165
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,994
Ever.

166
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,339
Hello, my fine young gentleman.

167
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,382
Care to join me?

168
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,140
So tell me, Mondego,

169
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,566
how did you ever
become friends...

170
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,861
with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

171
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,820
He claims to be my friend,

172
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,530
yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

173
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,990
What secrets?

174
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:21,762
To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

175
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,024
All I am I owe
to you, Father.

176
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,234
May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

177
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:37,240
of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

178
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,912
- Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
- I am.

179
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,083
Edmond Dantes, you are under arrest by
order of the magistrate of Marseilles.

180
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,459
- Arrest?
- On what charges?

181
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,300
That information is
privileged. Take him.

182
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:56,797
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

183
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,975
I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

184
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,269
Mon Dieu.

185
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,492
Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

186
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,950
Traitor?

187
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,496
Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

188
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,170
Did you have any personal contact
with Napoleon when you were on Elba?

189
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,459
Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

190
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:36,302
I was with the Count Mondego's son,
Fernand, almost the entire time.

191
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,638
- Do you know Fernand?
- He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

192
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,809
Oh, there you are.
He'll vouch for me.

193
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,478
No doubt, but you said,
"almost the entire time."

194
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:54,647
Except for when Napoleon asked me to deliver
a personal letter to a friend in Marseilles.

195
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,824
Well, Dantes, it is for accepting
that treasonous correspondence...

196
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,662
that you have been denounced by your
own first mate, a Monsieur Danglars.

197
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,490
- What?
- Did you deliver the letter?

198
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,327
No, sir, someone was
supposed to find me.

199
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,500
It's... It's still
in my jacket. Here.

200
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,899
- Have you read this?
- No, sir, I can't read.

201
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,858
Well, Dantes, this is a letter
to one of Napoleon's agents.

202
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,696
It gives the times and the locations
of the British beach patrols on Elba.

203
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,533
Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

204
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,535
He swore its contents
were innocent.

205
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:02,757
No, it's you
that's innocent.

206
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,429
Foolish and innocent.

207
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:09,054
I believe these are the worst charges
that could be leveled against you.

208
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:14,734
Fortunately, as I've intercepted
this document, there's no harm done.

209
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,233
God knows how you're going to
survive in this world, Edmond Dantes.

210
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,232
But you are no traitor.

211
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,859
You may go.

212
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,326
Thank you, sir.

213
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:36,126
Wait, uh, did Napoleon tell you
who's supposed to pick up the letter?

214
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,294
Monsieur Clarion.

215
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,377
What name did you say?

216
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,467
Monsieur Clarion.

217
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,100
Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

218
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,473
Monsieur Mondego
or anyone?

219
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:55,692
No, sir, in fact, Monsieur Mondego
knows nothing of this letter.

220
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:05,652
This is very
dangerous information.

221
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,621
One can never be too careful
in times like this.

222
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,825
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

223
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,293
Mm-hmm.

224
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,834
I've given you rather
a stressful time.

225
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,713
I wonder if, by way of an apology,
I could offer you my carriage home.

226
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,591
It's just through here.

227
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,850
Thank you.

228
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,833
Monsieur Villefort?
Monsieur Villefort?

229
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,044
Monsieur Villefort!

230
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,476
Whoa. Whoa!

231
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,234
Where are you taking me?

232
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,698
This is a mistake.

233
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,533
- I'm allowed to go home. - From now on,
your home is the prison Chateau d'If.

234
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,539
No! No! No!

235
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,837
Hey!

236
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,965
Shoot him now!

237
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,392
Mount up!
Get after him!

238
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:14,281
Fernand! Fernand!

239
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,283
- Monsieur?
- It's all right. He's right here. Fernand!

240
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:21,291
I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

241
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,914
When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

242
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,625
I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

243
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,631
He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

244
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,304
But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

245
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,924
It was to one of his agents.

246
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,848
Somehow the authorities found out.
I don't know what to do.

247
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,975
There's gendarmes on
horseback right behind me.

248
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,146
All right.
We just have to think.

249
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,147
I hope I haven't
compromised you.

250
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,320
I was hoping your father
could help me.

251
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,609
He's in Paris.
He's very ill.

252
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,659
- How far back are the gendarmes?
- Minutes.

253
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,282
- Do you need money?
- Yes, thank you.

254
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,989
- Do you have a pistol?
- Of course not.

255
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,117
Good.

256
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,620
Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

257
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,342
I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

258
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,297
It was you?

259
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,015
Well, it wasn't just me.
It was Danglars's idea.

260
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,344
Why didn't you
come to me first?

261
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,146
Why did you keep it a secret from me?
I thought you were my friend.

262
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,358
I told you I gave Napoleon my word.
He lied to me!

263
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,353
I know, Edmond.
I read the letter.

264
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,285
You... You read...

265
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,200
Why are you doing this?

266
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:45,875
Oh, it's complicated.

267
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,837
Complicated.

268
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,047
Don't be ridiculous.

269
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,554
- Get out of my way.
- I can't let you go, Edmond.

270
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,244
Get away from the window.

271
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,367
Don't make me
take off your hand!

272
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:54,403
Why? In God's name, why?

273
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,244
Because you're the son of a clerk!

274
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,579
And I'm not supposed
to want to be you.

275
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,620
- In here!
- In here!

276
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,302
- Get!
- Wait.

277
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,927
Hold it. Hold it.

278
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,434
To remember better days.

279
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,732
Come on!

280
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,947
I told you it wasn't always
going to be this way, Edmond.

281
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,625
Father! Where is he?

282
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,674
The study.
What's he done now?

283
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:58,004
Now, you listen to me, Father. I am the chief
magistrate, an official of the new regime.

284
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:02,933
I cannot afford to have my own
father mixed up in treasonous affairs!

285
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,979
You know...

286
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:11,810
In the end, treason
is a matter of dates.

287
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,860
I shall be the patriot, and you the
traitor, when the emperor returns.

288
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,153
Stop it. Stop it,
you old ruin.

289
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:24,159
Those days are over. Napoleon Bonaparte
is no longer the emperor of anything.

290
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,329
If you continue to dabble in this
lunacy, you run an excellent chance...

291
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,828
of being arrested and ruining our entire
family all because of your idiotic sympathies.

292
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,579
At least I have sympathies.

293
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,837
For God's sake, Father,
all Valentina is saying...

294
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,510
is that as a family
our fates are intertwined.

295
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,510
- Surely you can see that.
- See? Ah!

296
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,559
I'm an old ruin.

297
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,680
I don't see as well as I did.
You will excuse me.

298
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,195
Move it.

299
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,078
Move.

300
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,167
Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

301
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,595
I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'If.

302
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:08,767
Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal,

303
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:13,439
but I assure you I am innocent.

304
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,149
Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

305
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,940
- Innocent.
- Yes.

306
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,939
I know. I really do know.

307
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,494
- You mock me?
- No, my dear Dantes.

308
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:32,833
I know perfectly well that you are
innocent. Why else would you be here?

309
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,374
If you were truly guilty,

310
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,959
there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away,

311
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:46,468
but Chateau d'If is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

312
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,936
Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

313
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,373
"God will give me justice."

314
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,918
People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

315
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:22,170
Or they keep calendars, but soon
they lose interest or they die.

316
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,216
- There's a window. - All I'm left
with is a rather unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

317
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:30,845
So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

318
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,889
Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment,

319
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,058
we hurt them.

320
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,728
Usually just
a simple beating really.

321
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:43,688
Although, on their first day here,
in your case, today,

322
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,239
I like to do
something rather special.

323
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,530
And if you're
thinking just now,

324
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,411
"Why me, O God?"

325
00:29:55,419 --> 00:30:00,288
- The answer is, God has
nothing to do with it. - All right?

326
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,749
In fact, God is never
in France this time of year.

327
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,050
God has everything to do with it.
He's everywhere. He sees everything.

328
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,682
All right.

329
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,811
Let's make a bargain,
shall we?

330
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:22,564
You ask God for help,
and I'll stop the moment he shows up.

331
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,795
Monsieur Villefort,
have you not heard?

332
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,998
- Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
- What?

333
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,835
Landed 100 miles from here.
He marches on Paris!

334
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:55,309
Pack all my files. And tell that
idiot clerk to find the ledger!

335
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,646
We are here to plead the case
of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.

336
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,310
Not now! Dantes?

337
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:06,816
We have not met, monsieur. I am Fernand
Mondego, the son of Count Mondego.

338
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:10,024
I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

339
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:15,283
This is his employer, Monsieur Morell,
his father, and his fiancee, Mercedes.

340
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,161
Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

341
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,629
- Yet you stand by him?
- Of course I do.

342
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,637
What if I was to tell you that
Dantes is also charged with murder?

343
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,558
- Murder?
- Edmond would never do such a thing.

344
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,512
Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents.

345
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,517
When we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

346
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,350
No, if you knew him, monsieur, you
would know that was not possible.

347
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,355
Have mercy, please.

348
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,028
You have proof
of this treason?

349
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,023
That is government business.

350
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:55,027
Please. Please,
just tell us where he is.

351
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,326
I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

352
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,541
I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

353
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:06,713
But my advice to all of you
would be to forget Edmond Dantes,

354
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,836
particularly you,
mademoiselle.

355
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,553
Take solace in the comfort
of your good friend here...

356
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:17,724
and perhaps some good may yet come
of this unhappy affair.

357
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,719
Now, you will excuse me.
I have to attend some other matters.

358
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,061
My son is no traitor!

359
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,356
I will try to reason with him.

360
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,692
- Let's leave this to Fernand. He can
plead the case. - It's impossible. Never.

361
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,270
I will not give up
on Edmond yet.

362
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,072
I will never
forget your kindness.

363
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,698
And I shall never
cease to give it.

364
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:46,582
Not that I don't appreciate
the embroidery of the crimes,

365
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,584
but still, murder?

366
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,542
It's quite simple really.

367
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,877
When you reported Dantes's
receiving the letter to me,

368
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,255
I didn't quite understand
why you were betraying him,

369
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,433
but now having seen his exquisite
fiancee, I understand completely.

370
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,058
What prompts you to be
so accommodating?

371
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,270
Sit down, Mondego.

372
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:20,071
Come back!

373
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,072
Come back!

374
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,581
What's my crime?
What's my crime?

375
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,287
I'm innocent!

376
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,503
Happy anniversary, Dantes.

377
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,222
Until next year.

378
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,808
Has it really been
four years, Delius?

379
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,433
Or Danton? What is his name again?

380
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,011
Forgive my intrusion.

381
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,931
But I was under
the impression that I...

382
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,890
I was digging
toward the outer wall.

383
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,070
Parlez-vous anglais?

384
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,695
Italiano?

385
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:13,242
I am Abbe Faria. I have been a prisoner
in Chateau d'If for 11 years.

386
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,200
Five which
have been spent...

387
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,874
digging this tunnel.

388
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,254
There are 72,519 stones...

389
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,756
in my walls.

390
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,059
I've counted them many times.

391
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,556
But have you
named them yet?

392
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,277
Shh, shh.

393
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,568
Shh, shh.

394
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,775
Once I was as you are now.

395
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,278
But I promise, it will pass.

396
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,078
I promise, I promise.

397
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:00,623
Now, may I stand
on your shoulders?

398
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:12,798
Take me down.

399
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,471
Please, take me down now.
Take me down.

400
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:26,987
I have not seen the sky
these 11 years. Thank you.

401
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,938
Thank you, God.

402
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,613
There is no talk of God
in here, priest.

403
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:36,492
What about
the... inscription?

404
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:41,163
It's faded, just as God
has faded from my heart.

405
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:46,665
- And what has replaced it?
- Revenge.

406
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,885
Hold these.

407
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,133
Follow me.

408
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,304
Perhaps your thoughts
of revenge...

409
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,557
are serving God's purpose
of keeping you alive...

410
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,013
these seven years.

411
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,233
- To what end?
- Escape.

412
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,614
There we go.

413
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,233
You spoke of escape.

414
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,615
Yeah.

415
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,944
There are only two possibilities
of reaching the outer wall...

416
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,280
and finally the sea.

417
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:04,709
I simply...
I simply chose the wrong one.

418
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,754
Now, of course,
with two of us,

419
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,547
we could dig in
the opposite direction.

420
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:16,046
With both of us together, then, of course,
we could possibly do it in, oh, eight years.

421
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,269
Oh, does something else
demand your time?

422
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:27,690
Some pressing appointment,
perhaps?

423
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,070
In return... for your help,

424
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,398
I offer something priceless.

425
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,233
My freedom?

426
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,952
No, freedom
can be taken away,

427
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,746
as you well know.

428
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,119
I offer knowledge,
everything I have learned.

429
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,751
I will teach you, oh,
economics, mathematics,

430
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,921
- philosophy, science.
- To read and write?

431
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,719
Of course.

432
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,434
When do we start?

433
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,808
I got it. I got it.

434
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,983
Lights out. Lights.

435
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,442
Let's have 'em. Come on.

436
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,611
The slot opens twice a day.

437
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:23,284
Once for your toilet bucket,
which is where we hide the dirt.

438
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,289
Come on.

439
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,167
And once in the evening
for your plate.

440
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,458
Lights out. Out.

441
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,553
Come on, priest.

442
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,800
Thank you.

443
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,050
Between those times we can work all day
without fear of discovery.

444
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,637
"So neglect becomes...

445
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,185
our ally."

446
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,149
Excellent.

447
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,860
So you were in
Napoleon's army.

448
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,034
We had such dreams then.

449
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,033
However, one night...

450
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,499
my regiment ran down...

451
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,702
a band of guerrillas,

452
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:14,039
who ran into a church
for sanctuary.

453
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:19,548
I was ordered to burn...
down the church...

454
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,888
with them inside it.

455
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,848
Did you?

456
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,936
To my everlasting shame, I did.

457
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,062
I did.

458
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,235
How did you come to be here?

459
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,447
The following day
I deserted...

460
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,401
to devote my life
to repentance...

461
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,527
and to God.

462
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,284
I worked as
private secretary to...

463
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:52,244
the enormously wealthy
Count Enrique Spada.

464
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:56,089
Spada was
a righteous man.

465
00:43:56,092 --> 00:44:00,961
Sadly, a couple
of years later, he died...

466
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:06,925
amidst rumors that he had
hidden his limitless fortune.

467
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,555
- Two weeks later, I was arrested.
- Why?

468
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:16,560
Napoleon wanted
Spada's treasure.

469
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:21,440
He did not believe that
I had no idea where it was.

470
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:26,654
So he had me thrown in here
to refresh my memory.

471
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:31,286
And so here I've remained
with only God...

472
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,627
for company
until he sent me you.

473
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,126
God is no more real
than your treasure, priest.

474
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,377
Perhaps.

475
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,605
Ooh! Hurry. Get it.

476
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,149
Compute this.

477
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,949
2,500 cubic centimeters
of rock and dust a day...

478
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,824
for 365 days.

479
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,328
Equals three-and-a-half
meters a year,

480
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,000
12 feet, a foot a month.

481
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,329
Three inches a week.

482
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,460
In Italian.

483
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,887
Do not waste the light.

484
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:40,397
You were a soldier, priest.

485
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,442
So you know weaponry.

486
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,325
Teach me.

487
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,826
Or dig alone.

488
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:05,176
You force me to walk
a fine line, Dantes.

489
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,516
This is ridiculous.

490
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,897
The stronger swordsman
does not necessarily win.

491
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,899
It is speed!

492
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,690
Speed of hand.

493
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,026
Speed of mind.

494
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:34,535
Now, sweep your hand
through the drops...

495
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,999
without getting wet.

496
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,083
Like this.

497
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,592
How long must I keep this up?

498
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,383
I am going down the tunnel.

499
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,780
Parry. Up.

500
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,577
Like that.

501
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,788
Time to study.

502
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,332
Define economics.

503
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,786
Economics is the science
that deals with the production,

504
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,997
distribution and
consumption of commodities.

505
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,002
Translation.

506
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,210
Dig first, money later.

507
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,981
Thank you.
Happy Christmas, Edmond.

508
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,950
Give or take a month or so.

509
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,325
Good. Whom are you fighting?
Danglars? Mondego?

510
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,410
Who do you think?

511
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:13,504
Good! Too good.

512
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,466
We have Newton's third law.

513
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:20,811
There is a reaction
to every action...

514
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,352
in physics... and in man.

515
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,979
Thus my quest for vengeance is a reaction
to the actions of Danglars and Mondego.

516
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,655
Up, up.

517
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,825
I want that seat.

518
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:40,699
You once told me that Villefort
had you rearrested just after...

519
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,496
he had cleared you
of all the charges.

520
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,327
You may go.

521
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,046
Yes, that's true.

522
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,339
Then why would he go
through that charade...

523
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:57,886
unless he had reason to change his mind
about letting you go?

524
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:01,014
- Think, Edmond.
- I'm trying.

525
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:04,184
- What happened?
- He asked me...

526
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,398
Did Napoleon tell you who was
supposed to pick up this letter?

527
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,563
- I told him...
- A Monsieur Clarion.

528
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:12,738
- And nothing more? - Nothing.
He burnt the letter and said I could go.

529
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,948
Ah.

530
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:19,825
He burned... the letter.

531
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,752
Yes.

532
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:30,418
Strange that a chief magistrate
would burn evidence...

533
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,384
of a treasonous conspiracy...

534
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:38,381
and then imprison
the only man...

535
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:42,719
who was aware of
Monsieur Clarion's connection...

536
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,686
to that conspiracy.

537
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:52,399
- He was protecting someone.
- Ah.

538
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:57,154
- A dear friend perhaps?
- No. No.

539
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,951
A politician like Villefort would
have rid himself of such friends.

540
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,746
Clarion could be a relative.

541
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,957
A close relative, possibly...

542
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,045
No!

543
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,969
Villefort's father was
a colonel in Napoleon's army.

544
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,805
Villefort wasn't
protecting Clarion.

545
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:23,175
He was protecting himself.

546
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:27,309
Danglars, who falsely said he saw
Napoleon give me that letter.

547
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,311
Mondego, who told
Villefort I had it.

548
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,651
And Villefort himself,
who sent me here.

549
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,991
Bravo, Edmond, bravo.

550
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:24,037
Oh, my God. Oh, oh.

551
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,371
Oh.

552
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,916
Edmond, light. Light.
Quick. Light.

553
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,041
Oh, please, God.
What is that? Look.

554
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:37,501
Look. Look!
Roots. Plant roots.

555
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:41,880
If these are plant roots,
then we are only months away.

556
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:46,384
Yes. Well done, priest.
I'll get my chisel.

557
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:49,561
Good. Good.

558
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,860
Priest!

559
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:20,964
In God's name, go on.

560
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,218
Go on. Go on!

561
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,703
Lungs...
are punctured.

562
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:53,705
- Don't talk. Don't talk.
- Listen.

563
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,707
There's not much time.

564
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,460
Under th-those books,

565
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,462
there's loose rocks.

566
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,714
Bring me what you find.

567
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,717
Quickly, quickly.

568
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,676
Open it.

569
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,137
When I told them
I did not know...

570
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:16,190
where the treasure
of Spada was, I lied.

571
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,483
You lied?

572
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,687
I'm a priest,
not a saint.

573
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,693
There,

574
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,321
on that island
off the Italian coast.

575
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,489
- Monte Cristo?
- Yes, yes.

576
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,323
Use... Use your head.

577
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,667
- Follow the clues.
- The tunnel's blocked. I can't escape.

578
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,665
No, keep digging.

579
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:41,340
When you escape, use it for good,
only for good.

580
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:44,335
No, I will surely
use it for my revenge.

581
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,847
Here now
is your final lesson.

582
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,845
Do not commit...

583
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,687
Oh. Do not commit
the crime...

584
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,436
for which you now
serve the sentence.

585
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,860
God said,
"Vengeance is mine."

586
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,858
I don't believe in God.

587
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,691
That doesn't matter.

588
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,197
He believes in you.

589
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,747
Priest?

590
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,713
Plates out.

591
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,189
Let's have it.

592
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,944
Oh.

593
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,946
Oh, God.

594
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:04,336
He's always awake.

595
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,722
First time in 12 years
he hasn't said "thank you."

596
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,858
- Dead.
- How?

597
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,860
Fell off his bed,
didn't he?

598
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,660
- He's a bit dirty, isn't he?
- They all are.

599
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,658
Well,
let's sew him up...

600
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,331
and then see Dorleac.

601
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:44,921
One, two, three.

602
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:59,511
Right, let's get Dorleac.

603
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,023
Why'd you lock it?
He's not going anywhere.

604
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:10,026
I don't know. Habit, I suppose.

605
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,834
Good-bye, priest.

606
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,801
You're free now,

607
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,048
as I will never be.

608
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,869
So the old pope has finally gone
to St. Peter's.

609
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:04,581
Well, bring him along.

610
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,912
- Let's bury him, then.
- You ready?

611
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,085
One. That's it.

612
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,260
- Keep going.
- Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.

613
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,058
Actually, I do.

614
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,939
I've got...

615
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:30,269
I've got all the time
in the world!

616
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,998
Come on.

617
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,668
Come on.

618
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,976
Monsieur Dorleac!

619
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:10,351
Heavenly Father,
we bequeath to you...

620
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,687
these remains
of your humble servant.

621
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,445
Whatever his name was.

622
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,447
God, I'm so bored.

623
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,371
Monsieur Dorleac!

624
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,165
Did he, in fact,
have a map?

625
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,467
No, gov.

626
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,715
Where's the, uh...

627
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,473
Stop!

628
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,468
Monsieur Dorleac!

629
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,970
What do you mean, after three?
We throw him at three or before three?

630
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:50,474
After three.

631
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,356
- Monsieur Dorleac!
- And th...

632
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,530
- Don't, Mr. Dorleac!
- One...

633
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,234
- two...
- Don't throw the body over the cliff!

634
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,740
- Aah!
- Three!

635
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:42,256
We could have handled that
a bit better.

636
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,039
Thank you, priest.

637
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,292
Thank you.

638
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,079
So, mi amice,

639
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,537
I would ask who you are, but in
view of your shredded clothes...

640
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:01,999
and the fact that
the Chateau d'If is two miles away,

641
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,841
what's the point?

642
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:08,719
As for me, I am Luigi Vampa,
a smuggler and a thief.

643
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,175
My men and I have come to this island
to bury alive one of our number...

644
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:15,054
who attempted to keep
some stolen gold for himself...

645
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,351
instead of, uh, sharing it
with his comrades.

646
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,897
Interestingly enough, there are some
of his more loyal friends...

647
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,020
who are insisting
that I grant him mercy,

648
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:25,067
which, of course,
I cannot do,

649
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,567
for I would quickly lose control
of the whole crew.

650
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:33,076
- That's why you are such a fortunate find.
- Why is that?

651
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,579
You provide me with a way
to show a little mercy to Jacopo,

652
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,918
that maggot you see
tied up over there,

653
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,122
while, at the same time,
not appearing weak.

654
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:45,880
And as a special treat, the lads will
get to see a little sport as well.

655
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,053
How do I accomplish
all this?

656
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:51,427
We watch you and Jacopo
fight to the death.

657
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:54,430
If Jacopo wins,
we welcome him back to the crew.

658
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,395
If you win, I have given Jacopo
the chance to live,

659
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,394
even if he did not
take advantage of it,

660
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:03,443
and you can take his place
on the boat.

661
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,937
What if I win,
and I don't want to be a smuggler?

662
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,399
Then we slit your throat,
and we're a bit shorthanded.

663
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,286
I find that smuggling
is the life for me...

664
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,115
and would be delighted
to kill your friend, the maggot.

665
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:20,836
Oh, uh, by the way, Jacopo is the
best knife fighter I've ever seen.

666
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,879
Perhaps you should
get out more.

667
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,587
Release Jacopo
and give him back his knife.

668
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:32,638
Then we let
the games begin.

669
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,093
Get up, maggot.

670
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,651
Come on, come on!

671
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:08,375
As you hope to live,
do not move an eyelash.

672
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:13,380
Senor Vampa,
allow Jacopo to live.

673
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:17,388
He's already suffered enough
with the prospect of being buried alive.

674
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,642
The men that wanted
to see some sport have seen it.

675
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,731
Those who wanted mercy
for Jacopo will get it.

676
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,400
And by keeping me
and Jacopo,

677
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:29,821
you will have yet another skilled sailor
and fighter for your crew.

678
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,653
It's a deal.

679
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,160
- What is his name?
- You've got the devil, Jacopo!

680
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:43,334
His name?
We shall call him Zatarra.

681
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:47,581
- Sounds fearsome.
- It means driftwood.

682
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,006
I swear
on my dead relatives,

683
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:55,339
even on the ones
that are not feeling too good,

684
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,970
I am your man forever.

685
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,185
I know.

686
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:27,045
Eyes in the back of your head.

687
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,838
Have you never seen
Marseilles before?

688
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,888
It was my home.

689
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:40,383
But you do not join
the others ashore.

690
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:44,266
- Over here!
- Listen to me, Zatarra.

691
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:48,566
Whatever happened to you, you cannot make
it right by staying here on this boat.

692
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:51,986
Go. It's up to you.

693
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:56,408
"We are kings or pawns,"
a man once said.

694
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,576
Si.
Who told you this?

695
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:03,031
Napoleon Bonaparte.

696
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,414
Bonaparte?

697
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,999
Oh, Zatarra,
the stories you tell.

698
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,297
Someday I may come
to find you.

699
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,384
A man is always in need
of a good friend.

700
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,727
Truly.

701
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,616
Danglars, what's happened?

702
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:47,201
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,
and Edmond Dantes disobeyed my orders.

703
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,060
Zatarra,
are you all right?

704
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,066
Everything's changed.

705
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,868
I want you to buy a boat,
just something the two of us can handle.

706
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:26,449
Wait for me to return.
I make my next visit alone.

707
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,831
Is... Is this the home
of Monsieur Morell?

708
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:38,209
My grandfather
isn't well, monsieur.

709
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,679
Even if he were, he would not receive
visitors at 11:00 in the evening.

710
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:44,049
Perhaps he might make
an exception...

711
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,722
for a man who is seeking
E-Edmond Dantes.

712
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,390
I apologize
for the hour.

713
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,896
Old people never sleep.
Sit down, sit down.

714
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,942
Julianne, some sherry.

715
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:01,069
So, Monsieur Zatarra,

716
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,534
you were a friend
of Edmond?

717
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,950
- Monsieur Morell?
- Yes?

718
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:20,302
You knew... Edmond also?

719
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:22,299
Like a son.

720
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:29,595
I was hoping you could tell me where
to find his family.

721
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,643
Unfortunately,
his father hanged himself...

722
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:36,477
after learning
of Edmond's treason.

723
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:38,937
I see.

724
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,939
I see.

725
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,906
And...

726
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:48,663
this...
treason you speak of...

727
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,583
- Who accused him?
- Who knows?

728
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:55,249
Monsieur Villefort,
the man who had Edmond arrested,

729
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,002
left for Paris soon after
to take up the post...

730
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,083
of chief prosecutor.

731
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:03,427
Of course, the shock of his father's
violent murder...

732
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,096
may also have spurred
his departure.

733
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:10,765
They were strange times.

734
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:14,981
You seem to have fallen
on difficult times yourself, sir.

735
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,693
After Edmond's death,
I reluctantly took on a partner.

736
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:22,193
One of my captains.

737
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:25,650
And then one day,
Danglars forced me out.

738
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:30,655
My fate is nothing
compared to Edmond's.

739
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,705
Perhaps your luck
is about to change.

740
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:42,129
I shall search out
Edmond's fiancee.

741
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,336
You mean
the Countess Mondego?

742
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,303
- Countess?
- Yes.

743
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:52,306
A month after poor Edmond
was arrested,

744
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,604
Mercedes wed
his best friend.

745
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,315
- Fernand.
- Yes, that's right.

746
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:01,315
And with the death
of his father and brother in the war,

747
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,318
Fernand became Count Mondego.

748
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,987
They live in Paris now.

749
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,494
Count and Countess Mondego.

750
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,205
Are you all right?

751
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,878
Yes. I must go.

752
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:26,052
- I'm sorry I was not more helpful.
- Oh, no.

753
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:28,596
You told me
what I needed to know.

754
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,808
Edmond Dantes is dead.

755
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:46,197
Zatarra.
Zatarra, you will be so proud of me.

756
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,196
I found a nice little skiff.
We couldn't afford a sloop.

757
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,699
Got a really good deal.
Za-Zatarra?

758
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,537
Zatarra.

759
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,076
Whoo-hoo!

760
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:51,086
Zatarra, the boat
cannot hold no more,

761
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:54,010
and there are at least
eight more boatloads down there!

762
01:13:57,308 --> 01:14:00,095
Do you not understand?

763
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:04,391
You are wealthier than any man
I have ever heard of.

764
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:09,814
Whatever your problems were,
they are over.

765
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:13,317
What do you want to buy?

766
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,318
Revenge.

767
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:18,401
Okay, revenge. Who?

768
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,449
Danglars, Villefort,

769
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,448
Fernand and Mercedes.

770
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,453
Right.

771
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:28,331
We kill these people,
then we spend the treasure.

772
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:32,335
No, we will study them,
learn their weaknesses.

773
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,838
Why not just kill them?
I'll do it.

774
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:37,671
I'll run up to Paris...
bam, bam, bam, bam!

775
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:40,507
I'm back before week's end.
We spend the treasure.

776
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:42,512
How is this a bad plan?

777
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,686
Death is too good for them.

778
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:48,606
They must suffer
as I suffered.

779
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:51,355
They must see their world,
all they hold dear,

780
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,936
ripped from them
as it was ripped from me.

781
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:02,741
You will need a better name than Zatarra
if you are to accomplish that.

782
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,162
Then I shall
become a count.

783
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,734
I bid you
good afternoon, sir.

784
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:36,904
I'm here to purchase
your lovely home.

785
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:42,827
The very cheek!
I shall have you horsewhipped!

786
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,663
Now, get off my property,
you vagabond,

787
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,537
before I set the dogs on you,
you hear?

788
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,712
Thank you.

789
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,909
Ladies and gentlemen,

790
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:16,495
it is with great honor
that I present to you His Grace,

791
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:19,582
the Count of Monte Cristo.

792
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,439
It's so beautiful.

793
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:46,168
Greetings.

794
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:56,221
My dear count, allow me to introduce
to you my husband,

795
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,439
Monsieur Villefort,
Chief Prosecutor.

796
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,436
Very kind of you
to think of us.

797
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:03,394
Oh, I am the one honored
with your presence.

798
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,693
Now, please,
enjoy yourselves tonight.

799
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,863
What do we know about him?

800
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,862
Not enough.

801
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:15,239
Where are they?
Are you sure you invited them?

802
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:17,245
Yes, Your Grace.

803
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:21,420
But I just learned that Count Mondego
has retired for the evening.

804
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,789
He has a morning appointment
he cannot miss.

805
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,372
You're up early, my dear.

806
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,417
Is the Viscount Tourville dead?

807
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:11,637
Unless his heart is situated somewhere
other than the left side of his chest,

808
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,722
I suspect he is.

809
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:18,428
God grant him peace.

810
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,264
He did no more than defend
his family's honor.

811
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:24,691
Much good it did him.

812
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:29,021
His wife and I were happy in our
passion. You were happy in your ignorance.

813
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:31,858
Now comes the viscount's
valiant defense of his honor,

814
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,863
and you are pained.

815
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:37,037
- She is ruined, and he is dead.
- Don't flatter yourself.

816
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:41,618
I was neither happy
nor ignorant,

817
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:45,455
having known about the last three women
before Madame Tourville.

818
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,461
I'm sorry you
are humiliated.

819
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:53,971
The combination of Paris
and me is hardly a recipe for fidelity.

820
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:57,341
And since my attempts at discretion
have evidently failed,

821
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,470
there seems little point
in keeping up pretenses.

822
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:06,016
It's actually quite...
liberating.

823
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,984
Wouldn't you say?

824
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,318
His finances?

825
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,650
He's losing money
at the other casinos.

826
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,656
They're not even
cheating him.

827
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,658
Have you looked
into his shipping?

828
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:21,536
He got a bank loan for his own boat
several years ago.

829
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:24,994
- Doesn't use Danglars.
- Make sure we own that bank by tomorrow.

830
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:29,002
Tell the other shipping
companies to stay away from Mondego.

831
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:31,675
I want to give him no choice
but to crawl back to Danglars.

832
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:36,131
Now, tell the dealers...
take it all.

833
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:41,681
Do try to understand.

834
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:44,680
I have a very large
consignment of cotton ready to be sent,

835
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:48,275
and I shall make my payment on the ship
as soon as it is delivered.

836
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:52,355
So obviously I need the vessel
in order to deliver it.

837
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:56,951
Unfortunately, the bank can offer
no further extensions, Count Mondego.

838
01:21:57,037 --> 01:22:00,495
I suggest you find
alternate means of shipping.

839
01:22:08,715 --> 01:22:13,084
Well, well. To what do I owe the honor,
Count Mondego?

840
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:17,012
Can't imagine why you've been
avoiding me after all these years.

841
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,762
I'm prepared
to overlook your faults...

842
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:22,764
and perhaps resume
our dealings.

843
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:27,477
Business not going
so well these days?

844
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,703
Zatarra?

845
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,421
Jacopo.

846
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:57,594
Did you fall off the bed?

847
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:02,342
After 13 years of sleeping
on a stone slab, I can't.

848
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:05,519
Mi Maria.
Does that hurt?

849
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,099
Did you come here
for a reason?

850
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,647
Mondego has a son.

851
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:23,112
- Albert wishes to talk with us.
- Not now!

852
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,785
Tell him I'm trying
to protect his inheritance.

853
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:28,784
Are you afraid he's
going to squander his as you have yours?

854
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:32,663
I don't recall hearing your complaints when
I elevated you from a fishmonger's daughter.

855
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,999
Please, I must finish this,
then I shall be going out.

856
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:38,005
May I remind you, my love, that in
Paris there are mistresses aplenty,

857
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:41,554
but you have
only one son.

858
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:43,553
Come in, Albert.

859
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:48,680
- For God's sake, be brief.
- I will, Father.

860
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:52,813
Several of my friends are going to
Rome for two weeks during Carnival.

861
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,980
- I would like to accompany them.
- Rome?

862
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:58,690
- And no chaperons? You're only 15.
- Almost 16.

863
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,196
Make it my birthday present,
Father, please.

864
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,322
- I won't get into trouble.
- No.

865
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:06,822
Of course he can go. I could do with
some peace and quiet around here.

866
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,661
Rome!

867
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:33,019
Albert! Albert!

868
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:35,567
- Over here! Over here!
- Over here!

869
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,410
Milady?

870
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,247
Can't hide forever.

871
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,246
Milady?

872
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:41,337
Who are you, and why
are you doing this?

873
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:44,340
- We are bad men, and for the money.
- My money is in my waistcoat.

874
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:48,845
Not anymore. Besides, it's not
your money we're interested in.

875
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:51,847
You are the only son
of Count Mondego, are you not?

876
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,850
Ransom?
Send your note and be damned.

877
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:58,854
I wish it were that easy, but a note
won't reach your father for two weeks,

878
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:02,312
and then there's the endless debates
about whether we killed you already.

879
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:07,819
No, a note just doesn't have the impact.
Perhaps if we send him your ring.

880
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:10,495
Yes. My ring bears
the Mondego crest.

881
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:14,621
While still attached to your finger?

882
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,166
Listen to me, vermin.

883
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:21,964
I am Albert, son of Fernand,
Count Mondego,

884
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:26,052
and you have had your last laugh
at my expense.

885
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:30,132
- Do your worst.
- If you insist. Peppone, the knife.

886
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,823
Cut this boy's ropes,

887
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:54,406
or I will be forced to start cutting
your miserable corpses.

888
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,412
Now!

889
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:02,710
Follow me, young man.
You see the surface? Wait for me there.

890
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:05,668
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Go. We'll talk later.

891
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,342
Well done, gentlemen.

892
01:27:17,441 --> 01:27:20,433
Many thanks, Your Grace.

893
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:22,438
Albert.

894
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,691
Are you all right?

895
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:28,364
Sir, I owe you my life.

896
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,450
You've had quite an ordeal.

897
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:33,153
You're an extraordinary young man.

898
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,200
I insist, you must come to my estate
for breakfast tomorrow.

899
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:40,918
Agreed?

900
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:42,917
Agreed.

901
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,716
May I ask
who you are, sir?

902
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,053
For the present, your friend.
Tomorrow, your host.

903
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,889
For the short time
formality stands between us,

904
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,183
the Count of Monte Cristo.

905
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,135
He's out in the waiting room.

906
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,805
He showed courage
in the tunnels.

907
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:36,304
He's a means to an end.

908
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,890
Yes, Your Grace.

909
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,776
Young man.

910
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:52,028
Albert, come in. Come, come.

911
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,281
Come on.

912
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,704
- You've had quite a night.
- Yes.

913
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,952
What an adventure.

914
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,702
Everything's an adventure
when you're young.

915
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:05,333
- One thing puzzles me, sir.
- Hmm.

916
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,835
How did you come to know
of my kidnapping?

917
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,292
I have many connections,

918
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:13,170
some of which
are less than reputable.

919
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:17,850
I pay well to be informed of anything
of note in any city in which I stay.

920
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:20,473
And the kidnapping
of a count's son is of note.

921
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,561
But why risk your life
rescuing me?

922
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:28,018
The son
of a fellow noble.

923
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:30,024
It was the least
I could do.

924
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:34,074
Judging by your character,
I'm sure you would have done the same.

925
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,993
Your father will
be proud of you.

926
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:53,210
You must come to Paris and meet my
parents so they may thank you in person.

927
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:57,048
Unfortunately, I cannot.
Business, you see.

928
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,724
Please, it is
a matter of honor.

929
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:05,851
- Jacopo?
- Yes, Your Grace?

930
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:08,183
The Spada matter...
where do we stand?

931
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:11,020
- Even now, the gold...
- The shipment?

932
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:14,694
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Your Grace.
The shipment is in transit,

933
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:17,696
uh, bound for Marseilles.

934
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:21,700
- And it arrives?
- Not for another three weeks, Your Grace.

935
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,871
Three weeks? That's more
than enough time to visit in Paris.

936
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,629
- Very well.
- Excellent.

937
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:33,379
- And you'll be there just in time.
- In time for?

938
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,229
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

939
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:59,489
The Count of Monte Cristo.

940
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:10,162
Count!

941
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,513
- Albert.
- Your Grace. Father!

942
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,637
May I present
the Count of Monte Cristo.

943
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,765
- 'Tis a pleasure.
- The pleasure is mine, Count Mondego.

944
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:30,189
I've been looking forward
to this moment for some time.

945
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:32,858
You do me much honor,
when it is I who are indebted to you...

946
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,688
for the rescue of my son.

947
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:41,151
May I present
the Countess Mondego.

948
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,707
Mercedes.

949
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,675
Countess.

950
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:08,312
You would have to be a mother
to truly appreciate the service...

951
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:11,140
you've done
for my son and me.

952
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:13,816
Monsieur, I shall never forget you.

953
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,402
Please, madame,

954
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,400
it was nothing.

955
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:22,234
I am sure that within a month,
you will not even remember my name.

956
01:32:22,328 --> 01:32:25,070
Hmm?

957
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:27,247
May I steal your wife?

958
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:30,370
- I'm sorry?
- For the waltz.

959
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,623
Of course.

960
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,672
Isn't he wonderful, Father?

961
01:32:52,942 --> 01:32:56,526
- What's the matter?
- Uh, nothing.

962
01:32:56,613 --> 01:33:00,481
You just remind me
of someone from long ago,

963
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,235
someone who was
very dear to me.

964
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:08,534
I'm flattered.
What happened to him?

965
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:11,248
He died.

966
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,203
But I'm not that man.

967
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:18,290
Monsieur and Madame Villefort.

968
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:23,298
What are they doing here?

969
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,645
Prosecutor Villefort.

970
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:40,069
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Madame Villefort, monsieur.

971
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:43,065
I'm so glad you could come to see me
while I'm still in town.

972
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:46,443
- We were delightfully surprised
to get your note. - Thank you.

973
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:50,201
Would you be so kind as to excuse
your husband and I for a moment?

974
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:56,082
I'm told you are an expert in
the interpretation of the law.

975
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,627
I have a certain matter that
perhaps you could help me with.

976
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:09,549
Excuse me.

977
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:14,513
Fernand. Fernand!
The toast!

978
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:17,599
Not right now.
I have state business to attend to.

979
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:20,773
Our guests expect it.
Albert expects it.

980
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:23,192
You give it, my dear.
I'm sure it'll be splendid.

981
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:25,615
You are his father!

982
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:29,531
It is the least you can do.
You know how he admires you.

983
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:31,613
Then he will forgive
my absence.

984
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:33,455
But...

985
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,877
I thought we agreed
not to meet socially.

986
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,920
How could I pass up
the Count of Monte Cristo?

987
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:47,177
Quite.

988
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:50,382
- What do you know of him?
- He's foreign,

989
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:52,842
rich.

990
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:55,144
I hear he aided
your son.

991
01:34:55,148 --> 01:34:58,811
- Why does he seek your counsel?
- Why should I tell you?

992
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:02,520
When my son
returned from Rome,

993
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:05,981
he mentioned he'd heard Monte Cristo
saying he was expecting a shipment.

994
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:08,657
He also heard the words "gold"...

995
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:10,531
and "Spada."

996
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:15,407
- Hmm.
- You don't believe...

997
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,992
Monte Cristo has found
the treasure of Spada.

998
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:21,170
Not an hour ago, he asked me to help
him avoid troublesome inspections...

999
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:23,714
on a shipment coming
from Marseilles.

1000
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:26,258
- Hmm.
- I could have him arrested.

1001
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:30,214
Don't do that.
Let's just relieve him of it.

1002
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:33,926
- How do you propose... - I have an
acquaintance who deals in these matters.

1003
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,602
Tell Monte Cristo
you'll get his shipment through Customs,

1004
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:39,726
but that it will
have to stay in port overnight.

1005
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:43,522
I shall have it removed and taken
to my old family estate in Bouchon,

1006
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:46,066
where we shall meet
the following day.

1007
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:51,947
I require 70 percent.

1008
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:54,199
And yet you'll only get 50.

1009
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:56,201
Done.

1010
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:07,045
Yes, it is, isn't it?

1011
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:19,308
Yes, well, I know. Yes.

1012
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,311
Ladies and gentlemen,

1013
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:29,739
unfortunately, my husband has been
detained by business.

1014
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:35,662
And so it is
left up to me to...

1015
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:37,909
To introduce you...

1016
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,413
to the Count of Monte Cristo
yet again.

1017
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:44,254
You see, I had the audacity
to beg the count...

1018
01:36:44,257 --> 01:36:47,090
to allow me to give
the birthday toast to Albert.

1019
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:50,919
I was so insistent, and such
is the graciousness of our host,

1020
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,763
that he reluctantly gave up
his fatherly right...

1021
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,091
in order to accommodate a guest,

1022
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:58,096
even one as boorish
as myself.

1023
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,849
Ahh.

1024
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:02,976
Young Albert
has made far too much...

1025
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,649
of the assistance
I gave him in Rome.

1026
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,648
When I arrived
in the catacombs,

1027
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,776
I watched as the criminals,
who tied Albert to a wall,

1028
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:13,529
threatened to cut off
his finger and send it to his father...

1029
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:15,530
as evidence
of his abduction.

1030
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:17,452
Goodness!

1031
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:21,783
The boy's reply to all this was...
"Do your worst."

1032
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:27,130
Life is a storm,
my young friend.

1033
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:29,374
You will bask
in the sunlight one moment,

1034
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:32,131
be shattered on the rocks
the next.

1035
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:34,299
What makes you a man...

1036
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:37,803
is what you do
when that storm comes.

1037
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:41,682
You must look into that storm
and shout, as you did in Rome,

1038
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,021
"Do your worst...

1039
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,019
for I will do mine."

1040
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:49,978
Then the fates will know you
as we know you,

1041
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:53,657
as Albert Mondego,
the man.

1042
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:36,900
Giddap!

1043
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:59,013
Edmond, Villefort told me
that you were executed.

1044
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,592
- Did he?
- Oh, God.

1045
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:05,144
- Countess, you are mistaken.
Back to the Mondegos'. - No!

1046
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:07,605
- Madame, I'm only thinking
of your reputation. - I beg you, Edmond.

1047
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:09,599
- I don't care how you returned.
- I am not this Edmond.

1048
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:13,858
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

1049
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:23,871
So, what are you?

1050
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:29,203
A spirit?
Some ghost sent to torment me?

1051
01:39:31,382 --> 01:39:34,294
This Edmond,
you loved him?

1052
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:36,293
Yes.

1053
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,628
For how long?

1054
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:41,465
For all of my life.

1055
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:45,768
And how long after he died
before you married the count?

1056
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,305
That isn't fair.

1057
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:57,230
We've reached your home,
Countess.

1058
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:18,343
You're right.
You cannot be my Edmond.

1059
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:21,592
Well, there you are.
You said it yourself.

1060
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,843
Edmond Dantes is dead.
Good night.

1061
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:30,058
Countess.

1062
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:37,729
If you ever again presume
to interfere in my affairs,

1063
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:41,361
I will, I promise, finish the job
I started the day we met.

1064
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:44,532
Do you understand?

1065
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:46,954
- I understand you are mad.
- Mad?

1066
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:50,078
My enemies are falling
into my traps perfectly.

1067
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:52,077
Mad, Your Grace,
for ignoring this:

1068
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:55,709
You have a fortune,
a beautiful woman who loves you.

1069
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:58,879
Take the money,
take the woman and live your life.

1070
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:01,302
Stop this plan.
Take what you have won.

1071
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:05,382
- I can't.
- Why not?

1072
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,937
I am still your man, Zatarra.

1073
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:19,938
I swore an oath.
I will protect you.

1074
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:25,243
Even if it means I must
protect you from yourself.

1075
01:41:25,246 --> 01:41:28,909
I'll drive you home now.

1076
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,992
I'll walk.

1077
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:14,455
Put two chests
on the Pharaon for our cut.

1078
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:16,953
Mondego will never notice.

1079
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:40,726
Come on.
Get aboard.

1080
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:51,162
- Philippe Danglars?
- Yeah?

1081
01:42:51,248 --> 01:42:56,117
You are charged with the theft of goods
from a certain merchant ship.

1082
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:00,254
This is absurd.

1083
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:02,332
We can resolve
this matter easily.

1084
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:05,964
These men will perform
a search of your vessel.

1085
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:14,848
Count Mondego set me up.

1086
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:18,932
But I'll not hang for him.

1087
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:37,704
Who are you?

1088
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:42,414
I'm the Count of Monte Cristo.
But my friends call me Edmond Dantes.

1089
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:45,041
Dantes?

1090
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:53,132
Cut him down before
he can't talk.

1091
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,582
Boy, don't do that.
That's... That's too much.

1092
01:44:18,669 --> 01:44:20,751
My dear Villefort.

1093
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:23,454
I hope you don't mind
if I join you for a short while.

1094
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:27,425
Your Grace,
I was not expecting you.

1095
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:31,345
I want to thank you in person
for helping me with my shipment.

1096
01:44:31,432 --> 01:44:34,469
That, yes. I-I made all
the arrangements earlier.

1097
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,139
I can promise you there'll be
no more problems from our end.

1098
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:42,940
Excellent. I think this could be the
start of a long and fruitful relationship.

1099
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:47,437
Speaking of which,
may I pose a question?

1100
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:49,692
Yes, of course.
Anything in the world.

1101
01:44:51,869 --> 01:44:55,361
I was just curious.

1102
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:59,324
Why did you tell
Countess Mondego 16 years ago...

1103
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:02,623
that Edmond Dantes
had been executed?

1104
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,624
Hmm?

1105
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:08,458
Uh, I don't understand.
Wh-What on earth are you talking about?

1106
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:11,669
It's a perfectly
simple question.

1107
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,466
How do you know these things?

1108
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:18,134
That's, uh...

1109
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:20,636
That's quite enough.

1110
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:24,064
Whew! You don't understand. Dantes
was accepting a letter from Napoleon.

1111
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:27,188
- That was clearly treason.
- But we both know he never delivered it.

1112
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:30,563
Packing a man off to prison with such
knowledge is bad enough. But to tell...

1113
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:33,491
Your Grace, I have no idea what is
provoking this perverse discussion.

1114
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:37,988
Now I ask myself, "What did my old
friend Villefort stand to gain...

1115
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:41,415
by telling Mercedes
that Edmond Dantes is dead?"

1116
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:46,662
The answer is...
absolutely nothing.

1117
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,256
Just as you say, nothing.
So why...

1118
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:51,880
But if my old friend,
now chief prosecutor of France,

1119
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:54,503
doesn't gain from this lie,
well, who does?

1120
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:59,676
My dear Count, it's far too hot in here
and you're fully dressed.

1121
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:02,557
- It's time we both left.
- I think the clearest beneficiary...

1122
01:46:02,565 --> 01:46:04,601
is Fernand, Count Mondego.

1123
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:11,696
I don't understand what this inquisition
has to do with our business relationship.

1124
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:14,031
I'm about to tell you.

1125
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:19,035
Sit down, Mondego.

1126
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:23,408
I'm an ambitious man.
And I have furthered these ambitions...

1127
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:25,660
by scooping up Bonapartists.

1128
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:29,038
But now with Napoleon
on the loose, I have,

1129
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:31,624
shall I say,
a thorn in my side.

1130
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:34,756
Once merely an irritation,
now potentially lethal.

1131
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:37,596
- Be lethal in turn.
- Well, the problem is such...

1132
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,091
that I, myself,
cannot attend to it.

1133
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:42,392
So I have a proposition
for you.

1134
01:46:47,026 --> 01:46:49,267
How is your father?

1135
01:46:49,278 --> 01:46:51,894
Alive, unfortunately.

1136
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:55,069
We share the same misfortune.

1137
01:46:58,829 --> 01:47:01,366
You remember?

1138
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:15,801
Why is this door locked?

1139
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:18,420
I demand that you release me
from this room at once.

1140
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,423
You've proved yourself
no friend of mine.

1141
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:23,426
Your father was a loyal supporter
of Napoleon, wasn't he?

1142
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,432
Possibly involved in plotting
Napoleon's escape from Elba.

1143
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:29,356
The emperor arrives soon!

1144
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,435
An inconvenient
parent for an ambitious civil servant.

1145
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:36,940
But then he died, suddenly and opportunely
murdered, again some 16 years ago.

1146
01:47:36,951 --> 01:47:40,535
The Emperor Napoleon.

1147
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:46,491
The murderer never apprehended.
How hard did you look for him?

1148
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:49,164
You have no proof,
no witnesses.

1149
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:52,496
You just have theories.
J-Just conjectures.

1150
01:47:52,508 --> 01:47:54,965
On the contrary.
I have Count Mondego.

1151
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:59,844
Young Mondego. Why?

1152
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:02,339
Because your son
lacked the courage.

1153
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:07,345
Mondego is the one
who pulled the trigger!

1154
01:48:07,356 --> 01:48:09,517
He'd never confess
in a million years!

1155
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:12,141
You're right,
he wouldn't.

1156
01:48:12,152 --> 01:48:16,441
But you just have.

1157
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:23,486
Monsieur Villefort, you are under
arrest for conspiracy to murder.

1158
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:26,989
You remember?

1159
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:34,288
Dantes?

1160
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,608
A courtesy for a gentleman.

1161
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:27,807
You didn't think
I'd make it that easy, did you?

1162
01:49:27,895 --> 01:49:29,806
Hyah!

1163
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,200
Edmond?

1164
01:49:55,547 --> 01:49:58,960
I thought we had finished our
conversation in the carriage.

1165
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:01,800
So did I.

1166
01:50:03,138 --> 01:50:05,971
Until I realized...

1167
01:50:07,059 --> 01:50:11,268
you said the name "Dantes."

1168
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:14,855
A name that
I had never mentioned.

1169
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:22,442
What do you want of me?

1170
01:50:22,533 --> 01:50:25,366
I want to be free of you,

1171
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:28,444
the way you obviously
are free of me.

1172
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:34,158
Just a few answers from you,
and I shall be gone forever.

1173
01:50:36,672 --> 01:50:39,505
Ask your questions.

1174
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:49,715
Where have you been?

1175
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:55,888
Thirteen years in
the Chateau d'If...

1176
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:57,939
and everywhere else
you can imagine.

1177
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:03,987
The Chateau d'If
for 13 years.

1178
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:09,822
Did you suffer?

1179
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:14,995
Are you finished now?
I have a good deal on my mind.

1180
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:17,246
- What happened afterward?
- Much.

1181
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:19,703
- Why did you not come to me?
- Why did you not wait?

1182
01:51:19,715 --> 01:51:22,252
You married the very man
who betrayed...

1183
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:28,178
I told you that night
on the rocks, remember?

1184
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:33,677
That it would never leave my finger.
And it never has.

1185
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:37,763
- Why?
- You know why.

1186
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:42,901
If you ever loved me,

1187
01:51:42,905 --> 01:51:45,396
don't...
don't rob me of my hate.

1188
01:51:45,407 --> 01:51:47,398
It's all I have.

1189
01:51:47,409 --> 01:51:52,073
Let it go, Edmond.
Let it go.

1190
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:55,368
I don't know what dark plan
lies within you.

1191
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,950
Nor do I know by what design
we were asked...

1192
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:00,411
to live without
each other these 16 years.

1193
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:03,414
- But God has offered us a new beginning...
- God?

1194
01:52:03,508 --> 01:52:06,375
Don't slap His hand away.

1195
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:08,377
Can I never escape Him?

1196
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:13,382
No. He is in everything.

1197
01:52:15,479 --> 01:52:19,142
Even in a kiss.

1198
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:14,527
My lady?

1199
01:53:14,621 --> 01:53:17,328
Where's the count?

1200
01:53:17,332 --> 01:53:20,495
Um, the count would like
for you to join him this afternoon.

1201
01:53:20,585 --> 01:53:23,622
- Join him?
- Uh, yes,

1202
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:27,964
in, uh, leaving the country
with your son.

1203
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:34,129
Mmm, uh, I'll have someone
bring you to your house...

1204
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:35,839
and you just
wait there for me.

1205
01:53:35,851 --> 01:53:38,183
- And we just...
- Thank you!

1206
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:40,807
- Yes, yes, but...
- I need to go home and pack.

1207
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:42,808
Yes, yes. My lady...

1208
01:53:47,154 --> 01:53:49,987
- Where's the count?
- Upstairs, my lady.

1209
01:53:58,707 --> 01:54:00,663
What's wrong?

1210
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:06,087
I'm bankrupt.
All my debts have been called in.

1211
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:09,040
- Also, I'm to be arrested.
- For what?

1212
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:12,043
Piracy, corruption
and murder.

1213
01:54:12,137 --> 01:54:15,675
- Did you do all these things?
- Yes.

1214
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:18,348
There is simply not time to talk.
The gendarmes are on the way,

1215
01:54:18,435 --> 01:54:21,017
apparently, so hurry up
and pack something.

1216
01:54:21,021 --> 01:54:23,512
I'm not going
with you, Fernand.

1217
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:35,612
You are my wife.

1218
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:38,739
I have made
arrangements for us.

1219
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:41,739
We shall be very well
taken care of.

1220
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:44,950
Now go and find my son.

1221
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:48,458
- He's not your son.
- I beg your pardon?

1222
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:53,383
Albert Mondego is the son
of Edmond Dantes.

1223
01:54:57,933 --> 01:55:03,178
Why do you think I rushed off so quickly
to marry you after Edmond was taken away?

1224
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:16,073
Premature.

1225
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:36,301
Well, aren't you
a piece of work.

1226
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:41,424
So he's the bastard son
of a dead traitor.

1227
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:43,426
He always was disappointing.

1228
01:55:56,116 --> 01:56:00,951
Good-bye, Mercedes.
You did please me some of the time.

1229
01:56:05,292 --> 01:56:08,784
You never pleased me.

1230
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:01,594
What is this?

1231
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:18,027
Monte Cristo.

1232
01:57:21,284 --> 01:57:23,866
King's to you, Fernand.

1233
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:34,537
Edmond?

1234
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:38,585
But how...

1235
01:57:38,593 --> 01:57:43,087
How did I escape?
With difficulty.

1236
01:57:43,181 --> 01:57:48,096
How did I plan this moment?
With pleasure.

1237
01:57:48,103 --> 01:57:51,391
So you've taken Mercedes?

1238
01:57:51,398 --> 01:57:53,810
And everything else...

1239
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:55,856
except your life.

1240
01:57:58,029 --> 01:58:00,065
Why are you doing this?

1241
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:02,818
It's complicated.

1242
01:58:04,286 --> 01:58:08,575
Let's just say it's vengeance
for the life you stole from me.

1243
01:58:18,967 --> 01:58:21,834
Well, I see someone
has taught you the sword.

1244
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:24,761
How did you ever
call yourself my friend?

1245
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:28,261
We were friends, Edmond.

1246
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:31,101
You sent me to hell!

1247
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:33,095
Why?

1248
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:37,311
Take your vengeance.

1249
01:58:37,402 --> 01:58:40,109
But know the blood
you spill is noble.

1250
01:58:42,032 --> 01:58:44,023
Blood that will never
run through your veins.

1251
01:58:44,117 --> 01:58:46,108
You're no more a count
than I am a commoner!

1252
01:58:54,502 --> 01:58:57,289
You don't have it in you.

1253
01:59:02,844 --> 01:59:06,553
- Touch him, and I'll kill you.
- Boy, let me explain.

1254
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:10,303
It's been explained. I spoke to
Madame Villefort on the street.

1255
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:13,180
She told me how I was a silly,
trusting dupe that my friend,

1256
01:59:13,188 --> 01:59:15,645
the Count of Monte Cristo,
used to get into our lives.

1257
01:59:15,732 --> 01:59:17,643
- Albert, listen to me.
- I will not!

1258
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:20,851
Forgive me for being
such a fool, Father.

1259
01:59:20,945 --> 01:59:22,981
You were betrayed.
Of course you're forgiven.

1260
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:25,234
You were my friend.
I looked up to you.

1261
01:59:25,325 --> 01:59:27,361
There's a history here
you know nothing about.

1262
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:30,236
He loved your mother,
and yet she chose me.

1263
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:32,787
- Now he intends to steal her away.
- Lie. Get out of my way!

1264
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:39,327
Boy, if I have to,
I will kill you.

1265
01:59:39,339 --> 01:59:41,500
I will not stop now.

1266
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:44,333
- Nor will I.
- So be it.

1267
01:59:44,427 --> 01:59:46,634
No!

1268
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:07,777
Albert,

1269
02:00:07,867 --> 02:00:11,735
I found the note you left
explaining where you'd gone.

1270
02:00:11,746 --> 02:00:16,911
But now I must
explain something to you.

1271
02:00:17,001 --> 02:00:19,708
Where you really come from.

1272
02:00:19,713 --> 02:00:23,797
Albert, you are
the son of Edmond Dantes.

1273
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:33,553
The man you know as
the Count of Monte Cristo.

1274
02:00:47,907 --> 02:00:49,898
Well, I'm afraid
it is true.

1275
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:53,485
You are the walking proof that your
mother was as much of a whore...

1276
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,117
in her younger years
as she is today.

1277
02:00:56,124 --> 02:00:58,240
You...

1278
02:01:01,463 --> 02:01:03,499
You let me fight him?

1279
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:06,423
It didn't do
any good though, did it?

1280
02:01:06,426 --> 02:01:09,133
Fernand, I beg you.
No more!

1281
02:01:09,137 --> 02:01:11,093
I want no more of this.

1282
02:01:12,432 --> 02:01:17,096
Just go.
Call it mercy.

1283
02:01:17,187 --> 02:01:19,178
Mercy, Fernand.

1284
02:01:25,445 --> 02:01:30,781
You've only got one shot, and it
will take more than that to stop me.

1285
02:01:30,867 --> 02:01:34,451
Well, then I'd best put it
where it will do the most damage.

1286
02:01:36,122 --> 02:01:38,488
No!

1287
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:40,957
Mother! Mother!

1288
02:01:41,044 --> 02:01:44,753
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look what I've done. Jacopo!

1289
02:01:48,468 --> 02:01:50,379
Hyah!

1290
02:01:55,225 --> 02:01:57,341
Once again, Zatarra,

1291
02:01:57,352 --> 02:01:59,684
God sees you out of
the corner of His eye.

1292
02:01:59,771 --> 02:02:01,636
She'll live.

1293
02:02:34,681 --> 02:02:37,218
Edmond!

1294
02:02:37,225 --> 02:02:40,262
Edmond!

1295
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:44,096
Please don't go
out there. Don't.

1296
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:46,272
Edmond, don't go.

1297
02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:49,943
You try.
Don't ever quit.

1298
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:52,520
Zatarra,

1299
02:02:52,532 --> 02:02:55,695
you must end this.

1300
02:02:57,370 --> 02:03:00,862
Even the priest
will understand that.

1301
02:03:00,874 --> 02:03:04,992
- Edmond!
- Please don't leave.

1302
02:03:07,255 --> 02:03:10,042
Watch over your mother.

1303
02:03:29,736 --> 02:03:35,026
Now, I couldn't live in a world where
you have everything and I have nothing.

1304
02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:18,504
What happened
to your mercy?

1305
02:05:18,594 --> 02:05:23,554
I'm a count,
not a saint.

1306
02:06:04,182 --> 02:06:08,676
You were right, priest.
You were right.

1307
02:06:10,396 --> 02:06:12,728
This I promise you...

1308
02:06:12,815 --> 02:06:17,229
and God:

1309
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:20,399
All that was used
for vengeance...

1310
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:24,733
will now be used for good.

1311
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:29,116
So rest in peace, my friend.

1312
02:06:29,123 --> 02:06:32,411
So, Zatarra,

1313
02:06:32,418 --> 02:06:34,579
painful, huh?

1314
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:37,503
No.

1315
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:48,135
I bought this place, thinking
one day I would tear it down.

1316
02:06:48,226 --> 02:06:50,933
But now the only things
I care about...

1317
02:06:50,937 --> 02:06:55,431
are walking off
this island with me.

1318
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:58,274
Let's go home.
