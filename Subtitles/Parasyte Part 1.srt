1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,360
If the number of humans could be reduced by half...

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,200
If the number of forests is burnt by half...

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,660
If the number of human beings is reduced to a hundred...

5
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,830
Could existing waste...

6
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,030
become one in a hundred as well?

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,130
Someone in the world definitely thinks so...

8
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,700
if you want to save the lives of others.

9
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,530
What's wrong?

10
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,930
Oww!

11
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,530
What are you doing?

12
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,960
A-A snake entered my hand!

13
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,700
Huh?

14
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
A snake got into it...!

15
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,000
Really...
what are you thinking?

16
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,430
Hey, wait--! Don't!

17
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,660
Are you really alright?

18
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,660
Huh?

19
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,720
It's because you're listening to something like this,
that's why you got this strange dream?

20
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,720
Good night.

21
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,560
Good morning.

22
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,460
Morning.

23
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,530
Oh, no...
This turned out bad...

24
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm going to leave first, okay?

25
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,760
Eat your breakfast properly.

26
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,200
And don't forget your lunch.

27
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
Hey...
Keep yourself together...

28
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,820
Somehow...
my right hand feels weird.

29
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,050
Isn't it because of last night?

30
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,630
Strangling your own right hand
with your earphones and all.

31
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,160
I'm heading out.

32
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,880
What are you doing?

33
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm going shopping at the next shop.

34
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,730
Huh...?

35
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,330
What's with that surprised expression?

36
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,130
Stop doing that.
What are you gonna do if my heart stopped?

37
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,100
Oh, c'mon. You're okay, right?

38
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,230
Don't mess around.
I'm not a kid anymore.

39
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,630
Ho-ho, you're blushing!
You're really cute when you do that.

40
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,630
Argh, get off me!

41
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,100
W-What is it?

42
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,860
Now, wait a second!
What the hell are you doing!?

43
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,800
Eh, huh?

44
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,800
I-I can't believe this!

45
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,628
<i>In 1952, ECSC ...</i>

46
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:31,740
The European Coal and Steel Community
is established.

47
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:35,514
<i>This was 1950</i>

48
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:38,215
<i>when the French Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman</i>

49
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:42,120
<i>In order to prevent war
from breaking out between Germany and France</i>

50
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:45,788
<i>proposed a bill...</i>

51
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,900
Run!

52
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
Pass it over!

53
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,330
Izumi, pass it!

54
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,630
That was great, Izumi.
Nice shot!

55
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,660
Carry on with the game.

56
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,200
Hey...

57
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
"Hand moves involuntarily"

58
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,730
<i>I failed... I failed...</i>

59
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,110
<i>I didn't eat...</i>

60
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,760
<i>I failed, I failed.</i>

61
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,630
What the hell are you?

62
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,960
<i>What... are you?</i>

63
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,200
My right hand...

64
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,460
<i>My right hand...</i>

65
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,460
<i>I ate it.</i>

66
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,160
You ate it!?

67
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,200
<i>Teach me... to talk...</i>

68
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,700
Shinichi.

69
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,260
Huh!?

70
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,830
<i>Currently, the IAEA is carrying out
an investigation into a case.</i>

71
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,130
IAEA.

72
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,800
Research.

73
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,930
IAEA.

74
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,930
Research.

75
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,460
Mom, I'm home.
Is the dinner ready yet?

76
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm hungry.

77
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Welcome back.

78
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,660
Hey, mom!
Where's the food!?

79
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
I'm really hungry.

80
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,660
Although I'm awake...

81
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,060
the dream is still continuing.

82
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,230
Hey, c'mon.
Gimme my right hand back.

83
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,030
I can't right now!

84
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,830
I'm gathering information.

85
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,330
You, since when did you
learn to talk so well...?

86
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,260
Studying the Japanese language,
one day is enough.

87
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,130
<i>Shinichi...</i>

88
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,860
<i>Shinichi, you'll be late.</i>

89
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm up, mom!
Everything's fine!

90
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,960
What's okay, anyway?

91
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
Mom/Mother...

92
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,760
the body associated with Shinichi,

93
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,400
from the relationship with the father who lived in this house.

94
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,060
You know what a hospital is?

95
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,760
A place where the wounded and sick are treated.

96
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,900
I'll go there and let them cut you out!

97
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,430
I refuse!

98
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,900
I live on the cells that exists inside Shinichi.

99
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,700
If you do that, I would immediately die.

100
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,030
That's why I'm going to let them cut you out.

101
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,620
It will cause Shinichi to lose his right hand.

102
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,760
No point in doing that.

103
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,890
So what the heck?

104
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,560
No use asking questions.

105
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,760
Where did you come from?

106
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,260
Coming from nowhere,
and going nowhere?

107
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,700
What was I actually?

108
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,230
What answer can you give?

109
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,400
Shut up!

110
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,930
I do not have any memories.

111
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,100
My first memory starts with
failing to take over your brain.

112
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,010
And thinking that it's too bad.

113
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,620
Brain?

114
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,930
You're planning on taking my brain?

115
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,230
Because I've become a hand...

116
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,600
continuing my main mission is now impossible.

117
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,060
My feeling is wrapped up in despair.

118
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,660
That's my line.

119
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,400
Can you read faster?
It'd be bad if you got seen.

120
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,930
I do the same thing as you to learn.

121
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,800
No way?

122
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,130
To know the world that you live in,
I need a lot of information.

123
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,000
It doesn't seem like a thing a right hand should say.

124
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,160
Don't think like that.

125
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,760
Don't you want to be somebody?

126
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,900
You're annoying, monster.

127
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,560
I do not agree with you calling me that.

128
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,030
So what do I call you?

129
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,530
If I really need a name...

130
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,530
call me Migi.

131
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,830
Migi?

132
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,800
As in a right hand?

133
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,600
Right.

134
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,860
So you can also think of
simple things like that, huh?

135
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,500
This kind of movements are very intriguing.

136
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,830
Stop talking out loud here.

137
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,460
I want to know more.
Take me somewhere else.

138
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,000
I see. Compared to the melee combat a while ago,
this focuses on a longer range?

139
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Like I said, don't talk out loud!

140
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,700
What kind of training do you have, Shinichi?

141
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,030
I...

142
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,700
don't do training.

143
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,230
You're late, Satomi...

144
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,300
Sorry, it took me a while.

145
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,560
Oh, you came.

146
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,100
If you do something like that again,
I'll kill you. Got it?

147
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,830
It's just--

148
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,530
What?

149
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,860
Sorry.

150
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,030
Oh...

151
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,030
It's turning out pretty good.

152
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,460
Why did you pick that?

153
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,660
Because I don't have talent like you.

154
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,930
That's how it is.

155
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,330
Eh...

156
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,330
But you're doing great over there.

157
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,130
Hey...

158
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,730
Your model...

159
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,230
could it be Satomi?

160
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,680
Huh!?

161
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,330
Don't say random things...

162
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,330
Hey, it's a woman, right?

163
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,900
You're not being honest.

164
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,530
Shinichi...

165
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,900
What the hell, you guys?

166
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,230
I'll just restart it!

167
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,200
Wah!?

168
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,660
Heh?!

169
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,280
Sorry for interrupting...

170
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:22,727
Shinichi, do you want to
mate with that female?

171
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,290
Hah?

172
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,570
Murano Satomi.

173
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,900
What do you know of it?

174
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,900
I know about the sword...

175
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,400
down here.

176
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,100
Can I investigate?

177
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,330
Don't joke around!

178
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,100
I'm not joking.

179
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,460
I'm interested in this!

180
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:48,660
Ah, wait--!
Stop, stop. Stop!

181
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,300
Welcome...

182
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,930
The price is 268 yen, and 980 yen for this,

183
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,130
Total 1248 yen for all.

184
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,760
Where are we going?

185
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,460
Where would you like to go to?

186
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:45,997
<i>[Motive unknown,
Method unknown]</i>

187
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:47,999
<i>[Multiple killings discovered!]</i>

188
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,602
<i>[Terrifying acts of murder?]</i>

189
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,060
<i>For safety reasons,
please store your luggage.</i>

190
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,060
<i>Do not leave anything behind,
and check again before you alight.</i>

191
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,900
<i>To stop at the next stop,
please press the buzzer.</i>

192
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,130
What are you doing!?

193
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,600
We have to get off!

194
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,500
Stop doing that with everyone around!

195
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,100
There, it's there!

196
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,960
What is?

197
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,400
I felt the real brain eaters.

198
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,030
Even though it's my first time.

199
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,130
This...

200
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,560
But why?

201
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Your same kind?

202
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,030
Others just like you?

203
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,560
The distance is about 200 meters.

204
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,330
Come on.

205
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,760
I don't wanna!

206
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,060
Hah?

207
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,060
I-It's not what you think.

208
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,330
I need to know what it was
I'm supposed to have become.

209
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,200
Ok fine, I'll go.
Just calm down.

210
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,860
Here?

211
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,100
Yes, the distance out is only 5 meters.

212
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,200
Idiot!

213
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,600
Stop it!

214
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,560
Fellow kind?

215
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,360
You've come to a good place.

216
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,360
This place is nice...

217
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,360
By waiting alone,

218
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,330
I can get my next meal.

219
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,400
This is the original host.

220
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,330
Hmm?

221
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,560
What is this?

222
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,500
Is the brain still intact?

223
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,800
Now, that's bad...

224
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,430
Very bad...

225
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Shinichi, run!
I sense killing intent!

226
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,260
You're a human.
You can't win!

227
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,860
Shinichi!

228
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,630
Wait!

229
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,330
If you lay a hand on this human,
I'll kill you!

230
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,630
I understand where you're coming from.

231
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,960
If the host dies,
you too won't be able to live.

232
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,300
So, you just have to move over here.

233
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,160
Move?

234
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,060
To do that...
it's impossible.

235
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,260
Seems you haven't done your homework at all.

236
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,900
It is impossible for one head with two brains.

237
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,160
But...

238
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,460
if it is from hand to hand,
then it's possible.

239
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,830
Look, I've cut it off.

240
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,530
Move over here.

241
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,530
Move over from that body.

242
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,460
My body should be better, right?

243
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,600
Migi?

244
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,800
You not going to listen to him, are you?

245
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,800
C'mon, say something!

246
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,560
Ah, whatever.

247
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,830
I'll cut off that whiny boy's head!

248
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,730
Are you serious!?

249
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,160
My body...

250
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,530
My body...

251
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,200
Is he dead?

252
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,130
Good thing we watched those sword fights.

253
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,660
You...

254
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,830
You've killed one of your comrades.

255
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,300
There was no other option.

256
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,500
If you die, I die.

257
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,500
His proposal was risky.

258
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,500
You saved me!

259
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,830
This is not for you.

260
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,160
I just saved myself.

261
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,160
And also perhaps,

262
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,600
someday maybe I'll leave.

263
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,000
Hey...

264
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,130
Remember not drink too much.

265
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,200
Tell your wife to come over, okay?

266
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,560
Ok, I'll remember to tell her.

267
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,430
Get well soon.

268
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,400
Thank you very much.

269
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,260
I'll finish up soon,
so wait there a bit.

270
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,930
I'll go shopping first, okay?

271
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,200
Welcome.

272
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,960
Two mincemeat, please.

273
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,160
All right.

274
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,430
Why mince?

275
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,900
Huh? You like it, don't you?

276
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,200
Don't have any appetite?

277
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,830
Is there a problem?

278
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,760
Eh?

279
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,530
You've been acting weird lately...

280
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,030
I'll be a 3rd year soon, right?

281
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,630
It's just school work stressing me out,
that's why I'm like this.

282
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,600
Oh, I see.

283
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,660
<i>A body was discovered in a car,
in a car park in Kanagawa.</i>

284
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,130
<i>Sakagami Kohei was identified as the victim,
aged 41 years and died on the spot.</i>

285
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,330
Apparently, I can't tell mom.

286
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,400
It's better that way.

287
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,060
But if this continues,
the victims will continue to grow.

288
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,260
Actually I want to tell her all about you.

289
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,860
Why?

290
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,630
Only I know what's going on.

291
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,400
I can't just keep quiet, right?

292
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,930
You will be arrested as one of the suspects.

293
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,630
Is there no way?

294
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,460
If you don't do something about your friends soon...

295
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,460
Shinichi, I don't understand your logic.

296
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,860
My kind are just eating.

297
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,500
I'm digesting the nutrients in your blood as food

298
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,960
but the others had to rely on themselves to find food.

299
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,830
But they don't have to eat people...

300
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,360
Shinichi, why are you against eating other humans?

301
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,330
Hah?

302
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,130
Don't you understand?

303
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,330
Human lives are precious.

304
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,330
The most precious thing is one's own life.

305
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,760
For me, that is the most important thing.

306
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
That's because you're all just monsters!

307
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,700
For you humans, you eat cows, pigs,
birds, fish and many others.

308
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,700
Whatever plants and animal,
you've eaten them all.

309
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,130
By comparison, isn't eating human beings,
not as awful as you all?

310
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,830
You can't compare it that way...

311
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,160
In short, Shinichi.

312
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,960
If you continue to give me the nutrients to live,

313
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,760
I will fully protect you from anything.

314
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,130
If you're going to harm me,

315
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,560
making you unable to talk will be easy.

316
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Even if I cannot take the rest of the body...

317
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,560
Eh?

318
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,730
Very nice expression.

319
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,430
Demon!

320
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,930
Demon?

321
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,430
Thank you very much.

322
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,100
What's the result?

323
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,130
We saw body parts...

324
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,430
however, it doesn't look like a human being.

325
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,960
Hah?

326
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,630
The owner?

327
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,160
You mean he ate people?

328
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,560
Man-eater...

329
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,800
He was found dead in a position like this.

330
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,500
Detective, what exactly is this?

331
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,600
It makes no sense.

332
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,760
Shinichi, after being called a demon,

333
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,460
turns out humans are what's closest to it.

334
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,660
<i>At the start of this new semester...</i>

335
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,830
<i>many of you will find yourselves
at different points of your goal.</i>

336
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:54,800
<i>Do not give up, but push yourselves as hard as you can.
That goal can be reached with every little step.</i>

337
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,800
<i>Therefore, for all of you who have come here,</i>

338
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,560
<i>please continue to strive for the best.</i>

339
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,630
Shinichi.

340
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,800
I felt a presence.

341
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,560
One of my kind is near.

342
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,230
You've got to be kidding...

343
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,900
Don't look for it.
It's also searching for us.

344
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,830
There's no way it would take the fight
to a crowd as big as this.

345
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,200
<i>And that's the end of my speech.</i>

346
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:29,000
So, to substitute Mr. Machiyama due to an accident,

347
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,330
I will be introducing you our new teacher.

348
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,330
Please.

349
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,530
There she is!

350
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,960
For real...?

351
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,500
Don't look!
We'll be spotted!

352
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,560
Tamiya Ryouko.

353
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,470
Nice to meet you all.

354
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't be afraid.

355
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,000
Come closer to me.

356
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,700
I can hear your heartbeat pounding from here.

357
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,300
Don't worry.

358
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:43,230
If a fight takes place here,
we will both be harmed.

359
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,230
Besides,

360
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,700
if there's killing intent in the air,

361
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,230
your right hand would have sensed it.

362
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,160
It's Migi.

363
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,960
Surviving on one of the host's body parts...
it's unimaginable...

364
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,600
I didn't reside here on purpose.

365
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,760
You...

366
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,260
what are you planning to do in this school?

367
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
Planning something?

368
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,500
I just want to live normally.

369
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,100
I want to talk more,
but it seems impossible here.

370
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,960
Your girlfriend...

371
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,730
Come look for me after school.

372
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,960
I want to talk directly to you.

373
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,760
Fine.

374
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,230
You don't get to decide.

375
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,700
I don't want to talk with you!

376
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,560
Izumi,

377
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,900
mind your manners when talking to your teacher.

378
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,900
See you later.

379
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,860
Acting like a real teacher...

380
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,930
We have to go.

381
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,930
If she's planning something,
what're we gonna do?

382
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,930
I was surprised to see it,

383
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,030
but although it ate her brain,
she's living like a human.

384
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,030
Maybe it could solve our existing problem.

385
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,830
In addition, she teaches manners to a human.

386
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,830
That really surprised me.

387
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,360
I want to know more!

388
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,600
Taking me to a place like this...
Just what do you want to talk about?

389
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,130
There are two more,
the distance is 10 metres away.

390
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:35,800
Two!?

391
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,400
What is the meaning of this, Tamiya?

392
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,220
Distance from them, 1 metre.

393
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,380
I can totally see it.

394
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,370
I will introduce them to you.

395
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,220
Shimada Hideo.

396
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:57,810
Yo.

397
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,300
He's the same as you, a high school kid.

398
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,360
I thought it would be convenient
if you two talked to each other.

399
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,330
The other is an officer...

400
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,740
You don't need to know my name.

401
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,480
In that case,

402
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,010
call him Mr. A.

403
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,100
There's even a police officer...

404
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,320
disturbing.

405
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,740
This is Izumi Shinichi,

406
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,540
and also Migi.

407
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,330
You really took his right hand, huh?

408
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,730
That's interesting.

409
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,730
This is real.

410
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,470
What made you want to take these people
into our Network,

411
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
Tamiya Ryouko?

412
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,500
For collecting data.

413
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,490
What's a Network?

414
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,490
I told you to shut it!

415
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,850
To survive,

416
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,950
we need each other's help.

417
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,580
Such as,

418
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,820
finding hidden places to eat everyday.

419
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,510
In order not to look like a homicide.

420
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,720
But lately,
don't you think everything has been reported?

421
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,380
News of the amputee and the man-eating?

422
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,380
So what?

423
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,090
It's because you can't hide what you're doing.

424
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,810
What we are looking for,

425
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,160
are people who will not be missed.

426
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,380
We were all sharing information

427
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,070
in order to learn from each other.
It's very important,

428
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,700
the Network.

429
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,090
Don't tell me...
you want us to join your Network?

430
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,760
But I'm not entirely the same as you.

431
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,240
We are monsters.

432
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,820
I agree.

433
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,740
So I conducted an experiment.

434
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:56,930
Mr. A and I had sex.

435
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,860
As a result, I'm now pregnant.

436
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,330
So in other words,

437
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,930
what is this something that exists inside me?

438
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,740
Both of you used humans bodies,
therefore a human being was created.

439
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
That's right.

440
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,070
What I have inside me is a human child.

441
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,360
So the question arises,

442
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,080
what are we, actually?

443
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:40,180
We do not have an original body
and just took over someone else's.

444
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,200
How can it be possible?

445
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:55,420
Just for what purpose
do we exist in this world?

446
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,300
Like I know...

447
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,940
Leaving that aside,
we just want to protect ourselves.

448
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,830
I'm thinking of our future cooperation.

449
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,140
I refuse, ok?

450
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,410
I'm asking Migi.

451
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,810
At least don't disturb us,

452
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,060
or do something like oppose us.

453
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:24,340
I can kill a whole class within 3 seconds.

454
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,210
Remember, the school is my hostage.

455
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,400
Including your girlfriend.

456
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,720
See you next time.

457
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,900
Shinichi,

458
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,680
beware of A.

459
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,480
I can sense killing intent from him.

460
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,730
It turns out that a menstruating woman tastes awful.

461
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,350
Make sure you finish up the rest!

462
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,450
And keep the place clean for us to eat.

463
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,640
Don't you want to a have a bite?

464
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm doing an experiment.

465
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,710
Disgusting. Eating something like that...
it's not good for your body.

466
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,160
Tamiya Ryouko.

467
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,010
Do you really plan on taking that human in as our colleague?

468
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,650
If we can think like how humans think,

469
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,220
Izumi Shinichi and Migi

470
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,480
will make the ideal subjects of research.

471
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,540
You guys,

472
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,180
should be able to also understand this.

473
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,490
Especially you, A.

474
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,550
In order to survive in this human world.

475
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,800
Like me, right?

476
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,550
The newly opened restaurant has really good food.

477
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,510
Should we go there sometime?

478
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,190
Sure.

479
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,700
Don't be shy,
we can think about it occasionally.

480
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,860
I think it's better
if you don't leave the house that often.

481
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,790
Eh?

482
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,880
Because there are many incidents happening outside.

483
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,680
Lately, I haven't been able to talk to you.

484
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:00,880
No need to worry about little things like that.
See you later.

485
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,130
Wait a minute, Shinichi.

486
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,890
Something must have happened?
Tell me.

487
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,360
Nothing happened!

488
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,010
Don't hide things from your parents.

489
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,820
I know something's happening with you.

490
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,610
I'm not a kid anymore.
Hiding something... it's only natural, right?

491
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,480
Just remember...

492
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,710
that I'm always here to give you a hand.

493
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,440
Stop doing that!
I'm not a kid anymore!

494
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,330
I can take care of myself,
so don't worry.

495
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,710
Hot water or hot oil
causing local tissue damage on skin called a "burn".

496
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,080
Whenever you see your mother's scars,
your blood pressure rises.

497
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,840
I want to know why would a mother do that.

498
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,020
That's got nothing to do with you.

499
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,870
Yes, it has.

500
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,970
Because the nutrients I got was good.

501
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,260
Pan fried tempura.

502
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,720
When I was 4 years old,
I almost got splashed by hot oil on the head.

503
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,240
I turned out fine because mom caught the pot immediately.

504
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,550
Even now,

505
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,370
whenever it rains her scars will itch.

506
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,620
Sacrificing yourself to protect others.

507
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,770
It is something I cannot understand about humans.

508
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,710
As for your painting... it's not someone else.
It's your mom, right?

509
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,110
The distance is 20 meters.
Shinichi, he's here.

510
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,170
It's Mr. A from yesterday.
We should wait for him to pass by.

511
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,730
This killing intent...
he's serious this time.

512
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,740
What do we do now?

513
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,270
He also seems to have good fighting skills.

514
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,880
We best avoid him.

515
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,420
There is a choice of Plan A and Plan B,
which one do you want?

516
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,380
If so,

517
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,670
Plan A then.

518
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,400
So first, we avoid him.

519
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,110
I'll do the talking.

520
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,340
What do you think you're doing?

521
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,410
I'm not the same as Tamiya Ryouko.

522
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,500
What's the point of our kind
fighting each other?

523
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,270
Our kind?

524
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,140
Your kind with whom?

525
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,840
Why don't you let us pass?

526
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,190
During the recent murder case,
I saw his body at police headquarters.

527
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,820
At that time,
we had to find out the cause of that incident.

528
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,620
There is only one thing I know who can kill that way...

529
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,220
and it's parasites alone.

530
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,760
You are dangerous.

531
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,740
Leave the attacks to me.
But our victory will depend on you, Shinichi.

532
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,610
Shinichi!

533
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,050
Hurry!

534
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,990
Shinichi!

535
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,790
What is this?

536
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,800
The blood won't stop.

537
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,120
Your body is slowly failing
because of massive hemorrhage.

538
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,780
You will completely bleed out.

539
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,950
Disregarding an attack from a human
was your biggest mistake.

540
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,460
It can't be...
that--

541
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,360
A human...

542
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,580
What's wrong with you?
You haven't taken any damage.

543
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,950
That was a human body.

544
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,320
I've killed a man!

545
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,360
When his brain was taken over,
he was no longer a human.

546
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,520
What's with you!?

547
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,440
Human nature

548
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,630
really is hard to comprehend.

549
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,800
That Plan B... what's that?

550
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,020
There is no such thing.

551
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,980
It was only the option to make it easy.

552
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,310
Huh!?

553
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,420
Welcome.

554
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,660
2 packs of minced meat.

555
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,700
All right.

556
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,090
My son loves eating it.

557
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,320
Oh, I see...

558
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,420
This body can no longer survive.

559
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,960
If there is a new body,

560
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,360
cut...

561
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,710
separate...

562
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,810
merge...

563
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,220
replace...

564
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,560
Cut...

565
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,800
Are you alright?

566
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,950
Cut...

567
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,590
separate...

568
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,560
merge...

569
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,580
Replace...!

570
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,440
Shinichi, this is bad!
Shinichi!

571
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,450
What the heck?

572
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,940
150 meters.

573
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,250
140 meters.

574
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:21,940
It's getting closer.

575
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,800
Another one!?

576
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,050
I can't take this anymore!

577
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,500
30 meters.

578
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,670
20 meters.

579
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,220
I can beat it, I can beat it, I can beat it...

580
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,180
10 meters.

581
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,360
What's wrong?

582
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,330
He stopped in front of the house.

583
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,200
Give me a break...!

584
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,200
It can't be...

585
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,160
He's coming in...

586
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,160
How does he have our house key?

587
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,340
This feeling...

588
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,570
Mom?

589
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,270
Shinichi, you're wrong.

590
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,680
It's you, right, mom?

591
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,780
It's A!

592
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,040
What're you talking about?
A is dead, right?

593
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,690
Mom.

594
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:42,700
Welcome home.

595
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,090
That's A!
You have to realize that, Shinichi!

596
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,200
Stop it, Migi!

597
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,730
He separated from his old body,
and moved to your mother's body!

598
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,280
Don't go saying things like that!

599
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,950
It's the truth, Shinichi!

600
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,800
Too bad...

601
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:59,500
It turns out that the body I took was your...

602
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,310
Mom, I'm sorry...

603
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,440
C'mon, mom...
stop joking around like that...

604
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,840
Don't, Shinichi!

605
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,890
Your mother is not human anymore!

606
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,670
I told you to shut up, right!?
You're the monster!

607
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,380
Mom...

608
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:19,730
I'm sorry for hiding it from you.

609
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,640
T-This is just...

610
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,620
I'm just afraid that mom will worry about it,
so I didn't tell you.

611
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,660
I was looking for the right time to talk about it.

612
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:38,370
It's because I'm weak and afraid,
that's why I didn't want to make you worry.

613
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,320
I always wanted to thank you.

614
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,260
From the beginning,
I really wanted you to know...

615
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,130
That's why...!

616
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,820
Please tell me it's all a joke, mom!

617
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:53,850
Mom...

618
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:56,740
Shinichi!

619
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,700
Shinichi!

620
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,360
Shinichi!

621
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,020
I pierced his heart, so it's over.

622
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,560
You will also die with him.

623
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,940
Because you didn't take the brain of that boy.

624
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,700
You're awake? It's a miracle.

625
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,780
I used a piece of myself to cover up
the hole left in your body.

626
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,900
Then I left a part of me in your heart
that had been destroyed.

627
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,240
Afterwards, I slowly returned back into your right hand.

628
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,200
It was like a risky experiment.
But luckily it turned out well.

629
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,630
You should've just left me to die...

630
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,520
Mom...

631
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,020
Forget it! She's been taken over by A!

632
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,580
You haven't been to school these past few days.
Why, I wonder?

633
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,580
Shinichi?

634
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,180
Are you alright?

635
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,840
Where are you going?

636
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,910
Shinichi!

637
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:37,170
Stop following me.

638
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,660
Shinichi!

639
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,360
Near your house, a policeman's body was found.
It was on the news.

640
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,400
Was that your doing?

641
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,680
Do you know where A is?

642
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,220
You killed him already, right?

643
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,760
That's what we thought at first,
but he had taken over Shinichi's mother.

644
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,160
Shinichi and me were almost killed.

645
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,420
So for those few days,
you were repairing his cells.

646
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,500
Where's A?

647
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,660
I don't know.

648
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,680
Don't lie to me!
He's in your Network, isn't he!?

649
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,080
Even if I do know,

650
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,460
I won't tell you.

651
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,180
So you're hiding your friend?

652
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,820
We all have a personality of our own.

653
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,540
A has a strong personality,
so he's considered dangerous.

654
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:38,020
If you already knew about that,
then why introduce us to A?

655
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,000
An experiment.

656
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,660
Just an experiment.

657
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,550
Just an experiment?

658
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,950
You did it just for that!?

659
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:08,920
Brave, aren't we?

660
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,650
If you insist,

661
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,180
then it seems I have no choice.

662
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:31,660
For a while, I saw...

663
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,510
a change in you.

664
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:40,000
Interesting...

665
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,060
You two really are interesting.

666
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,380
Wait!

667
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:59,660
Looks like we'll meet again, Izumi.

668
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,320
I swear I'll find you.

669
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,900
No matter what, I'll find you.

670
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I'll kill you.

671
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,000
Detective.

672
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,650
Huh?

673
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,180
About the fish market police killing,
a residual fingerprint has been found consistent...

674
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:55,310
...with the iron pipe weapon
and the back door of the restaurant murder.

675
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,380
So the suspect is the same...

676
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,840
About the victim at the scene,

677
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,340
they found human flesh in his stomach.

678
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,240
How can it be possible?

679
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:11,480
Can't you see?

680
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,510
I'm eating right now.

681
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,560
But you're still looking at these photos, right?

682
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,460
Then, the rumors are true...

683
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,500
that there are unknown
parasitic organisms infecting the body.

684
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:33,080
Don't rush in with conclusions,
or the top will put the brakes on this investigation.

685
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,200
This station is one we haven't visited yet...

686
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,130
Where are we going?

687
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,970
I don't know.
I just want to walk somewhere today.

688
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,420
What if we accidentally crossed paths with A?

689
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:51,530
You've got a radar.

690
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,820
That's not an effective way.

691
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,430
If you were to meet A in this state...

692
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,090
What's up?

693
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,350
Someone's within 200 meters.

694
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:03,610
Is it A?

695
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:04,460
I have no idea.

696
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,170
But, Shinichi...

697
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,190
It isn't just one or two...

698
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,010
<i>The reason is simple.</i>

699
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,750
Is it in this crowd?

700
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:24,590
I can't sense it clearly.

701
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,410
I only know they're around here...

702
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,850
Really!?

703
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,660
Shinichi.

704
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,690
What?

705
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,020
In this crowd...

706
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,620
among this crowd...

707
01:01:37,754 --> 01:01:42,855
<i>Reduce the seats of parliamentary members!
Cut off the excess and redundant!</i>

708
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:45,783
<i>Not just the parliament</i>

709
01:01:46,262 --> 01:01:49,622
<i>In each area we have to separate the wheat from the chaff!</i>

710
01:01:49,899 --> 01:01:50,933
<i>Cut off the excess!</i>

711
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,710
Not A, but...

712
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,280
It's the one on the stand, huh?

713
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,050
This is surprising.

714
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:08,170
I was shocked by Tamiya Ryouko being a teacher,
and now they have someone in politics.

715
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,420
So they want to create a place where people can be eaten?

716
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:19,000
To control the town and have a place for them to gather.
There's no mistake.

717
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:24,280
After a few months,
they will become a highly evolved group.

718
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,880
You're too enthusiatic about all this...

719
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:33,600
Maybe someday,
the parasites will have full control over the entire world!

720
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,740
Don't talk about it so casually.

721
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,910
As if you monsters can do something like that.

722
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,800
You're underestimating us humans.

723
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,080
Izumi Shinichi, right?

724
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,970
Um, yes.

725
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,620
So... you live alone now?

726
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,150
That's right.

727
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,320
You cook for yourself?

728
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:07,970
Once in a while, yeah.

729
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,250
What about your future?

730
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:15,920
My mom still left me a decent amount of savings, so... umm...

731
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,370
Don't worry about it.

732
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,920
Sometime ago,
there was a case where a policeman was killed?

733
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,170
Do you know anything about it?

734
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,420
Not really.

735
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,620
Is that so?

736
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,920
Pardon our intrusion.

737
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,220
Well, thanks for everything.

738
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,150
Migi!

739
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,470
Good morning.

740
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,120
It's been difficult, huh?

741
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,500
I hope you find your mom soon.

742
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,420
What about your meals?

743
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:55,970
No problem.

744
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,400
If you want,

745
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,000
I can make you some.

746
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:02,750
It's him...

747
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,570
Good morning.

748
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:16,900
This is Shimada, our new transfer student.

749
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:20,020
I'm Shimada Hideo. Nice to meet you.

750
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,460
You can't shake with your right hand?

751
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,020
Why the hell are you here?

752
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,700
C'mon, what are you saying?

753
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,120
There, hope you two become friends.

754
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,080
What's wrong...?

755
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,040
Well then...

756
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,480
What was that?

757
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,020
I'm only testing out his power.

758
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,420
Good morning!

759
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,880
Got into another fight?

760
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,060
No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

761
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,360
Hey, that guy just now.
That was the new transfer student, right?

762
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,140
You do remember, right?

763
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:54,460
Murano Satomi and the rest of the school are her hostage.

764
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,660
Damn her...

765
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,500
It seems his physical strength has been greatly increased.

766
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:07,640
Migi's presence must have had
an effect on his body.

767
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:12,280
Basically, he was not supposed to be like this.

768
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,620
But as I thought...
he is changing...

769
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,960
He really is interesting, huh.

770
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,980
I now understand why you want to study him.

771
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,800
To obtain such an information...

772
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,760
they both play a very important piece.

773
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,180
I'm going out again to find A.

774
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,460
I already told you that when your heart was destroyed,

775
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:49,040
I used my cells to repair it.

776
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,680
Those parts of me are still alive, it seems.

777
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,400
And they're flowing through your blood.

778
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,080
So can't you take it out?

779
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,320
As my cells are tiny particles,
they're now fused inside your body.

780
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,140
I cannot recall them anymore.

781
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,480
So what you're saying is...?

782
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,480
That my body is starting to become more like you?

783
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,440
I don't want to look like you.

784
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,620
Where are we going anyway?

785
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,160
Today we'll do a little sightseeing.

786
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:17,640
You're gonna look for A again, right?
It seems not only your body is changing, but so is your personality.

787
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,180
I want you to stop.

788
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,460
You know I can't.

789
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,860
If you do see her,
there's nothing you can do.

790
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,880
The dead won't come back,
so think about your own life.

791
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:28,880
Moreover...

792
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,920
don't be concerned about my problem.

793
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,080
Your problem?

794
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:39,640
After saving you,
I now have to sleep for 4 hours each day.

795
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,980
I also sleep for 8 hours.

796
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,940
Unlike you, I can't be woken up when asleep.

797
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,080
It's as if I'm dead during that time.

798
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,880
I also don't know when it'll happen.

799
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,580
That means...
if an enemy appears and you fall asleep...

800
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,520
Good luck on your running away.

801
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,600
What!?

802
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,400
Here it comes!

803
01:08:59,400 --> 01:08:59,940
Eh?

804
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:00,740
I'm sleepy.

805
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,300
Hey!

806
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,420
Sorry, but I'm going to bed.

807
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,480
Hey, wait a minute! Hey! Hey!

808
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,020
How to identify parasites?

809
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,080
"Once you pull out their hair,
the hair will react by curling."

810
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,360
...that's what it says here.

811
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:23,920
Oww!

812
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,480
So you're not one of them, huh?

813
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:53,560
What is the meaning of this?

814
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,760
I told you not to arouse more suspicion.

815
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,560
Looks like they found a way to detect us,
just by pulling out our hair.

816
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,560
That is a problem.

817
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,840
Isn't it because you're often playing
with things that interest you?

818
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,420
You better stop it--

819
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:12,420
I'm grateful for your concern.

820
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,960
But it's not because of them.

821
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,340
In fact,

822
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,860
those are my precious samples.

823
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,800
If you're going to continue with your experiments,

824
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,640
just be careful with them.

825
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,860
I...

826
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,600
I'm also thinking about the future of our kind.

827
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,260
When I get elected,

828
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:38,580
I will make you all my subordinates,
and reorganize the system.

829
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,140
Don't you worry.

830
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,220
Tamiya.

831
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,320
How's your baby?

832
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,060
It can already move.

833
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,680
It's body is developing
just like an ordinary human.

834
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,200
Hey, how about I cook you dinner tonight?

835
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,900
I don't mind. Do it then.

836
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,480
It can't be helped then.
I'll make something healthy!

837
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,900
She has a point. Balanced food is
good for your health. Obviously for me, too.

838
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,040
Sorry about the food I ate lately.

839
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,800
And this is also an opportunity to approach her.

840
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,760
You're always talking about it.

841
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,540
Who are you whispering to?

842
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,540
No, it's nothing.

843
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:49,700
Shinichi, you've been a little scary lately.

844
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:50,740
Eh?

845
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,140
I can understand it a bit
because of what happened.

846
01:11:54,320 --> 01:12:00,120
I think you really have changed,
not like before when you were a bit shy and wishy-washy.

847
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,040
Because that's what makes you so cute.

848
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,820
What the heck is that...

849
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,360
But now I'm relieved.

850
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,240
Relieved to know that you're still you.

851
01:12:12,455 --> 01:12:13,488
So any comments?

852
01:12:13,489 --> 01:12:15,347
No, no...

853
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:16,953
Just it seems a bit much...

854
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,120
What is it?

855
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,880
I thought I heard something.

856
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,240
Poor dog...

857
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,380
Watch out!

858
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,280
It's too late.

859
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,500
He's dead.

860
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,440
What are you doing!?

861
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:21,000
What do you think you're doing?

862
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,460
I'm just throwing away garbage.

863
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,250
That's not garbage!

864
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,120
Don't you pity it?

865
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,740
But it's already dead.

866
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,960
Since it's dead,
it's not a dog anymore.

867
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,960
Now it's just flesh and bones.

868
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,000
You...

869
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,680
you're Shinichi, right?

870
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,970
What's wrong?

871
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,330
Sorry.

872
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,130
Looks like I got the wrong person.

873
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,720
Hey, Migi...

874
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,810
Did I say something wrong?

875
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,810
You said that body is
just made up of flesh and bones.

876
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,450
That's something I would be saying.

877
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,260
I see...

878
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,540
She really hates me now, huh...

879
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,010
Umm, Ms. Tamiya...

880
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:50,940
Yes? What can I do for you?

881
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,450
I was just wondering...

882
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,360
You're pregnant, right?

883
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,480
Is there a problem with it?

884
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,560
Well...
we can't talk here in public, so...

885
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,740
Can you come to the principal's office?

886
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,810
Ah. So you're home.

887
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:50,780
Sorry for barging in.

888
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,440
Welcome home.

889
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,040
It surprised us
when you suddenly quit teaching.

890
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,400
So it's true...

891
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,780
We got the news from school.

892
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,000
Father.

893
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,440
Hmm?

894
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,640
It's not her.

895
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:28,080
She's not Ryouko.

896
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,880
She's not Ryouko!

897
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,880
What are you saying?

898
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,340
Father, call the police.
Call the police immediately!

899
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,340
Hey, are you okay?

900
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,460
Father!

901
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:27,240
It's me.
There're two bodies for you to eat.

902
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,260
Leaving school already?

903
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:24,980
I knew this would happen sooner or later.

904
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,560
What about Shimada Hideo?

905
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,060
He will continue to watch over you.

906
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,720
And besides,
he's going to be fine in this environment.

907
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:36,460
What do you mean?

908
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:44,080
Like me, he rarely eats human meat.

909
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,220
Even Shimada?

910
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,140
Right now, there seems to be a problem.

911
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,960
If we learn not to eat humans,

912
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,260
the problem will be solved, right?

913
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,160
It is possible.

914
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,500
So even Shimada, too...

915
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:09,080
Like you said, if you can adapt to this world,
then there won't be a problem anymore.

916
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,460
Wait a minute.

917
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,280
Didn't he also take over the body of someone else?

918
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:18,380
And even so,
I still can't believe anything you'll say.

919
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:27,740
Yo.

920
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,220
I asked him to be our model.

921
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,900
Satomi, want to join us?

922
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,410
Ah, no, I'm fine.

923
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,530
Hey.

924
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:43,050
Hmm?

925
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,720
Is your relationship with Shinichi doing okay?

926
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:45,740
Huh?

927
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:48,020
I-I don't know what you're trying to say.

928
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,680
So, on to the next pose.

929
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,880
In that case...

930
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,600
Put your hand over here.

931
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,160
Now then,

932
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,120
face over here...

933
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,920
Perfect.

934
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:10,920
Honestly, your style is something...

935
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,100
Like you're not human.

936
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,900
Just kidding.

937
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,920
Why did you have to do that?

938
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:38,220
I was even kind to you.

939
01:20:45,701 --> 01:20:52,236
1, 2, 3...

940
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:58,843
4, 5, 6...

941
01:20:59,845 --> 01:21:01,440
7...

942
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,620
8 people.

943
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,940
Did you hear that?

944
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,820
I can sense Shimada Hideo's killing intent!

945
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,960
Even here in school!?

946
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,340
Where is Shimada!?

947
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,160
We shouldn't approach him!

948
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,680
As if I would listen to that!

949
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,480
I promise you.

950
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,140
I will make it painless.

951
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,260
So please remain silent.

952
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,180
Everybody, run!

953
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,580
C'mon! Make it quick!

954
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,520
Where did that scream came from!?

955
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,240
It definitely came from the Art Room.

956
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:21,480
I can also sense Shimada's killing intent.
Don't go near him. Don't go near him!

957
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,720
Shinichi!

958
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,140
Move! Out of the way!

959
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:00,700
Calm down, Shinichi!

960
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:05,860
I-I can't-- I can't--

961
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,600
You've got to calm down!

962
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,880
M-My...

963
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:11,320
my classmates...

964
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,600
It's alright, Shinichi.

965
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,570
Your heart won't get destroyed again.

966
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,850
Everything's alright.

967
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,620
You will be... alright.

968
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,320
He's lost control of himself.

969
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:38,740
Let's take him down.

970
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,220
One more incoming...!

971
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,620
Tamiya...

972
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,900
Shimada Hideo.

973
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,690
You look horrible.

974
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:02,410
I-I-I can't return to my original form anymore.

975
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,730
Help me...

976
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:09,000
I hate comrades who drag me down.

977
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,810
Shinichi, run!

978
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:19,940
We're going!

979
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,290
Everything's alright, Satomi!

980
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:00,930
Did he go west?

981
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,770
We've just past the stairs.

982
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:06,690
Surveillance is continuing.

983
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,610
Be careful. Roger.

984
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,010
Hey...

985
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,530
Hey!

986
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:16,570
You!

987
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,460
Shinichi, this may surprise you.

988
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:58,260
But I can still sense Shimada's killing intent!

989
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,840
He's heading to the roof.

990
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:15,130
It looks impossible... for an ordinary human.

991
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,570
See yah...

992
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,850
Shimada.

993
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,760
Shinichi, someone's here.

994
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,000
I'll disappear for a while.

995
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,650
Why come just to say that?

996
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,760
I've killed 13 people.

997
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,450
I should've killed you and Shimada from the start.

998
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:48,240
If you kill me,
you'll also kill the child inside me.

999
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:53,290
Can you kill a human child?

1000
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,140
Tamiya Ryouko.

1001
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:57,460
What are you going to do

1002
01:31:57,820 --> 01:31:59,080
with that human child?

1003
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,820
I'll also

1004
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:04,980
be using him for my experiments.

1005
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:07,450
Don't you dare...!

1006
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:08,770
Izumi Shinichi.

1007
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,180
Mothers are

1008
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,020
quite a strange breed of human beings?

1009
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:19,850
To become a mother...

1010
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:22,650
I have to see it through for myself.

1011
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:26,670
Where does their strength come from?

1012
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:32,030
I want to know.

1013
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,300
This...

1014
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:41,200
is where you'll find A.

1015
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:43,710
Is it here?

1016
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:45,250
Yeah.

1017
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,300
Don't be reckless.

1018
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:09,970
I know!

1019
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,280
Don't slice up her body.

1020
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,410
It's still my mom's body, after all.

1021
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,410
We'll aim for the head.

1022
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,000
Got it, Migi?

1023
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,200
Shinichi.

1024
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,010
Something serious is about to happen.

1025
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,380
We have to retreat.

1026
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,200
Huh? What are you saying?

1027
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:43,730
I feel sleepy.

1028
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:44,990
What!?

1029
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,180
I can't bear this sleepy feeling.

1030
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:48,840
Why now of all times!?

1031
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:51,150
I don't have a say in this.

1032
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:52,730
Let's retreat.

1033
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,490
C'mon! It's right in front of us!

1034
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,760
Then good luck.

1035
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,130
Hey, Migi!

1036
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,690
The only thing I could do, at least...

1037
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,100
is this...

1038
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:08,730
You can't be serious...!

1039
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:18,720
How did you survive?

1040
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:26,050
Doesn't matter...

1041
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:41,930
Humans can't move that fast.
What happened?

1042
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:45,150
Mom, I'm coming for you now.

1043
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,460
Please stop, Shinichi.

1044
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,210
Why are you doing this?
It's me, your mom...

1045
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:38,560
Mom...

1046
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:06,480
Looks like you've succeeded.

1047
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:09,540
In the end...

1048
01:37:12,490 --> 01:37:13,680
mom saved me again.

1049
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:17,280
I see.

1050
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,170
Even so, Migi...

1051
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:23,620
It seems I...

1052
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,430
may really be just like you.

1053
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:33,630
When mom was taken away...

1054
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:36,590
even now...

1055
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:40,080
I can't...

1056
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:42,490
even cry.

1057
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:55,000
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

1058
01:37:55,001 --> 01:38:00,059
(Hirokawa Takeshi, elected)

1059
01:38:04,872 --> 01:38:07,307
<i>Even though the road to victory
may have seem long</i>

1060
01:38:07,308 --> 01:38:10,844
<i>We thank everyone
for working hard to support us.</i>

1061
01:38:10,845 --> 01:38:12,942
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

1062
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,120
Why have we been called to HQ?

1063
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,500
I have no idea...

1064
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,640
Chief!

1065
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:57,500
May we be of some assistance?

1066
01:38:57,530 --> 01:38:58,360
I'm Detective Hirama...

1067
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:00,280
And I'm Detective Tsuji .

1068
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,280
Please provide all the information
that has been gathered.

1069
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,820
Sign here.

1070
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:10,050
This is a letter of confidentiality.

1071
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:15,420
The title for this operation is,
"Human Life Protection".

1072
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,200
You are...?

1073
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:21,970
I apologize. I'm one of the special forces.
I'm Yamagishi.

1074
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,620
Special forces?

1075
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,600
The SAT, sir?

1076
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:14,770
If the number of humans could be reduced by half...

1077
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:20,250
If the number of forests is burnt by half...

1078
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:25,760
If the number of human beings is reduced to a hundred...

1079
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:31,660
Could existing waste...
become one in a hundred as well?

1080
01:40:32,970 --> 01:40:34,380
Watching it again, I see.

1081
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,450
You really love that, don't you?

1082
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:41,260
Someone in the world definitely thinks so...

1083
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:46,160
if you want to save the lives of others.

1084
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:50,770
That may be true.

1085
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:54,330
Isn't that right... Gotou?

1086
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:59,680
We didn't know how to talk before,
but now we do.

1087
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:02,920
We didn't know how to move before,

1088
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,060
but now we do.

1089
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,180
All living things

1090
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,680
follow some kind of command.

1091
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:16,720
Command?

1092
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:22,380
When I took this brain,

1093
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,880
I got a command.

1094
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,280
What is it?

1095
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:44,650
To kill...

1096
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:47,690
mankind.

1097
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:22,860
Migi.

1098
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:24,860
What?

1099
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,400
I know now.

1100
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,650
The one thing I should be doing.

1101
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:35,480
The thing that you should do?

1102
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:50,570
I don't care who or what they are.

1103
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:57,650
I just need to find all these parasites,
then kill them one by one.

1104
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,820
That's what I should do.

1105
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,850
If we are born to destroy mankind,

1106
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:11,370
then you are their only hope.

1107
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:18,650
I'm going to kill their leader's child!

1108
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,710
I'm really grateful for failing to take your brain.

1109
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:27,540
Deceitful humans, look at this world.
Aren't you all the ones destroying everything!?

1110
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:30,480
Everyone in this world forgets...

1111
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,880
If the lives of people are protected...

1112
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:35,250
Shinichi is human.

1113
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,500
I have to find them!

1114
01:49:38,170 --> 01:49:39,350
So, run!

1115
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:48,720
Migi!

1116
01:49:49,305 --> 01:50:49,264
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
