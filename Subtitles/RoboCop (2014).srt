2
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,889
And we're on
in four, three,

3
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,891
two, one.

4
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,814
What if I told you that even the
worst neighborhood in America

5
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,983
could be made completely safe.

6
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,069
And what if I told you that
this could be accomplished

7
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,362
without risking the life

8
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:12,323
of one single
law enforcement officer.

9
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,908
How do I know this?

10
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,202
Because it's happening right now

11
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,580
in every country in the world

12
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,457
but this one.

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,502
<i>I'm Pat Novak, and welcome
to The Novak Element.</i>

14
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:30,759
In tonight's
State of the Union segment

15
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,886
we'll be joined
by General Curtis Monroe

16
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,180
live from the War Room
in the Pentagon.

17
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,683
General Monroe, welcome back.

18
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:39,934
<i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>

19
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:44,355
Thank you for this unprecedented
access to your operations.

20
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:48,151
Could you walk us through
what we're seeing here?

21
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:50,528
<i>Well, this is
a routine operation.</i>

22
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,781
<i>We found that random patrols</i>

23
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:56,242
<i>helped the local population to
feel safer and to trust us.</i>

24
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,327
It's amazing.

25
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,746
And what are these colored dots

26
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,331
that we're seeing here, General?

27
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:04,417
<i>These are our assets
on the ground.</i>

28
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,086
<i>In green,
we got the ED-209s.</i>

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,881
<i>They're the big boys.
They secure the perimeter.</i>

30
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,217
<i>Purple are
the smaller EM-208s.</i>

31
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,843
<i>They sweep and mop up.</i>

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,888
<i>And the red dots, Pat,
that's your film crew.</i>

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,100
It is great to see
American machines

34
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,479
helping to promote
peace and freedom abroad.

35
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,314
<i>All right, you guys, this is
a standard op, all right?</i>

36
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,774
<i>There's no opposition expected.</i>

37
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,026
<i>I'm gonna set your markers
to code red.</i>

38
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,907
All our drones are gonna give
top priority to your safety.

39
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,117
No red assets
have ever been lost.

40
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,327
Okay.
Okay?

41
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,745
Does that make you feel better?

42
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,747
But, listen,

43
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,582
<i>keep those bracelets on,
you're completely safe.</i>

44
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,750
<i>Okay?</i>

45
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,085
<i>Good. Enjoy the show.</i>

46
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,343
All right. Let's go.

47
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,433
<i>May peace
be upon you.</i>

48
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:06,271
<i>Please exit your homes
with your arms raised</i>

49
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,857
<i>for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.</i>

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,942
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

51
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,538
<i>Please exit your homes
with your arms raised</i>

52
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,291
<i>for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.</i>

53
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,543
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

54
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,755
Scott, get me a shot of this.

55
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,508
<i>Your cooperation
is appreciated.</i>

56
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:38,511
<i>We apologize
for any inconvenience.</i>

57
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,307
<i>May peace be upon you.</i>

58
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,482
Incredible.

59
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,902
Incredible!

60
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:58,323
Not long ago, that would have
been American men and women

61
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,576
risking their lives
to pacify these people.

62
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,871
General, you care
to comment on this?

63
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,415
<i>Well, Pat, we had Vietnam,</i>

64
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,293
<i>we had Iraq, we had Afghanistan.</i>

65
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:12,045
<i>Never again.</i>

66
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,590
<i>From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.</i>

67
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,467
<i>We can accomplish our objectives</i>

68
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,594
<i>without any loss
to American lives</i>

69
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:23,014
<i>and I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.</i>

70
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,933
And why wouldn't they?

71
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:27,352
For the first time
in their lives

72
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,771
they get to watch
their children grow up

73
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:33,733
in an environment
of safety and security.

74
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:35,777
Navid!

75
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:37,195
Get away from the window!

76
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,364
Mom! They're here! They're coming!

77
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,200
Come here! Come here right now!

78
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:43,784
Arash!

79
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,412
Navid! You stay with your mom and sisters!

80
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,288
But he's just a kid.

81
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:47,705
Seven!

82
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,727
Stay here with your mom and the kids!

83
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,093
What do you think you're doing?
You heard me!

84
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,545
Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!

85
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,872
Navid! My dear! Come back here!

86
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,468
Navid!

87
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,719
Shut the door!

88
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:05,556
We're not here to kill any of them.

89
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,474
Got it?

90
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,269
The goal is to die on television.

91
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:11,812
Let's go!

92
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,564
<i>Kelly!</i>

93
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,316
<i>Can you hear me out there?</i>

94
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,319
<i>Loud and clear, Pat.
I'm here in sunny Tehran</i>

95
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:22,657
where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

96
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,701
As you can see behind me,
they're working

97
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,577
in collaboration with the robots

98
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:31,165
and obviously their safety
is everyone's top priority.

99
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,601
Don't make a move before I say...

100
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,812
I wanna make sure they're recording.

101
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:53,771
Yes!

102
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,147
Yes! Yes!

103
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,273
We're ready.

104
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:02,530
<i>You'll notice children</i>

105
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,657
<i>in the streets as well.
This is everyday life</i>

106
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,826
<i>happening in perfect harmony.</i>

107
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,374
<i>Oh, great.
Here, come here.</i>

108
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,618
<i>Stay put, stay put, stay put.</i>

109
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,312
It's fine. Don't worry.
My guy's got it.

110
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,639
Navid! It's dangerous here!

111
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,642
Come away! Come...

112
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,895
Navid, where are you going?

113
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,855
Look at me! Navid! Navid!

114
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,316
What are you looking for? Navid!

115
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,902
Navid! Navid! What are you...

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,361
Navid! Don't go! Navid!

117
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,129
Oh, my God!

118
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,346
<i>Drop your weapon.</i>

119
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:14,685
<i>Kelly?</i>

120
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,771
Kelly!
Are you all right? Kelly!

121
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:18,022
<i>We're okay, Pat.</i>

122
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:20,525
<i>Our robots have just repelled
some suicide bombers.</i>

123
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,318
I'm sorry, Kelly,

124
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:26,197
but for security reasons the Pentagon's
going to cut our feed to Tehran.

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,573
But, please, be careful.

126
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,450
<i>Yeah. I'll continue
to stand by.</i>

127
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:36,457
Now you see how fundamental these
robots are to our foreign policy.

128
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,334
So then tell me.

129
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:42,839
Why can't we use these
machines here at home?

130
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:47,969
Why is America so robophobic?

131
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,889
On the one hand,
we have Raymond Sellars.

132
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,977
An entrepreneur
and true American

133
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,230
whose product just saved
my colleague's life.

134
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,607
And on the other.

135
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:04,110
Hubert Dreyfus.

136
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:08,239
A man with both feet
planted firmly in the past

137
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:12,702
whose bill prohibits the
use of drones on US soil.

138
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:15,913
The American people
support the Dreyfus Act

139
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,542
because they haven't
experienced this technology

140
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,753
and they fear
what they don't understand.

141
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,757
<i>We at The Novak Element
support Mr. Sellars' efforts</i>

142
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:30,178
to make our country
and our viewers safer.

143
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,263
After all,

144
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:36,392
what's more important than the
safety of the American people?

145
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,254
Hey, Murphy.
Hey.

146
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,883
How's Jack?

147
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,760
We don't know yet.

148
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,970
MurphY-
Hey.

149
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,972
How's it going?
Good.

150
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,049
What the hell
are they doing here?

151
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:25,024
Six in the morgue.
Lewis in the hospital.

152
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,026
This was the mother
of all bad ideas.

153
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,070
We got a lead on Antoine
Vallon, we took it.

154
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,154
What lead?

155
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,406
Not in front of them.

156
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,825
This is bullshit. Yeah?

157
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,577
Yeah, you got something
to say, Murphy?

158
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:37,745
Vallon's our case.

159
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:41,666
Yeah, two years without no arrest, no
nothing? You've gotta be dumb or dirty.

160
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,086
You got something on us?
Or is this personal?

161
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,171
No, it's nothing personal.

162
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,423
Although, I don't
like you as a person.

163
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,509
Okay, you two, out.

164
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,094
No problem.

165
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:55,989
Maybe if you hadn't
gone off the reservation,

166
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,556
your partner would
still be standing.

167
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,562
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

168
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,854
Okay, Alex.

169
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,442
It's just you and me now.

170
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,529
So me and Jack, we've been
doin' some street buys.

171
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,197
We get a line on some guns.

172
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,867
<i>We meet up with this
low-level G called Jerry</i>

173
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,495
<i>who ends up havin' a piece
he's not supposed to have.</i>

174
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,463
Where the hell you get a
gun like that, Jerry?

175
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,457
I can get you two
whole crates full, man.

176
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,625
Two crates?

177
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,793
No disrespect, J,

178
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,836
but how a clown like you
get so much product, man?

179
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,046
What's it matter
where it comes from?

180
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,799
Why it matters, we don't
want no dirty guns, Jerry.

181
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,718
These guns got bodies
on 'em, Jerry?

182
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,052
Yo, look,
they're clean, all right?

183
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,595
You gonna buy this shit or not?

184
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,139
Why you acting so nervous, man?

185
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,057
You fishin' on us, Jerry?

186
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,225
What'd you say?

187
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,390
You think he fishin', D?
I think he's fishin' on us.

188
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,812
Yo, what the hell
are they talkin' about, man?

189
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,230
Hey, let me see your phone.

190
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:47,732
Let me see your phone.

191
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,025
I'm not showing you
my phone, man!

192
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,359
You recordin' this?

193
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,111
I think you're a goddamn cop!

194
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,195
What the hell are
you talkin' about, man?

195
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,572
I'm not showing you my phone!

196
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,740
Hey! Put your gun down!

197
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,033
Putyourphones on the table.

198
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,236
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

199
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,244
What?

200
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,204
Shut up! Shut up!
What'd you say?

201
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,373
Ends up he works for Vallon.

202
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,335
Before the meet, we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

203
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,670
The guns were supposed to be
in our evidence room.

204
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,423
<i>Not out on the street.</i>

205
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,675
<i>Intake papers blank.
No signatures.</i>

206
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,094
What do you got?
Nothin'.

207
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,764
How do you think that happened?

208
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,684
I'm telling you, Murphy,
this is a mistake.

209
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,771
These guys'll shoot you just
to see if they gun work.

210
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,230
We need backup.

211
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,717
If we call for backup, word's
gonna get around the station.

212
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,109
He's gonna disappear.

213
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:33,944
It's gonna be all right.

214
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,031
<i>MURPHY". So we told Vallon
we were gun buyers,</i>

215
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,366
<i>and he bought it.</i>

216
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,453
What do you two need with that
much product? You plotting a coup?

217
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,932
Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna
bust a single shot in your town.

218
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,875
We got some problems
back home with Chicago PD.

219
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,003
Yeah, I heard
you don't like cops.

220
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,963
Hey, boss.

221
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,966
What do you got for me?

222
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,761
Really?

223
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:01,782
<i>We were just about to close
the deal but someone tipped him off.</i>

224
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,225
Gentlemen,
I gotta deal with this.

225
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:05,810
Two minutes.

226
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,318
Make sure you kill 'em both!

227
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,080
I got two handguns,
one automatic.

228
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,011
We gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna take the automatic.

229
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,471
You sure about this?

230
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:05,828
You ready?

231
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,121
Move.

232
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,829
Lewis!

233
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:50,873
Lewis!

234
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:57,421
Officer down!
Officer down, 331 Hamilton.

235
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,048
This is Detective Alex Murphy

236
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,050
in need of immediate
medical assistance.

237
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,219
331 Hamilton Road.

238
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,262
Jack.

239
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,225
Jack, come on.
Jack. Can you hear me?

240
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,727
Jack. Stay with me.

241
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,771
Jack.

242
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:17,608
<i>Alex, you don't
do something like this</i>

243
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,443
unless you bring it to me first.

244
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,945
Vallon's connected.

245
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,907
I'm warning you, don't make any
more moves until I vet this.

246
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,784
If officers are
supplying him with guns...

247
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,953
That's up to IAD.

248
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,913
I'll handle it.

249
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:41,257
I don't care how sophisticated
these machines are, Mr. Sellars.

250
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:45,970
A machine does not know what
it feels like to be human.

251
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,514
It can't understand
the value of human life.

252
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,099
Why should it be
allowed to take one?

253
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,687
To legislate
over life and death,

254
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,566
we need people who
understand right from wrong.

255
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,985
What do your machines feel?

256
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,613
Well, they feel no anger.
They feel no prejudice.

257
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,326
They feel no fatigue, which makes
them ideal for law enforcement.

258
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,497
Putting these machines
on the streets

259
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,667
will save countless
American lives.

260
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,794
You're evading the question.
No, I'm not.

261
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:19,878
Yes,
you're evading the question.

262
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:23,424
I asked what do
these machines feel?

263
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,427
If one of them killed a child,

264
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,971
what would it feel?

265
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,476
Nothing.
And that's the problem.

266
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:39,940
That's why 72% of Americans will not
stand for a robot pulling the trigger.

267
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,909
America is the world's most
valuable market, and we can't touch it.

268
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,498
With a domestic expansion, we'd
clear $600 billion per annum.

269
00:15:56,665 --> 00:16:01,545
In other words, every second that law is
in existence, we are hemorrhaging money.

270
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:02,752
What do you want me to do?

271
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,216
We've thrown cash at senators at both
sides of the aisle. Nobody's budging.

272
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,383
They don't want to vote
against their constituents.

273
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:11,513
So unless we sway public
opinion, the battle's lost.

274
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,641
Now, to that effect,

275
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:18,062
my team have come up with a
pretty aggressive new campaign.

276
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,731
Wow factor
off-the-charts.

277
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,734
We need to give Americans
a product they can love.

278
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,736
A figure they can rally behind.

279
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,906
Sir, I have dissected this bill.
There are no loopholes.

280
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,741
We can't put a machine
on the streets.

281
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,034
Forget machines.

282
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,577
You saw the polls.

283
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,246
Americans don't want a machine.

284
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,083
They want

285
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,919
a product with a conscience.

286
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,505
They want

287
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:47,466
something that knows

288
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,011
what it feels like

289
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:52,554
to be human.

290
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,438
We're gonna put a man
inside a machine.

291
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:09,071
You're not you because
of your legs, your arms, your hands.

292
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,823
You're you because
of your brain.

293
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:15,327
It's your brain's capacity to process
information that makes you who you are.

294
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:20,958
Relax, and just do
what you've always done.

295
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,588
I've never played with these.

296
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:31,093
The music doesn't come from your fingers,
Michael, it comes from your mind.

297
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,220
All you have to do
is let it out.

298
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,305
Please.

299
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,629
Oh, my God.

300
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,552
No, it's okay. Easy.

301
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,307
His emotions are peaking. The
readings are getting clouded.

302
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,641
It's okay.

303
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,644
Relax. If you get
too emotional,

304
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,605
it'll change the chemistry
in your brain.

305
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,523
It'll throw the system out.

306
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,112
You're doing great.
Come on.

307
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,712
I need emotion to play.

308
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,673
Concierto <i>de
</i> Aranjuez, second movement.

309
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,551
Beautiful piece.

310
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,429
<i>Bennett, when you
have a moment. Thank you.</i>

311
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,682
Now, we agreed on this
a long time ago, Raymond.

312
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:04,478
I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat applications.

313
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:07,815
My work here is driven
by its own questions.

314
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:11,443
And your work is brilliant. But
your ideas are being underutilized.

315
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,279
Look, I think I found a way

316
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:18,116
to put real revenue stream
behind your research

317
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,870
and save thousands
of lives in the process.

318
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,152
You're not
keeping up your end,

319
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,511
leaving me exposed like that.

320
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,471
Detective Murphy's
just a little impulsive.

321
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:40,722
So put him on the payroll.

322
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:41,966
Why are we talkin' about this?

323
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,517
It won't work. And now that
his partner got hit,

324
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,519
he's never gonna let it go.

325
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,563
What is that?
Lewis' hospital.

326
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,090
Alex is dropping by
this afternoon,

327
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,191
in case you want
to send flowers.

328
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,613
Yeah.

329
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,156
I kill a cop,

330
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,908
lookin' over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

331
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:01,326
That's not good for business.

332
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,413
Who do you think's
gonna be investigating you?

333
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,921
I'm gonna go hard
after Lake and Daniels.

334
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,634
I'm gonna have 'em in bracelets
within a month, man.

335
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,270
Hey, Vallon,
I'm walking up right now.

336
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,682
Cameras off?

337
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,059
Clear.

338
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,939
<i>You were right.
We should've had backup.</i>

339
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,482
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

340
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,821
You're not really sleeping,
are ya?

341
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:41,575
Asshole.

342
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:48,749
Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.
Paralyzed from the waist down.

343
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,211
He has let himself go a
little since the accident.

344
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,504
Pass.

345
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,131
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

346
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,134
Officer Alfred Miller, Denver.

347
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:02,846
"Severe Cerebellar..."

348
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,514
Cerebellar ataxia.

349
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,266
That's why you're
the doctor, Doctor.

350
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,520
He scored through the roof
with our urban demos.

351
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,364
Let's keep this one
in mind. I like this guy.

352
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,150
Very good, sir.
I saved the best for last.

353
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:20,781
I give you Sergeant Jack
Freeman, masculinity incarnate.

354
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,241
Led Pittsburgh SWAT
for five years,

355
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,410
now confined to a wheelchair.

356
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,957
I think I can see the appeal.

357
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,041
NO.

358
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,001
What? Why?

359
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,088
Well, check the psych evaluation.
He's far too unstable.

360
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,048
He's trying to say
that he has a temper.

361
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,820
Have you any idea
what we'd be putting him through?

362
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:44,137
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.

363
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,348
We have to be scientific.

364
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:49,226
I mean, we're not selling
a soft drink here, are we?

365
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,104
He's right. Okay.
Keep looking.

366
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,942
David, what did I say?
Not until you're finished.

367
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,111
Hey, guys.
Hi, Dad.

368
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,072
Hey.
Hey, little monkey.

369
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,536
How's the game, buddy?

370
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:10,580
Damon got ejected, but we
got a two-man advantage.

371
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,583
Oh, yeah?
That's fantastic.

372
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,210
Hey, D, why don't
you head upstairs

373
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,962
and start getting ready for bed.

374
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,797
But he just got home.

375
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,882
I'll be up in a second.

376
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,427
Tuck you in, okay?
All right?

377
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,182
Now give your mom a kiss.
Good night, baby.

378
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,559
Too slow, boy.

379
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,146
You're just too slow.

380
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,238
How's Jack holding up?

381
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,866
They said a week
till he's back on his feet.

382
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:47,742
It's my fault.

383
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,161
We shouldn't even
have been there.

384
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,831
Here.

385
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,939
Oh, shit, I thought
I fixed that.

386
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,398
It'll stop.

387
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,448
It's gonna wake up David.

388
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,705
<i>He suffered 4th degree
burns over 80% of his body.</i>

389
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,708
<i>Lower spine has been severed.</i>

390
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,586
<i>If he survives,</i>

391
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:07,257
he'll be paralyzed from the waist
down and confined to a wheelchair.

392
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,720
Mrs. Murphy,

393
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,807
we don't have to do this.

394
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:20,187
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

395
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,941
Please continue.

396
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,069
Vestibulocochlear,

397
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:31,239
optical nerves have
been critically damaged.

398
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,409
He'll be blind in one eye.

399
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,494
Most likely deaf.

400
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,706
Frankly, Dr. Norton
and the Omni Foundation

401
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,291
are the leaders in this field.

402
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:45,045
In my opinion, this is the
only chance your husband has.

403
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,589
I'd seriously
consider their offer.

404
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,676
I'm sorry, Doctor.

405
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,679
I need time to think.

406
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:58,767
I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy, time
is one thing you don't have.

407
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,649
You say you can save him,
but what does that mean?

408
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,862
What kind of life will he have?

409
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,749
<i>Fly</i> me to the <i>moon</i>

410
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:27,128
<i>Let me play among the stars</i>

411
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,215
Thanks.
Thanks, buddy.

412
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,175
You know she's gonna
make me dance again.

413
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,010
Now that I've gotta see.

414
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,258
You don't want to see that.

415
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,930
Here she comes now.

416
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,223
Hold on to that.

417
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:39,557
Get out there, partner.

418
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,852
Every time.

419
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,774
Get her, boy.

420
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,323
<i>Fill my heart with song</i>

421
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:59,744
<i>And let me sing forever more</i>

422
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,999
<i>You are all I long for</i>

423
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,167
<i>All I worship...</i>

424
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,211
Subject is
still dreaming.

425
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,131
He's retrieving memories,

426
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,634
trying to make sense of sensorial
stimulation package 37.

427
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,178
Perfect, Kim.

428
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,682
Let's reconnect the spine.

429
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,184
Time to wake him up.

430
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,816
<i>Fill my heart with song</i>

431
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,486
<i>Let me sing forever more</i>

432
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,991
<i>You are all I long for</i>

433
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:42,412
<i>All I worship and adore</i>

434
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,081
<i>In other words</i>

435
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:49,586
<i>Please be true</i>

436
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,212
Excuse me?

437
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,423
What are you doing here?

438
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,175
Baby, where you going?

439
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,553
<i>In other words</i>

440
00:27:58,636 --> 00:27:59,763
Lewis.

441
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:03,725
<i>I love</i>

442
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,730
<i>You</i>

443
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,651
Subject regaining
cognitive functions.

444
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,821
What's happening?

445
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,241
Where am I?

446
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:24,913
You were in an explosion, Alex.
You're in a hospital.

447
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,834
Where's Clara? My wife.
Where's my wife?

448
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:32,337
I want you to calm down,
Alex. Listen to me.

449
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:36,091
You're okay. And your family's fine.
Both your wife and your son.

450
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,385
Who the hell are you?

451
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,554
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.
I'm treating you.

452
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,306
Heart rate rising.

453
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,435
I can't move.

454
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:52,607
I can't move.
What the hell is all that?

455
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:53,900
Visual input unstable.

456
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,485
I want you to relax, Alex.

457
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,945
Subject's dumping
too much epinephrine.

458
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,405
Should we purge it?
Not yet.

459
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,032
Unlock vertebrae.

460
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,372
Go ahead, Kim.

461
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,959
Unlock upper, lower extremities.

462
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,723
What kind of suit is this?

463
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,394
It's not a suit, Alex.

464
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,772
It's you.

465
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,359
This was the only option.

466
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:40,029
We're here, all of us,
to make you whole again.

467
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:41,990
Full body unlock.

468
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,451
I want you to walk now, Alex.

469
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:46,119
You can do that.

470
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,644
This seems so real.

471
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:16,441
Alex,
it's very important

472
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,109
you understand
what is happening.

473
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:19,569
This is real.

474
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,822
It's not a dream, it's not
drugs or anesthetics.

475
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,825
I know I'm dreaming 'cause
I can feel all of this.

476
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,953
Alex, amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.

477
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,389
It's called
phantom limb sensation.

478
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,664
What do you mean "amputees"?

479
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,083
What the hell did you do to me?
You need to relax.

480
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,460
Take this off me now.

481
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:38,087
I need to get out of this thing.
What did you do to me?

482
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:40,215
What have you done to me?

483
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,717
Alex? Hey!

484
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,094
Shut him down.

485
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,805
No! Let him run!
Let him run!

486
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:09,661
Where am I?

487
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,728
<i>Alex, please.</i>

488
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,565
<i>Stop-</i>

489
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:41,317
<i>Alex, you have to stop.</i>

490
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:43,987
<i>Please.</i>

491
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,239
<i>Alex.</i>

492
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,242
Please stop.

493
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,244
Stay where you are

494
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:54,163
and we'll come and pick you up.

495
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,157
Okay, Kim.

496
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,784
Shut him down.

497
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,228
Alex,

498
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,773
you can't run from this.

499
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:07,945
You have to understand
the reality of the situation.

500
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,784
Show me.

501
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,162
Kim.

502
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,388
Oh!

503
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:36,849
No.

504
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,605
Holy Christ.

505
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,982
Holy Christ.

506
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,445
Holy Christ,
there's nothing left.

507
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,247
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

508
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,422
That's not even my brain.

509
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,717
We had to repair
the damaged areas.

510
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:14,011
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion or your intellect.

511
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,639
Do you understand me, Alex?

512
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:20,101
You're in control.

513
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:23,354
I'm in control?
Yes.

514
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,400
Okay.

515
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,905
If I'm in control,

516
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,033
then I wanna die.

517
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:42,790
Just unplug whatever it is keepin'
me alive and end this nightmare.

518
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,168
Now, say I did that.

519
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,879
Which as a doctor would
almost be impossible for me,

520
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:49,964
but say I did.

521
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,093
What do I say to your wife?

522
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:56,304
What does she say to your son?

523
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:59,140
That it didn't work.
That you tried.

524
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,851
Somethin' went wrong.

525
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:05,730
You did everything you could,

526
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,026
but I died.

527
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,028
So after all
they've been through,

528
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:15,448
all the pain,
all their hope restored,

529
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,742
we would just rip that away?

530
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,329
Your wife loves you, Alex.

531
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,581
She signed
the consent forms herself.

532
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:27,001
Otherwise, you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

533
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:41,808
She loves you and she
gave you a second chance.

534
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,604
I need you to take it.

535
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,569
I don't wanna see myself
like this again.

536
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,197
Even

537
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:58,533
And the same goes for my family.

538
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,000
Just put me back in.

539
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:13,631
Zoom in.

540
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,218
Stop.

541
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,305
Zoom in.

542
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,017
Stop.

543
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,816
Accept the connection.

544
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,365
<i>It's so good to finally see you.</i>

545
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,868
I was gonna say the same thing.

546
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,495
I'm sorry.

547
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,832
I know how I must look to you.

548
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:50,334
<i>I think you look beautiful.</i>

549
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,132
<i>Are they treating you okay,
baby?</i>

550
00:36:56,299 --> 00:37:00,720
So far. Dr. Norton,
he seems like a nice guy.

551
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,223
Does David know you're calling?

552
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,270
<i>He misses you.</i>

553
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,148
<i>I can go get him.
No.</i>

554
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,693
I don't want him
to see me like this.

555
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:18,946
Not yet.

556
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,323
<i>Sure.</i>

557
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,706
<i>We're gonna
get through this, baby.</i>

558
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,794
<i>We're gonna make it like it was.</i>

559
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:39,842
<i>When are you comin' home?</i>

560
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,345
Well, they've still
got some tests.

561
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,556
But they're sayin'
it's goin' really well.

562
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:48,976
The minute they let me.

563
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,939
I gotta go.

564
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,358
I love you.

565
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,151
End the connection.

566
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,378
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

567
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:20,758
Viral and bacterial
screening activated.

568
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,430
Releasing proteins, fats,

569
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:29,392
minerals and carbs.

570
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:36,607
Energy inflow
is at 1320 kilocalories.

571
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:42,363
Now starting anti-inflammatory
corticoids, hormones

572
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,449
and antibiotic protocols.

573
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,077
Standard daily intake.

574
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:52,623
Release antidepressants.

575
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,127
Let's give him a nice dream.

576
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,991
All right, here's
what you're dealin' with.

577
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,559
Modified M2 battle rifle.

578
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:14,103
.50 caliber Beowulf
ammunition at 30 round clips.

579
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:16,022
Three-shot bursts
or full auto.

580
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,399
Heavy-duty.

581
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,862
TSR 66. Cartridge-driven
taser pistol.

582
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:27,366
Each projectile releases up to 200,000
volts. It can stun, it can kill

583
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:28,909
and it's nasty shit.

584
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,327
Your armor,

585
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,746
state-of-the-art,
but not invulnerable.

586
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,457
.50 caliber or larger
can penetrate and kill.

587
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:38,335
Multiple hits, and guess who
ends up in the recycling bin?

588
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,551
If you sense you need a
weapon or are threatened

589
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,678
the visor goes down and the system
makes the weapons available.

590
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,723
But you gotta remember, it's
not the weapons that count.

591
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:51,849
It's who's handling them.

592
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,143
Or, in your case, what.

593
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,063
You think you can do this?
Oh, just stick to your job.

594
00:39:57,188 --> 00:40:00,024
Just stick to my job?
Combat robots are my job, Doc.

595
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:04,278
Rio, Congo, you name it, I was there.
Our machines run perfectly.

596
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,489
You ask me, stickin'
organics into the system

597
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,657
is a huge step backwards.

598
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,035
I don't care how well you
designed this thing.

599
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,496
Without my sign-off, it better
start learnin' Chinese,

600
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,039
'cause it ain't
never goin' home.

601
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,465
It's nice to meet you, too.

602
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,468
Let's do this,

603
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:29,095
Tin Man.

604
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:39,438
Quality control,
EM-208 versus Tin Man.

605
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,525
Rendering scenario one now.

606
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,985
Hey, Doc, hope you don't mind.

607
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:46,195
I like a little music
while I'm workin'.

608
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:50,241
<i>When a man's an empty kettle</i>

609
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:55,371
All right. All right, let's let the
games begin. Let's rock 'n' roll.

610
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,541
Commence scenario.

611
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,710
<i>Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human</i>

612
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:05,089
<i>If I only had a heart</i>

613
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:11,137
<i>I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental</i>

614
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,764
<i>Regarding love and art</i>

615
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,601
<i>I'd be friends with the sparrows</i>

616
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:19,770
<i>And the boy
who shoots the arrows</i>

617
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,815
<i>If I only had a heart</i>

618
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:28,404
<i>Picture me a balcony</i>

619
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,408
<i>Above a voice sings low...</i>

620
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,368
<i>Laggin' on the comers.</i>

621
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,953
No, there, d'you see that?

622
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,913
What my robot did,
that's how you do it.

623
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:41,458
New product's afraid.

624
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:45,671
2.3 seconds behind. Great.

625
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:48,608
<i>Don't shoot! He has a gun!</i>

626
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:49,675
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

627
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:53,137
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

628
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,598
<i>Drop the weapon.
Let the kid go!</i>

629
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,934
Oh, well, it's worried that
the kid's gonna get hurt.

630
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,603
<i>- Let the kid go!
- Too bad.</i>

631
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:06,108
Well, there you have it. 5.6
seconds behind. Scenario failure.

632
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,152
I wouldn't buy that
for a dollar.

633
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:16,035
Let's do it again.
Your funeral.

634
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,915
Detective Alex Murphy.

635
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,291
<i>Search results.</i>

636
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,418
<i>"Detective Murphy
making a speedy recovery."</i>

637
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,712
<i>"Alex Murphy.
Man or Machine?"</i>

638
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:30,257
<i>"Thrust into the spotlight,
Clara Murphy won't talk."</i>

639
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,885

640
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,053
<i>Search results.</i>

00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:38,265

suspect due to lack of evidence."</i>

642
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,687
<i>Detroit Free Press.</i>

643
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:46,941
<i>Unfortunately, Murphy's
investigation into Antoine Vallon</i>

644
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:48,464
<i>wasn't authorized
in the first place.</i>

645
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:52,238
<i>Look, Detective Murphy was
simply overzealous, okay?</i>

646
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:55,449
<i>We have absolutely no evidence linking
Vallon to the attempt on his life.</i>

647
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,826
<i>All I'm gonna say is
my partner's a great cop.</i>

648
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,413
<i>And I won't rest until the men who tried
to kill him are brought to justice.</i>

649
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:06,353
What's wrong with him?

650
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:07,657
No, nothing, nothing.

651
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:12,049
Watch the procedural bars
on the 208.

652
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:16,428
The machine assesses
the threat and acts.

653
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:18,430
That's it.

654
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:21,308
It's two steps.
Now watch Alex.

655
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:26,438
The software assesses the
threat, just like the robot.

656
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,482
And it sends the information
to the brain.

657
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:31,402
Alex's brain receives the information
and decides what to do with it

658
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:36,115
based on his emotional cognitive
abilities like any man would.

659
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:39,451
Then the brain relates this
to the Al module and...

660
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,329
Yeah, like, you know,
a year later.

661
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:43,622
And our computers
finish the job.

662
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:47,459
Raymond, you wanted
a man inside a machine.

663
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,128
And that's what you've got.

664
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:51,338
But the human element
will always be present.

665
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:54,008
Fear, instinct,
bias, compassion,

666
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:55,342
they will always interfere
with the system!

667
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:56,969
Okay, but, Dennett,

668
00:43:57,052 --> 00:44:00,472
I've gotta give the American people
something they can root for.

669
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,308
Something aspirational, right?

670
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,809
They have to
believe in this thing.

671
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:07,396
"Pretty good"? I don't
know how to sell "okay."

672
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,106
We, you and I,
have got a release date,

673
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,607
and we've gotta make it, okay?

674
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:13,277
So I don't care how you do it. I'm
askin' ya, come on, can you help me?

675
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,822
Just get him to do that.
Get him to do that.

676
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,324
That is a machine.

677
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:19,867
I know, but it's a man
inside a machine.

678
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,828
No, that's a man
inside a machine right there!

679
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,996
And his life depends on it.

680
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,456
And the future of Omnicorp
depends on it

681
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,375
so get your ass back to China
and get it fixed.

682
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:30,627
I don't care how you do it,
just go do it!

683
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:49,188
It tastes like peanut butter.

684
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,319
I can't get it out of my mouth.

685
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:57,788
And you
don't like peanut butter?

686
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,156
No.

687
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,492
You like peanut butter, Kim?

688
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,077
I love it.

689
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:06,205
Okay.

690
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,832
I'm gonna put you
to sleep now, Alex.

691
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,000
Okay.

692
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,253
Now, put him under, Kim.

693
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,344
What are you planning to do?

694
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:25,224
Consciousness is nothing more

695
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:28,102
than the processing
of information.

696
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:31,480
I'm gonna fix him.

697
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,983
And he won't
know the difference.

698
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:47,913
Raymond?
Yeah?

699
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:51,458
We just ran focus groups
at Ryan Correctional Facility.

700
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:55,421
We call this Combat Mode.

701
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,298
It really put the fear of God
into the prisoners.

702
00:45:58,465 --> 00:45:59,591
Yeah, that's okay.

703
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,510
And get a load of this.

704
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:06,098
What's that? He transforms.
Kids love it.

705
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:08,767
Really? Focus group
numbers through the roof.

706
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,269
Really?
Oh, yeah.

707
00:46:10,436 --> 00:46:12,396
Well, that's really
embarrassing.

708
00:46:12,563 --> 00:46:14,523
What is this?
You know what?

709
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,525
People really don't know
what they want

710
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,819
until you show it to 'em
most of the time.

711
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:21,905
Make him more, uh,

712
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:22,990
tactical.

713
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,616
Make him look, uh...

714
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,537
Let's go with black.

715
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,039
Yeah.

716
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,201
Alex.

717
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,453
He looks like a billion dollars.

718
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,580
2.6 billion.

719
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,749
Raymond Sellars.

720
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,959
I've looked forward to
meeting you, Detective.

721
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:18,128
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

722
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:20,422
Well, we funded this program

723
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:22,716
to give men like you
a second chance.

724
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,344
You just do your best today.

725
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:26,970
Shall we?
Let's.

726
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:32,559
Mr. Sellars, we're ready for you.
Okay, great.

727
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:34,186
Chief Technician Shuman.

728
00:47:34,353 --> 00:47:35,729
Mornin', folks.

729
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:41,068
<i>Okay, so
this is how it's gonna be.</i>

730
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:43,529
We're goin' toe-to-toe.
Last man standing wins.

731
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,240
<i>I hit you, you go back
to the drawing board.</i>

732
00:47:46,323 --> 00:47:48,825
<i>You hit me,
you get a ticket back home.</i>

733
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,663
My guys are gonna be
shootin' .47 caliber rounds.

734
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,998
Do a little damage,
but they can't take you out.

735
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:58,502
But make no mistake,
Tin Man, my gun will.

736
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,134
Alex, listen to me.

737
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:17,896
<i>The EM-208s will
try to maneuver you</i>

738
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,314
<i>so Mattox can get a clear shot.</i>

739
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,526
<i>Do not let that happen.</i>

740
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:25,988
<i>If Mattox hits you, everything but
your life support will shut down.</i>

741
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:29,199
<i>You'll feel more pain than
you've ever felt in your life.</i>

742
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:32,202
I don't know about that.
I've been through a lot.

743
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,459
All right.

744
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:42,170
I say we go on three.

745
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,338
Three.

746
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:06,903
How's it going down there?

747
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:12,034
Whatever you do,
don't get shot in the face.

748
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:16,538
Wow.

749
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:51,531
Dr. Norton,
how is he doing this?

750
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:55,827
His software is faster.
His hardware is stronger.

751
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,496
<i>He's a better machine.</i>

752
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:02,334
<i>But you said
humans hesitate.</i>

753
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,795
Only when they're
making decisions.

754
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:06,838
He's not making decisions?

755
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,757
Yes and no.

756
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:12,052
In his everyday life,
man rules over the machine.

757
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,179
Alex makes his own decisions.

758
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:16,390
<i>Now, when he engages in battle,</i>

759
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:19,685
<i>the visor comes down
and the software takes over.</i>

760
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,812
<i>Then the machine
does everything.</i>

761
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:25,232
Alex is a passenger,
just along for the ride.

762
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:30,213
<i>But if the machine
is in control,</i>

763
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:31,655
<i>then how is Murphy accountable?</i>

764
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:32,903
Who's pulling the trigger?

765
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:34,324
Well, when the machine fights,

766
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:36,910
the system releases signals
into Alex's brain

767
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,593
making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.

768
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:42,499
I mean, Alex believes right
now he is in control.

769
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:46,044
But he's not. It's the
illusion of free will.

770
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:56,847
Crap!

771
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:22,202
So you've circumvented the law by creating
a machine that thinks it's a man.

772
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,206
But that's illegal.

773
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,167
No. No, no, no.

774
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:28,670
It's a machine that thinks
it's Alex Murphy.

775
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:30,130
And in my book

776
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,090
that's legal.

777
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,218
Well done.

778
00:51:36,762 --> 00:51:38,263
Well done.

779
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:46,104
Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an
exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?

780
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:50,484
I, uh, I think we're all
curious to find out.

781
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,985
Go ahead.

782
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:31,399
If I had a pulse,
it'd be racing.

783
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:34,236
She's been waiting four months.

784
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:36,571
I'm sure hers is, too.

785
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,742
You're gonna do fine.

786
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,379
I love your sign, D.

787
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:56,842
Hey.

788
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,931
There's nothin' to be
nervous about.

789
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:08,854
<i>Thank you, Bennett.</i>

790
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,356
It's been a privilege.

791
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:47,202
Hi, Dad.

792
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:51,873
You know I missed you, buddy.

793
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:54,209
Me, too.

794
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:02,842
Wanna feel it?

795
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:08,014
What is it?

796
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:10,892
It's okay, sweetie.

797
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:25,156
I saved all the Red Wings
games on my computer.

798
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:27,575
You did?

799
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,539
How'd they do?
I don't know.

800
00:55:32,706 --> 00:55:34,916
I've been waiting
to watch them with you.

801
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,169
You know I'd love to, kiddo.

802
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:40,588
But I can't tonight.

803
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:43,591
You know, 'cause Daddy's
suit needs some...

804
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,553
Some special handling.

805
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,597
Do you understand?

806
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:22,213
Thanks for coming, Jack.

807
00:56:22,464 --> 00:56:23,965
I heard you went home already.

808
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:25,800
I know Clara must be
thrilled to have you back.

809
00:56:25,884 --> 00:56:28,136
I saw Clara

810
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,471
and David.

811
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:34,476
That ain't my home right now.

812
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,896
It's in a damn lab
across the hall.

813
00:56:38,063 --> 00:56:39,773
I'm sorry, Alex.

814
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:43,985
Startin' tomorrow, I'm gonna take
down Vallon and his whole damn crew.

815
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:45,945
I was waitin'
to hear you say that.

816
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:52,243
Least I know
you're the right color now.

817
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:27,320
<i>Pat, the cooler
temperatures here today</i>

818
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:29,572
<i>certainly have not stopped
people from showing up.</i>

819
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:32,117
<i>We're expecting people
from every corner of the city</i>

820
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,451
<i>here in Detroit</i>

821
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:35,411
<i>to come out and
show their support</i>

822
00:57:35,495 --> 00:57:36,746
<i>for Detective Alex Murphy.</i>

823
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,375
<i>You know, a lot of questions on people's
minds today is what will he look like.</i>

824
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:42,293
<i>Is he a changed man?</i>

825
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,129
<i>Rumor has it
he is in the building</i>

826
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:45,713
<i>preparing to come out...</i>

827
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:51,845
Alex, we're gonna upload the entire
DPD database into your brain.

828
00:57:52,554 --> 00:57:56,808
That means you'll have instantaneous
access to criminal records

829
00:57:56,891 --> 00:58:01,062
plus an archive of CCTV footage
from 2011 to the present.

830
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,230
All right.

831
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,357
Hit me.

832
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:07,235
Okay. Kim,
it's all yours.

833
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,489
Archive footage
uploading successfully.

834
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:14,242
Your system draws
connections automatically.

835
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:16,161
It will link perpetrators
to their crimes

836
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:19,581
and give you their exact
locations whenever available.

837
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:23,418
I got evidence
to make 138... No, no.

838
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,920
166 arrests.

839
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,631
His emotions are stable.

840
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:31,843
This is incredible.

841
00:58:32,385 --> 00:58:35,013
<i>You will notice his family
is here in the building as well.</i>

842
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,182
<i>The mayor is standing
onstage behind me.</i>

843
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:39,434
<i>Also, Raymond Sellars
from Omnicorp.</i>

844
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,768
<i>They seem like great friends</i>

845
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:43,771
<i>obviously echoing the partnership
that they've brought together.</i>

846
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:46,423
How much longer
will this take?

847
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:49,527
Well, the feed from the
database is almost clone, so.

848
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:51,279
We're approaching present day.

849
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:54,866
634 pending arrests.

850
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:57,368
We're gonna need
a bigger prison.

851
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:00,955
He's on top of her.

852
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,874
Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

853
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:04,542
I gotta do something!
Alex.

854
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:06,794
Alex, calm down.

855
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:08,713
Take a breath.

856
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:10,381
Relax.

857
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:11,883
Kim, what are the readings?

858
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:13,760
I haven't seen him
at levels like this.

859
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,011
- He's gonna shoot 'em!
- Alex!

860
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:17,513
Alex, Alex, relax.

861
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:19,474
Relax.

862
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:21,476
Alex?

863
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:24,223
What is this?
This just a computer glitch?

864
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:26,064
No. That's
his own crime scene.

865
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:27,148
Alex!

866
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:28,233
He's spiking
all over the place.

867
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,484
Alex!

868
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:31,903
The system
is crashing, Doctor.

869
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,154
Alex, can you hear me?

870
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:34,739
Alex! Alex!

871
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:37,134
I'm not sure he can handle this.
I gotta do something!

872
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:38,279
He's emotionally overloaded.

873
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,410
Unlock me!

874
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:40,995
Alex! Stop!

875
00:59:41,496 --> 00:59:43,122
Stop! He's having a seizure!

876
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:45,166
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

877
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,501
Get me a live feed!

878
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:47,752
I can't do it.
Dr. Norton's with the patient.

879
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:48,836
Do it now!

880
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:50,129
Jesus Christ!

881
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:51,923
Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!

882
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,466
What?
The press is waiting!

883
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:54,634
We have to get him up there now!

884
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:55,843
What do you want me to do?

885
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:58,805
I don't know! Fix him!
Do what you have to do!

886
00:59:58,888 --> 01:00:02,225
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

887
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:05,186
We're running out of time.

888
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,272
Okay.

889
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,108
Everybody out!

890
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:12,694
Out!

891
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:14,279
<i>Mayor Durant is
about to take to the stage</i>

892
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:17,949
and introduce Detroit's newest
weapon in the war on crime.

893
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:21,286
I'm actually getting word that
he's ready to go right now.

894
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:28,084
Heart rate rising. He
might start spiking, Doctor.

895
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,795
Set modules to absorb
dopamine and noradrenalin.

896
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,046
But you will be
taking away his emotions.

897
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,881
Drop the levels
until I tell you to stop.

898
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:35,967
Doctor, you'll be taking away
his ability to feel anything.

899
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,677
Now, please!

900
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:45,560
Pull the footage.
Put it on a loop.

901
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:49,397
Dopamine level's at 20%.

902
01:00:49,564 --> 01:00:50,565
More.

903
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:54,319
Dopamine
level's at 10%.

904
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:55,528
More.

905
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,364
Dopamine level's at 5%.
Lower.

906
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:00,408
You're flattening him out.
Lower!

907
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:05,079
2%.
Hold it there.

908
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,421
Alex?

909
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:16,758
Alex, how do you feel?

910
01:01:20,762 --> 01:01:22,847
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

911
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:28,936
Well, today I'm not here to
talk about crime prevention.

912
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:32,732
I am here to give you the cure.

913
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,380
That's right!

914
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:42,742
Hi, Dad!

915
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,204
Dad?

916
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
the revolution begins right now

917
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:58,966
with Detective Alex Murphy!

918
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:17,026
Detective.

919
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:34,335
- What's he doing?
- He looks like a zombie.

920
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,338
I think he's
accessing criminal data.

921
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:45,972
Thomas King!
You are under arrest!

922
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:07,743
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

923
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:11,372
wanted for rape, arson,
and murder.

924
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:15,543
This man has torn
apart American families.

925
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,255
On the loose for six years.

926
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:25,553
And where was this
criminal mastermind hiding?

927
01:03:28,723 --> 01:03:33,686
Right in front of
the police headquarters.

928
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:38,399
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

929
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:42,487
These two officers
are completely unaware

930
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,573
of the monster in their midst.

931
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:50,453
And then, in 60 seconds...

932
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:54,540
I repeat, just 60 seconds,

933
01:03:54,707 --> 01:03:58,211
Detective Murphy
brings him down.

934
01:03:58,294 --> 01:04:02,173
<i>If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.</i>

935
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:08,137
This, my friends, is the
future of American justice.

936
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:11,974
How many like Thomas King
will pay for their crimes

937
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:15,228
now that RoboCop is here?

938
01:04:16,062 --> 01:04:17,188
Yes,

939
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:21,776
let's not shy away
from what this means, people.

940
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:26,197
Men weren't up to the task.

941
01:04:26,364 --> 01:04:27,823
But Alex Murphy,

942
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:30,159
a <i>robot cop,</i>

943
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:31,285
<i>was.</i>

944
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:33,871
We can't take him
off the street.

945
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:35,498
This is what I'm saying.
He's a hit.

946
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:37,291
A big, fat, stinking hit.

947
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,627
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

948
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,922
Hey, we all knew there would be issues.
It's inevitable.

949
01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:45,675
Dennett, you're my guy. I just
need you to get a handle on this.

950
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:46,918
I know, but I need more time.

951
01:04:46,968 --> 01:04:49,470
Scientifically,
we're in uncharted water.

952
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:51,722
We need to take him
backtothelab and do more tests.

953
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:55,226
I mean, it was like something was
interfering with our system.

954
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,728
Something beyond
chemistry or physics.

955
01:04:57,895 --> 01:04:59,730
Like what? His soul?

956
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:02,316
Hey, look, this train has
already left the station.

957
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,694
I can't exactly go out
to the world and say,

958
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:07,280
"Sorry, I released
a defective product."

959
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:10,324
So, no matter what we do, we just
need to keep him on the streets.

960
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:12,076
What about the interviews?

961
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:14,579
Cancel 'em.
Cancel all of 'em.

962
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,080
Everything.

963
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:18,499
In fact, Dennett.

964
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,838
<i>Let's keep the wife at a
distance for now, as well.</i>

965
01:05:25,006 --> 01:05:26,446
<i>I'd like to see him.</i>

966
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:28,467
Can you arrange that?

967
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:30,469
Look, I won't lie to you.

968
01:05:31,012 --> 01:05:34,432
Alex was so nervous,
we had to sedate him.

969
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:37,268
I looked in his eyes and
I couldn't see my husband.

970
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:41,314
And then he just shoots a man in front
of our son. That's not sedation.

971
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:45,651
He's responding
to drugs differently now.

972
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:49,989
We both knew from day one,

973
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:53,159
there would be complications.

974
01:05:57,455 --> 01:05:59,498
Just give me a little more time.

975
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,043
I promise,

976
01:06:03,169 --> 01:06:05,171
you'll have your husband back.

977
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:11,177
This goes for every
squad in every department.

978
01:06:11,344 --> 01:06:14,805
Detective Murphy will have full
access to all investigations.

979
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,516
Robberies, narcotics, homicides.

980
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:20,144
If he requests
to take over a case,

981
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:21,812
the case will be handed to him.

982
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,731
No arguments, no complaints.

983
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:24,899
This is bullshit!

984
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:28,861
I said no complaints!
And I mean it. Now...

985
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:32,573
Good morning, Chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.

986
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,868
I've selected 13 targets for
today, all wanted for murder.

987
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:37,912
John Biggs is target number one.

988
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,413
I'll be taking over this case.

989
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,332
Ambulances, detention
vehicles, and coroners

990
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:44,001
should be ready to
move in on my request.

991
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,212
I wish you all a very good day.

992
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:54,762
Murphy.

993
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:56,847
You okay, man?

994
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:00,393
I'm fine, Sergeant.

995
01:07:00,935 --> 01:07:02,728
Can't wait to get back to work.

996
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:04,689
Lake and Daniels are in there
shittin' their pants...

997
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,440
Excuse me, I have casework.

998
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:00,995
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

999
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:09,295
Walter Karrel,
look at me.

1000
01:08:09,462 --> 01:08:10,755
You have two options.

1001
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:11,922
Option one.

1002
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,842
I shoot you with 50,000 volts

1003
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:18,345
which may cause respiratory
failure, organ malfunction,

1004
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:20,848
internal burns, and loss of
bowel and bladder control.

1005
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:22,725
And then I arrest you.

1006
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,351
Option two.
You tell me where

1007
01:08:24,435 --> 01:08:26,771
John Biggs' drug lab is located.

1008
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:28,939
And then I arrest you.

1009
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,984
You have two seconds to decide.

1010
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,012
Totally justifiable.

1011
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:44,431
We are going to make
a lot of money.

1012
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:48,269
Nothing. No fear.
No increase in heart rate.

1013
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:51,772
No traces of anger whatsoever.

1014
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:54,358
Congratulations, Doctor.

1015
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:56,026
You did it.

1016
01:09:57,278 --> 01:09:58,779
Yes, I did.

1017
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:08,414
<i>I told you, sir.</i>

1018
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:11,375
Norton clearly never had
control of the product.

1019
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,461
I agree. And that's
why I called you here.

1020
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:17,464
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

1021
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:18,632
Okay.

1022
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:20,676
I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head

1023
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:23,042
plus full surveillance of the lab, and...

1024
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,472
You're gonna have
full access to everything.

1025
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:27,474
If anything comes up,

1026
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:29,268
I'm gonna be in Washington.

1027
01:10:33,314 --> 01:10:34,607
<i>He brought peace</i>

1028
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:37,234
<i>to this country's
most violent city.</i>

1029
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:38,485
<i>He showed us all</i>

1030
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:41,655
<i>that Detroit and America
can have a brighter future.</i>

1031
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:45,659
<i>A future of economic growth,
freedom, and happiness.</i>

1032
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:49,997
On tonight's show,
a visionary and true patriot.

1033
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:53,751
The CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellars.

1034
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,171
Hello, Pat.
Raymond.

1035
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:58,255
Thanks for havin' me.

1036
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,925
You must be doing
a victory lap about now.

1037
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:02,009
Well.

1038
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:06,013
Two weeks ago, Omni's stock
went through the roof.

1039
01:11:06,138 --> 01:11:08,432
And the Senate
has finally agreed

1040
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:10,476
to vote on the repeal
of the Dreyfus Act.

1041
01:11:10,643 --> 01:11:14,021
Well, look, I mean, the
tide is definitely turning.

1042
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:17,024
I just feel certain that soon we'll
be keeping all Americans safe.

1043
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:18,108
I certainly hope so.

1044
01:11:18,484 --> 01:11:21,445
But, I think our next guest will
have a different point of view.

1045
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:22,529
Mmm-hmm.

1046
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:23,989
Hubert Dreyfus.

1047
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:26,367
Senator,
thank you for joining us.

1048
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,243
<i>Hello, Pat.
Mr. Sellars.</i>

1049
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:30,621
Senator, do you know
what this is?

1050
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:33,540
The American public is divided

1051
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,042
on the Dreyfus Act.

1052
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:40,339
Our polls at Novakelement.com
are tight at 50-50.

1053
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:44,301
<i>There is no doubt
Omnicorp created a sensation</i>

1054
01:11:44,385 --> 01:11:47,805
<i>but this bill is
not about Alex Murphy.</i>

1055
01:11:47,972 --> 01:11:50,933
<i>It's about whether America's
willing to give robots</i>

1056
01:11:51,016 --> 01:11:52,643
<i>the authority over human lives.</i>

1057
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:54,311
No. Look, look, look.

1058
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:57,064
This sea change
we're witnessing,

1059
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:58,565
and it is a sea change,

1060
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:00,317
shows that Americans
don't really care

1061
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:03,153
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

1062
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:06,281
What they care about is efficiency
and they care about safety.

1063
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:07,616
<i>You're clouding the issue.</i>

1064
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,243
<i>This is clearly an attempt</i>

1065
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:11,745
<i>to sway public opinion
with a marketing stunt.</i>

1066
01:12:11,912 --> 01:12:13,247
What's clear is

1067
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:16,875
that with just one system in
place, we've cut crime by 80%.

1068
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,003
Just imagine if we put,

1069
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:21,296
I dunno, let's say
100 systems in place.

1070
01:12:21,547 --> 01:12:23,424
And then,
I want you to ask yourself,

1071
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:25,300
why are you holding us back?

1072
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:26,864
<i>Is that your plan?
Thank you, Senator.</i>

1073
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:28,512
And thank you, Raymond.
Thank you, Pat.

1074
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:31,598
Well, there you have it.

1075
01:12:32,266 --> 01:12:34,184
Who could argue with that?

1076
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:36,228
Which begs the question.

1077
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:41,483
Has the US Senate
become pro-crime?

1078
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,327
Yeah, hi.

1079
01:12:52,494 --> 01:12:54,121
No, no, 5000.

1080
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:55,956
Call me tomorrow.

1081
01:12:57,374 --> 01:13:00,627
Hey, guys. Vallon's
waitin' for you inside.

1082
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:03,505
What, you too busy
to walk us in?

1083
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:05,049
I'm out here makin' money.

1084
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:08,052
Where are my trip wires?
I gotta do this myself?

1085
01:13:08,469 --> 01:13:10,949
What the hell is all this shit?

1086
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:12,222
I can't move any product

1087
01:13:12,306 --> 01:13:13,807
with this thing on the streets.

1088
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:16,018
What are you doing
to protect me?

1089
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:18,145
Relax. The guy's
a walkin' zombie.

1090
01:13:18,312 --> 01:13:19,813
And tell me your phones are off.

1091
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,149
He's not going after you.
We covered our tracks.

1092
01:13:22,316 --> 01:13:24,485
He can't manufacture
evidence outta thin air.

1093
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,361
If he does, I'm ready for him.

1094
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:36,163
Well?

1095
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,335
I've been getting calls.

1096
01:13:41,502 --> 01:13:42,669
From whom?

1097
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:44,713
Well, Clara.

1098
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,509
You need to let her see her husband.
She has rights.

1099
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:52,054
That's not your decision.
That's Legal's call.

1100
01:13:52,387 --> 01:13:54,723
Yeah, but it's only
a question of time

1101
01:13:54,807 --> 01:13:56,683
before she turns up
on television.

1102
01:13:57,017 --> 01:13:58,519
Well, she can try.

1103
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:02,064
I'll issue a gag order before
I let her see her husband.

1104
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:04,900
I'd hop to it.

1105
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:08,320
Alex. Alex!

1106
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:13,492
Alex. You need to come home.

1107
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:15,035
Clara, please stand aside.

1108
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:16,537
You need to speak to your son.

1109
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,664
Right now, I see three
crimes in progress.

1110
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:20,249
Alex, listen to me.

1111
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:22,709
I know you're in there.

1112
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,381
David won't show
his face at school.

1113
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,842
He's having nightmares.

1114
01:14:31,677 --> 01:14:34,388
He's falling apart.
Lam falling apart.

1115
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:36,890
Please.

1116
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:40,769
I can't do this on my own.

1117
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:44,398
He's been scared
ever since that night.

1118
01:14:53,866 --> 01:14:55,346
<i>What do you think
she's gonna do?</i>

1119
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:57,744
What's he gonna do?

1120
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:19,933
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1121
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,102
<i>David? David.</i>

1122
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:25,272
<i>Stand back.
Come on, stand back!</i>

1123
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:47,794
He's supposed to be
watching this.

1124
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:52,549
Instead, he's accessing images of
Clara and David arriving at school.

1125
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:53,926
Over and over again.

1126
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:58,680
Somehow, he's overriding
the system's priorities.

1127
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:11,276
<i>- Do you want me to shut him down?
- No.</i>

1128
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:12,819
Not yet.

1129
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:16,031
I wanna see what happens.

1130
01:16:35,968 --> 01:16:37,886
What's he doing
at his house?

1131
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:42,057
Look, he's disobeying protocol.

1132
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,392
You have to shut him down.

1133
01:16:43,684 --> 01:16:46,645
As far as I can tell,
he's still doing his job.

1134
01:17:46,288 --> 01:17:48,915
Adrian, give me
an image of his brain.

1135
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:53,128
He's undoing what we did to him.

1136
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:56,256
His dopamine levels
are coming back to normal.

1137
01:17:56,423 --> 01:17:58,884
How is that even possible?

1138
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:02,387
I haven't the faintest idea.

1139
01:18:02,763 --> 01:18:04,097
<i>Alex.</i>

1140
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,959
<i>Alex, please return
to the station.</i>

1141
01:18:34,002 --> 01:18:35,796
I wanna run some tests.

1142
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:38,298
Well, this should
be interesting.

1143
01:18:55,184 --> 01:18:56,584
<i>And your phone
on the table!</i>

1144
01:18:56,608 --> 01:18:58,819
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1145
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:01,196
- Whoa!
- What'd you say?

1146
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:03,824
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1147
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:33,979
My hand, man!

1148
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:35,230
Where's Antoine Vallon?

1149
01:19:35,355 --> 01:19:36,565
You broke my hand, man!

1150
01:19:37,357 --> 01:19:39,234
I know you remember me, Jerry.

1151
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,448
Where's Vallon?

1152
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:45,615
Wait a minute.

1153
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:48,179
If I tell you where Vallon is,
he'll kill my wife and kid, man.

1154
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:53,248
Your wife left you in 2019 after
filing charges for domestic abuse.

1155
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:55,208
And you don't have a kid.

1156
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:56,667
Butldo.

1157
01:19:58,253 --> 01:19:59,504
I'm not askin' again!

1158
01:19:59,671 --> 01:20:01,832
Look, I swear, man. I don't
know where Vallon is, okay?

1159
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:05,260
The only guy I talk to is his driver
Marcus. That's it, man. That's it!

1160
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:07,721
Does he have a phone number?

1161
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:27,282
We have a problem.
Alex is breaking protocol.

1162
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:28,450
What's he doing?

1163
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:30,744
He's off solving his own murder.

1164
01:20:30,911 --> 01:20:33,663
Oh, that is genius.

1165
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,707
Why didn't I think Of that?

1166
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:44,257
<i>How long
till he gets here?</i>

1167
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:46,426
<i>Five minutes.
All</i> right.

1168
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,470
Johnny, you stay
on these monitors.

1169
01:20:48,637 --> 01:20:49,930
What happened?

1170
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:53,934
Some idiot used
an unencrypted phone.

1171
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:56,394
Shit.

1172
01:21:04,653 --> 01:21:06,279
All right, everyone, listen up!

1173
01:21:06,655 --> 01:21:07,948
He's coming.

1174
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:10,951
He leaves alive, you don't.

1175
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:13,787
How do we stop him?

1176
01:21:15,163 --> 01:21:18,333
.50 caliber and above.
Aim for the head.

1177
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,805
This one's set.

1178
01:21:32,097 --> 01:21:33,265
Let's go. Go!

1179
01:21:33,431 --> 01:21:34,766
All right, move! Let's go!

1180
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:37,978
Come on. Come on!

1181
01:21:39,771 --> 01:21:40,772
Ready to go!

1182
01:21:41,815 --> 01:21:43,149
They're all set.

1183
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:12,405
Finish it!

1184
01:23:26,795 --> 01:23:28,088
You freak, die!

1185
01:24:17,345 --> 01:24:18,638
Watch out.

1186
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:20,432
Need me
to call a doctor?

1187
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:22,600
Come on, Jack.
You're gonna like this.

1188
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:26,471
What the hell you doin' here?

1189
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:27,840
Y'all gonna play
good cop, bad cop?

1190
01:24:27,856 --> 01:24:30,567
Nah, Daniels.
Bad cop, RoboCop.

1191
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:35,655
I've recovered 26
guns from Vallon's warehouse.

1192
01:24:35,822 --> 01:24:38,616
Thirteen serial numbers match
weapons missing from Evidence.

1193
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:40,618
And I got your prints
all over 'em.

1194
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:41,786
This is bullshit.

1195
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:43,747
I also
have CCTV footage

1196
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,832
of you and Vallon the same
day he tried to kill me.

1197
01:24:45,999 --> 01:24:48,168
<i>So put him on the payroll.
Why we talkin' about this?</i>

1198
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:51,629
<i>It won't work. Now that his partner
got hit, he's never gonna let it go.</i>

1199
01:24:51,796 --> 01:24:53,214
<i>- What is that?</i>
<i>- Lewis' hospital.</i>

1200
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:54,841
<i>Murphy's dropping by
this afternoon.</i>

1201
01:24:55,008 --> 01:24:57,886
<i>I kill a cop, I'm lookin'
over my shoulder...</i>

1202
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:00,346
You know what they do
to cops in prison, man?

1203
01:25:00,805 --> 01:25:03,391
Being locked up with the
same dudes you put in there?

1204
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:08,438
How long you think
before he gives you up?

1205
01:25:12,192 --> 01:25:14,861
Don't shoot me. Okay?

1206
01:25:15,862 --> 01:25:18,198
I swear to Christ.
It was Dean.

1207
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:21,242
She helped pull those guns.
Just don't shoot me.

1208
01:25:23,203 --> 01:25:25,205
Thank you for your cooperation.

1209
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:28,875
You can cuff him now, Jack.

1210
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:39,844
Now I know why we
couldn't get an arrest.

1211
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:43,264
'Cause Vallon was protected
from up on high.

1212
01:25:43,348 --> 01:25:45,058
Alex, I can explain.

1213
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:47,101
You tipped him off today.

1214
01:25:47,185 --> 01:25:48,436
Come on, man.
Don't do this.

1215
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,438
You tried to kill me twice.

1216
01:25:50,522 --> 01:25:53,817
I trusted you.
And you destroyed my family.

1217
01:25:54,108 --> 01:25:55,109
Confess.

1218
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:58,112
Now, in front of everyone.

1219
01:25:58,238 --> 01:25:59,239
Confess!

1220
01:26:09,082 --> 01:26:10,083
What happened?

1221
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,377
Tin Man is down.
Had to be done.

1222
01:26:12,544 --> 01:26:13,545
<i>Why?</i>

1223
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:14,963
Product shot a corrupt cop.

1224
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:16,506
Two more seconds,
the chief's brains

1225
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:19,092
would've been splattered
across the 6:00 news.

1226
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:20,635
We got anything on her?

1227
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:23,137
Well, she's the Chief of
the Detroit Police Department.

1228
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:25,098
What do you think?

1229
01:26:28,935 --> 01:26:30,228
You know what?

1230
01:26:31,646 --> 01:26:34,899
This might actually tip this
thing right into the net.

1231
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:44,492
<i>Alex, I don't
know if you can hear me.</i>

1232
01:26:44,784 --> 01:26:48,079
<i>But tonight,
you uncovered a nest of vipers</i>

1233
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:50,665
<i>inside
the Detroit Police Department.</i>

1234
01:26:50,832 --> 01:26:55,169
<i>And in so doing, you shed
light on an invaluable truth.</i>

1235
01:26:55,795 --> 01:26:57,255
Even the police,

1236
01:26:57,338 --> 01:27:01,342
the men and women
who swore to keep us safe,

1237
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:03,636
they can be bribed.

1238
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:07,140
They can be bought.

1239
01:27:08,766 --> 01:27:12,896
Machines, however,
are corruption free.

1240
01:27:13,855 --> 01:27:16,065
Americans could be
living in a country

1241
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:19,485
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

1242
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:21,321
but incorruptible.

1243
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,949
Thank you, Alex,
for all you've done.

1244
01:27:25,116 --> 01:27:26,826
And for all that you are.

1245
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:30,496
<i>Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.</i>

1246
01:27:31,164 --> 01:27:33,917
Our doctors
are working ceaselessly

1247
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,753
but, at this time, it is
unclear if he will survive.

1248
01:27:38,046 --> 01:27:40,048
<i>Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt</i>

1249
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:42,008
<i>on Detective Alex Murphy's life</i>

1250
01:27:42,091 --> 01:27:44,385
<i>will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?</i>

1251
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:46,346
<i>At this time,
Omnicorp's sole concern</i>

1252
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:48,514
<i>is the full recovery
of Detective Murphy.</i>

1253
01:27:49,641 --> 01:27:51,809
<i>How many times
does Detective Murphy</i>

1254
01:27:51,893 --> 01:27:54,312
<i>have to give his life
for his country?</i>

1255
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:59,817
<i>I sincerely hope the Senate
makes the right vote tomorrow</i>

1256
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:04,489
<i>so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices
will not have been in vain.</i>

1257
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:11,454
<i>Senator Dreyfus is my friend.</i>

1258
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:14,332
<i>He has been
my mentor and my strength</i>

1259
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:16,876
<i>in times of difficulty
on this floor.</i>

1260
01:28:17,377 --> 01:28:20,463
<i>But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio,</i>

1261
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:23,675
<i>and the safety of its citizens
is my top priority.</i>

1262
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,093
<i>So I vote yes.</i>

1263
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:27,553
<i>The Dreyfus Act
must be repealed.</i>

1264
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:30,056
That's us ahead, 39 to 10.

1265
01:28:30,223 --> 01:28:33,142
I spoke to the Senate liaison and
it looks like it's in the bag,

1266
01:28:33,226 --> 01:28:36,312
but we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

1267
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:40,149
<i>We're here live
at DPD headquarters</i>

1268
01:28:40,233 --> 01:28:42,986
<i>where moments ago, Clara Murphy
made a shocking statement.</i>

1269
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:44,278
What the hell?

1270
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:49,409
<i>Omnicorp has denied me and my
son access to Alex for weeks.</i>

1271
01:28:50,076 --> 01:28:51,911
<i>I demand to know why.</i>

1272
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:57,917
<i>This treatment is inhuman and somebody
needs to be held accountable.</i>

1273
01:28:59,127 --> 01:29:00,920
Oh, we're fucked.

1274
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:02,463
No, we only need 12 votes.

1275
01:29:02,547 --> 01:29:04,048
She shouldn't make
much difference.

1276
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:06,426
Yeah, but what about
after the vote?

1277
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:08,389
I mean, those two should
not be allowed contact.

1278
01:29:08,428 --> 01:29:10,847
If she starts
putting ideas in his head...

1279
01:29:10,972 --> 01:29:13,641
Bring her in.
I'll handle the explanation.

1280
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:15,268
And what about Alex?

1281
01:29:15,351 --> 01:29:17,603
You know, unfortunately,
we can'tjust keep him on ice.

1282
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:20,831
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.

1283
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:23,401
They're our clients.
We have to take care of them.

1284
01:29:23,568 --> 01:29:26,988
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

1285
01:29:27,071 --> 01:29:30,366
but when a man is investigating
city politics, they get nervous.

1286
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,827
All right. First off,
it's not a man, okay?

1287
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,871
It's property of Omnicorp.

1288
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:37,206
And politics are
the least of your concern.

1289
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:38,958
I mean, this thing
solved its own murder.

1290
01:29:39,042 --> 01:29:41,562
How long till it realizes you
haven't been on the level with it?

1291
01:29:41,586 --> 01:29:42,712
If that happens,

1292
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,715
every journalist in this country
is dying to speak to him.

1293
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:47,759
I mean, we created a hero.

1294
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:50,970
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

1295
01:29:54,474 --> 01:29:56,184
What's bigger than a hero?

1296
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:09,155
Dead hero.

1297
01:30:13,493 --> 01:30:15,453
Get me Dr. Norton.

1298
01:30:24,504 --> 01:30:25,630
What is this, Raymond?

1299
01:30:26,756 --> 01:30:30,760
You have Mattox spying on me and now this
bullshit about a "critical condition"?

1300
01:30:30,927 --> 01:30:33,638
You know and I know
Alex is fine!

1301
01:30:33,805 --> 01:30:34,972
Calm down.

1302
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:36,641
<i>Bennett.</i>

1303
01:30:36,768 --> 01:30:38,048
Your work is so good, I don't...

1304
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:39,393
Well, now,
this is not about my work!

1305
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:41,395
You saw the woman on TV!

1306
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:43,689
This has to stop!

1307
01:30:45,525 --> 01:30:46,818
You're right.

1308
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:49,529
But let me
ask you something, Dennett.

1309
01:30:49,695 --> 01:30:52,115
What kind of life have we
really given Alex Murphy?

1310
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:55,743
He's never gonna be a normal
man, a father, a husband.

1311
01:30:55,827 --> 01:30:59,080
By the time we put the other units
on the street, he's just...

1312
01:30:59,247 --> 01:31:00,331
<i>Bennett.</i>

1313
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,709
Let's face it.

1314
01:31:04,544 --> 01:31:06,045
We failed him.

1315
01:31:07,505 --> 01:31:09,423
We failed Alex Murphy.

1316
01:31:09,507 --> 01:31:11,134
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture

1317
01:31:11,217 --> 01:31:12,778
because that's what
we're talking about.

1318
01:31:12,844 --> 01:31:15,596
The work you've done with him is
gonna be studied for decades.

1319
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,890
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

1320
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:22,270
No policeman is ever going to
die in the line of duty again

1321
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,564
because of you.

1322
01:31:26,232 --> 01:31:27,692
You think about that.

1323
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:40,163
I want that family taken care of

1324
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:41,747
beyond their wildest dreams.

1325
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:43,875
We owe them that.
I agree.

1326
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:47,962
I want full funding.
Ten years.

1327
01:31:48,379 --> 01:31:50,047
New staff, all my own people.

1328
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:51,757
Fantastic.

1329
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:53,467
Deal.

1330
01:32:03,853 --> 01:32:05,354
Hey. What's going on?

1331
01:32:05,438 --> 01:32:07,523
Security's here.
They're clearing everyone out.

1332
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:09,358
They're not waking him up.

1333
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:11,319
Whatever you do,
don't leave him alone.

1334
01:32:11,402 --> 01:32:13,082
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

1335
01:32:14,296 --> 01:32:16,216
<i>The voting period has ended.</i>

1336
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,826
<i>The clerks have
tabulated the results.</i>

1337
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:20,953
<i>The yeas are 63.</i>

1338
01:32:21,037 --> 01:32:23,748
<i>The nays are 22.</i>

1339
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:26,334
<i>A majority of senators have
voted in the affirmative.</i>

1340
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:30,171
<i>The Dreyfus Act has been
repealed by Congress.</i>

1341
01:32:35,676 --> 01:32:38,221
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

1342
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:39,388
This is Mattox.

1343
01:32:39,472 --> 01:32:40,848
<i>Dennett's on board.</i>

1344
01:32:40,932 --> 01:32:42,516
It's about time.

1345
01:32:47,605 --> 01:32:48,731
Call it.

1346
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:50,900
<i>Get it done.</i>

1347
01:32:51,901 --> 01:32:53,319
My pleasure.

1348
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:04,247
Mrs. Murphy... You can come
here as much as you want.

1349
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:07,583
You can threaten me. You can sue me.
You can take my home.

1350
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:10,586
But I am not gonna stop till I see
my husband. Do you understand that?

1351
01:33:10,878 --> 01:33:13,631
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

1352
01:33:15,174 --> 01:33:16,676
Is Alex okay?

1353
01:33:16,926 --> 01:33:20,388
He has important information to share
with you. Will you accompany me?

1354
01:33:22,723 --> 01:33:23,891
David.

1355
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:27,853
We gotta go.
Can you grab your coat?

1356
01:33:29,188 --> 01:33:30,189
Hey!

1357
01:33:30,273 --> 01:33:31,315
<i>I'm in the
elevator, on my way down.</i>

1358
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:32,942
I need access to the lab.

1359
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:34,652
That's insane.
They're still here.

1360
01:33:34,735 --> 01:33:36,445
<i>Distract them.</i>

1361
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:37,655
Okay.

1362
01:33:38,864 --> 01:33:39,907
I cannot...

1363
01:33:39,991 --> 01:33:42,159
There's a
lady in here going hysterical.

1364
01:33:42,243 --> 01:33:44,120
She will not let us in. She's
got the codes for the door.

1365
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:45,871
I repeat,
she will not let us in.

1366
01:33:45,955 --> 01:33:48,249
Lady, you need to let us in there now.
We have to get in there.

1367
01:33:48,332 --> 01:33:49,834
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

1368
01:33:49,917 --> 01:33:52,757
Do you wanna be responsible for the
deaths of everyone in this building?

1369
01:33:53,045 --> 01:33:54,422
Hey! Stop!

1370
01:33:58,592 --> 01:33:59,719
Don't shoot!

1371
01:33:59,802 --> 01:34:01,178
Step outside.

1372
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:09,312
Unlock the transmitter!

1373
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,689
Transmitter
unlocked!

1374
01:34:19,155 --> 01:34:21,032
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

1375
01:34:21,115 --> 01:34:22,835
<i>Right</i> away, sir.

1376
01:34:24,744 --> 01:34:25,995
<i>Wake him up!</i>

1377
01:34:26,412 --> 01:34:29,498
Alex! Alex!

1378
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:33,085
Alex, it's Dr. Norton,
you have to wake up!

1379
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:34,378
Alex, can you hear me?

1380
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:37,673
These men are here to kill us.

1381
01:34:37,757 --> 01:34:40,217
They're here to kill us,
for chrissakes!

1382
01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:46,807
<i>Mrs. Murphy, last night,</i>

1383
01:34:46,891 --> 01:34:48,893
Alex had a psychotic break.

1384
01:34:48,976 --> 01:34:53,272
He killed an unarmed colleague
and later suffered a seizure.

1385
01:34:54,398 --> 01:34:55,900
We did everything,

1386
01:34:55,983 --> 01:34:58,903
everything, we could, but the
doctors couldn't save him.

1387
01:35:00,363 --> 01:35:02,406
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1388
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:05,242
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1389
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:08,162
You shut me down. I was
about to get a confession.

1390
01:35:08,788 --> 01:35:10,456
Mattox shut you down.

1391
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:14,668
I've removed your transmitter
so he won't do it again.

1392
01:35:15,086 --> 01:35:17,254
Sellars can't afford
to wake you up.

1393
01:35:18,297 --> 01:35:20,424
He sent these guys
to pull the plug.

1394
01:35:20,883 --> 01:35:24,387
He wants you dead, Alex.
Do you understand?

1395
01:35:24,553 --> 01:35:26,389
Sorry. If there's
anything we can do

1396
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:27,807
for you and David, we'll do it.

1397
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:30,101
I want nothing from you.

1398
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,353
I understand.

1399
01:35:32,937 --> 01:35:35,231
You stay out of our lives.

1400
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:37,858
You and your company.

1401
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:40,027
If that's what
you think is best.

1402
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:42,446
There's one more thing.

1403
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:45,366
I think it would be to the benefit
of everyone, especially David

1404
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,660
if we kept this matter private.

1405
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:50,454
We don't wanna
damage Alex's legacy.

1406
01:35:53,124 --> 01:35:54,959
<i>DR. NORTON'.
Alex! Alex!</i>

1407
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:56,961
I can fix this!

1408
01:35:57,044 --> 01:35:58,504
You lied to me.

1409
01:35:58,587 --> 01:35:59,839
You lied to my wife.

1410
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:01,549
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me.

1411
01:36:01,632 --> 01:36:02,912
You want me
to trust you, Doctor?

1412
01:36:02,967 --> 01:36:05,010
Alex, I can go to the press!

1413
01:36:06,429 --> 01:36:09,014
Alex, I can tell them
the whole story!

1414
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:10,766
Alex!

1415
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:13,227
Listen to me, please!

1416
01:36:14,228 --> 01:36:17,523
Alex! Alex!

1417
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,202
What the hell?

1418
01:36:38,586 --> 01:36:39,986
Keep all our systems
at green light,

1419
01:36:40,045 --> 01:36:42,131
and for chrissakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

1420
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:43,215
<i>Roger</i> that.

1421
01:36:43,299 --> 01:36:45,259
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

1422
01:36:46,594 --> 01:36:48,179
Look at this city.

1423
01:36:50,014 --> 01:36:51,557
So beautiful.

1424
01:36:52,558 --> 01:36:55,227
It's become so peaceful.

1425
01:36:58,022 --> 01:36:59,356
I Wish

1426
01:37:00,357 --> 01:37:02,610
I had some good news
for Detroit.

1427
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:04,862
I have very sad news.

1428
01:37:05,029 --> 01:37:07,698
Despite our best efforts
to save him,

1429
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:10,451
Alex Murphy passed away
just hours ago.

1430
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:12,161
Alex Murphy was...

1431
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:13,524
Mr. Sellars.

1432
01:37:13,871 --> 01:37:15,456
What is it?
Mattox just called.

1433
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,875
We need you to come with us now.

1434
01:37:23,627 --> 01:37:26,067
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

1435
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:28,093
What are you talking about? We
have a security situation here.

1436
01:37:28,177 --> 01:37:29,595
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

1437
01:37:29,678 --> 01:37:31,558
Sir, there's a car outside
that's supposed to...

1438
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:33,265
That area is locked down.
Now go.

1439
01:37:33,349 --> 01:37:35,017
What's h -
I said go! appemng?

1440
01:37:35,351 --> 01:37:37,353
I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.

1441
01:37:40,272 --> 01:37:41,357
Mr. Sellars.

1442
01:37:41,524 --> 01:37:43,564
How close is that helicopter?
About 10 minutes, sir.

1443
01:38:01,335 --> 01:38:02,586
Excuse me.
Yes?

1444
01:38:02,753 --> 01:38:05,089
I need to speak with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1445
01:38:05,256 --> 01:38:06,465
It's an emergency.

1446
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:08,259
Stand by. Mr. Sellars.

1447
01:38:08,717 --> 01:38:10,558
Apparently there's a Clara
Murphy in the lobby.

1448
01:38:10,594 --> 01:38:13,931
Raymond, if she sees him,
we are dead in the water.

1449
01:38:14,098 --> 01:38:16,433
What do you wanna do?
Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

1450
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:17,800
Yes, sir.

1451
01:38:21,605 --> 01:38:24,400
Norton said they may be
using drones for protection.

1452
01:38:24,567 --> 01:38:26,610
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1453
01:38:26,777 --> 01:38:29,405
They won't shoot
if we're unarmed. Clear?

1454
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:30,489
Clear.
Clear.

1455
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,481
Hold it right there.

1456
01:38:49,258 --> 01:38:50,259
Don't move.

1457
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:57,349
This is private property. You
are not authorized to be here!

1458
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:03,606
I'd put those guns down now
if I were you.

1459
01:39:03,772 --> 01:39:05,441
Stand down.
All right, man, we're good.

1460
01:39:51,904 --> 01:39:53,238
Head to the lower level.

1461
01:39:54,487 --> 01:39:55,967
Hold up, hold up!

1462
01:39:55,991 --> 01:39:57,201
Ram it!

1463
01:40:57,469 --> 01:40:58,762
Gun it.

1464
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:01,807
GO, go, go! Now!

1465
01:41:17,781 --> 01:41:19,283
Alex, run!

1466
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:22,161
Omnicorp Security!
Drop your weapons!

1467
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:24,246
Drop your weapon.

1468
01:41:24,413 --> 01:41:27,207
<i>Keep your hands above your head
and no one will be harmed.</i>

1469
01:41:42,473 --> 01:41:43,599
What's going on?

1470
01:41:43,682 --> 01:41:45,934
Mrs. Murphy, I want you to
listen to me carefully.

1471
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:48,604
The organic part of
your husband Alex is dead.

1472
01:41:48,687 --> 01:41:50,814
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning,

1473
01:41:50,898 --> 01:41:51,982
and he's shooting up
the building.

1474
01:41:52,065 --> 01:41:54,860
So we've gotta get you and your
son out of here right away.

1475
01:41:55,027 --> 01:41:56,570
I gotta take this call.

1476
01:41:57,666 --> 01:41:59,507
He just left the lobby
and he's headed our way.

1477
01:41:59,531 --> 01:42:01,074
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1478
01:42:01,492 --> 01:42:04,536
Don't shoot. My robot. You just flank.
Got it.

1479
01:42:04,703 --> 01:42:05,954
Tin Man.

1480
01:42:08,707 --> 01:42:09,917
Tin Man.

1481
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:12,211
Tin Man.

1482
01:42:12,795 --> 01:42:13,962
Oh, there it is.

1483
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:16,006
You look like crap.

1484
01:42:18,634 --> 01:42:19,802
What's the matter?

1485
01:42:19,968 --> 01:42:21,178
Can't shoot?

1486
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:24,056
Huh?

1487
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:26,892
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.

1488
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:27,976
You're a robot.

1489
01:42:28,185 --> 01:42:30,395
I'm a red asset.
Wrote that myself.

1490
01:42:30,854 --> 01:42:32,147
What do you think?

1491
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:35,400
Come on, Tin Man,
just pull the trigger.

1492
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:36,568
Pull it.

1493
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:38,445
You can run.

1494
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:39,988
Go on.

1495
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:41,365
Run.

1496
01:42:41,824 --> 01:42:42,950
Run!

1497
01:42:43,283 --> 01:42:45,118
There you go. Run.

1498
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:46,912
Run.Run!

1499
01:42:50,082 --> 01:42:51,500
Whoo!

1500
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:53,710
Stings like a bitch, don't it?

1501
01:42:53,877 --> 01:42:57,172
Aren't you lucky I didn't
have my gun set to "kill"?

1502
01:42:58,423 --> 01:42:59,758
Hey, listen.

1503
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:01,802
This isn't personal.

1504
01:43:02,845 --> 01:43:04,596
Well, maybe a little.

1505
01:43:06,348 --> 01:43:08,183
I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

1506
01:43:19,621 --> 01:43:21,422
<i>Helicopter's approaching.</i>

1507
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:22,698
Mr. Sellars boards first.

1508
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:25,742
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy, you
and your son can get on first.

1509
01:43:31,164 --> 01:43:32,457
Officer down.

1510
01:43:32,541 --> 01:43:33,667
Mechanical room.

1511
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:35,335
Omnicorp Building.

1512
01:43:35,502 --> 01:43:37,382
<i>Roger that. EMS on the way.</i>

1513
01:43:39,006 --> 01:43:40,591
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

1514
01:43:40,674 --> 01:43:41,925
It's nonfatal.

1515
01:43:42,009 --> 01:43:43,594
Go. Go.

1516
01:43:44,803 --> 01:43:47,598
Omni-LZ Helo-1
on approach to deck.

1517
01:43:54,354 --> 01:43:55,355
What's that?

1518
01:43:57,274 --> 01:43:58,400
He's got a gun!
What?

1519
01:43:58,567 --> 01:43:59,568
Pull up! Pull up!

1520
01:44:04,531 --> 01:44:06,825
What the hell is he doing?
Sorry, sir. I don't know.

1521
01:44:12,372 --> 01:44:13,373
Alex?

1522
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:14,541
Dad?

1523
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:19,379
Clara, David.

1524
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,548
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1525
01:44:21,632 --> 01:44:22,633
Wait.

1526
01:44:23,717 --> 01:44:25,594
Get out of the way.
Alex, put down the gun.

1527
01:44:25,761 --> 01:44:27,846
Clara, take David
and get out of the way now!

1528
01:44:29,723 --> 01:44:31,123
Raymond Sellars,
you're under arrest

1529
01:44:31,183 --> 01:44:32,943
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1530
01:44:36,647 --> 01:44:39,149
Are you here to cuff me?
All right.

1531
01:44:39,942 --> 01:44:41,401
Go 'head, cuff me.

1532
01:44:42,611 --> 01:44:45,197
You can't. You're not
programmed that way.

1533
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,782
If you go against the program,

1534
01:44:46,865 --> 01:44:48,700
the entire system
shuts down, so.

1535
01:44:48,867 --> 01:44:50,953
You don't even have a warrant.
We'll overlook this little...

1536
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,205
Get down on the ground and put
your hands behind your back.

1537
01:44:53,372 --> 01:44:54,373
I'm just from marketing.

1538
01:44:54,539 --> 01:44:56,875
Now! Ok a)', yep, yep, yep Yep

1539
01:44:57,042 --> 01:44:59,211
Alex, we need to
work together here.

1540
01:44:59,378 --> 01:45:02,464
Because I'm the only one with the
technology to keep you alive.

1541
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:05,217
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

1542
01:45:11,348 --> 01:45:12,349
All right.

1543
01:45:12,516 --> 01:45:13,517
Weapon.

1544
01:45:15,185 --> 01:45:18,313
Alex, honestly,
I mean you no harm.

1545
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,774
If I wanted to, I could have
killed you a long time ago.

1546
01:45:20,877 --> 01:45:22,877
I just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.

1547
01:45:22,901 --> 01:45:24,736
Sellars, please! Don't!

1548
01:45:24,903 --> 01:45:27,544
I mean, if I wanted to, I could
just aim this at your little family

1549
01:45:28,782 --> 01:45:30,367
and I could just kill them too.

1550
01:45:30,492 --> 01:45:32,160
And really, there's nothing
you could do about it

1551
01:45:32,244 --> 01:45:34,246
because, let's face it,

1552
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:36,206
you're a robot.

1553
01:45:36,832 --> 01:45:38,291
Do you understand that?

1554
01:45:42,546 --> 01:45:43,547
Alex.

1555
01:45:46,717 --> 01:45:47,968
Dad!

1556
01:45:52,097 --> 01:45:53,348
Baby.

1557
01:45:58,937 --> 01:46:00,022
Hey.

1558
01:46:01,648 --> 01:46:02,649
Hey.

1559
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:05,152
Everything's gonna be all right.

1560
01:46:06,111 --> 01:46:08,363
Everything's gonna be all right.

1561
01:46:58,246 --> 01:46:59,998
How you feeling, Alex?

1562
01:47:01,917 --> 01:47:03,043
I'm ready.

1563
01:47:40,831 --> 01:47:42,207
He's ready.

1564
01:48:16,324 --> 01:48:17,492
There's still no word

1565
01:48:17,576 --> 01:48:20,579
from Omnicorp
parent company, OCP.

1566
01:48:21,496 --> 01:48:25,250
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

1567
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:28,044
rumors continue to swirl
about his condition.

1568
01:48:28,128 --> 01:48:32,674
But we have obtained exclusive
video taken by cell phone

1569
01:48:32,757 --> 01:48:35,177
that shows the people of Detroit

1570
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:37,345
may have Alex Murphy
back on the streets

1571
01:48:37,429 --> 01:48:39,014
sooner than they think.

1572
01:48:41,057 --> 01:48:42,559
The real tragedy here

1573
01:48:42,642 --> 01:48:47,439
is that our president chose
to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

1574
01:48:48,815 --> 01:48:53,570
Now, I have no doubt he was
manipulated by our biased media

1575
01:48:53,653 --> 01:48:57,115
and by whistle-blower
Dennett Norton.

1576
01:48:57,199 --> 01:49:00,952
<i>I acknowledge we know
less than we thought.</i>

1577
01:49:01,953 --> 01:49:04,873
<i>But I do believe
my research program is sound.</i>

1578
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:07,709
<i>What I did With it</i>

1579
01:49:09,211 --> 01:49:10,253
<i>was wrong.</i>

1580
01:49:10,337 --> 01:49:13,340
The fact that this
mother...

1581
01:49:13,423 --> 01:49:16,676
is not serving time
in some federal penitentiary

1582
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:20,764
is a huge, hot, heaping
pile of horse...

1583
01:49:26,519 --> 01:49:30,899
Now I know some of you may think that
this kind of thinking is dangerous

1584
01:49:30,982 --> 01:49:34,986
and these machines
violate your civil liberties.

1585

were trying to escape.

1592
01:49:59,261 --> 01:50:03,682
the greatest country
on the face of the Earth!
