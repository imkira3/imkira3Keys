00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,800
Hello. This is Cheech.
I'm not here right now.

3
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm here, but I'm not here.
I'm on my way to Amsterdam.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,300
We got invited to a Burt Reynolds
and Dolly Parton film festival.

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,700
So, I'm going to be in Amsterdam
for a little while,

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,100
so if you need me, when you hear
the beep just leave a message.

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,800
And PS, if this is Donna...

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,300
You can put that wherever
you need it, baby. Check you later.

9
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,000
Hey, where are you?
I'm at the airport.

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,600
The plane's getting ready
to leave without us. Come on!

11
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,700
- It's him!
- Here they come.

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,200
This is the first airport
I haven't been searched in.

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,300
You don't smuggle stuff into Amsterdam!

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,200
- Hello!
- Hello, hi!

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,200
Thank you very much.

16
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,000
Hello, Mr Burt Reynolds.

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,900
On behalf of the Amsterdam
lnternational Film Festival,

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,200
we heartily welcome you in Amsterdam,
Mr Burt Reynolds.

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,300
I hope you will have a very happy,
and lucky time.

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,900
Do you know if Miss Dolly Parton
was on the plane?

21
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,900
Was Dolly Parton on the plane?

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,200
I didn't see Dolly Parton.
Was she on the plane?

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,300
I have seen your movies.
You are much taller than in real life.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,500
May I say...may I say
Burt to you, Mr Reynolds?

25
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
What?

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Maybe I say Mr Burt or Mr Reynolds.
Maybe Burt. Something like that.

27
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,000
- May I say Burt to you, Mr Reynolds?
- I'm not Burt Reynolds.

28
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,200
- You are not Burt Reynolds.
- No, I'm Cheech, man.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,300
This is Chong.
We're Cheech and Chong.

30
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,700
Turn around and show him.
Cheech and Chong. See right there.

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,800
- You are here and...
- Listen, man, where's that car?

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There is a car outside waiting
for Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,500
But you can have the van if you want.

34
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,900
Go outside and there is a van there.

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,600
Please, no more autographs,
no more pictures.

36
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,800
Thank you, thank you.
It's lovely to be here.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
Take me to a dyke.
Thank you.

38
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,100
There you go.

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,300
I've got writer's cramp.
Thanks anyway.

40
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Hey, man, I think I'm going
to have to finally do it.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,400
- Do what?
- Put scars all over my face.

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,700
I'm too handsome.
This guy thinks I'm Burt Reynolds.

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,700
I've got to give the other actors a chance.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,300
I don't think you have to go
to all that trouble.

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,300
Just grow another big zit
like the one you got right there.

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,400
Where? I've got one on my nose?

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, a big yellow one.

48
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,800
- Is it big?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,100
Looks like another nose, man.

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,900
If you really want to look ugly, leave
a bogey hanging off your moustache.

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,000
- Is it off?
- And if you really want to look uglier...

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,300
Man, shut up!

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,600
Oh, you are sitting here...because...

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,300
...these places were supposed to be
for Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds.

55
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,100
Dolly Parton's supposed to be
sitting here?

56
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
Let me clear a place for her to sit down.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,900
I asked the people to put you in the van...

58
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,000
They just told us to sit here.

59
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,300
They didn't understand well.

60
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,200
You're sure that Burt Reynolds
was not on the plane?

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,000
He wasn't with us.
We flew first class.

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,700
Maybe he was sitting back
with the peasants.

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,600
- You flew first class?
- Yeah, thanks for the ticket.

64
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,200
There's a little problem.
You didn't get the telegram?

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,700
What telegram?
You said come over here and party.

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,700
You was on the list but there are
a little bit financial problems.

67
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,000
You know Mr Patrick?

68
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,600
He's the dude that phoned us up
and sent us the tickets.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,700
He's a good dude.
Met him at a party.

70
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
He's a heavy fan of ours.

71
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,800
He told us,
"Come to Amsterdam and let's party."

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,300
We've been studying up on partying.

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,700
- We got it down pretty good.
- We're ready.

74
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,600
To be honest, I asked him
to send you a telegram to cancel this trip.

75
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,200
We have a little bit of financial problems.

76
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,800
Mr Patrick, he left with all my money
and also my car.

77
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,500
So certainly he will come
back one of these days.

78
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,800
Oh, yeah. He'll come back.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,100
We'll help you out.
We'll do a show for you.

80
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,400
We haven't worked in four years.

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,700
That's OK.
I remember all the skits.

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,200
- Where's the windmills?
- Maybe you can see one on your left.

83
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,500
Where's the chocolate?

84
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,100
You haven't been before in Holland?

85
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,500
What are you doing in America?
Radio shows or something like that?

86
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,000
You ever heard of Cheech and Chong?

87
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,700
Where you been?
Under a rock?

88
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,000
We make movies.

89
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,700
I have a wonderful movie theatre
in Amsterdam.

90
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,100
We are having a press conference.

91
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,500
I want to introduce Dolly Parton
and Burt Reynolds

92
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,700
to people from Holland
and from the newspapers.

93
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Where's the party gonna be?
ls that where the party is?

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,600
Patrick said Sylvia Kristel's
gonna be at the party.

95
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,100
- Maybe she is.
- You're a Hollander.

96
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm a Hollander, yeah.

97
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,500
There are parties, but I had to cancel
some because of financial problems.

98
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Maybe we can have one party.

99
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,200
- Where can we score some hash?
- What do you mean?

100
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,800
- I've got the address of that dope cafe.
- Great.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,800
We have lots of cafes in Amsterdam.

102
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,300
With jetlag you got to smoke dope
and it comes out even.

103
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,200
...Burt Reynolds.

104
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,900
Mr Burt, welcome in Holland.

105
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Mr Dolly, Mr Burt, please follow me.

106
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,300
This is our very best,
the Saskia van Uylenburgh suite.

107
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
Rembrandt's former wife.
The best we have.

108
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,300
He we are in our very best.

109
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,000
Amsterdam at your feet.
Venice of the north.

110
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,700
Sorry.

111
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
The Rye building for the big fairs.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,300
Rijksmuseum.

113
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,900
Vincent Van Gogh museum.

114
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,400
Museum of the history of Amsterdam.

115
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,700
There are a lot of nice sights around here.

116
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,400
Many, Mr Burt, many.

117
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,500
- The Royal Palace.
- Oh, Yeah.

118
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,400
The Stedelijk museum.

119
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,000
Xaviera Hollander's house.

120
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,100
Mr Burt, I'm so fond of having you here.

121
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm your biggest fan, Mr Burt.
You can believe it.

122
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Mr Burt, I am your biggest fan.
I've seen all your pictures.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,400
Except the last one.
I haven't seen the last one.

124
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,600
Neither have l!

125
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,000
Excuse me, Mr Burt,
you got any Dutch money?

126
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,800
No, no, no. No, Mr Dolly,
you don't have to pay.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
It's free, man.

128
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,800
Yes... Uh, no.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,900
I'm sorry. It's not free.
You have to sign for it.

130
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,100
- Mr Jan... Jan...
- Godefry.

131
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,800
Mr Jan Godefry
arranged everything for you.

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
You just order and sign.

133
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,400
Just sign.

134
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,700
How is Raquel Welch in reality,
flesh to flesh?

135
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,400
- She's gonna last forever.
- Really?

136
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,100
When there's anything you need...

137
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,400
- I mean anything.
- Anything?

138
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Anything!
We have some ivory statues.

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
Oriental statues...

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,800
...from gorgeous delight
in the basement.

141
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,100
Those tiny fingers will work you up,
slowly, slowly,

142
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,300
to an excitement you've never had before.

143
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,600
- You just sign?
- Just sign.

144
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm so sorry, I have to take him.

145
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,000
1 ,001 delights.

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
Anything you wish.

147
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,800
Mr Burt, Mr Dolly.

148
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,300
Enjoy your stay in Amsterdam...
in Holland.

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,700
Sign. Anything.

150
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,700
Amsterdamski, man!

151
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,000
All right.

152
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,700
Your luggage.

153
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,900
Hey, man, just sign for it.

154
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,900
- Sign?
- Sign for it.

155
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,700
And for you.

156
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,200
- Could you get me one for the doorman?
- Of course.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you.

158
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,300
Goodbye.

159
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,800
We made it, man.

160
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,300
I wonder where the toiletskiis.

161
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,800
See the size of this bathtub.
We could have a couple of friends in.

162
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,100
Still got that little outboard motor?

163
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,000
Wow, look at this. What is this?

164
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,500
Hey, man, help!

165
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
What are you doing?

166
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,300
Hello, room service?
This is Mr Burt in the Suzi Q suite.

167
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,500
Mr Burt...

168
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,600
You know, Burt and Dolly.

169
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,300
Yeah, that Raquel Welch.
She's something.

170
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,800
No, they're real.

171
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,500
You know that caviar
you sent up today? It smells fishy.

172
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Yeah and it had all turned black.
Someone must have left it out all night.

173
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,100
Can you send up that other caviar?
Send up some of that Belgian.

174
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,300
I don't know. A pound?
No, make it five pounds.

175
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,900
Whatever you got. Send it right up.
We're really hungry.

176
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,300
OK, donkey smell.

177
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
All right, the game.
That's the new series.

178
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,300
I'm beginning to feel bored.
Let's go see the town.

179
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,100
Amsterdam.
Look at these buds.

180
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,100
Look at this.

181
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,800
They're real!

182
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,700
- Hello. Would you like to eat something?
- Yes, please.

183
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,700
- The special today is lndika.
- Oh, great.

184
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,800
- Would you like some weed tea?
- I'd love some.

185
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,200
Oh, wow, look what they got, man.

186
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,500
- Fresh buds in season with melon.
- Look here, filet au cola.

187
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,600
Here's my favourite, seed soup.
I wonder if they got pepper with that.

188
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll start with the tossed Californian
bud salad, then a shake-shake.

189
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,300
What's "Fungus Mungus"?
Never mind. Bring it to me, anyway.

190
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,900
For my main course, a Bogart special
with everything, including the mould.

191
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,000
Then I'll try the Temple Surprise, too.

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,900
Pig out, man.

193
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,200
I'll have the cream of hash
and barley soup.

194
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,600
And the fresh buds.

195
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,200
Are they in season?
Yeah, OK. And...

196
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,500
For desert, I'll have the space yoghurt
with chopped cola nuts.

197
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,500
Thank you very much.
Put the rush on it.

198
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,800
Do you feel anything?

199
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,300
I'm still hungry, man.
Want to order another one?

200
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,500
I will try to explain why the people
on the list are not coming.

201
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,400
You sit there,
and you can sit...

202
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,600
- Do you have any Aspirin?
- I've got half a lude.

203
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
My concentration is slipping.

204
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
Try to be as nice as possible.

205
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,600
I have to leave
because I have to make phone calls

206
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,500
for the plane of Miss Parton
and Mr Burton. I'll be right back.

207
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,600
Mr Cheek and Mr Wrong.

208
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,600
I don't understand something.
I've been waiting half an hour.

209
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,600
We overslept. We under slept!

210
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,300
- Who are you?
- Cheech and Chong.

211
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,300
Cheech like peach.
Chong like dong.

212
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,300
Which films
are we going to get in the festival?

213
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,800
Why don't you take this for a while?
I'm gonna take a nap.

214
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,100
Do you know when Reynolds
and Parton are coming?

215
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,200
Uh, yeah...

216
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,900
Dolly Parton's coming and Burt Reynolds
and Paul Newman.

217
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,900
Jimi Hendrix is coming and ET,
he's a personal friend of mine.

218
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,400
- Who are you?
- Cheech and Chong.

219
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,100
We're really big in the States.

220
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,500
I'm really proud to introduce
the most famous world actors,

221
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,500
Mr Cheech and Mr Chong.

222
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,500
You may begin your questions now.

223
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,400
Thank you for coming to the Netherlands.
We are awfully thrilled.

224
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,500
We can see you now in the flesh.
We can say hello to you in person.

225
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,400
My question is why did you organise
your first film festival in Amsterdam?

226
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
Because.

227
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Mr Cheech and Mr Chong, we are very
pleased to have you here and I love you.

228
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
I mean, I love all your films.

229
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,200
I've seen them all except the latest one.
There was a line outside about three miles.

230
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,200
- So I couldn't get a ticket.
- The Cheech shall arrange tickets for you.

231
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,500
- Mr Cheech.
- Yes?

232
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,900
We know you made that scar
to give all the actors a chance.

233
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,200
But you are even more handsome
with the scar on you face. It's great.

234
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,100
What can I do? I try.

235
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,900
We love you!

236
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
I owe it all to my director.

237
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,400
I owe it all to my director...

238
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,300
Wake up, it's over.
Let's get some breakfast. I'm hungry.

239
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,600
Why are you telling those things?
I asked you to be nice.

240
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,100
There were a lot of important
newspaper men from Holland.

241
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,800
And why did you tell
about Paul Newman?

242
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Who invited ET?

243
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,800
- Who invited ET?
- Do you think they still have caviar?

244
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,700
- Here you are.
- I know exactly what I want.

245
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,200
I want a big plate of "huevos rancheros"
with rice and beans, and hot dog tortillas.

246
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,600
- And a little shot of tequila.
- I don't understand.

247
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,800
- I'll have coffee and toast.
- Make that two.

248
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,800
- I'd like a "muchacha burrito".
- Do you want mussels?

249
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,600
- No, just coffee and toast.
- Are you sure? That's all?

250
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,700
Thanks a lot.

251
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,100
- Let's get thinking about our show.
- We should seriously think about it.

252
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's do a skit about parties.
Something we know.

253
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,400
We promised that dude a show.
We should start thinking about something.

254
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,200
- What do you wanna do?
- Something about movies, television.

255
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,900
I was working on a skit.
I forgot to tell you.

256
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,400
We do a take off on ET
except it's like a Chicano version.

257
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,400
It's called,
"Eddie Torres, the extra testicle".

258
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,500
It's about this horny guy
from east Outer Space.

259
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,300
He lands on earth in a flying saucer.

260
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,100
He pulls up on this chick and she hides
him in the closet, cos her parents are out.

261
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,600
And he chases her all around the house.

262
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,200
- How are we gonna do that on stage?
- I got a costume.

263
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,700
I had a guy make it up down the street.

264
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,800
ET.
Eddie Torres, the extra testicle.

265
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,200
Cool, huh?

266
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,700
Check this out for special effects.
Lets go all the way. Big budget.

267
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,500
When the chick comes around,
he chases her all over the house.

268
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,200
I guess she doesn't speak Spanish.

269
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,900
Get out of here. I've got something going.
Leave me alone.

270
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,000
Get out of here, man.
I ain't bullshitting with you...

271
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,900
- Is something wrong?
- The door's locked.

272
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,600
I'll help you.

273
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,700
I ain't bullshitting.
Get the fuck out of here.

274
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,000
Hey, open the door.

275
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,200
I'm stuck. Open the door.

276
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,300
Open the door!

277
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,200
Get me the fuck out of here, will you?
Asshole!

278
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,700
I'm OK. Don't send a ransom.
I'm all right.

279
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,300
No more, no more...

280
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,600
No more!

281
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,400
- Let's go eat.
- Let's eat at the club.

282
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,400
- Where's the club?
- This way.

283
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,500
- Where, this way?
- Follow me.

284
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Oh, hey. Donkey smell.

285
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,500
This is great Dutch entertainment -
a Czech band and American singers!

286
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,500
- Yes? What would you like to drink?
- Champagne.

287
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,900
Champagne. Bring it here
and put it on the table.

288
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:49,600
- This looks like the place we started in.
- Yeah, looks a lot like it.

289
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,500
Do you want a cigar? It's a Cuban.
You can only get them here.

290
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,800
I'd like to do our act here.

291
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,500
I'd like to do an act with that cigar girl.
An unnatural act.

292
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,900
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentleman. Merci beaucoup.

293
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,400
We are "Top Flight",
a unique American singing group.

294
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,900
If you want to see more, hang around.
We will be back with more entertainment.

295
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:44,000
The Piccadilly Night Club proudly presents,
from America, Red Dick.

296
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,400
Thank you very much.
Thanks for the clap.

297
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,300
Thanks for the introduction except
my name's Red Nick not Red Dick.

298
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,600
That guy must have been peeking
in the dressing room.

299
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,200
Thank you very much.

300
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm used to singing in the streets.
This is the first time I've been up on stage.

301
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,800
Goddamn.

302
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm so nervous you couldn't get a pin
up my ass with a jackhammer.

303
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,400
Thank y'all.

304
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,500
Oh, here's a joke for you.

305
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,700
Do you know why cowboys
have shit in their moustaches?

306
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,600
Looking for love
in all the wrong places...

307
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,700
Oh, thank you very much. Thank y'all.

308
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,300
All right.
I'd like to sing you a song now.

309
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,500
It's called "First Time I Seen Her".

310
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,500
It's an original song.
I wrote it myself.

311
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,400
Thank you very much.

312
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,300
Thank you very much.

313
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,600
It gives me great pleasure to introduce
an old buddy. He's a blues singer.

314
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,400
He's been singing with me
down in Dam Square.

315
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,300
We've been making
a lot of money together.

316
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,300
He's the world's oldest blues singer.
He's so old he farts dust.

317
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,400
He's the father of the blues.
So let's have a warm how do you do for

318
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,100
Blind Melon Chitlins.
Come on.

319
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,700
Blind Melon Chitlins.

320
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,200
Blind Melon Chitlins,
the blindest singer in the world.

321
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,500
Sit right down there.

322
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,300
There you go.
Just sit downski.

323
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Blind Melon Chitlins.

324
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,500
OK. There you go.

325
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,300
He can't see cos he's blind,
but he ain't deaf so let's have a big hand.

326
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,600
Ladies and gentlemen...

327
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
Ladies and gentlemen...

328
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,900
Ladies and gentlemen...

329
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,400
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Right now...

330
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,900
My name is Blind Melon Chitlins.

331
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,900
I'm a legend.
I'm 1 56 years old.

332
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,900
That's right. I'm 1 56 years old.
And I can still get it up.

333
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,500
I just can't get it in.

334
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,300
I want to get down with you all right now
and sing a little tune I wrote one day.

335
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,600
It's called,
"Going downtown, gonna see my girl".

336
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,200
It goes something like this.

337
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
One, two...

338
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,500
You all can dance if you want to.

339
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,300
Yeah, I want to dance a little bit now.

340
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,400
All right.

341
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,700
Blind Melon Chitlins.

342
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,700
It's a good thing these places
are open 24 hours.

343
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,500
Everything in this town's open 24 hours.

344
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,800
I waited for that bar to close
and it never closed.

345
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,500
I love Amsterdam.

346
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,500
I can't take much more of this partying.
I'm wasted.

347
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,300
I hope they got a masseuse here,
I need my back worked on. My front too.

348
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,000
- I can't see shit without my glasses.
- Come and sit next to me.

349
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,100
I thought of another skit.
Queer Worlds.

350
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,400
- Remember queer worlds?
- Yes.

351
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,200
- Fags in outer space?
- That'll be good.

352
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,000
These two faggots get ready
to go to a party, remember?

353
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,900
Queer Worlds.

354
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,400
- What shall I wear to the party tonight?
- Wear something exciting.

355
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,500
I know.
I'm going to go Peter Allen.

356
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,700
- I don't think so.
- Me neither. I'm sick of Carmen Miranda.

357
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,400
Tonight...

358
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,000
I go butch.

359
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:47,000
- Too Jackson Five.
- Yes, you're right.

360
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,400
But...

361
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,200
How about Liza?

362
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,000
Start spreading the ludes

363
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm crashing today

364
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't think so.

365
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Yes, you're right.

366
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,600
I'm so bored with everything.
We have to buy some new clothes.

367
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,100
- That's my cape, take it off.
- I'm just trying it on.

368
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,300
- Take it off.
- I'm gonna wear it tonight.

369
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,000
You always get stains on my clothes.

370
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,400
- I wanna wear it.
- I'm gonna wear it. That is my cape.

371
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,300
- I know it's your cape.
- Then take it off.

372
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,600
Have a shit fit, why don't you!

373
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,700
If I don't wear the cape, I'm not going.

374
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,500
- Then don't go.
- I won't go.

375
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,100
- There's plenty to wear.
- I said I'm not going.

376
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,600
- We have to go. We're imperial guards.
- I don't have to go anywhere.

377
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,700
- All right, I'll go by myself.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you.

378
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,700
I wonder who's going to be there.

379
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,800
You know damn well. Hans Solo.

380
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Hands so low you can hardly see
what they're doing.

381
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,900
I'm going to stay home
and pig out on chocolate.

382
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Cheer up.

383
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,300
Are you getting your period again?
That's a joke.

384
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,700
- I'm just getting so old.
- No you aren't.

385
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,800
- You can see all my wrinkles.
- Let's stay home and watch cartoons.

386
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,300
I'll make some popcorn.

387
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,100
- That's not cartoons.
- Let's watch it and see what it is.

388
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,700
Welcome to "Con Talk".

389
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,400
I'm your host, Sleepy Gonzales.

390
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,600
We're gonna rap it down to you today
to all you little locos out there,

391
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,700
on how to stay out of the slam...
and shit like that.

392
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:29,800
I did time in
Folsom, Soledad and Chino, you know?

393
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,800
And this is my guest here, man.
This dude's famous, you know?

394
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,300
His name is Joe the Hole Cole.
He did 40 years in Q in Quentin.

395
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,200
And 20 years in the hole.

396
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,100
Welcome to the show. Here's a cookie.
You don't owe me nothing.

397
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,900
- And I don't owe you nothing.
- Thanks, Speedy.

398
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,100
It's Sleepy, man.

399
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:00,100
Yeah. So...like...the topic for today
is gun control.

400
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,700
All right? OK.

401
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,500
I'm against...no I'm for.
I'm for gun control!

402
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,300
Guns can fuck you up.

403
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,900
Knives can fuck you up too.

404
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,500
Check it out.
I got stabbed 1 3 times in this arm.

405
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,800
In this arm I got...
I can't roll up that sleeve.

406
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But I'm still living.
And check this out.

407
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,500
I got shot in the side of the head.
The bullet's still in there, you know?

408
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,700
And that's why I talk slow.

409
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,000
It has nothing to do with dope.

410
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,400
So now,
Joe's gonna rap it down to you.

411
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,900
OK, man.

412
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,300
First of all, Speedy,

413
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,300
I wanna say you're full of shit.

414
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,300
You were full of shit in the joint
and you're even more full of shit now.

415
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,700
- Guys like me need guns.
- You need guns, man.

416
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,800
That's how I make my living.
I rob banks.

417
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,800
Can you see me walking into a bank
with a knife saying, "Stick 'em up!"

418
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,100
Yeah, that would be a trip.

419
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,700
Besides...

420
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,700
guns don't kill people,
cops kill people.

421
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,000
Right on, I hear you there.

422
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:34,300
The thing is, you got to be an idiot
not to know how to handle a gun.

423
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,100
The first thing you do,
you make sure the weapon is not...

424
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,800
Ah, wow, man.

425
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,700
Let it go.

426
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,500
That's all the time we got today
on Con Talk.

427
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:07,600
Join us next week when the topic
will be how to score dope in prison,

428
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,600
or how not to...go to prison.

429
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,000
Hey, man, have some coffee.

430
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,100
You all right?

431
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,000
Oh, wow, man!
Hey, you're lucky it came out.

432
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,500
Mine's still in there, man.

433
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
Hey, far out.

434
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,800
See you next week.

435
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,800
You know what we haven't done yet?
A skit on dope.

436
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,700
What we need to do
is a take off on a telethon.

437
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,500
You know like Jerry Lewis does.
Raise money for kids.

438
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,800
I know, we call it Dope-a-thon.

439
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,900
We have guest hosts.

440
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:12,000
We raise money for dopers
who lost their crops.

441
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:16,100
- You like that.
- I love it. Ooh, my God.

442
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,300
I like it...
Dope-a-thon.

443
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,900
Hey!

444
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:38,800
Welcome to Dope-a-thon '82.
I'm your host twisting the night away.

445
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:46,700
We're here for 36 hours to raise money
for dope victims all over the world.

446
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,100
Now, to introduce
what this Dope-a-thon '82 is all about

447
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,600
Iet's have a big hand for
President Ashley Roach Clip!

448
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,500
Welcome, Ashley.

449
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:07,600
Can you explain to the folks out there,
what this dope-a-thon is all about?

450
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,000
We're here because the government's
been burning our crops.

451
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,800
They're causing a dope famine
all over the world.

452
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
- Here's one of the victims of the burning.
- Isn't it cute?

453
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,200
It's a pretty sick sight.

454
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,400
We want to raise money to buy
some tanks and anti-aircraft guns.

455
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,200
Good idea.

456
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,400
We got to stop this
before it gets out of hand.

457
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,700
There's a lot of people who depend on us
for their supply of drugs.

458
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,800
This world would probably fall apart
if it wasn't for farmers like us

459
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,300
that take time to grow this shit. You know?

460
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,900
That's right. That's why we need
your money so send it.

461
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,900
- Where are you from?
- Ann Arbor, Michigan.

462
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,700
I was there in the '60s
when the universe meant something.

463
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,600
Hi guys out there in Ann Arbour
Now we're going to show you a little film.

464
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,900
The studio sent it over. It's the first trailer
for their brand new season.

465
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,400
It's "The Harder They Don't Come".
Roll the film.

466
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,400
Dope! Dope!

467
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,900
Concert come you got to have dope.

468
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,200
Hashis, brother. Come on, hashish.

469
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,400
Lebanese, home-grown Nigerian...

470
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Moroccan.

471
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,700
Dope! Hey sister,
Lebanese, Moroccan hashish. Nigerian.

472
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,500
Home-grown. Come-on sister.
I give you some special price.

473
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,000
Dope!

474
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,600
Hey, brother. You want to buy some
smoke from me? Special price.

475
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,900
Moroccan, Lebanese, Afghani
Nigerian. Home-grown.

476
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:30,100
I wandered in here by mistake.
I was just looking for a drink.

477
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,500
I sure wandered in the wrong place.

478
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,000
You don't want a drink.
You want happy smoke.

479
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,700
You call that music?
Sounds like jungle warfare.

480
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,500
- That's good reggae.
- Sounds like a bunch ofjungle music.

481
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,200
- Where you from?
- Canada.

482
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,000
Sergeant Preston.

483
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,900
Well, I make you special Canada price.

484
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,500
You buy from me Nigerian, Moroccan,
Lebanese home-grown.

485
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,400
- I'm not interested in souvenirs.
- I'm not selling souvenirs.

486
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,900
Good happy smoke for good happy music.

487
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,600
Not interested.

488
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,900
How you going to enjoy good music
without good marijuana?

489
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,200
What?

490
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,200
How you going to enjoy good music
without good marijuana?

491
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,600
Let me get this straight.
You're standing here selling marijuana?

492
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,300
Now you got it, brother. Yeah!

493
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,600
- All right, put 'em up.
- You don't have to rip me off.

494
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,600
- Police.
- You with the police?

495
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,100
I love you, brother.
I have all your albums.

496
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Goddamn mop head. Narcotics.

497
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:57,500
Now get over here. Take off that...
What the hell?

498
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:03,200
Hey, I'm American.
I'm from Detroit.

499
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,500
Get over here.
Shut up.

500
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:12,200
I'm over here in the army.
These motherfuckers don't pay shit.

501
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,900
My old lady made me do this.
She put a gun up to my head.

502
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,900
Have you ever tried arguing
with a Dutch bitch?

503
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,200
First, you got to look up to them.

504
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,800
She's been cycling all day.
You know she can kick ass.

505
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,200
All I'm doing is selling harmless smoke.

506
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,200
Harmless smoke?
Yeah, looks like harmless smoke.

507
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,400
I'm a diabetic. That's just saccharin.
You can throw it away.

508
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,200
OK, you got all my dope,
give me a break.

509
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,000
You want a break?

510
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,100
Go ahead, make a run for it.
I'll give you three. One, two...

511
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,400
It doesn't usually misfire like that.

512
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,300
It probably hit an empty chamber.
Let's try that again.

513
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,100
- Oh, please man.
- What's the matter, punk?

514
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,400
- Take that gun away from my head.
- Shut up.

515
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,900
I just got a penicillin shot, man.

516
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:29,300
- You're real smart ass, aren't you?
- No, just a sore ass. That hurt.

517
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,900
Turn around, sorry ass.
I said turn around.

518
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,800
- Hey, give me a break. Let me go.
- I told you, get going. Come on, run!

519
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,200
- Take that away from my head.
- Got no balls?

520
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,200
No balls?

521
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,400
- Come on.
- You got a big mouth, you know that?

522
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,100
- Yes, sir.
- Turn around. On your knees, big mouth.

523
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,700
- I said, on your knees, big mouth.
- Yes, sir.

524
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,600
Come on over here.
Get over here.

525
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:16,700
- You know what I want you to do?
- Oh, fuck that, man!

526
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,000
Shut up, punk.

527
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,700
I want you to start praying.

528
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,000
Pray!

529
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,400
Oh, Lord. Thanks for this
meal we are about to receive...

530
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,200
- On your feet, punk.
- Come on, man.

531
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,100
- You think God's funny?
- I wasn't making fun of God.

532
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,200
You sonofabitch...

533
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,900
All right...

534
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,900
All right, give me the gun.
Come on, give me the gun.

535
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:08,200
You're in enough trouble already.
Don't make it worse.

536
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,500
You're high on drugs, I can see that.
Listen, son, don't make it worse.

537
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,500
I tell you what.
Give me the gun, you can go.

538
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,700
Don't do that.
That's got a hair trigger.

539
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:27,900
It could go off at any time.
I got a wife and kid.

540
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,600
How would you like a new asshole too?

541
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,100
Don't do that, please.
I'm not even a cop, OK.

542
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:42,500
I'm a security guard at Woolworth's.
I'm on vacation for Christ's sake.

543
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,200
Don't do that. Please.

544
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,900
Hey, I like you people, honest to God.
I really do.

545
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,900
- Get down on your knees.
- Yes, sir.

546
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,800
You know what I want you to do,
don't you?

547
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And it ain't praying, cop.

548
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,700
We're back. Dope-a-thon '82
and we're still rolling.

549
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,600
Keep that phone line hot.
We need your money and your pledges.

550
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,700
We have a very special guest
who's dropped by the studio.

551
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:33,300
Let's welcome three-time US Open
lnternational Masturbation Champion,

552
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,200
Hairy Palms.

553
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,100
Hairy Palms,
give him a big, warm welcome.

554
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:47,300
Hairy, glad to have you on the show.
Fantastic. Nice of you to come by.

555
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,500
That's quite a grip you have there, Hairy.

556
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,900
You're a graduate of St Agnes All Boys
Catholic High School, right?

557
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,800
And you've just come back from Russia

558
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,700
where you competed
in the Giant Jerk World Championships.

559
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,700
And you came in first and third this year.

560
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,700
Fantastic. Whoo!
Get a hold of yourself, we're on TV.

561
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,000
Hmm, good for the skin.

562
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,800
So, anyway, you've been an innovator
in the field of thumpology.

563
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You've introduced "speed shifting",
"around the hump" the "white knuckler",

564
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,300
and this year you introduced
a brand new hold. What is it?

565
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,800
I just grab it in both hands
and beat it against my forehead.

566
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,100
Fantastic.
That's using your head.

567
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:50,700
- Where do you go from here?
- Back to the hotel room to practise.

568
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,800
Always practising.
What's your next competition?

569
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,100
Next, I go to Hong Kong
for the Fist Fury Tournament.

570
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:04,800
Good luck, cos we know you'll be
in there pulling for us. Hairy Palms.

571
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,500
You know what
we haven't done for years?

572
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,800
Remember Bruno Hakalugi,
the ltalian wrestler?

573
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,700
Remember where Bruno
meets the lnvisible Man?

574
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
Why don't we do it
where you play the samurai warrior?

575
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:25,700
I'll be Bruno Hakalugi,
and we'll do the wrestling skit.

576
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,700
I used to love that skit.

577
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:38,300
Welcome to championship wrestling.
I'm your host, Jerry Dumphy.

578
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,600
With me tonight is three-time World
Heavyweight Champion, Mike McGraw.

579
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:46,800
- Welcome to the show, lron Mike.
- Thank you, Jerry.

580
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,400
We have an excellent card on top for you
tonight between the ltalian Bruno Hakalugi

581
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,700
and his team partner,
Japanese ltchy Scratchy.

582
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:05,000
- How do the boys look for you, lron Mike?
- The ltalian looks pretty good.

583
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,300
The Jap looks good.
They both look good.

584
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,700
Their opponent tonight is none other than
the world famous champion from nowhere.

585
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,500
The lnvisible Man.
What do you think of him, lron Mike?

586
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,700
Well, I haven't seen
too much of him lately. In fact, no one has.

587
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,700
Cos he's invisible.
But I think it's going to be a good match.

588
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,800
Hakalugi and ltchy Scratchy
are certainly showing him no respect.

589
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,800
They're not showing him
any respect at all.

590
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,400
But I don't think the lnvisible Man
is scared of them either.

591
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:46,200
They're deciding who is going
to go in the ring first.

592
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Yeah, they're deciding
who is going to go in the ring first.

593
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,300
They're having quite a discussion.
I can't understand what they're saying.

594
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,300
The lnvisible Man is ready.

595
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,900
I think it's going to be the ltalian.

596
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,000
There goes the bell.
Here we go.

597
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:18,100
It's no holds barred Texas-rules, no
referee and no pay cheque for the loser.

598
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,600
And he gets hits
by a shot out of nowhere.

599
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:27,100
And another shot out of nowhere.
He's down already. Quite a mess.

600
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,800
- Looks like the ltalian's in trouble.
- Got him in a lock.

601
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:56,100
And now he's got the Japanese guy.
Itchy Scratchy into the ring.

602
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,100
He's looking around.
Looking for a sneak attack.

603
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,900
And he's hit his rim.
And another rim shot.

604
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,700
That's illegal, but there's no referee
so it doesn't matter.

605
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,200
He bit him. That's good wrestling.
Biting is allowed.

606
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
Another rim shot.

607
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,800
Here comes Bruno Hakalugi
into the ring. What is he doing?

608
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,000
He's probably digging for crabs.

609
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:59,800
He's eating garlic.
He's going to give him a garlic blowjob.

610
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,600
The Japanese is down.
And now the knee drop!

611
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,000
And into the corner.
Hard to get out this.

612
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,800
- That's pretty tough on the back.
- That's right, lron Mike.

613
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,900
- Look at that one.
- He's got him in the "got ya".

614
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:35,400
He's got his hands full now.
He's really stretching.

615
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,500
He's slipped out.
Must be the grease on his hands.

616
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,300
And he gives him another stretch.
And another stretch.

617
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:50,800
And over his shoulder for the Volga
boatman, marching to Moscow.

618
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,400
He's down now.
Couldn't see where he was going.

619
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,700
- You can't see invisible balls.
- That's right.

620
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:37,700
- He's got him in the bass, man!
- That's not orthodox wrestling.

621
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:44,200
He we go into double Dutch.
Listen to them hit the ground.

622
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,400
I'd say the lnvisible Man's
in a lot of trouble.

623
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:57,400
- He looks pretty tied up.
- I bet he can get out of it.

624
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:04,800
Hakalugi is going to make
a four-corner run.

625
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:11,500
That really hurts, let me tell you.
It happened to me once.

626
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:21,100
Hakalugi is down. Itchy Scratchy too.
And the lnvisible Man wins.

627
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,900
Those balls are pretty dangerous
when they're flapping around.

628
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,800
Hey, Cheech!

629
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
How can you stay in there that long?

630
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,100
You know one skit we got to do?
Alice Bowie in a sex club.

631
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,700
I am absolutely ruined.

632
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:43,700
I just got a phone call.
Burt Reynolds is definitely not coming.

633
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:49,800
He is in Florida.
And Miss Dolly Parton is in hospital.

634
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,400
They're not coming?
Definite, for sure?

635
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,200
- They phoned me.
- That's too bad.

636
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,200
That's OK.
Who needs Burt Reynolds?

637
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:08,900
We're here. What have you got
to worry about? We'll do a great show.

638
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,800
Don't worry about Burt Reynolds
or Dolly Parton.

639
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,500
I lost my reputation.
I have no money.

640
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:21,100
- Who needs material possessions?
- Real tears.

641
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,700
Hey, man. Come on.
Take it easy.

642
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,100
Dry your eyes, man.
I hate to see a grown man cry.

643
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:35,200
Take it easy. All this worry about money
will make you grow old before your time.

644
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,000
I cannot go round in Amsterdam now.

645
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:44,200
Don't worry. We're gonna do a great show.
People will be screaming and cheering.

646
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,200
It'll be all right, man.

647
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:52,000
Stop him, he's gonna jump!
Stop him... I gotta reload.

648
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,800
Hey! Come on. Let go.

649
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,900
Let go. Come on, man.

650
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,700
OK. Let him go.

651
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,200
Look how far down it is.

652
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,000
You don't want to jump.

653
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,500
Come on. You'll end up like spaghetti.
We'll have to scrape you up.

654
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,500
You've got nothing to worry about.

655
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:25,100
My son is nine.
My daughter is only...

656
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:30,400
Steven Spielberg is a personal friend
of mine. I'll give him a call.

657
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,200
We have lunch at "I Love Sushi"
in Malibu all the time.

658
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,400
We'll have ET over here.
You'll be a big success. Don't worry.

659
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,600
Have a watch.
That looks good on you.

660
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,200
- That looks slick.
- You want to give me your watch?

661
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,500
Here's one for your old lady too.
She likes that?

662
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,500
That's for my mother?

663
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,000
I really appreciate it.

664
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,900
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about nothing.

665
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:05,200
Just show up at the theatre. You'll see
something you never saw before.

666
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,500
It'll be great.
Don't worry about nothing.

667
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:14,500
- But I have to think of my reputation.
- Don't worry about that.

668
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,800
- It'll be cool in Amsterdam.
- Thank you for the watches.

669
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:24,300
Don't worry. Everything will be cool.
Go home and take a lude or something.

670
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,700
- We'll see you at the theatre.
- Thank you.

671
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,500
Oh, wow. That's a good-looking watch.

672
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,000
Thanks a lot.
All right. Look at that sucker.

673
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,300
Is this too much?

674
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:55,900
'Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton.'

675
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,600
I think there's been a mistake.

676
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:23,000
We're not Burt and Dolly...
We're Cheech and Chong.

677
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,800
We're gonna do a show for you anyway.
And...

678
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:36,100
We want to start off with a dude
who had his arm blown off during the war.

679
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:41,400
He's real sensitive about it too.
You know, about his arm.

680
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:47,900
So let's give him a nice hand.
Let's hear it for Limey Bitters.

681
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,400
See his arm?

682
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,800
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

683
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,500
It's a great pleasure to be here tonight.

684
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,000
I'd like to perform
for you all an unnatural act.

685
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,400
Hello.

686
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,500
Listen, man.
Turn those mikes down.

687
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,600
Can't you hear them?
They're feeding back.

688
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,000
Turn 'em down.

689
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,300
And don't black out.
Don't black out till we tell you to.

690
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,500
Don't mess with anything.
Just leave it as they are.

691
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:43,600
Don't tell all those things.
There are a lot of important people.

692
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,100
They even expect the queen will come.
All the people from the secret service...

693
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:52,500
Don't use the word "bums",
don't use those languages.

694
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,000
I know what a lot of you people out
there are thinking.

695
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,800
Just what kind of act will this be?

696
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,100
Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen.

697
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,200
The act of which I speak...

698
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:22,400
is that l...am the only person
in the world

699
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,300
who can play the trumpet...out his nose.

700
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,200
That's right.
And not only that.

701
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,200
I will make this trumpet
sound like a slide-trombone.

702
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,000
I would like to play a tune called,

703
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:49,000
"Nobody knows about me cares
and nobody cares about me nose".

704
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:55,300
Out me nose...or proboscis.

705
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,800
Thank you very much.
Here we go.

706
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,300
Had a bit of a greenie stuck there.

707
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,000
All right.

708
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:02,600
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
- Limey Bitters.

709
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,300
He's a great talent.

710
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,600
A lot of people think we come here
just for the drugs but that's true.

711
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,600
It's nice here. I don't think
you can smoke so light up.

712
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,300
Ladies and gentlemen.
The astronaut.

713
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,000
Ten...nine...eight...
seven...

714
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:13,600
six...five...four...three...

715
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,100
two...one...zero!

716
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,100
Donkey smell.
Dams and herrings.

717
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:58,100
Right now, we'd like to take you
to Vondel Park.

718
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:04,000
Look at all these goddamn pigeons.

719
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:11,400
Come here, chick, chick, chick...
I got some popcorn for you.

720
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:18,400
There you go.
Look at that little guy.

721
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:50,900
I don't want to get personal,
but did you shit your pants?

722
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:56,100
- What?
- Did you shit your pants?

723
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:06,400
- Yeah, I shit my pants.
- Why the hell don't you change them?

724
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:11,600
I ain't done yet.
I still got another week.

725
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,700
- I like you. You're cool.
- Get your goddamn hands off me.

726
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:26,300
What's that, old man's talk?

727
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,900
You should have a lot more respect
for me than that.

728
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,500
For all you know,
I could be your daddy.

729
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:43,300
- You could be my daddy?
- Sure, I used to fuck buffaloes.

730
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:01,500
You look just like your mama too.
You know that?

731
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,800
Don't say nothing about my mama.

732
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,100
You wanna play games, funny bunny?

733
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,100
Old man with the cane,
wanna play games?

734
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,700
How about race car driver?

735
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:23,300
By Jesus! You take off,
or I'll kick you in the balls.

736
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,100
You gonna kick me in the balls?

737
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,100
Go ahead.

738
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,200
Come on.
Free shot. Come on.

739
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:44,700
You sure don't give a guy
much of a target, do you?

740
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,900
- That does it. I'm gonna kill you.
- You sonofabitch!

741
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:59,000
- You think I'm scared of you?
- I'll do it with a chair.

742
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,300
Oh, Jesus... Oh, God.

743
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,200
What're you doing?
Come on. Let's go.

744
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,000
I'm gonna take your wallet.

745
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,700
Come on, man. Let's go.

746
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,700
Hey!

747
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,300
Hey.

748
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,100
Quit fucking around, man.

749
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,600
Hey, dude.

750
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,200
OK, I'm sorry.

751
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,700
What are you doing?

752
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,300
I didn't even touch him!

753
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,300
I was only playing with you, man.

754
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,800
Hey, I'm on parole.

755
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,900
Shit.

756
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,000
Hey, come on, man.

757
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,200
I said I was sorry.

758
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,200
Hey, dude.

759
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,200
Hey, old dude.

760
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Oh, shit. Goddamn, man.

761
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,100
I'm sorry.

762
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,700
Scared the shit out of you
that time, didn't l?

763
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,900
Margaret, where the hell are you?

764
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,200
Come on out of that goddamn toilet
and get over here.

765
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,600
We're gonna see a real live sex act.

766
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,500
Right on that goddamn stage.
I've never seen a live sex act for 12 years.

767
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,200
It cost me a bundle that time too.

768
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:37,000
Margaret, what the hell are you doing
in that toilet? Scuba diving?

769
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:44,200
Come on out here for Christ's sake.
You might learn something.

770
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,200
Never mind all the assholes.
Come on.

771
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,600
Where you been?
You don't want to watch? Sit down.

772
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,200
I took that goddamn boat tour, didn't l?

773
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:04,000
If I see another goddamn windmill,
I'll puke!

774
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:11,200
Come on we're gonna see a live goddamn
sex act. Sit your ass down and shut up.

775
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:17,200
We been here 12 goddamn days
and this is the first bit of excitement.

776
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,900
What's the matter with you?
There's nothing on that goddamn seat.

777
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,100
What the hell is that anyway?
It feels like Silly Putty.

778
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:41,800
Must be some kid in the balcony.
Sit down for Christ's sake.

779
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,800
Let's get this show on the road.
What are you waiting for?

780
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:51,400
Christ, a live damn sex act.
Christ, I hope that's not the star.

781
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:57,800
Holy Jesus! She's so old,
she's got stretch marks on her mouth.

782
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,700
She looks like your goddamn sister, Ethel.

783
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,500
- That is goddamn Ethel.
- That is not.

784
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:13,000
- Hey, Ethel. Over here.
- Will you be quiet?

785
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,300
She's trying to ignore us.
She's taken off her clothes.

786
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,200
- Nope, that ain't Ethel.
- I told you it wasn't Ethel.

787
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,800
I don't think it's Ethel.

788
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:35,800
Holy Christ, lady, put it back on.
You'll scare someone with that body.

789
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:42,200
Look at her tits.
Look like oranges in a pair of socks.

790
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,500
Look out, you're gonna trip on them.

791
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,400
Christ all mighty.

792
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:56,400
Why doesn't she take off her panties?
Oh, she's got 'em off.

793
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,100
What the hell kind of haircut is that?

794
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,300
Looks like someone's initials.

795
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,300
Now she's showing it to us.

796
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,900
Hey, I don't wanna see it that close.

797
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,600
Looks like the Holland Tunnel.

798
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:29,500
Look, it's doing impressions.

799
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:36,000
Margaret, look.
There's a devilled egg sandwich.

800
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:42,300
That's goddamn funny.
Sit down.

801
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,800
What the hell's she gonna do
with that Coke bottle?

802
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,000
Holy Jesus!

803
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:57,500
You don't suppose
she's got an opener up there, do you?

804
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:08,000
The goddamn bottle disappeared.
No deposit, I guess.

805
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,200
There it is.
Look at that pop out of there.

806
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,500
She shot that bottle clear across the room.

807
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,000
And it's open. Margaret, look!

808
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,800
There's a goddamn Houdini up there.

809
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,600
What's she gonna do
with those grapes now?

810
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,800
No, she... Holy Jesus!

811
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,200
She's stuffing 'em...
Oh, for Christ's sake, lady.

812
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,100
Why don't you get a purse or something?

813
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,100
Goddamn Pack Wrap.
Look at that!

814
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,700
What are you saving them for?
What the hell you doing?

815
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,900
How's she gonna get them out of there?

816
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Here they come!

817
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,900
Like a goddamn jackpot.
Look at that!

818
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,800
Margaret, look at that.

819
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,800
Oh, no. She's eating them.

820
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,000
If you're that hungry,
I'll buy you a hamburger.

821
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,800
What's the matter?
Are you getting sick? You OK?

822
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,500
Put your head between your legs.

823
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,300
That might make you sicker.
Sit up here.

824
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,100
Sit down.

825
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,400
Don't look if it's gonna make you sick.

826
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,500
Hey, Margaret, look.

827
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:51,300
They brought in a goddamn dog.
Look at the size of that sonofabitch!

828
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:56,600
I bet that's the dog that's been shittin'
all over Amsterdam.

829
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,200
Holy Jesus.

830
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:09,900
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to present
the dogs, Ralph and Herbie.

831
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:52,000
- Herbie!
- How the hell are you?

832
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:05,100
- You're looking good.
- I hardly recognised you!

833
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:10,600
I got a new haircut. It's a punk cut.
It's red and orange and green and yellow.

834
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,900
- I like that.
- And brown in the centre.

835
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,200
Where you been?
I haven't seen you for so long.

836
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,200
- My human's been keeping me locked up.
- Really?

837
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,500
He went off on vacation to London.
He left me in the room for two weeks.

838
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,800
That's OK.
I shit in his earphones.

839
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:37,100
I ate all his stash too.

840
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:44,100
- Want to chase some cats?
- I could use a little pussy about now.

841
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,100
Smell that?

842
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,900
It's Fifi.

843
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,600
She gets me so horny,
I could pole vault.

844
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:05,400
Every time I smell her, I go nuts.

845
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,300
Hey!

846
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,700
Knock it off, Ralph.

847
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:22,000
- I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.
- Yeah? Well, I know what got into me!

848
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,200
Just stay in front of me.

849
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,300
- Go ahead. Get me back.
- Get out of here.

850
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,900
You been locked up too long, haven't you!

851
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:40,900
Let's go down and chase some Fifi.
Come on, I'm horny.

852
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,700
- I gotta go poop.
- What? Right now?

853
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,300
Well, you hit a nerve or something.

854
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:53,500
- Shit. Let's pick out a good spot for it.
- Oh, God. I can't wait.

855
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,400
Do it right here.

856
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,900
- But we're in the middle of the restaurant.
- Even better.

857
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,100
I'll watch out for the waiter.

858
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:36,400
Herbie, here it comes!
It's gonna be a big one.

859
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,300
Open wide.

860
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,900
Look at the size of that mother.

861
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:51,000
- Did I do that?
- What do you want to name it?

862
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,000
It's still smokin'.

863
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,200
I love where you put it too.

864
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:01,200
The waiter's gonna skid
all the way to the kitchen!

865
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:07,200
Thank you very much.
It's been a pleasure playing for you.
