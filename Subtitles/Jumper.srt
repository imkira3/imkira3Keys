00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:44,774
[Man Narrating]
Let me tell you about my day so far:

2
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,278
Took a little nap
on Mount Kilimanjaro:

3
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,281
Oh, yeah, and I got digits
from this Polish chick in Rio:

4
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:54,283
And then I jumped back: : :

5
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:57,013
For the final quarter of the N: B: A: Finals-
courtside, of course:

6
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,021
And all that was before lunch:

7
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,023
I could go on,
but all I'm saying is: : :

8
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,093
I'm standing on top of the world:

9
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:08,464
The lighter terrain here-

10
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:11,296
[Man Narrating]
It wasn't always like this:

11
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:15,429
Once I was a normal person,
a chump just like you:

12
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:20,677
- Hey, Millie.
- Oh, hey, David.

13
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:26,340
You got a lot of cities there.

14
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:29,420
Well, if you're gonna have a dream,
might as well dream big, right?

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,420
- Right:
- [Bell Ringing]

16
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:33,422
See you later.

17
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:45,100
Hey, Millie.

18
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:49,165
Give me a sec.
Hey.

19
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,205
I wanted to give you this.
I picked it up at a yard sale in Plymouth.

20
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:58,282
L-I thought you'd really like it.

21
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:06,685
It's a little dinged up
and it's missing a few steps, but-

22
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,589
I love it.

23
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:13,220
- You do?
- I do.

24
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:14,855
[Boy]
Holy crap, Rice Bowll

25
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:17,799
- Mark.
- Hey, what's this?

26
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:19,802
- Christmas come early?
- Mark, stop it.

27
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:22,031
- Mark, give it back to her.
- Holy crapl

28
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,132
Look what David got Millie!
You guys like the Eiffel Tower?

29
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:28,872
Wow, if you shake this thing hard enough,
you can hear the Eiffel Tower move.

30
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,279
- Hey, who wants to give it a shake?
- Okay, that's enough!

31
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:34,749
- Stop it. Just give it back.
- All right.

32
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,820
Okay, I'm sorry.
Here.

33
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:46,592
Sorry, buddy.
Guess I don't know my own strength.

34
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:51,731
- I can't believe you're such a jerk!
- I was just playing around.

35
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:54,896
- It wasn't funny:
- [Chuckles] They thought it was pretty funny.

36
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:58,032
[Millie]
David?

37
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,838
David, don't go out there.
It's not safe.

38
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,845
David, just forget about it.

39
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:05,279
Come on, Rice Bowl!
Don't be stupid!

40
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:08,716
David, come back. Come on.
Just let it go. It's okay!

41
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:13,220
Stopl It's not worth it:
Just come back: Rlease?

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,121
Come on, David!

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,530
[Millie]
Be careful: Come on:

44
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:23,964
- All good. See?
- [Mark] Great: Now come back:

45
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:29,871
- David!
- Millie, don't go out there!

46
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:34,377
[Millie, Muffled]
Davidl Davidl Somebody-

47
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:37,879
- [Groaning, Muffled]
- [Millie] Oh, my Godl

48
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:41,042
- David- Get help!
- Millie, get back here!

49
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:44,019
[Millie]
Rlease helpl Davidl

50
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:46,851
- Call 911 I Davidl
- You can't help him!

51
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,687
- Millie, stop, stop, stopl
- Davidl

52
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,018
[David Narrating]
And that's how it happened the first time:

53
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:19,749
One second I'm a goner, and the next thing
I know I'm at the Ann Arbor Rublic Library:

54
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,365
Home, sweet home:

55
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:40,069
Mom left when I was five:

56
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:44,136
As for Dad, well, let's just say
he wasn't much of one:

57
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:51,553
You're late:
Supper's cold:

58
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,821
Where you been, anyway?

59
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,932
You know, when I ask a question,
I expect an answer. Okay?

60
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,195
Hey, hey, hey.
What happened to you?

61
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:09,271
Just kids at school.

62
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:14,106
Hey, David, get back down here,
get a mop and clean this crap up!

63
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:16,111
Davidl

64
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:18,306
Don't make me come up therel

65
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,907
David?
Make the right choicel

66
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:24,112
- [Door Rattling]
- David! David.

67
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,280
Open the door.

68
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,377
Did I just teleport?

69
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:56,286
Great.

70
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:59,820
I teleported to the library.

71
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,154
Look-No, no, no: I'm not going anywhere:
I don't care what you say:

72
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:36,954
[David Narrating]
And that's when it occurred to me:

73
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:40,519
This thing that just happened,
it could set me free:

74
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,409
And if she could run away,
so could l:

75
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,382
You're okay.

76
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,818
[David Narrating]
I wanted to tell her everything:

77
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:46,897
David?

78
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,232
David?

79
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,962
[David Narrating]
I mean, who would have believed me anyway?

80
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:55,002
[Millie]
Davidl

81
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:58,074
[David Narrating]
I figured it was time to move on:

82
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,203
Uh, I'd like a room.

83
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:29,636
You're not gonna be any trouble,
are you? No weird stuff?

84
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,437
Nope.
No weird stuff.

85
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,363
[David Narrating]
And so there I was:

86
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:58,128
I had a million questions,
like how does this thing work?

87
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:00,203
How do I control it?

88
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,377
Been there.

89
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:52,455
[David] Mommy, you can see
the ocean and everythingl

90
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:55,116
If we're lucky,
maybe we'll see King Kong.

91
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:57,125
- Really?
- [Laughs]

92
00:09:57,227 --> 00:10:00,663
- You got me?
- Oh, I got you. I'm not letting you go.

93
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:27,686
[David Narrating]
I was 15:

94
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,318
Come on:
What would you have done?

95
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:34,397
I figured I'd pay it back someday:

96
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,339
Is there a bathroom for customers?

97
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,681
Hey.
It's this way.

98
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:58,755
Yeah.

99
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:01,857
Make it quick.

100
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,086
No problem.
Thanks.

101
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,996
I'm gonna need a bigger bag.

102
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,668
Holy shit.

103
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,737
Whoo!

104
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,874
- Hey!
- ##[Continues]

105
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:30,436
I said no weird stuff.
Let's go- two days' rent. You owe me rent.

106
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,447
- [Knocks]
- Hello? Hello?

107
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,268
The police and the F.B.I.
Have already been through here.

108
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,895
- Who are you with?
- N.S.A.

109
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:58,406
They couldn't make
heads or tails of it:

110
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,910
The vault has a time lock,
pressure mounts, steel plates.

111
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:03,912
- This guy didn't open a door.
- Open a door?

112
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,915
We didn't know we were robbed
until halfway through the day.

113
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,383
I want the security tapes
for the whole month.

114
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:13,388
And I need the name of everyone who has
a safety deposit box in that vault.

115
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,482
That's confiidential.
Why do you need those names?

116
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:19,994
Whoever robbed your vault
has been in it before.

117
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:23,157
Now, I want those names,
and I want those tapes.

118
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,167
Today.

119
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:44,615
[David Narrating]
So the story had a happy ending:

120
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:48,418
Rice Bowl was dead,
but I had never been more alive:

121
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,927
So now I'm living in New York:

122
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,429
[Chuckles]
But why settle in one place: : :

123
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:56,829
When you can have the whole world?

124
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,551
[Announcer]
She floats into the river.

125
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:26,151
But as you can see, this flood became
more severe about 10 minutes ago.

126
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:29,391
The question now, Pat, is,
what will happen to these people?

127
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:31,592
It would take a miracle
to get to them:

128
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:59,921
Good afternoon, Mr: Jones:

129
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:03,761
- How they doin'?
- Down by six at the half.

130
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,768
Don't think you'll be
needing that umbrella.

131
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,100
You never know.

132
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:56,184
- [Man] Watch itl
- [David] You mind if I join you?

133
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,914
- [Woman] No:
- What are you drinking?

134
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,751
Gin and tonic.

135
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:05,191
Uh, Tanqueray and tonic.
Two of'em, please.

136
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:12,057
So, you live in London?

137
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:16,796
- Taxi!
- #So what the hell are you here for #

138
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:42,598
[Whispers]
Shit.

139
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,179
Dude, this totally sucks.

140
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:00,715
Hey, I thought this was where the storm
was supposed to hit.

141
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:03,479
- I heard it hit Fiji.
- Fiji, huh?

142
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:06,351
Yeah. They got,
like, 30-foot swells.

143
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:08,117
Really?

144
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:11,279
Let's go.

145
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:21,622
? Ror que?
? Ror que? Why?

146
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:25,428
Because you are an abomination.

147
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:31,632
Only God should have the power...

148
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,505
to be all places at all times.

149
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:57,800
One less of you to worry about.

150
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,865
Cut him down!

151
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:05,601
Let's get the hell out of here.

152
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,904
- [Rhone Rings]
- Yeah?

153
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:10,912
We have a lead on the bank, sir.

154
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:13,539
I'll be on the next plane.

155
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,323
Hey, Angelo.
How'd they do?

00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,904
You're just another suit.
You're never gonna believe me.

314
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:36,818
It says here you were
beamed into the vault.

315
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:45,191
You wanna laugh about it?
Go ahead. Have a laugh.

316
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:49,395
You hear me laughing?

317
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,900
The girl's name is Millie Harris.

318
00:32:53,002 --> 00:32:57,462
She boarded a plane to Rome 16 hours ago,
and she didn't go alone.

319
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:15,389
So, what do you think?

320
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:23,958
I think there's something
you're not telling me.

321
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:28,963
What do you mean?

322
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:32,039
This room.

323
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:34,109
First class.

324
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,878
Usually in my life,
when things seem too good to be true: : :

325
00:33:38,981 --> 00:33:40,881
It's because they are.

326
00:33:40,983 --> 00:33:43,952
- I told you, I'm in banki-
- Banking?

327
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:50,757
See, I know
that you flunked algebra.

328
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,626
If you don't wanna
tell me everything, that's fine:

329
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:58,556
But just don't lie to me.

330
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:02,269
I'm not lying to you.

331
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:04,339
No?

332
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:14,249
Good.

333
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:32,734
Can't... reach it.

334
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,647
I could eat.

335
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:27,882
- ##[Continues]
- You know, you could've just
asked me out on a date.

336
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:41,465
- Grazie:
- # This head spins around #

337
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:55,079
- ##[Continues]
- You know, this has always been
number one on my list.

338
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:57,084
I know.

339
00:35:57,186 --> 00:36:00,314
You must be pretty good
at this, huh?

340
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:03,391
Good at what?

341
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,900
- #Baby #
- Rookie.

342
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:17,598
- #Oh-ohh, ohh-ohh ##
- No idea.

343
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:22,443
- W-W-W-W-Wait!
- Sorry, sir.

344
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:25,446
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. No. No. It's impossible.
- What?

345
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:29,575
- It's closed.
- What do you mean, it's closed? How is it closed?

346
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:33,553
- We just wanna go inside there.
- No, it's impossible. No, no.

347
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:36,284
- It's the Colosseum. How is it closed?
- It's impossible.

348
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:40,385
David, it's okay: I got to see it from outside:
That's good enough:

349
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:44,364
- You know, she came all this way to go inside.
- Hey, come on.

350
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:46,400
Sorry, he's- I don't know.

351
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:48,470
- Ciao:
- Bye.

352
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:55,809
Milliel

353
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:57,970
- Come on:
- What?

354
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,105
Come on.
How about a private tour?

355
00:37:00,216 --> 00:37:03,276
It's closed. We can't
break into the Colosseum.

356
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:06,843
Who said it's closed?
The door was open.

357
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:08,924
Wanna see the Colosseum or not?

358
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:13,161
Come on.

359
00:37:13,262 --> 00:37:15,730
We so should not be doing this.

360
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:42,224
[Millie]
This place is amazing:

361
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:44,315
[David]
I wanted you to see this:

362
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:47,224
You've gotta admit,
it's worth the risk.

363
00:37:48,264 --> 00:37:50,232
Yeah.

364
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:58,639
- [Laughing] It's so cool!
- It is.

365
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:08,810
Down here is where they used to keep
the gladiators and the lions in cages?

366
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:12,478
- We should go down there.
- Can't go down there. It's off-limits.

367
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:15,182
- Even when it's open.
- Nothing's off-limits.

368
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,054
What?

369
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,559
Psst! Millie!

370
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:29,498
Did that door just open too?

371
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:31,539
- It's open now.
- Yeah.

372
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,406
You're gonna want to see this.
Trust me.

373
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,093
Bet you that's worth something:

374
00:38:52,194 --> 00:38:54,492
[Laughs]
Maybe:

375
00:39:04,473 --> 00:39:06,600
I think he's telling you
do not enter.

376
00:39:08,177 --> 00:39:10,805
You speak Italian?

377
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,813
No.

378
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:14,815
- Well, uh, I'ingresso: : :
- Uh-huh?

379
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,817
Means "come on in."

380
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:20,150
Oh! I thought it meant "bullshit."

381
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:23,156
Well, no, that means that you should
stay here while I go around...

382
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:25,658
and open it from the other side.

383
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:27,661
It's all right.
You'll catch on.

384
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:29,731
Mmm.

385
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:44,938
Thank you very much.
Next showing will be at 6:00.

386
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:48,107
Don't forget to tip your usher.

387
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:51,849
- Oh, uh-
- Uh, do you mind, man?

388
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:54,514
- Whoa!
- Just a little privacy, eh?

389
00:39:54,623 --> 00:39:56,181
- Sorry, man.
- Big Colosseum: Guy peein'?

390
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:59,749
This isn't a fashion show.
I'm taking a piss. Do you mind?

391
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:03,590
Place is all yours.

392
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:11,934
Wouldn't open that door if I were you,
not if I wanted my girlfriend to keep breathing.

393
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,601
What are you gonna do anyway?
Bring her down, have a nice, romantic picnic?

394
00:40:15,711 --> 00:40:18,612
Nice little tea party?
Is that what you think is gonna happen?

395
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:21,478
- If you so much as look at her wrong-
- You gonna jump me? Where?

396
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:26,788
Did you think you were the only one?

397
00:40:28,323 --> 00:40:30,382
You really have no idea, do you?

398
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:32,392
You lead the life you live.

399
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:35,327
You think you can just go on a little
Roman holiday and they wouldn't notice?

400
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,331
Just jump
all over the place-

401
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,333
jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump-

402
00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:41,403
and nothing's gonna happen?

403
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:45,171
Well, they've noticed.

404
00:40:45,274 --> 00:40:46,901
Not me.

405
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,671
I mean I already knew.
I'm not talking about me, but them.

406
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:51,746
Down there.

407
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:57,085
Hello, boys.

Welcome to the war.

411
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,355
Just let me know if you guys
are gettin' tired.

- What's going on?

414
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:53,199
Great. Let's meet
the girlfriend, shall we?

415
00:41:53,308 --> 00:41:55,367
No.

00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:27,571
Wait!

422
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:36,809
I just came through your jump scar.

423
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:39,820
What do you think
you're doing here? Huh?

424
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:42,322
If I were you, I'd jump right back.

425
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:45,154
You're not supposed to see
all this stuff. Get out!

426
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:51,928
So if you'd like to
kindly fuck off, as in now.

427
00:42:52,034 --> 00:42:54,468
Maybe your girlfriend's still alive.

428
00:42:57,673 --> 00:42:59,368
- Hey.
- Hey.

429

- What happened to you?
- Uh, nothing.

430
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:06,273
Let's go. Come on.
I think we should just get out of here.

431
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,611
[Millie]
That didn't sound like nothing:

432
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:12,448
You were right. Okay? I shouldn't have
gone down there. Everything's fiine.

433
00:43:12,554 --> 00:43:15,546
Come on. We can
still make the museum.

Will you talk to me?
Rlease?

Why aren't you talking to me?
Please talk to me.

- I'm not waiting for the hotel.

00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:06,125
Don't worry:
You won't need it where you're going:

466
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,439
Hello, David.

467
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:24,007
You've only got about 30 seconds before
they come through that door: You understand?

468
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,087
You have to get out of here.

469
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:28,918
- Ditch the girl. If she's with you, she's dead.
- Mom:

470
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:31,925
- Mom.
- Twenty seconds, David.

471
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:37,364
Mom! Mom!

472
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:38,490
Hey!

473
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:53,781
Millie.

474
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:57,847
All done. You okay?

475
00:45:57,953 --> 00:45:59,921
Mm-hmm. Hey.

476
00:46:00,021 --> 00:46:02,819
- I'm free to walk.
- They just let you go?

477
00:46:02,924 --> 00:46:05,757
- They just let me go.
- Just like that?

478
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:08,523
Just like that.
Come on.

479
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:12,731
[Millie] If they just let you go,
why are we running?

480
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:15,564
Well, uh, they really strongly suggested
that we leave town now.

481
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,969
- But what did they say to you?
- Asked me some questions.

482
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:22,134
- For eight hours?
- They had a lot of questions.

483
00:46:22,244 --> 00:46:24,678
I really want to trust you.
You're making it extremely diffiicult.

484
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,680
All right. So trust me.
Let's go.

485
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:32,019
Whoa!

486
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:35,155
Whoa! Hey.

487
00:46:35,257 --> 00:46:38,055
- Can you take us? Yeah?
- ##[Car Radio: ; Rap]

488
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,357
Get in the cab, Millie.
Millie, get in the car.

489
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:46,525
Please.
Please get in the cab.

490
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:15,995
That's yours:

491
00:47:16,097 --> 00:47:18,565
Remember how I told you you didn't
need to tell me everything?

492
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:21,903
I changed my mind.

493
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:28,976
What's in the backpack?

494
00:47:53,134 --> 00:47:55,102
Where did you get that?

495
00:48:02,277 --> 00:48:04,370
I don't want to lie to you.

496
00:48:06,314 --> 00:48:09,613
But you don't want to
tell me the truth either.

497
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:15,416
I can't get on this flight
with you, Millie.

498
00:48:15,523 --> 00:48:18,686
This is as far as we go together:

499
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:36,908
- [Woman] To Detroit?
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,980
[Roland]
Roland:

501
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:49,056
[Man]
We lost him, sir.

502
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:52,159
- How many did you send?
- Two men.

503
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,252
- I told you to send everybody.
- Well, she said two would be enough...

504
00:48:55,363 --> 00:48:57,297
but, uh, they missed him.

505
00:48:57,399 --> 00:49:00,061
It's like he knew we were coming.

506
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:02,966
We're searching the grid now.

507
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:06,802
Keep me informed.
I'm taking a different tack.

508
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:22,189
William Rice?

509
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,780
Yeah.

510
00:49:23,892 --> 00:49:25,860
I.R.S.

511
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:30,461
Could we, uh, go inside and talk?

512
00:49:32,634 --> 00:49:35,432
I don't have to ask.
That's a courtesy.

513
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:38,768
- [Chattering On TV]
- So, what's this all about?

514
00:49:38,873 --> 00:49:41,034
Your son. David.

515
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:46,105
Why? Is he in some kind
of trouble or something?

516
00:49:48,516 --> 00:49:52,316
This will go a lot swifter
if you let me ask the questions.

517
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,321
When's the last time
you saw your son?

518
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:58,892
Eight years ago.

519
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:03,364
Eight years?

520
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:05,433
That's right.

521
00:50:07,736 --> 00:50:10,068
What about friends?

522
00:50:10,171 --> 00:50:12,071
Anybody I can talk to?

523
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:14,368
He didn't have
a whole lot of friends.

524
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:17,138
I'd like to talk to
David's mother if I could.

525
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:21,306
Yeah, me too.
If you fiind her, tell her I said hello.

526
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,384
That her?

527
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:25,646
Mary Rice. At least that was
her name back then.

528
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,491
When's the last time you saw her?

529
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:35,062
She split when the kid turned fiive.

530
00:50:35,163 --> 00:50:37,063
Five. Oh.

531
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:39,258
Haven't heard a word since:

532
00:50:45,707 --> 00:50:48,835
If I hear anything,
I'll be sure to give you a holler.

533
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:57,041
- No, you won't.
- No. I won't.

534
00:51:00,288 --> 00:51:02,882
Have you seen the special move
you can do on this new thing?

535
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:07,519
They've added this new control and, like,
you just- If you-Just double-click it. See that?

536
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:09,529
What do you say?
Whoa.

537
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:14,101
Still alive, are ya?

538
00:51:19,908 --> 00:51:22,604
- [Man On TV] I'm hitl
- [Man #2 On TV] He's dead:

539
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,645
- What? That's just great.
- There's more of them?

540
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:29,808
Hundreds more: I'm tracking 10 right now:
What do you care? There's lots more:

541
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:32,648
- What about the rest?
- What about the rest?

542
00:51:32,754 --> 00:51:34,813
Like I said, I hunt them.

543
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:36,891
- Start again:
- So who are these guys?

544
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:38,720
I told you.
They're Paladins.

545
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:42,422
Yeah, you told me their name.
You didn't tell me what they want.

546
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,988
- [Machine Gun Fire On TV]
- Well, it's pretty simple,
isn't it? They want us dead.

547
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:49,229
- Didn't you fiigure that out yet?
- [Chuckles] Yeah. No, I got that much.

548
00:51:49,337 --> 00:51:51,237
- Good. I'm glad.
- Yeah. Thanks.

549
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:53,273
- Do you mind just, uh-
- Why?

550
00:51:53,374 --> 00:51:55,274
Because we can do
whatever the hell we want.

551
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:57,276
- Now can you please just-
- I'm hit!

552
00:51:57,378 --> 00:52:00,677
- He's dead.
- Great. Thanks.

553
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:03,012
You really don't get it, do you?

554
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:06,110
Paladins have been killing
Jumpers for years.

555
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:08,121
Way back since medieval times.

556
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:11,517
They're fanatics.
Religious nut jobs.

557
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:14,356
Inquisition. Witch hunts.
That was them.

558
00:52:14,462 --> 00:52:18,421
Look. They're smart.
They're fast. They're organized.

559
00:52:18,533 --> 00:52:20,967
No matter what, they'll kill anyone
that gets in their way.

560
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:24,869
Like your family.
Your friends.

561
00:52:24,973 --> 00:52:28,704
That little girlfriend
you're traipsing around Rome with you.

562
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:33,042
They're dead.
All of'em.

563
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:35,742
Get used to it.
It's just a matter of time.

564
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,648
I'm gonna get some takeaway.
Do you want some?

565
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:16,250
He's your father.

566
00:53:16,357 --> 00:53:19,417
I'm sorry. I talked to him,
but he wouldn't budge.

567
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:23,054
He can be so stubborn:
I don't know how my mother puts up with him:

568
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:39,405
Somebody get some help!

569
00:53:41,182 --> 00:53:43,343
- Now!
- [Man] What happened?

570
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:45,851
- [Woman] What's going on in here?
- [Chattering]

571
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,519
- [Man] Get the paddles:
- [Shouting]

572
00:53:54,596 --> 00:53:56,894
You okay? Stay still.

573
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,468
[Man]
I'm not getting a pulse:

574
00:54:04,172 --> 00:54:06,140
What the hell happened here?

575
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,110
Oh!

576
00:54:12,146 --> 00:54:13,943
- [Whoosh]
- Mark.

577
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:16,482
- Jesus Christ.
- What did you tell him?

578
00:54:16,584 --> 00:54:18,575
- How did they know about Ann Arbor?
- Don't touch me.

579
00:54:18,686 --> 00:54:21,348
- Who'd you tell?
- Stay the hell away from me.

580
00:54:21,456 --> 00:54:24,482
Was it a black guy with white hair?
Was his name Roland?

581
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:26,492
Just answer the question...

582
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:28,789
or I'll drop you off the top
of Mount Everest, okay?

583
00:54:28,896 --> 00:54:30,796
- What? What?
- What did you tell him?

584
00:54:30,898 --> 00:54:33,230
I don't-What? Tell what?

585
00:54:33,334 --> 00:54:35,234
I know you told him
about home, all right?

586
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:38,203
I know you told him about Ann Arbor.
Did you tell him about Millie?

587
00:54:38,306 --> 00:54:39,967
I told him everything.

588
00:54:40,074 --> 00:54:42,304
Why?
Why did you do that?

589
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,708
- Why not?
- [Shouts]

590
00:54:44,812 --> 00:54:46,746
Who are you?

591
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,590
Where'd the Paladin go?

592
00:54:57,692 --> 00:55:00,160
- Swimming.
- Pacific?

593
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:03,856
No. Actually, Atlantic.
Nice little shark pit round Cuba.

594
00:55:05,633 --> 00:55:07,863
Uh, what do you think you're doing?

595
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:10,437
- Put that stuff back!
- Actually, I need to borrow a few things.

596
00:55:10,538 --> 00:55:12,870
Just stay away from the wall!

597
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:14,441
I'll cut your eyes out.

598
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:16,976
[Grunts]
I need to fiind Roland.

599
00:55:17,078 --> 00:55:19,410
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

600
00:55:19,514 --> 00:55:21,573
- I only got eight hours.
- Eight hours?

601
00:55:21,683 --> 00:55:23,617
There's a girl-
Her flight lands in eight hours.

602
00:55:23,718 --> 00:55:25,515
Think that stuff s gonna help?
That stuff s four years old.

603
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,384
Do you want me to jump you back to
high school so you can learn something?

604
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:31,390
I've been tracking him for 10 years.
Look at this. Look.

605
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:36,859
You see this?
Our fiirst round in Nepal.

606
00:55:36,964 --> 00:55:39,194
You should see the one he gave me
back in Prague.

607
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,064
Look. Forget it.
Forget Roland.

608
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,138
Don't waste your time.

609
00:55:44,238 --> 00:55:46,297
Just leave it to me.

610
00:55:58,419 --> 00:56:00,387
- Do you mind?
- Look.

611
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:02,581
Little, uh- Little privacy here?

612
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:05,090
You know, this is
kind of my thing. Just-

613
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:08,788
Just- Get-You know, turn around.

614
00:56:08,896 --> 00:56:10,864
Yeah.

615
00:56:10,965 --> 00:56:15,265
I'm- I was thinking
that if we do this together...

616
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,270
we could get him.

617
00:56:17,372 --> 00:56:19,465
What? You mean, like, you and me?

618
00:56:19,574 --> 00:56:22,099

- Yeah.
- [Chuckles]

620
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:27,470
Look. I'm sorry,
but I don't play well with others.

621
00:56:43,398 --> 00:56:46,890
Do me a favor, yeah?
Don't be here when I get back:

622
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:49,663
Find a rock. Crawl under it.
Stay there.

623
00:56:58,212 --> 00:57:00,737
Joi woo, brother.

624
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:03,316
That's "good-bye" in Chinese.

625
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:33,209
Yeah. No. I've been meaning to call.
Really. I still really want to get the tattoo.

626
00:58:09,016 --> 00:58:10,984
You can't keep following me.

627
00:58:11,085 --> 00:58:13,815
Actually-[Clears Throat]
I'm the one person who can:

628
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:15,821
Yeah, lucky me.

629
00:58:29,103 --> 00:58:31,401
Why are you walking?

630
00:58:31,506 --> 00:58:34,805
I mean, l- I know Tokyo pretty well.
I got a lot of jump sites here.

631
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:39,676
You know, l-l- I like walking for a change.
Makes me feel normal.

632
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,908
You, uh-You ever read
Marvel Team-up?

633
00:58:43,017 --> 00:58:44,917
Yeah, I read it. And?

634
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:49,718
Two superheroes joining forces
for, like, uh, a limited run.

635
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:52,793
I see what you're trying to do, yeah?
I'm not buying it.

636
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:56,295
For your own sake, just go home.

637
00:58:56,397 --> 00:58:59,195
- You live in a cave.
- It's called a lair.

638
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,268
And what's the point?

639
00:59:01,369 --> 00:59:05,465
I'm just saying, you know.
We, uh, kind of have this common thing.

640
00:59:07,808 --> 00:59:09,799
And I know where to fiind Roland.

641
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:23,323
[David]
So we doing this, or what?

642
00:59:50,518 --> 00:59:52,543
Sorry. Clutch stuck.

643
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:57,380
- You're real subtle.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna get rid of you, am I?

644
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:17,841
You might want to hold on, son.

645
01:00:34,295 --> 01:00:36,422
That was close.

646
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:39,192
Not bad.

647
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,497
This thing must be two tons, easy.
How are you, uh-

648
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:44,901
If it moves, I can jump it.

649
01:00:45,006 --> 01:00:48,305
Actually, I knew this Jumper once-
crazy bastard-

650
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:50,673
tried to hop a whole building.
[Chuckles]

651
01:00:50,778 --> 01:00:53,212
- Won't be trying that again.
- Why's that?

652
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:55,805
That's 'cause he's dead.
Killed him.

653
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:59,477
Still managed to shake it
a little though.

654
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,590
So how long you been doing this for?

655
01:01:05,693 --> 01:01:08,355
- Doing what? Driving?
- No. Jumping.

656
01:01:08,462 --> 01:01:10,396

- Since I was fiive.

- ##[Radio: ; Rock]
- How'd you keep it a secret from people?

659
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:19,370
- Like your parents:
- It's pretty easy when they're not around.

660
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:21,737
- ##[Radio: ; Heavy Metal]
- Where were they?

661
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:23,810
Not around.

662
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:31,207
You know, my mom-
she took off when I was fiive.

663
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,050
I know what it's like
to not, you know-

664
01:01:35,156 --> 01:01:37,590
My dad, he-

665
01:01:37,692 --> 01:01:40,058
Did I ask about your family?

666
01:01:41,295 --> 01:01:44,287
I mean, are we on
Oprah here or-

667
01:01:53,174 --> 01:01:55,972
[David]
Griffin, I can't keep doing this: I gotta go:

Her flight lands any second.
I need an answer.

669

This is it, all right?
Marvel Team-up, now or never.

670
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:09,782
- [Horn Honks]
- A very limited run, right?

671
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:12,882
Save her, kill him, you know.
We're done.

672
01:02:12,993 --> 01:02:15,461
All right, Spidey.

Oh, no.

Hey. Uh, I'm Millie's friend,

Hey. Your friend came by.

I buzzed, but you didn't pick up.

- Yeah. Well, I needed to
make sure that you were okay.

No, David: I'm not okay:

I'm sorry.

You're sorry.

Thank you.

That's what I was
trying to tell you.

By bringing her down here, they can
follow you. They have a machine.

- It can open wormholes and keep them open.
- What are you talking about?

I'm saying they can

763
01:11:14,935 --> 01:11:16,402
Great.

It was always you.

01:12:03,317 --> 01:12:05,285
Please just take me.

772
01:12:09,056 --> 01:12:11,149
Take a deep breath.

773
01:12:20,267 --> 01:12:22,735
I got it.
I trapped them there.

774
01:12:22,836 --> 01:12:25,737
Without the machine,
they're screwed:

775
01:12:28,175 --> 01:12:30,370
No. Millie.

776
01:12:30,477 --> 01:12:33,037
- Got her!
- No!

777
01:12:33,146 --> 01:12:34,636
Millie:

778
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:37,342
Buddy: Wow:

779
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:42,919
Crap. I, uh- I didn't expect that.
L- I didn't know.

780
01:12:46,426 --> 01:12:49,259
Now they have to come to us.

781
01:12:49,363 --> 01:12:51,331
Let's get these fiires out.

782
01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:57,830
- [Beeping]
- What's that?

783
01:12:57,938 --> 01:13:00,736
- Huh? What?
- What are you doing?

784
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:03,503
Nothing. I was, uh,
thinking about going bowling.

785
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:06,010
- What?
- What? Roland's in there with his whole army.

786
01:13:06,113 --> 01:13:08,513
I'm gonna go back there and end this.
What do you think?

787
01:13:08,615 --> 01:13:11,083
- I'm gonna blow 'em to Timbuktu-
- Yeah, but Millie's in there.

788
01:13:11,184 --> 01:13:13,152
Well, yeah, there is that as well.

789
01:13:13,253 --> 01:13:15,778
- I gotta go- I gotta go get her:
- Huh?

790
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:18,858
Griffiin, it's my fault that she's there.
All right? You-

791
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:20,517
- You can't just-
- What?

792
01:13:20,627 --> 01:13:22,822
We gotta get her out:
We have to get her out:

793
01:13:22,929 --> 01:13:25,693
I can hear you! I'm not deaf.
I understand what you're saying.

794
01:13:25,799 --> 01:13:28,267
- All right. Well-
- It's a crying shame. It really is.

795
01:13:28,368 --> 01:13:31,599
But you know what? We all have to
make sacrifiices once in a while. You know.

796
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:35,974
Where's the detonator?

797
01:13:36,076 --> 01:13:37,805
- [Beeping]
- [David] I don't see you making any:

798
01:13:37,911 --> 01:13:40,379
You know what?
I made mine.

799
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,380
All right?

800
01:13:42,482 --> 01:13:44,382
When I was fiive.

801
01:13:44,484 --> 01:13:47,112
Came to my house
and killed my parents.

802
01:13:55,829 --> 01:13:57,990
David, David.

803
01:14:11,678 --> 01:14:13,646
Yeah?

804
01:14:18,785 --> 01:14:21,913
Look: Before this gets out ofhand,
let's just talk about this:

805
01:14:25,926 --> 01:14:30,295
[Griffiin] How about this for talking, huh?
Am I getting the message through to you?

806
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:32,297
[David]
I can't let you do this.

807
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:36,165
Look, David. You touch the safe again,
and I'm gonna kill you. Have you got it?

808
01:14:45,378 --> 01:14:48,040
[Griffiin]
Give me the detonator, David!

809
01:14:48,148 --> 01:14:51,845
- Give it back!
- Sorry, Griffiin!

810
01:14:53,587 --> 01:14:55,782
Give it back!

811
01:15:01,428 --> 01:15:03,396
Don't.

812
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,331
Bad move.

813
01:15:40,934 --> 01:15:43,300
Oh, shit.

814
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:03,584
- God, I hate Chechnya.
- [Machine Gun Fire]

815
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:07,693
Where'd you go?

816
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:24,866
Well, then, brother,
I guess our limited run's done:

817
01:16:44,364 --> 01:16:46,992
The old electricity trick:
That's a nice move:

818
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:51,230
- Thanks.
- Cut me down, and, uh, we can fiinish this, yeah?

819
01:16:51,338 --> 01:16:54,501
- [Groans]
- You know, it didn't have to be this way.

820
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:57,304
There's fiive of them back there.
You go back there alone, you're dead.

821
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:59,970
You hear me?
You can't win!

822
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,743
Get me down, David!
You do this alone, and you're dead.

823
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,818
You're not a hero, David!

824
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:09,912
You're a Jumper!
You don't save the girl!

825
01:17:10,023 --> 01:17:11,957
Don't you get it?
[Groans]

826
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:16,161
[Man]
Out of the wayl

827
01:17:26,606 --> 01:17:28,005
- [Roland] Movel
- Watch itl

828
01:17:28,108 --> 01:17:29,439
[Roland]
Got himl

829
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:32,539
No!

830
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,649
Shit.

831
01:17:48,094 --> 01:17:51,621
- [David Grunts]
- There's some things you can't jump, David.

832
01:18:02,308 --> 01:18:06,142
- Only God should have this power.
- [Electricity Crackles]

833
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:08,407
Not you, David.

834
01:18:08,515 --> 01:18:12,474
- [Electricity Crackles]
- David, I'm so sorry about what I said before.

835
01:18:19,492 --> 01:18:21,050
Take a deep breath.

836
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:27,951
David. Hey. Hey.

837
01:19:28,061 --> 01:19:31,929
David? Hey. Hey.

838
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:34,261
David!

839
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:36,835
- [Groans] Ooh.
- Shit. I'm sorry.

840
01:19:36,936 --> 01:19:38,904
- Oh, you-
- I'm sorry.

841
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:41,633
[Millie]
What's my dishwasher doing in the library?

842
01:19:48,615 --> 01:19:49,912
David!

843
01:19:51,785 --> 01:19:54,652
- [Roland] I'm impressed:
- Stay here, okay?

844
01:19:54,754 --> 01:19:55,982
What?

845
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:59,024
You've come a long way
from robbing banks:

846
01:20:08,234 --> 01:20:10,202
I told you I'm different.

847
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:16,666
I could have dropped you
with the sharks.

848
01:21:09,229 --> 01:21:11,493
Hi.

849
01:21:11,598 --> 01:21:14,362
[Chuckles]
Can I help you?

850
01:21:15,468 --> 01:21:17,436
Is-Is Mary here?

851
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:22,032
Hey, Mom.

852
01:21:29,849 --> 01:21:32,283
Honey, why don't you wait upstairs?

853
01:21:32,385 --> 01:21:34,353
Okay.

854
01:21:36,656 --> 01:21:38,647
You know, it wasn't
easy fiinding you.

855
01:21:38,758 --> 01:21:40,726
You shouldn't be here.

856
01:21:44,964 --> 01:21:47,125
So it's true.

857
01:21:48,234 --> 01:21:51,032
You're one of them.

858
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:52,695
Yes, it's true.

859
01:21:54,641 --> 01:21:56,802
You were five years old
your first jump:

860
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:58,878
I only had two choices:

861
01:21:58,978 --> 01:22:01,606
Kill you, or leave you.

862
01:22:01,714 --> 01:22:03,648
So you left.

863
01:22:04,684 --> 01:22:08,211
- To protect you:
- I was fiive.

864
01:22:11,724 --> 01:22:14,420
I did what I had to do.

865
01:22:14,527 --> 01:22:17,496
I've never stopped thinking about you.
Not even for one day.

866
01:22:25,772 --> 01:22:29,003
So I'm a Jumper.
You're a Paladin.

867
01:22:29,108 --> 01:22:31,076
That's right.

868
01:22:33,446 --> 01:22:36,074
What now?

869
01:22:37,483 --> 01:22:39,678
I'm giving you a head start, Son...

870
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:43,151
because I love you.

871
01:22:49,462 --> 01:22:51,430
Good luck.

872
01:23:21,995 --> 01:23:23,963
Hey:

873
01:23:28,234 --> 01:23:31,431
- You okay?
- Yeah.

874
01:23:33,306 --> 01:23:35,604
You sure?

875
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:37,676
Yeah. I am.

876
01:23:39,912 --> 01:23:41,812
Good.

877
01:23:41,914 --> 01:23:45,145
'Cause I'm freezing.
Can we please go someplace warm?

878
01:23:46,252 --> 01:23:49,153
- Where do you want to go?
- Surprise me.

879
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,528
