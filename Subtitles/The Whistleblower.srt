1
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,315
I have to get home.

2
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,987
- Mama's gonna kill me.
- No.

3
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,821
You are staying with me tonight.

4
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,578
Roman wants us there
at nine in the morning.

5
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,664
Raya we've been over this.

6
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,584
It's just a few months
working in a hotel.

7
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,998
Yes, but...

8
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,876
You want to work at
Copyshack like your mother?

9
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:40,051
He said it was both
of us or nothing!

10
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,230
No.

11
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:58,023
Fuck your mom!

12
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,260
- I'm sorry.
- It's 1:30 in the morning.

13
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,630
You don't understand!
Luba wanted me to...

14
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,007
If her mother lets her do
whatever she wants...

15
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,599
go live there.

16
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,811
You graduated.
You're an adult now.

17
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,016
Do what you want.

18
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,670
Raya?

19
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,146
Big smile.

20
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,029
Big smile.

21
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,944
Good.

22
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,863
What will you say at border?

23
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,032
I am Natalya...

24
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,159
I am Natalya Verbova.

25
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,872
I am going to Budapest
to buy carpets for reselling.

26
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,089
Raya...

27
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,712
Hello.

28
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,084
I'm working...

29
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,254
Out. Out.

30
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,558
Out.

31
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,194
Smile!

32
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,086
Hi, Kathy.

33
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,137
You're in a hurry.

34
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,801
Where's the fire?

35
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,555
Sorry.

36
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,133
- Hi, Mare.
- Hi.

37
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,560
Transfer come through?

38
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,980
No.

39
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,852
You'll find something, hon.

40
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,899
Yes.

41
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,781
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

42
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,619
Why don't you guys go
inside and help your mom, okay?

43
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,869
All right?

44
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,874
Marie asked me to bring this.

45
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,750
Erin around?

46
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,048
- It's nice to see you too, Kath.
- Yes, right.

47
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,842
You can't hold this
against me.

48
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,931
I gave you plenty of
warning on this.

49
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,050
It's not my fault you're
married to that job of yours.

50
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,644
Plenty of warning?
You just sprung this on me.

51
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,512
Look, I'm not going to
do this in front of Erin, okay.

52
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,855
Where is she? Erin?

53
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,066
And actually I'm not
married to my job.

54
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,651
I happen to like it.

55
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,896
I don't see why that has
to make me a bad mother.

56
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,532
Well, it's not my fault the
judge didn't see it that way, Kath.

57
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,868
Thanks, Kyle. Thank
you for bringing that up.

58
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,615
Look, I told you, you're welcome
to come down to Dalton...

59
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,538
It's really simple for me, you know,
I've just got to clear my mortgage...

60
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,911
find a transfer, you know,
really a piece of cake.

61
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,836
Hey, sweetie, how's it
going? Come here.

62
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,220
- Come here.
- No, Kyle, it's fragile.

63
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,089
- How am I supposed to know?
- Hi, Marie. How's it going?

64
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,059
- I brought the camping gear.
- Thank you.

65
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,553
- Why don't you label them...
- Marie scares me.

66
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,890
I'll tell you a secret.
She scares me too.

67
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,107
Don't tell anyone.

68
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,939
You okay?

69
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,857
Tell me.

70
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,826
When are you coming?

71
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,245
Sweetie, I'm having a really
hard time finding a transfer.

72
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,166
It might take awhile. But
I'm trying really hard.

73
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,923
I'm going to make it
happen, okay?

74
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,878
I don't understand.
There's got to be something.

75
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,971
- I mean I have the experience...
- Kathy.

76
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,136
- I took extra forensic courses.
- Kathy!

77
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,593
You've done
everything right.

78
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,142
- This is just how the cards fell.
- Yes, story of my fucking life.

79
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,557
Look, there's something
I heard about.

80
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,729
Yes.

81
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,146
I didn't think it would
work for you...

82
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,272
what with you trying
to get closer to your kid.

83
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,898
It's incredible money.

84
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,744
A hundred grand tax-free
for six months' work.

85
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,156
Come on, is it legal?
What is this?

86
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,580
It's the contractor that
the government uses to provide...

87
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,703
peacekeepers in Bosnia.

88
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,212
Bosnia.

89
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,946
You see the bullet
marks? Eye level!

90
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,199
They just... Kicked out
with the store. All the store.

91
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,627
Hey, man.
You gotta watch your back.

92
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,139
You come here today as
a beacon of hope.

93
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,599
As representatives of
our highest aspirations.

94
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,559
You've been hired by
Democra Security...

95
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,151
to represent the US...

96
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,609
as monitors for the
United Nations.

97
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,986
In the next few months...

98
00:08:55,993 --> 00:09:00,032
you will protect the rule of Law
where lawlessness is run rampant.

99
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,990
The 1995 Dayton Peace
Accords ended this war...

100
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,835
dictating that an international
police task force...

101
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,831
you, would smooth the
transition from war to peace.

102
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,047
During your training you
will see that peace...

103
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,629
is harder won than war.

104
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,055
That every morning's hope is
haunted by yesterday's nightmare.

105
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,063
As representatives of
the United Nations...

106
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,935
we stake our highest
values, even our lives...

107
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,067
on the belief that we
can rebuild.

108
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:40,152
We must renew and we will
witness the rebirth of this country.

109
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,077
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

110
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,881
It'll settle down.

111
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,969
Hey, honey.

112
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,888
- You been here before?
- This is my second mission.

113
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,635
You came straight from
the Academy?

114
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,980
No, I'm not a cop. I work
in administration.

115
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,314
You only need
a high school diploma...

116
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,813
and to be over 21 to get in.

117
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,774
What about you?
What brought you here?

118
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,119
I heard the food was
really great.

119
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,701
I thought the war was over.

120
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,915
De-mining.

121
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,790
- You okay?
- Yes.

122
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,213
I'm great.

123
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,596
I'm serious. He couldn't
move off the mine...

124
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,939
for eight days and eight nights.

125
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,933
So he's demanding time
and a half for nights.

126
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:58,153
Best part is that now,
sue me! How about that?

127
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,942
You still seeing the little guy?

128
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,738
Kathy, meet Fred Murray.

129
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,072
- Hi.
- Pleasure.

130
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,166
Hi, guys. We got a match.

131
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,831
High stakes tournament
situation. US versus Holland.

132
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,624
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh yes...

133
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,964
- Yes!
- Come on!

134
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,174
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on, yes!

135
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,633
I knew it!

136
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,973
You suck at pinball and
you suck at football.

137
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,888
- Who do you think invented pinball?
- Can you play?

138
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,603
- Can I play! Hold this.
- Okay. Alright.

139
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,972
- She's having the last one.
- The last one.

140
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,769
You know what?
You got to pull it, alright?

141
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,983
Yes, she knows, okay.
She knows.

142
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,193
- Okay, come on.
- Just watch this.

143
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,522
- Damn it!
- Okay. Here we go!

144
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,525
Yes! Yes!

145
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,989
Here we go, here we go!

146
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,076
Shit!

147
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,665
Sorry, guys. I don't
know what happened.

148
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,784
Who's not going to buy
the drinks?

149
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,790
I don't know what
happened there.

150
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,212
I would love some whisky and...

151
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,754
- Don't use...
- Shit!

152
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,099
Sorry, you can't use both flippers
at the same time, otherwise...

153
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,810
- Flippers?
- Yes, these are called flippers.

154
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,896
Well, this is the way I was taught.

155
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,691
- With a man behind you?
- Girls.

156
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,651
See, bam bam.

157
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,031
Bam bam, because it
has to bounce off.

158
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,899
This move still get you laid?

159
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,785
Well, in Holland it does.

160
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,054
I'm really out of practice.

161
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,715
Gentlemen.

162
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,644
So where do we sign
to say we came?

163
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,109
You sign...

164
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,855
Well, I think you have to
sign at the end of the session.

165
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,857
No. Why?
No, no, no.

166
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,908
Yep. It says right here, "UN mandate
requires you to sign at the end"...

167
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,748
Yes, but this paper is no
good. The new policy is...

168
00:13:55,751 --> 00:14:00,245
Leave her alone.
They try it out with everyone.

169
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,998
You sign them in,
they bugger off.

170
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,124
- I'm McVeigh. You're Kathy?
- Yeah.

171
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,010
Welcome to paradise.
Follow me.

172
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,758
Okay, gentlemen. If you have
nothing better to do today...

173
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,557
I would like you to start
investigating two new stabbings.

174
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,230
Four new shootings...

175
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,228
and a wee man with
a broken leg...

176
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,693
who can barely remember his name.

177
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,646
First one. In here.

178
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,650
Gather around.

179
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,948
Kathy...

180
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,081
why don't you take
this, please?

181
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,791
Facial contusions from
repeated beatings with fist.

182
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,965
Lacerations on the eye caused
by the edge of an iron.

183
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:54,845
Left arm was the first entry
point of a large kitchen knife.

184
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,060
Okay, Mama, I'm Just
going to lift this up.

185
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,068
It's all right.

186
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,205
- Who did this?
- Looks like the husband.

187
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,617
Okay, that's the case.

188
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,202
Who's taking it and
what's their first step?

189
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,637
- I will take it.
- Very good.

190
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,893
All right. Calm down.

191
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,645
What is he saying?

192
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,901
Say woman is Muslim...

193
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,027
and she deserved it.

194
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,238
Alright, alright!

195
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,907
That's enough. Stop it!

196
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,580
Hands off.

197
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,759
Moving on. Next case.

198
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,680
Go. Everyone outside.

199
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,144
Kathy, you too.

200
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,059
Excuse me. What do
you mean moving on?

201
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,023
Who's going to investigate
and make an arrest?

202
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,813
This is a felony assault.

203
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,277
Okay, let me ask you something.

204
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,154
Can you tell a Serb
from a Croat or a Bosniak?

205
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:38,494
Because I can. Racial hatred
started a war in this country.

206
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,953
And as much as I'd like to be...

207
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,040
we aren't here as investigators,
we monitor. That's it.

208
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,202
Sometimes stepping
back is part of the job.

209
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,927
Zlata has been in the hospital
eight times because of her husband.

210
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,717
Each time she tried
to make complaint...

211
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,511
my bosses send her home.

212
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,930
They laugh at her. They
laugh at women in Bosnia.

213
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,723
They laughed at
my mother even.

214
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,064
And they do not prosecute
domestic violence.

215
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,856
Yesterday you wanted to help.

216
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,110
Now you can show me
how to do this.

217
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,946
So this is the hospital report.

218
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,995
You have no police reports.

219
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,622
Well, what you need to do
is investigate this...

220
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,003
as if it were a felony assault.

221
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,967
So if you go back to the hospital...

222
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,634
and get every single doctor
who treated her to testify...

223
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,008
well, then you might have a chance.

224
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,099
But you'll have to...

225
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,890
Cross reference every
injury with other cases...

226
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,225
where courts ruled
felony assault.

227
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,981
If our courts rule that stabbing
a man in a bar is criminal...

228
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:01,903
then the same should apply
to a woman in her home.

229
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,868
I have considered the evidence...

230
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,792
and rule in favour
in Zlata Sehik.

231
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,642
- H el I o.
- H el I o.

232
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,779
Don't mind him.
He's a complete wimp.

233
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,193
Well, you've been
stirring things up.

234
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,789
Ms. Rees, if I over-stepped protocol
with the Zlata Sehick case I'm...

235
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,828
Would you call me
Madeleine?

236
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:56,211
You've just done in two months...

237
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,090
what we failed to do
in four years. Sit down.

238
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,797
- Do you want some tea?
- Yes, please.

239
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,924
Viko Mezovic did a great job...

240
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:09,804
but you've just facilitated the first
conviction for domestic violence...

241
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,065
since the end of
the war in Bosnia.

242
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,561
Well, it was very basic...
Thank you.

243
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,733
Basic police work.

244
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,822
It's just my job.

245
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,614
You can't imagine how that makes
you stand out around here.

246
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,620
The IPTF have a
Gender Affairs Office here.

247
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,585
And the current head left...

248
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,672
and I think you're
the right person to take over.

249
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,098
Well...

250
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,717
Are you up for it?

251
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,106
- Hello.
- Hi, Sweetie.

252
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,102
Did you get the stuff I sent?

253
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,229
- Did dad say you're not coming back?
- No.

254
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,855
Of course I'm coming back.

255
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,732
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

256
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,280
- For Labour Day?
- Well, I...

257
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,152
Because my friends
are renting a boat and...

258
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,745
But I have to stay longer...

259
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,616
because they've asked me
to be the head of a department.

260
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,541
Oh, well...

261
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,998
You know what?
I'm making a lot of money...

262
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:21,884
so I can move nearer dad and
I can see you all the time.

263
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,549
That's cool. Hold on!
Sorry, I've got to go, Mom.

264
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,012
- I have a game.
- Okay.

265
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,302
- I love you. Bye.
- Bye.

266
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,689
- Kathy?
- Yes.

267
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,950
Nick Kaufman, Contingent Commander.

268
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,615
- Good to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

269
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,828
- How are you?
- Can I give you a hand?

270
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,073
- I'm fine. This way?
- Yeah.

271
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,582
Good having another
American in the mix.

272
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,077
Some people get pissed off,
saying we're taking over.

273
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,829
Makes my life easier.

274
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,749
Especially when it's a good-looking
woman reporting to me.

275
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,218
I don't mean to burst your bubble
but I report to Madeleine Rees.

276
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,008
It's a joint appointment.

277
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,722
And she's Human Rights.
But you're Democra.

278
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,014
So ultimately you're all mine
at the end of the day.

279
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,987
No, you can't. Don't, don't.
Please don't.

280
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,992
Just don't touch. Just step
away from the table, please.

281
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,994
I've had my eyes on this
table for a long time.

282
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,541
This one is mine, lady.

283
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,004
- This is your table?
- This is my table.

284
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,670
I'm sorry to tell you
but this is my table.

285
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:30,129
I have a new job over at HQ
with a lot of fancy diplomats...

286
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,803
and for someone
in my position this...

287
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,516
- Would have this table?
- Yes.

288
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,260
I feel very strongly about it.

289
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:42,149
- You don't care about my feelings?
- I don't care about your feelings.

290
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,901
- So you're just going to take it?
- I'll tell you what.

291
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,567
If you buy me dinner you can
have the damn table.

292
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,945
- Come on! Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

293
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,033
I was married twice.

294
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,917
Like, two times?

295
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,879
- Two times.
- That's twice.

296
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,544
Yes, once and then again and
I messed it up both times.

297
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,179
- What about you?
- Well, technically I'm still married.

298
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,883
But it is...

299
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,725
it's complicated right now...

300
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,936
because we are in the middle of...

301
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,058
what I would call an ending.

302
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,942
But you're married.

303
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,063
Right. But we are in
the process of...

304
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,905
- Kids?
- Yes, we have two.

305
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,319
- Two?
- Boys.

306
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,905
It isn't that complicated
but it is.

307
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,495
If I slept with you,
I'm going straight to hell.

308
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,583
You are.
Let's get drunk first.

309
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,962
I'm sorry!

310
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,750
Stop fighting, okay?

311
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,970
- Put it down.
- Stay here, please.

312
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,632
Total goat fuck!

313
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,931
Musical apartments!
Just hold the people back!

314
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,144
What do you need me to do?

315
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,101
The Muslim women are supposed
to get their old apartments back.

316
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,225
Serbs took them during the war.
Serbs don't want to leave!

317
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,774
And a lot of places got sold to
third-party Croats or God knows what!

318
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,896
And everyone's pissed.

319
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,113
And I figured it's a
bunch of widows...

320
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,530
- so your Gender Office can handle it.
- Okay.

321
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,652
- Bolkovac?
- Yes.

322
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,743
They need you. Come on.

323
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:22,032
- Murray, can you deal with it?
- I'll take this then. Great!

324
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,660
She was talking but
I couldn't understand.

325
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,957
She's not local.

326
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,804
Hey.

327
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,554
Hey?

328
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,702
All right.

329
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,044
I'm not going to touch you.

330
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,020
What is it? Are you in pain?

331
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,104
Oh God, this girl is seriously ill.
Could you call a medic?

332
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,603
Somebody call an ambulance!

333
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,947
Raya, are you okay?

334
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,988
- She was further back in the woods.
- It's me, Irka. Wake up!

335
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,988
They make raid!
They abuse the girls.

336
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,081
Okay, calm down.
Take a breath.

337
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,998
Nine girls there.

338
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,495
- Help them!
- Where?

339
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,997
- Florida Bar.
- Florida Bar?

340
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,624
- What is Florida Bar?
- It's one of the bars in the hills.

341
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,625
Raya!

342
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,502
I can take them to
the Zenica Shelter.

343
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,755
That's where we usually
take these girls.

344
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,222
Usually!?

345
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,640
Where is the bar?
How do I get there?

346
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,639
What's happening here?

347
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,060
What's going on here?

348
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,937
- IPTF told us to come.
- Really?

349
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,186
That's interesting.
Since when do you listen to us?

350
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,563
Well, where are they?
I don't see any monitors.

351
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,156
Lady, what do you want?

352
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,948
I got called to come here to take
the girls to Zenica so I'm here.

353
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,661
What's Zenica?
What's it?

354
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,125
Mothersuckers. I don't pay you
fucking Smurfs no more.

355
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,084
Pay? Pay?
What's he talking about?

356
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,669
What does he mean, pay?

357
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,669
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

358
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,593
I am Bosniak and he is Croat and
I don't understand Croat!

359
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,842
Bullshit! I know you
understand him.

360
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,722
Smart lady.

361
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,564
- What's in Zenica?
- It's a woman's shelter.

362
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,851
You know, the whores
get a good meal.

363
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:41,983
They can talk about problems.
It's like a vacation for them.

364
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,942
Very funny.

365
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,662
Oh my God.

366
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,038
Jesus Christ.

367
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,983
Quickly! Over here.

368
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,944
- Is this the Zenica Shelter?
- Yes.

369
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:01,245
We have to be careful.
Sometimes they watch.

370
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,992
- Who watch?
- Traffickers.

371
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:07,122
- Traffickers?
- Yes. Human trafficking.

372
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:17,883
These girls were
abducted and sold.

373
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:26,733
They are told they must
work off their debt.

374
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,489
And then they'll be let go.

375
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,618
But they never are.

376
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,036
Since the end of the war...

377
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,912
sex trafficking has spread
like cancer.

378
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:56,300
- Why since the end of the war?
- Half our men are dead.

379
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,178
So...

380
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:04,058
who are these girls
brought in for?

381
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,194
This is our volunteer nurse.

382
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:31,502
She says Raya has bad infection.

383
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:36,920
The nurse found objects inside her.

384
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,717
Excuse me?

385
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,798
Coins.

386
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,679
Like you saw, they're
not prostitutes.

387
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,558
They are slaves, treated
like dogs.

388
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,943
Do you have a doctor here?

389
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,938
We don't have doctor.

390
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,943
Try the Global
Displacement Agency.

391
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,833
If they keep them or not,
I don't know.

392
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,088
Wait, please. There
were other girls?

393
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,890
The ones who were
from the Florida Bar.

394
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,931
The police brought them
here about an hour ago.

395
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,726
Here? No police came.

396
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,602
Are you sure?

397
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,689
These girls never arrived.

398
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,955
I'm looking for Laura Levi.

399
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,179
Okay. We'll see you later.
Okay?

400
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,566
I'm Kathy Bolkovac. I'm the new
Head of Gender Affairs.

401
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,981
I heard. Congratulations.
I'm Laura Levi.

402
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,604
What nationalities are
we dealing with here?

403
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,951
I presume these two women
want to be repatriated?

404
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,236
I don't know.

405
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,581
Actually, I brought them here because
they need medical attention.

406
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,742
We'll get them to the medical centre.

407
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,790
As soon as we get clearance,
we'll know where we stand.

408
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,797
Clearance? What does that mean?

409
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,801
Look, I'll do whatever
I can to help...

410
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,965
but I have to determine
if they'll cooperate...

411
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,055
with their repatriation program.

412
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,765
That's the only way
I can let them stay here.

413
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,680
It's not me, it's policy.

414
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,226
I see, policy. Okay. One more thing
I just wanted to ask you.

415
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,058
The other girls from
the raid were supposed to go...

416
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,685
to the Zenica Shelter
but they never arrived.

417
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:02,532
Really? Why don't you check
the IPTF message boards?

418
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,277
Listen, half the time
these raids are for show.

419
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:10,032
I'm sure the owner has paid off
whoever he had to by now.

420
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,250
Your missing girls are
probably back at the bar.

421
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,126
Excuse me now.

422
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:01,542
- Murray, mind if I join you?
- Yes, have a seat.

423
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,887
- Not eating?
- No, I just have a quick question.

424
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,301
You know the raid you
ordered last night?

425
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,141
Local police said they were
taking the girls to Zenica...

426
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,931
but they never showed up.

427
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:18,607
Fucking mess! It's the locals
dragging us into their turf war.

428
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,818
Some cop from another
canton calls in a fake tip...

429
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,901
about a prostitution bust.

430
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,615
But the bar is legit and
the girls just waitresses. So...

431
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,275
Waitresses?

432
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,908
It doesn't hurt to be
thorough, though, right?

433
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,910
Yes, right.

434
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,125
Thing is I found padlocked rooms,
young women's passports...

435
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,747
and there was a lot of
US currency...

436
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,841
Where are we going,
Columbo?

437
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:49,930
I don't know, but something
fucked up is going on.

438
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,895
Honey, it's like I say,
this is Bosnia.

439
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,939
These people specialize
in fucked up.

440
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,609
And speaking of which...

441
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,575
we've got another re-housing goatfuck
in Gorazde, so catch you later.

442
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,693
See you later, guys.

443
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,907
Let's go.

444
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,832
Should have seen this place.

445
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,711
There were pictures all over
the walls of guys with those girls.

446
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:29,132
And almost every
single guy in there is ours.

447
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,726
I saw one of your guys there.

448
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,850
- You saw one of my guys there?
- Yes, he was wearing your flag.

449
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,643
You want to ask me something?

450
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,528
I guess I do.

451
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,860
Okay, listen...

452
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,529
I've heard about these places.
I know they exist.

453
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,201
I know my guys go up
there once in awhile.

454
00:38:56,208 --> 00:39:00,542
I figured for strippers or sex.
I don't know, I haven't been there.

455
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:04,004
I know nothing about any girls
being locked up. What the fuck?

456
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,714
Okay.

457
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,670
I'm sorry.

458
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,141
At home...

459
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:27,692
I worked in a Precinct
where there were 25 guys.

460
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:33,985
And I knew them really well,
I knew every one of them.

461
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,580
I know their families.
I know everything about them...

462
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,913
and I trust them completely.

463
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,999
I was dumb enough to think...

464
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,845
I'd be joining some
elite police officers here.

465
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,179
But I don't know who
these people are.

466
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:09,187
Three, two, one, clear.

467
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,734
Kaufman!

468
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,820
- Is it okay for me to be here?
- Sure. Just wait there.

469
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:28,127
What's up? You finally come
and see me in action.

470
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,625
I live to see you in action.

471
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,587
This is for you.

472
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,762
I think Fred Murray's taking
payoffs from brothels.

473
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,013
And it's not prostitution.
The girls were trafficked.

474
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:49,065
The problem is, who investigates,
how to charge him?

475
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,738
All the international personnel
have immunity.

476
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,572
They can't be Prosecuted.

477
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,572
But this is good work, Bolkavac.

478
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,573
I think it might even deserve
a dinner out with yours truly.

479
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,582
Don't think I've earned that.

480
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,160
Girls, how are you doing?

481
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,039
Did you get some rest?

482
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,925
I went to the Florida Bar...

483
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,016
and I saw the room in the back and
I know what's been happening to you.

484
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,682
Good for you. Can we go now?

485
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,022
What happened to the girls?

486
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,688
Did you see my friend Luba?
Is she safe?

487
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,979
No.

488
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,233
The police took
the girls back to the bar.

489
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,033
But we can still help
your friend.

490
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,913
I believe the bar was raided
because Tanjo, the owner...

491
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,707
was refusing to pay
this man money.

492
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,210
Is that true?

493
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,474
Look, I know you're
scared to talk but...

494
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,142
if you can tell me that
this is the man then...

495
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,936
Then what?

496
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,938
You put him in jail?

497
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,022
No, he has diplomatic
immunity.

498
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,992
That means he's protected
by the UN.

499
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:47,034
But Tanjo can go to jail.
He can go to jail.

500
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,249
And if you both say
in a court...

501
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:55,667
that Tanjo has been taking
payoffs from this man...

502
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,999
then his name will go on record...

503
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,719
and the UN has to do
something.

504
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,552
They can't knowingly have one
of their men involved in rape...

505
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,969
kidnapping and torture.

506
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,094
How do you do this
if you work for the UN?

507
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,262
I'm an American police officer.

508
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,810
It doesn't matter who I work for...

509
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,149
I wouldn't let anybody
get away with this.

510
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:20,521
So if we go to court you promise
you can stop these men?

511
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,984
I can't promise I can stop
all these men. I promise...

512
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,987
If you cannot promise then
why do we agree?

513
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:33,000
There is too much danger
to go speak in a court, even this...

514
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,540
to say anything to you.

515
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,833
How do I know this is safe?

516
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,799
You're a smart girl.

517
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,896
I have a daughter.

518
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,811
She was taken away from me and...

519
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,109
I can't change that.

520
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,159
But maybe I can change
what happens to you.

521
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,882
- Will we be safe?
- Yes.

522
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,883
Do you promise?

523
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,684
I promise.

524
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,779
Hello.

525
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:48,196
I'm calling from the Global
Displacement Agency in Sarajevo.

526
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,785
Do you have a daughter
named Raysa?

527
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,701
- Yes. Yes.
- We have her here.

528
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,121
If everything checks out...

529
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,620
we will send her home
in a few days.

530
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,088
- I'll come there now.
- I'm sorry, we can't afford...

531
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,084
I'll pay for it.
Just tell me where to go.

532
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,266
Roman will be home soon.

533
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,737
Roman seems to be doing well.

534
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,730
Milk?

535
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,696
I need to borrow money.

536
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,625
They found Raya in Sarajevo.

537
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:43,501
I want to go and get her.
I don't need much.

538
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,177
Does he still hit you?

539
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,608
You know I hate to ask.

540
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,990
But she's my daughter...

541
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,115
and your niece. Please.

542
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,993
I will get you the money.

543
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:25,122
But you have to go.
Roman will be home soon.

544
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:29,046
He won't give it to me
if he knows it's for you.

545
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,071
You need an armored security
vehicle for two teenage girls?

546
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,990
- What the hell did they do?
- None of your business.

547
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,745
Okay, well, it's tough today.

548
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,784
They sent most of
our convoy up to Tesla.

549
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,748
- Found some war criminal.
- Shit!

550
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,538
I can push for end
of the week.

551
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,787
Never mind. Don't worry about it.

552
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,210
But I'll put it through.
You never know, right?

553
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:23,264
- Is Viko around?
- Viko, your girlfriend is here.

554
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,770
Come on, let's go.

555
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:32,773
The van just sits here.
It's no problem.

556
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:37,073
It is not armored like you want
but it's heavy like tank.

557
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,036
So it's okay.

558
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:43,080
They don't build them like this.
So we go straight to the safe house.

559
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:48,547
Here's the address. after they
make statement in court, yes?

560
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,586
I made the call, so it's okay.

561
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,268
Where is Irka?

562
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,849
- I need to have a word with you.
- Okay. Hey, Raya.

563
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,277
There was a problem.

564
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,115
During repatriation procedures
we realized Irka had no passport.

565
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:20,537
Okay, so we get her one.
Where is she?

566
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,998
You don't understand.
She was trafficked from Grozny.

567
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,870
Her parents were killed in Chechnya
and she has no documentation.

568
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,543
No embassy will recognize her.

569
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,915
She's a girl without a country.

570
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,919
Okay, you're not answering
my question. Where is Irka?

571
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,301
We handed her over to
the police a few hours ago.

572
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,596
How could you do that?
Viko, take Raya.

573
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,848
- So you meet us when you're done?
- Yes.

574
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,016
- Come on. Let's go.
- Raya, I'll see you soon, okay?

575
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,481
- It's okay.
- How could you do that?

576
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,769
I couldn't keep her. She
didn't have the paperwork.

577
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,865
- This is bullshit!
- Every case needs to be justified.

578
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,862
I know what you think
but it's an uninformed opinion.

579
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:05,036
- We have a system that works here.
- Really, for who?

580
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,620
Sorry, I look for Laura Levinia?

581
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:10,916
That's me.

582
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,511
Hey.

583
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,509
You know where they took her?

584
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,806
The police take them to the border.

585
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:29,936
Once they've crossed, there is one
less trafficking victim in Bosnia.

586
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,650
Take the 761 to Visegrad.

587
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:57,710
Hey, I'm looking for a girl.

588
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,677
The police dropped
her here a few hours ago.

589
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,137
Could you check the border logs?

590
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,177
She's 15 years old, no passport.

591
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:07,849
Okay. Lady, I know
what you look for.

592
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,227
Those girls do not go
through border.

593
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,190
They go through there.

594
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:17,612
To Serbia, if they survive.

595
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,189
Jesus.

596
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,981
Irka!

597
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,563
Leave me alone!

598
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:58,979
Go home!

599
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,073
Irka, please wait.

600
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,986
You promised.

601
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,200
Irka!

602
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,619
Stop doing that!

603
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,801
Please.

604
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,009
Just let me die.

605
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,806
I'm sorry. Irka, I'm sorry.

606
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,803
No.

607
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,522
It's okay.

608
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,775
Alright, alright.

609
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,716
It's okay. It will be over soon...

610
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,965
then you go home
with your mother, okay?

611
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,072
Where's the other girl?

612
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,702
She's not here. Let's go.

613
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,592
We'll do whatever
we can to get Raya back.

614
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,018
I'm truly very sorry.

615
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,956
What will they do to her?

616
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,622
What will they do to her?

617
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,793
I want to show you what happens
when you talk to the devil.

618
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,637
Now. Bring her in.
Bring her in.

619
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,596
Bring her in.
Bring her in.

620
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,143
Watch. Make sure
they are watching.

621
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,098
Open your eyes.

622
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,774
Watch! Watch!

623
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,894
Take a good look.

624
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:49,150
Look at your fucking friend no w.

625
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,975
What happened?

626
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,281
The car must have
been following us.

627
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,036
Do you know who they were?

628
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,700
No.

629
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:05,915
Nobody at my station
knew where I was going.

630
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,915
Did you tell anybody at IPTF?

631
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,090
Madeleine, I need to see you.

632
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,946
This is Peter Ward.

633
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,990
Hello.

634
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:39,114
Peter's an old friend,
Internal Affairs.

635
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:45,159
So, Kathy, have you had
any report on Raya?

636
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,786
None.

637
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:55,593
Kathy, from now on I want you to run
your investigation alongside Peter.

638
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,136
The best way to find Raya...

639
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,257
is to continue your investigation
into Fred Murray.

640
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,685
You handed in a vehicle
request to IPTF.

641
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,848
Yes.

642
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:09,979
Well, the traffickers obviously knew
where you'd be, so there's a leak.

643
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,987
I know that cops don't like
to work with Internal Affairs...

644
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:19,030
but considering what just
happened, it's our only way.

645
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,871
Well, I don't know how
to move forward.

646
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,998
I've lost two witnesses.

647
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:37,628
Raya, and Irka won't testify
now, she's too terrified.

648
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:42,637
Do you think Fred Murray is only
getting payoffs from one bar?

649
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,017
No.

650
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:50,186
So there could be other girls willing
to testify against Fred Murray.

651
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,729
It's possible.

652
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:56,229
Well, if you can get any of these
girls to testify in court then...

653
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,991
well, there'd be something quite
substantial to work with.

654
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,618
Agreed?

655
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,967
Thank you.

656
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:24,592
I don't want to put any of you
in a dangerous position...

657
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,093
and ask you to speak out
against your traffickers.

658
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,228
I just want to know if you
recognize this man.

659
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,617
Maybe give them some time.

660
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,908
I'll let you know...

661
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,125
if anyone says anything.

662
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,130
Okay.

663
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,972
Milena, would you show them
this photograph, too?

664
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,518
Just maybe someone has
heard something about her.

665
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,521
You look for this girl?

666
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,235
She is okay?

667
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,910
No. No, she's not.

668
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,750
Do you know her?

669
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,958
No.

670
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:53,722
But I know him.

671
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,774
He comes in the same group...

672
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:05,738
every month to take
money from Ivan.

673
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,952
- He came in a group?
- Yes.

674
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,703
I want to show you some
other photographs.

675
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:20,166
If you could tell me if any
of these people were in the group.

676
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,842
That is Paolo.

677
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,805
He liked pain.

678
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,891
He liked weird things.

679
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,101
He wanted me to like too...

680
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,817
This made my price go down.

681
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,779
I know then...

682
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,571
it will take me two more years
to pay my debt.

683
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:59,212
He buys girls for other men
and puts them in apartments.

684
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,671
Soldiers pay money to own
girls for themselves.

685
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,558
Check it out, three grand
and she's all mine.

686
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,136
Luc got one for 25 hundred.

687
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,104
Turn around, let me see your ass.

688
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,604
Take off your bra.

689
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:25,855
When we come through
checkpoint he drives the van.

690
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,528
- What?
- Him. He was the d river.

691
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:37,576
This man drove you in a van...

692
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,911
across the border...

693
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,581
into Bosnia?

694
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,925
Yes.

695
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:51,718
We stop at border.
See man in blue like you.

696
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:57,638
I thank God. I think
we have our saviour.

697
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:07,154
Then he jumps in
and drives the van.

698
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,206
Madeleine, they're
bringing them in.

699
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:23,663
IPTF are actually trafficking girls
and bringing them across the border.

700
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,171
And it's not just IPTF.

701
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,885
This involves all kinds
of internationals...

702
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:37,181
from military officers
to diplomats.

703
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,684
I thought I was only
going after one guy.

704
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:47,148
I had no idea what
I'd be handing over.

705
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,234
Get this off to Peter
as quickly as you can.

706
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,130
Are you sure you want
to go ahead with this...

707
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,796
because you know there'll be
no going back after?

708
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,803
Yes, ma'am.

709
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,013
Right.

710
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:54,970
You work in two hours.

711
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,526
You sleep on whichever
mattresses are free.

712
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:16,275
They bring us food in the morning.

713
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,578
You have to eat it all,
or you get fined.

714
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,034
Come sit down.

715
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:34,134
Don't let them see you like this.

716
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:35,840
Okay?

717
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,716
What is your name?

718
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,811
Raya Kochan.

719
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,895
I've nearly paid my debt.

720
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,781
Then I can go home.

721
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,823
- It's all bullshit.
- No.

722
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,115
He sent a girl back
three months ago.

723
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,121
I was here.

724
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,875
What is your name?

725
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:16,002
She is Luba.
Luba Pallch.

726
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:29,937
I'm afraid we can't keep
you here any longer.

727
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:35,688
I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

728
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:45,073
We'll do anything we
can to get Raya back.

729
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,508
- Kathryn Bolkovac?
- Yes.

730
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,627
You're wanted
in Human Resources.

731
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,504
- Now?
- Yes, now.

732
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,904
- Sorry to keep you waiting there.
- No problem.

733
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,609
John Blakely.

734
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,699
Kathy Bolkovac.
Nice to meet you.

735
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,151
Have a seat.

736
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:26,656
- So you keeping busy?
- Yes.

737
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:32,162
Your superiors, they tell me
that you're working hard.

738
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,914
I enjoy my work.

739
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,627
You're dedicated, thorough.

740
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,753
Thank you.

741
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:44,173
Tough stuff, though, your area.

742
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:47,934
Stressful.

743
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:53,933
Do you ever worry about burnout?

744
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:58,688
No. Never.

745
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,945
You must miss your daughter.

746
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:11,956
It's unusual, isn't it, that a judge
would award custody to the father?

747
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:20,710
I would imagine there's almost
some kind of a stigma around that?

748
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,212
What did you want
to talk to me about?

749
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:28,017
I'm sorry. I just wondered.

750
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:33,731
Because we award
special paid leave to folks...

751
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,975
who work in stressful departments.

752
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:39,228
You know, parents especially,
we really encourage it.

753
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,573
And you'd have some time
to hang out with your daughter.

754
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:46,569
Nice little jaunt around
Europe, see the sights.

755
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,823
I'm going to have
to think about it.

756
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,667
You're not the maternal type?

757
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:11,286
Bitch.

758
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,746
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Go home before you get...

759
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,084
We're watching you...

760
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,707
You'd do better to shut
your mouth, you fucking...

761
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,754
Kathy, we need to meet.
It's important.

762
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,802
And be careful. Make sure
you're not followed.

763
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:36,641
Kathy, we need to meet.
It's important. And be careful.

764
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,605
Make sure you're not followed.

765
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:42,981
Fuck!

766
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:34,528
The world and its mother
knows about my investigation.

767
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,781
I know.

768
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,578
- Would you like something to drink?
- No.

769
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:44,250
- Do you mind if...
- Go ahead.

770
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:48,049
Kathy, Internal Affairs is
shutting down all your cases.

771
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:49,668
Why?

772
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,090
All of your files look like this.

773
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,603
Jesus.

774
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,897
I've been completely
steam-rolled.

775
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,061
They've sent Fred Murray
home on some kind of leave.

776
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,980
And top level military
commanders...

777
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:08,821
are walking into my office
and pulling your files.

778
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:11,239
I've never seen I.A.
Over-ridden like this before.

779
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:13,199
Over-ridden by who?

780
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,660
I don't know.

781
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,870
I mean, I can't be sure.

782
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,874
It's the State Department.
Or Democra.

783
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,166
You do know what
they stand to lose if this...

784
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,793
I guess not.

785
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,092
Their contract in Bosnia
is worth millions.

786
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,055
Globally, just this year alone...

787
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,052
billions of dollars
in US government contracts.

788
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,054
And now you come along
with this scandal...

789
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,147
I don't want a scandal.
I'm just doing my job.

790
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,983
I know, but it doesn't matter.
Nobody cares about you.

791
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,997
I'll get you the rest of
your files back from I.A.

792
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:10,670
You get them out of here,
take them public.

793
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:13,134
Or this will never see
the light of day.

794
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:18,591
- I can't leave these girls.
- You're not helping them here.

795
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,513
And, frankly, you're not safe
to walk around.

796
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,102
It's completely exposed you.

797
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:27,146
Kathy, accidents do happen.
A car blows a tire, a mine explodes.

798
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,693
We don't have to report
civilian deaths.

799
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,242
I'll get you the rest of these...

800
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,988
and you get yourself the hell
out of here as soon as you can.

801
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:42,956
Trust me. This is
the right thing to do.

802
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:05,726
I was so stupid. I mean I thought
I could work inside the system.

803
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:07,142
Like I knew what the fuck
I was doing.

804
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:11,019
Like I knew how to play ball
with all these fancy diplomats.

805
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:15,067
I don't know. What would you do?

806
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,740
I have to go home.

807
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,200
My wife got a lawyer.

808
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,162
I have to go home for the kids.

809
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:36,752
I'm so sorry.

810
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,886
But I'm worried about you.

811
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:49,605
Don't be.

812
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,692
I don't want...

813
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:57,527
I don't want to leave you
in the middle of all this. And...

814
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:01,910
I don't want this to be the end.

815
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,548
Please be careful.

816
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,833
What is it?

817
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:54,671
- We have to get out of here...
- Don't...

818
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:57,044
You'll get us in trouble.

819
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,012
Go.

820
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,848
I want to take you home.

821
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:10,720
- Ivan!?
- Come.

822
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:15,101
How much do you want me to pay
for these girls, to take home?

823
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,898
- You want to take them home?
- Yes!

824
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,110
It's ten times normal.

825
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:22,984
It's three thousand each.
Sorry, not this one, she's trouble.

826
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:28,454
I'm sorry, sir.

827
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:32,538
So just this one?

828
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,787
You bring the girl back, I give
you the deposit back, okay?

829
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:35,833
Okay.

830
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,755
Come on. I'll get you a drink.

831
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:12,866
Sign at the bottom, please.

832
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:49,952
- Yes?
- It's Viko.

833
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:53,039
- I can't talk right now, Viko.
- I think I know where Raya is.

834
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,544
Okay.

835
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,162
We have a bit of a problem.

836
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,577
What kind of problem?
Where's the girl?

837
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:44,504
All right. All right.

838
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:51,131
There you go, Raya.

839
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,849
- What did she say?
- Names of girls. Raya.

840
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,764
Raya!?
Raya is there?

841
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:57,103
All right. Calm down, you're okay.

842
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:58,563
- We go to Oasis?
- Yes!

843
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,853
- And IPTF?
- Fuck protocol.

844
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,647
We just raid the bar.

845
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:16,656
Here.

846
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,875
- You trust these guys?
- Yes, I do.

847
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,086
- They're going to listen to you?
- Out!

848
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,917
You sure?

849
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,257
I do trust them. Let's go.

850
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:49,823
Hello?

851
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,296
We need to bring the owner out here.
We arrest him outside.

852
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,259
I don't want him
threatening the girls. Go!

853
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,747
Here we go, go! Go!

854
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,246
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

855
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,591
Ivan Bladzic has been arrested
for human trafficking.

856
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:50,709
Get out of here.

857
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,587
You don't have to be afraid
of Ivan. He can't hurt you.

858
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:58,012
We're going to get you somewhere
safe and help get you home.

859
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,974
Raya. Raya. Come on.

860
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:10,649
These girls work here.

861
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:15,150
They have all documents,
passports.

862
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:19,701
- And you can fuck off!
- Really?

863
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,742
Fakes. Bad ones.

864
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:25,914
And you, too, fuck off.
And you, too, fuck you!

865
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:28,038
Okay, Viko, get the blankets
out of the van...

866
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,914
and get these girls out of here.

867
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,008
Okay, girls, come on.
You're safe. Just come.

868
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,968
All right, come.

869
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,511
Let's go.

870
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:38,052
Don't be afraid, we can all
go now. Raya, come on.

871
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,050
It's going to be okay. All right?

872
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,598
Now. Come on, Raya.
Let's just...

873
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,647
Come on, what's the matter?
What?

874
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,600
What's the matter?
What's...

875
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:50,648
What the fuck are you
doing here?

876
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:53,647
- We got a call about this raid.
- From who?

877
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,155
Get out.

878
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,782
Get out! Come on, get out.
Get out! Out!

879
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:05,158
Get out right now!
Get out! Out!

880
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,877
- Get your hands off me.
- Fuck!

881
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,840
Don't look at these guys.
Don't be afraid of these guys.

882
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,967
Just say you want to go
and I can walk you...

883
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:21,887
Raya, I can walk you out
of here, right now.

884
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,678
You just have to say you
want to go, that's all.

885
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:26,888
Don't look at him.

886
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,892
Look at me. I want you
to look at me.

887
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,686
You are safe.

888
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:36,026
Listen to me, don't look at him.

889
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:39,234
Out of here!
Just get out! Fuck!

890
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,654
Okay, Raya, just look at me.
Look at me. Please.

891
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:48,831
Okay. Just say yes.
Just say yes.

892
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:50,578
It's all you have to do.

893
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:57,215
Raya, please. Just say
you want to go.

894
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,173
No.

895
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:03,849
Just say you want to go.

896
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,686
No.

897
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:17,067
Fuck! What the fuck is
the matter with you?

898
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:19,732
Don't you know anything!

899
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:21,951
We are supposed
to protect these people.

900
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,695
- You're a crazy bitch!
- We are supposed...

901
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:24,867
to protect these people.

902
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,122
- I know this girl.
- I know you do.

903
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,038
I know this girl.
I can't leave her here.

904
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:31,627
Let's go. Come on, Raya.
Let's go.

905
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:36,667
- I can't leave her here.
- Look at me! Kathy!

906
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:42,222
We cannot force them.
Nothing will hold up in court.

907
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,809
Please, understand. They will be
brought down here, punished.

908
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,228
You want blood on your hands?

909
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,733
- You fuck!
- Get the fuck out of here!

910
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:57,150
You piece of shit. You fuck!

911
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:00,149
What the fuck is the matter
with you people?

912
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:02,700
What is the matter with you?

913
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:44,567
My husband arranged
for me a job.

914
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,870
But his friend
bought me for $2,000.

915
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:49,913
With renewed funding from...

916
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:53,035
USAID the Global
Displacement Agency...

917
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,880
continues to be a pioneer at
international counter-trafficking.

918
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:59,920
My sister arranged for my papers.

919
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:04,596
Her boyfriend did this for
12 other girls.

920
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,931
Mostly traffickers prey
on those they know...

921
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:09,642
banking on the fact that
the girl will trust them.

922
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:13,855
Traffickers can be fathers,
brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles...

923
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:34,042
I wanted to tell you.

924
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:44,218
It's how you pay for this.

925
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:49,591
Roman, he does...

926
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,520
How could you...

927
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:00,609
sell your own blood?

928
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:06,107
You swine.

929
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,946
You swine.

930
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,661
You swine.

931
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,045
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

932
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:25,256
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

933
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,219
Where is she?

934
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:30,298
Where is she?
Where is she?

935
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,852
Where is she?

936
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:43,111
She is no longer your sister.

937
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:47,069
Stay away from me.

938
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:13,641
Where's Raya? Where's
the little bitch?

939
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:16,811
She's in the back.

940
01:27:20,693 --> 01:27:22,934
I didn't say anything.

941
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,754
I didn't say anything.

942
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,761
Please...

943
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,552
Are you sure you want to see?

944
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,804
Excuse me.

945
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,081
Would you please cover her up?

946
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:11,675
Could you find a blanket, please?

947
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:13,886
Could you cover her up?

948
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:32,666
I am a police officer
obligated to report crimes.

949
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:36,169
I have taken statements from
women describing their physical...

950
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:38,922
psychological...

951
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:41,007
and emotional torture.

952
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:46,054
On arriving in Bosnia,
these women are sold...

953
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,733
and forced to provide
sexual services.

954
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:55,109
Their clientele consists of SPOR...

955
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,028
IPTF, local police...

956
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,910
and international employees.

957
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:06,082
Worse, they have become
in olved in the trade itself.

958
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:14,670
It is time each and
every one of you realize...

959
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:17,589
this is a serious organized crime...

960
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,805
with enormous profits.

961
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:28,229
We are peacekeepers who came
to protect the innocent...

962
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:32,776
but now prey upon them
in the worst ways possible.

963
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:40,191
We may be accused of thinking with
our heart instead of our heads...

964
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,780
but we will have our humanity.

965
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:31,124
Good morning.

966
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,836
I have to ask you to
surrender your ID.

967
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:35,880
What?

968
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:41,798
What's going on?

969
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,264
You've been ordered out
of this mission.

970
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,098
You can't be serious.

971
01:32:51,607 --> 01:32:53,268
I'll need the ID.

972
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:06,619
- Thank you. Guys...
- Come on.

973
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:15,832
Why do you want to get rid of her?

974
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,753
Madeleine, I have to protect this
organization and so should you.

975
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,220
The UN is too fragile, too important.
That's what immunity is for.

976
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:27,715
Immunity not impunity.

977
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:31,636
The United Nations was formed
from the ashes of Auschwitz.

978
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:35,105
The United States led the way and
it's a point of honour with me...

979
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:39,144
that the UN is not
remembered for raping...

980
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:41,897
the very people we must protect.

981
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:47,781
Those girls are whores of war.
It happens.

982
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:51,656
I will not dictate for morality.

983
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:53,867
So what are we dictating for?

984
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:56,745
I'll go to Washington. I'll go to
the State Department if I must.

985
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:59,919
Democra isn't even based out of the
States, it's based out of England.

986
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:02,921
It's a private corporation.
We work in the real world.

987
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,698
Thank you so much.
Really helpful.

988
01:34:42,718 --> 01:34:44,583
I had to send that e-mail.

989
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:48,178
They killed Raya.

990
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,976
- They shot her in the head.
- I know.

991
01:34:56,982 --> 01:35:00,816
She wanted to testify and
they made an example of her.

992
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:05,021
I'm responsible for this.

993
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:08,983
No, dear, you're not.

994
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:12,244
I promised her I would
protect her.

995
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:20,794
Oh God, I can't stop
thinking about her mother.

996
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:26,129
How do we tell people
what's happening here?

997
01:35:27,012 --> 01:35:31,972
Democra is registered in
the UK, in Britain.

998
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:38,012
So you are entitled
to appeal your dismissal.

999
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:42,232
We've got to get those files out
of the mission right away.

1000
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:49,024
Because you're a whistleblower,
so the press will want to know.

1001
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:53,987
I handed in my ID
and my keys.

1002
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:56,663
Shit!

1003
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,877
I don't know how
to get in there.

1004
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:05,915
We'll have to find a way.

1005
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:20,020
Zoe. Zoe!

1006
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:26,519
What are you doing here?

1007
01:36:27,072 --> 01:36:29,484
I need to get something
out of my office.

1008
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,533
I was wondering if you
could get me a set of keys.

1009
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:36,158
Kathy, I can't.

1010
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:39,748
It's too risky.
I would lose my job.

1011
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,206
I wish I could help, I really do.

1012
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:48,590
I'm sorry. I'm just not like you.

1013
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:23,576
- You scared me.
- Sorry, I didn't recognize the coat.

1014
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:27,121
We don't have much time.

1015
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:49,606
I can't go up there with you.
You understand, right?

1016
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:50,648
Yes.

1017
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:53,193
Alright, now make
certain you get everything.

1018
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,738
And that includes any files you
didn't send to I.A. or to me.

1019
01:37:56,745 --> 01:37:57,951
Yes.

1020
01:37:58,622 --> 01:38:02,160
If anybody's going to believe this,
the press needs to see it all.

1021
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,997
Okay, I'll meet you
in the atrium, right.

1022
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:07,165
Okay.

1023
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,839
You're an asshole.

1024
01:39:42,184 --> 01:39:45,597
You really didn't think you were
going to get away with this, did you?

1025
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:50,097
Those look right to you?

1026
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,651
Yes, it's all here.

1027
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,242
You're trespassing.

1028
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:06,739
So what? What are you going
to do, fire me again?

1029
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,833
You going to arrest me?
I have diplomatic immunity.

1030
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:12,248
Isn't that what you all rely
on around here?

1031
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:15,965
You had immunity. You don't
have a UN ID any more.

1032
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:18,050
You're a civilian now.
You're on your own.

1033
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,753
I'm sure the State Department
will be happy to hear...

1034
01:40:20,764 --> 01:40:22,846
- from me when I get back.
- Where do you think this comes from?

1035
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,681
The State Department
owns your contract.

1036
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,141
They don't want you here.

1037
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:28,261
Democra wants you out.

1038
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:33,857
You talk to whoever you want.
They're not listening.

1039
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:37,610
You're finished.

1040
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:20,904
Did you get what you need?

1041
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:25,154
The State Department
owns your contract.

1042
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:26,823
They don't want you here.

1043
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:29,030
Democra wants you out.

1044
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:32,787
You talk to whoever you want.
They're not listening.

1045
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:35,039
That's good.

1046
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:40,215
As soon as you get to London
take this right to the BBC, okay?

1047
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:44,257
- Thank you, Peter.
- Go.

1048
01:42:18,632 --> 01:42:22,500
I can categorically state
not one United Nations officer...

1049
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,677
has been involved in
the trafficking of a single woman.

1050
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:29,048
You believe all these victims'
claims to be false?

1051
01:42:29,184 --> 01:42:31,846
Well, I don't want to make
accusations against those girls.

1052
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:35,597
But I will assert over and over again,
I run a Zero Tolerance program...

1053
01:42:35,607 --> 01:42:37,017
for that type of activity.

1054
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:40,267
Now we've just set up a full
taskforce dedicated to abolishing...

1055
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,645
all sex trafficking
in the region.

1056
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:51,824
Thank you.

1057
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:58,957
We spoke to Bill Hynes, the senior
UN official in Bosnia at the time.

1058
01:42:58,964 --> 01:43:00,795
I saw that interview.

1059
01:43:00,799 --> 01:43:02,960
And as you watched it,
what did you think?

1060
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:06,927
I think Mr. Hynes knows
that he made a false statement.

1061
01:43:07,639 --> 01:43:09,630
So you're accusing
him of lying?

1062
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,091
Yes. Absolutely.

1063
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:15,723
We have considered
Democra's explanation...

1064
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:18,222
as to why they
dismissed Ms. Bolkovac...

1065
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:20,690
and there is no doubt
whatsoever...

1066
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,855
that the real reason
for her dismissal...

1067
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:25,070
was that she made
a protected disclosure...

1068
01:43:25,073 --> 01:43:28,065
and accordingly
was dismissed unfairly.

1069
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:31,865
You smuggled files that belonged
to the UN out of the mission.

1070
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:35,535
Don't you think that was a rather
reckless thing to do?

1071
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:39,876
Those young women had put themselves
at great risk by confiding in me.

1072
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,872
And I led them to believe
that they would receive justice...

1073
01:43:43,133 --> 01:43:45,089
but we let them down.

1074
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:48,544
So the least I can do is
let them be heard.

1075
01:43:54,937 --> 01:43:58,100
Given everything
you've been through...

1076
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:00,771
would you do it again?

1077
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:02,933
Yes.

1078
01:44:04,529 --> 01:44:05,939
Yes, I would.

1079
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:09,944
No doubt about it.
