2
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:17,540
He's in the other room.

3
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:28,175
- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.

4
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:32,013
We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.

5
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:35,391
I hear you're quite good
with puzzles and riddles.

6
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:40,271
- It's a coded message.
- It's a Playfair cipher.

7
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:44,275
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?

8
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:46,819
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.

9
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:51,073
- What do you mean by "a key"?
- A keyword or phrase.

10
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:54,493
I believe what you need is right there.

11
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:56,579
It'll take some time.

12
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:02,626
Go on. I'll take your diary.
I'll meet up with you later.

13
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:09,759
Whoa.

14
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:28,360
...calculate the distance
and you're sure to hit the mark

15
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:30,696
in about most things
as well as shootin'.

16
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:37,536
...ready to pour out all over you
like apple sass over roast pork.

17
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:45,878
I'll take care not to
give up my hold on poor De Boots

18
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:48,506
till I am quite sure of the American.

19
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:53,344
Ah, that's my own girl.

20
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,304
Augusta, dear, to your room.

21
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:03,729
...to turn you inside out, old
gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap.

22
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:15,407
Sic semper tyrannis!

23
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,592
Temples.

24
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:36,428
Gold.

25
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:40,015
CÃ­bola? This is a treasure map.

26
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,854
KGC? You're Knights of the
Golden Circle. You're a traitor.

27
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,940
You're all traitors.

28
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:53,779
- President Lincoln's been shot!
- Everybody, out! All of you!

29
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:55,739
Killer's on the loose!

30
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:02,246
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish
deciphering that code now.

31
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:10,170
- Dad!
- The war is over.

32
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,549
No!

33
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:20,431
- No!
- No!

34
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,479
You're wrong about that.

35
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,191
The war has only just begun!

36
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:39,366
Charles.
The debt that all men... men pay.

37
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,244
The debt that all men p...

38
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:45,581
Dad! No, please!

39
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:53,964
Come back. It's not fair.

40
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,217
Help! Somebody help, please!

41
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,721
So recapping:

42
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:04,808
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

43
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:08,020
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

44
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:12,691
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,

45
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:15,694
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,

46
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:18,697
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.

47
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:21,116
Thank you.

48
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:26,330
I'd like
to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.

49
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:27,414
Thank you.

50
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:33,754
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

51
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,838
Thank you.

52
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,301
Thank you, Dr. Nichols.
I only wish my grandfather

53
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,595
had been here to see this wonderful day.

54
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,181
Excuse me.
I have a question I'd like to ask.

55
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:47,059
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page

56
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:50,020
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.

57
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:51,563
Perhaps.

58
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:55,275
Perhaps not.

59
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,112
You see, I have one of those
great-great-granddaddies, like you,

60
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,991
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.

61
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:06,995
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.

62
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,039
As Silas tells it,

63
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:13,335
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

64
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,213
It was Thomas who called the meeting.

65
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:19,174
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.

66
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:21,718
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!

67
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:25,973
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...

68
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:31,186
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

69
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,941
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

70
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:42,572
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

71
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:45,867
He shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis"
after he shot Lincoln.

72
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,413
- "Thus always to... "
- "Thus always to tyrants. " We know.

73
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:54,126
- "Surratt, copiae"?
- Military supplies.

74
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:56,545
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

75
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:59,506
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

76
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:07,556
- "Thomas Gates, artifex. "
- "Designer"

77
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:10,976
- or "mastermind. "
- I know what it means.

78
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:15,314
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.

79
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,400
- I see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.

80
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,112
You see that?
Burned out right there.

81
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:25,782
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

82
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:28,660
- May I, Mr?
- Wilkinson.

83
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:31,413
I'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.

84
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,624
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.

85
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,295
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

86
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:41,548
Yes, sir, I am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.

87
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:44,009
My grandfather
told me this story himself.

88
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:47,512
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

89
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:03,361
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.

90
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,405
It can't be.

91
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:08,617
Maps to presidents' houses.

92
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:12,204
Keys to locks that don't exist.

93
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:16,374
What's the point?
What am I looking for?

94
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:19,920
Proof, proof, proof.

95
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:22,756
What proof?

96
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:47,072
Oh, wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?

97
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:51,660
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

98
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:56,164
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.

99
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:59,751
- So the author's here signing copies?
- I'm the author.

100
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,212
- You are?
- Yeah. See, uh...

101
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:05,006
There's a picture of me right there.

102
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:08,802
I think it's a pretty good picture.

103
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:12,180
I thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

104
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:16,101
Well, yes, Ben did,
but I am the co-finder.

105
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:19,271
- Oh, I've never heard of you.
- Oh!

106
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:27,028
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?

107
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:31,950
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?

108
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,163
- Yes, I do.
- Well, it's being towed.

109
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:38,415
Hm?

110
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:50,802
Wait! Wait! That's my car!

111
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:58,977
Where's the Ferrari?

112
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:03,440
- IRS impounded it.
- The IRS?

113
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:08,069
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation

114
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:10,322
on an island that didn't exist

115
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:13,450
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.

116
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:18,121
Then I got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.

117
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:22,125
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?

118
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,461
Six million dollars.

119
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,339
But enough about me.

120
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:29,799
What's new with you?

121
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:34,721
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
I'm living with my dad,

122
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:37,932
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.

123
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:40,852
I need your help.

124
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:44,147
I can't believe
you have to break into your own house.

125
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:47,901
I need to get Abigail's ID.
She has access to the Booth diary page.

126
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:50,111
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?

127
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:53,573
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.

128
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:54,699
All right.

129
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:59,245
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.

130
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,707
Go.

131
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:11,508
I'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?

132
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:15,386
I don't know. I don't know.
She started using the word "so" a lot.

133
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,846
"So?"

134
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:19,974
Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter. "

135
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,937
"So, you seem to always know what's
best. " "So, I guess I'm invisible. "

136
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:26,773
Now I've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...

137
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,650
Oh.

138
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:33,238
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.

139
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:35,365
You did that in 25 seconds.

140
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:37,909
That's why I tell people to get a dog.

141
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,497
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.

142
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:51,589
That's not Abigail's car.

143
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:55,635
She was on a date.

144
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,180
Isn't that that guy?
The White House guy?

145
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:03,017
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...

146
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,060
He's weird!

147
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:06,771
What happens if kids
don't find all the eggs?

148
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:09,607
Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.

149
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:10,900
Pretty much.

150
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:13,528
What clever repartee.
She must like him.

151
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:16,614
All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.

152
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:19,200
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...

153
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:21,035
Oh, Abigail.

154
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:24,831
- What are you doing here?
- I just needed to get some things.

155
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:28,293
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

156
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,587
How did you get in, Ben?

157
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:36,217
Riley! Come out here!

158
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,263
What?

159
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:46,477
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

160
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,606
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance?

161
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:52,692
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

162
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,778
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

163
00:12:55,862 --> 00:13:00,408
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

164
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:02,160
What?

165
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,787
Um, maybe I should go.

166
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:08,499
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

167
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,794
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

168
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,129
You do?

169
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:17,091
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

170
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:20,261
- Awkward.
- Oh, great.

171
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,473
- Good night.
- Good night.

172
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:26,726
I cannot believe you broke in.

173
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,395
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

174
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,190
Hand it over, Ben.

175
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:34,817
I need to see
the Booth diary page.

176
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:38,696
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

177
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,533
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

178
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:45,912
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

179
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,164
It could have been erased or faded.

180
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:51,709
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

181
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,795
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

182
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,381
That department reports
to your department.

183
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,758
Come on. One look under infrared.

184
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:00,802
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

185
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:07,934
Both of them?

186
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,065
We've been looking
at this page for hours.

187
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:15,691
There's nothing there.

188
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:20,988
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

189
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:23,491
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

190
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:26,869
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

191
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:31,082
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?

192
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,251
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

193
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:38,214
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

194
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,926
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

195
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:45,680
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

196
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:48,558
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

197
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:53,396
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

198
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:57,525
- Ben.
- What?

199
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:58,985
Look at this.

200
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:02,780
- See that?
- Oh.

201
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:07,618
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge. "

202
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:09,787
It's nothing.

203
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:15,543
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

204
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,087
The letters are backwards.

205
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,131
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

206
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:22,466
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

207
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:28,306
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

208
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:32,810
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

209
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:35,104
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

210
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,440
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

211
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:40,318
- All right.
- Uh, can I get a printout of this?

212
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:43,279
There's a billion words
in the English language.

213
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:46,407
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.

214
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,034
A. Aardvark.

215
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,079
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but I don't think this is gonna stop

216
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:56,125
Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

217
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,005
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

218
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:04,050
What if he isn't innocent?

219
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,397
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.

220
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:20,608
What did he find now? Atlantis?

221
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:23,361
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.

222
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:25,488
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.

223
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:27,657
"On the page are the names
of the conspirators

224
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:31,786
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,

225
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:35,498
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great-grandfather

226
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:38,167
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates. "

227
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,129
- Thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?

228
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:46,384
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page

229
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:49,804
for 140 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?

230
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:54,141
- Why?
- We'll find out.

231
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,518
Better.

232
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:57,686
Bacon.

233
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,525
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.

234
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:10,825
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.

235
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,413
We're grateful
to the Wilkinson family

236
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:17,248
for coming forth with the page.

237
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:22,128
On the page is a name of a previously
unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.

238
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:25,714
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.

239
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,260
It's on the Internet!

240
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:33,514
- No stopping it now.
- Gates may have been the architect...

241
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:37,184
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.

242
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:40,604
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.

243
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:44,984
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

244
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:46,902
We have a story. We have nothing.

245
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:50,489
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

246
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:53,617
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

247
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,954
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

248
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,584
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. History.

249
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,253
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

250
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:07,423
You and I both know he burned the page

251
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:09,967
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

252
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,844
That's what we're going to prove.

253
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,430
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

254
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:17,850
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

255
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:20,603
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.

256
00:18:20,728 --> 00:18:25,274
Grandpa heard his father say,
"Treasure map. "

257
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:29,403
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?

258
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:33,032
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?

259
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:35,910
- Wait a minute.
- What?

260
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,206
He took his son's hand.

261
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:45,377
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

262
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:50,299
- "The debt that all men pay. "
- "The debt that all men pay"?

263
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:52,509
The debt that Thomas paid.

264
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:54,970
That's five letters.

265
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:56,513
Oh!

266
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,765
Try "Death. "

267
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,558
- What?
- It's the keycode.

268
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:01,477
The debt that all men pay is death.

269
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,274
All right.

270
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,196
L- A-B-O-U-L...

271
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:14,823
It's Lab-ool...

272
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:19,078
Lab-ahl... La...

273
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:20,329
It's gibberish.

274
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,623
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!

275
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:25,334
- What is that?
- It's a who. Ãˆdouard Laboulaye.

276
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,418
Where's the phone?

277
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,171
I don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.

278
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:33,258
- Temporary till I find a new place.
- Find the old one. I like her.

279
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:37,513
- Hi.
- Dr. Chase.

280
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,807
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.

281
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,142
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

282
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:47,773
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

283
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,652
Of course. I was actually going
to call you about the diary page.

284
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,987
- Any news?
- Well...

285
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:58,367
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.

286
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:01,995
Take a look.

287
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:05,541
Random letters. A cipher?

288
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,292
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?

289
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:09,378
He's the one that discovered it.

290
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:13,006
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

291
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:18,095
- I need one minute.
- Please, take your time.

292
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,388
Hey. What?

293
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:21,932
We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye. "

294
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:23,725
The cipher spells "Laboulaye. "

295
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:27,813
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. It could be nothing.

296
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:31,608
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,

297
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,903
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.

298
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:37,114
L- A-D, lad... ladder...

299
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,866
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?

300
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:41,326
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!

301
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,456
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning

302
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,125
right around the time
Lincoln was assassinated?

303
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,335
OK, Ben, I've got to go.

304
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:52,880
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...

305
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:56,383
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.

306
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:59,178
- Dr. Gates?
- Yes.

307
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:04,391
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
I couldn't help but overhear.

308
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:07,519
Laboulaye? As in Ãˆdouard Laboulaye?

309
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:10,189
He seems to believe so, yes.

310
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:12,649
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.

311
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:15,986
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?

312
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:19,948
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.

313
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:21,867
Did you learn that from my book?

314
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:27,539
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.

315
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:31,084
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

316
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,463
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

317
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:38,717
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

318
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:44,014
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

319
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:47,184
So the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?

320
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:48,352
Exactly.

321
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:50,729
Is there more than one?

322
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,358
There are three, actually, Riley.

323
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:58,862
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.

324
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:01,782
But he only referred to one
as his "lady. "

325
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:21,343
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.

326
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:23,011
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

327
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:27,140
Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

328
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:30,018
Let me get there.
It's not as easy as it looks.

329
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:32,521
No. Believe me, I understand.

330
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:38,276
Excuse me, officer. May I help you?

331
00:22:38,777 --> 00:22:41,613
Ah, American, eh?

332
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,240
Of course you see no problem

333
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:46,576
in disturbing everyone's
pleasant morning

334
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,995
- with your buzzing there.
- Hey!

335
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:53,375
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?

336
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,168
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.

337
00:22:57,587 --> 00:23:00,757
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government
should be set up so that... "

338
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:03,927
"... no man need
be afraid of another. "

339
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:06,221
- That's very good.
- Thank you.

340
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:10,058
- I'm astonished.
- I got it, I got it.

341
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:13,228
- I hope you read French.
- May I?

342
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:16,523
He's a cop.

343
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:22,362
Um... "Across the sea
these twins stand determined... "

344
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,906
- Resolute.
- "Resolute," yeah.

345
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,909
"... to preserve what we are looking for.

346
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:31,830
- Uh... Laboulaye, 1876."
- Six.

347
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:35,417
- It's a clue.
- "These twins stand resolute. "

348
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,420
Let's see. Resolute twins.

349
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,465
Resolute.

350
00:23:42,257 --> 00:23:45,051
Resolute. And then twins.

351
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:50,765
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?

352
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:54,394
That's ridiculous.
HMS Resolute.

353
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:59,774
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1800s.

354
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:04,821
It was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.

355
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:07,365
When the ship was finally retired,

356
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:12,412
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.

357
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,873
VoilÃ . Resolute twins.

358
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:19,294
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.

359
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:21,630
How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?

360
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:24,299
Don't know. Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

361
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:28,386
He's going to call you a cab.

362
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,013
OK?

363
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:33,725
- Nice helicopter. Is that yours?
- Yes, actually. It is.

364
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,896
- OK, so you get the ticket.
- Great.

365
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:41,983
Mitch Wilkinson studied history
at Virginia Military Institute.

366
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:45,904
Graduated 1978. Ran a private security
company which had contracts in Iraq

367
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:48,782
during the invasion,
and in the Congo in the late '90s.

368
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:53,119
These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.

369
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:56,706
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...

370
00:24:57,457 --> 00:25:01,044
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?

371
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:05,340
Something he could sell to a private
collector for a good deal of money?

372
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,780
So the queen's office is here.

373
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:12,907
The elevator shaft gets you close,

374
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:16,870
but the only direct access
is through security.

375
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:20,373
- That should be exciting.
- We got to get you in that room.

376
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,418
- Hi, Dad.
- Ben.

377
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:26,087
It's Patrick Gates' phone.
He's calling Ben.

378
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:27,213
Give me that.

379
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:30,967
The house was broken into
last night. I was attacked.

380
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,552
Call the police. I'm coming home.

381
00:26:32,677 --> 00:26:34,429
- What?
- What good would that do?

382
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:37,599
They didn't take anything.
And besides, I'm fine.

383
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:41,144
OK. We're in London.
We're going to Buckingham Palace.

384
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:44,439
We have an appointment
with the curator tomorrow afternoon.

385
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:46,691
- Son, just be careful. Goodbye.
- Bye.

386
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:48,610
Someone else is after the treasure.

387
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:51,112
Of course someone else
is after the treasure.

388
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:55,033
- It's the axiom of treasure hunting.
- We have to hurry and see that desk.

389
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:57,285
We don't want to miss that appointment.

390
00:26:59,537 --> 00:27:02,582
- Hi. Ben Gates.
- See security. They'll let you in.

391
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:19,724
Wow.

392
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:45,542
OK. It's teatime, chaps.

393
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:02,642
Looking for the curator's office.
Which way was it again?

394
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:05,186
Follow the stairs round,
then turn first left.

395
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,896
Thank you so much.

396
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:14,028
- Ben.
- Abigail.

397
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:16,364
- What's she doing here?
- What're you doing?

398
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:19,534
Your dad called me.
Said your next clue was here.

399
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:21,536
- She's really there?
- Ben...

400
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:23,162
- Drop her. Lose her.
- I want to help.

401
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:25,873
That's very nice,
but it's a bad time right now.

402
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:29,669
- A bad time, right now?
- It's a bad time.

403
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:34,424
OK, I just flew all the way
to London to offer my help...

404
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:36,843
- Remember the plan.
- You don't need it?

405
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:38,678
You're the one making a scene.

406
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:42,181
- I... I'm not making a scene right now.
- We want to make a scene.

407
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:45,893
Well then, fine! If that's what
you want, let's have it out now!

408
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:50,148
- So subtle.
- Let me guess? It's the wrong time.

409
00:28:50,273 --> 00:28:53,067
It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!

410
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:56,112
Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,

411
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:58,781
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!

412
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,867
You're wrong to assume
I'd like the chair.

413
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,787
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.

414
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:08,374
She thinks that even when I'm right,
I'm wrong! Isn't that right?

415
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:12,295
Abigail, just because
I answer a question quickly

416
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,755
doesn't make it wrong.

417
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:17,508
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.

418
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,260
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.

419
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:21,345
You and your missis, take it outside.

420
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:25,475
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!

421
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,519
You take the missis outside.
I'm staying right here.

422
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,147
- Ben!
- Whee!

423
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,940
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hello.

424
00:29:33,024 --> 00:29:35,485
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.

425
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:38,571
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!

426
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:40,615
Going to arrest a man for that?

427
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,118
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?

428
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:45,787
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.

429
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,455
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

430
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,581
- Sir!
- Haggis!

431
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:52,502
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

432
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:54,670
Here they are, standing in a row!

433
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:57,840
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!

434
00:29:57,924 --> 00:30:00,384
That was brilliant.

435
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:04,847
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.

436
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:08,017
- You're saying that I'm never right?
- I did not say that.

437
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,144
Hoo! So I'm wrong again.

438
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,356
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.

439
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:17,652
Your mother told me about you.

440
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:23,157
- In here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list

441
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:26,410
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...

442
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,413
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.

443
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:31,457
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.

444
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,752
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.

445
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:36,796
What is going on?

446
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:40,800
I'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.

447
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,970
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out

448
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:46,806
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out I was

449
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:49,517
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.

450
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,520
Where "I assume I'm right. "
Get us out. Which I don't get.

451
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:55,523
If I'm right, after I assume I'm right,
then I'm correct.

452
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,025
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,

453
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,112
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.

454
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,198
I get lucky a lot.

455
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,826
So where does that leave me, Ben?

456
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:09,161
You guys are so great together.

457
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:11,080
- Want to know why I'm here?
- Uh-huh.

458
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:16,544
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

459
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:19,755
Does that help?

460
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,302
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.

461
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:27,888
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be

462
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:30,558
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

463
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:34,020
Door number one, opening.

464
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:38,190
OK. Let me try this out.

465
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:42,361
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

466
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,196
Yes. Thank you.

467
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:45,906
Ridiculous. You're staying.

468
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,908
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.

469
00:31:47,992 --> 00:31:50,536
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

470
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:53,539
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

471
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:57,126
You should be near
a service elevator.

472
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:59,420
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

473
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:03,507
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

474
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,135
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

475
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:08,804
- No.
- Don't let her go.

476
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:10,306
Abigail...

477
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,392
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

478
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,353
Hold this.

479
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,779
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

480
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:25,946
Yeah.

481
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:35,748
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

482
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:37,583
So?

483
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,419
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

484
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,423
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

485
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,178
Let's go.

486
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,810
OK, now turn left.

487
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:59,396
- Dead end.
- I mean right. Go right.

488
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:08,823
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

489
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:18,165
Go, go.

490
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,586
That's it.

491
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,131
The Resolute desk.

492
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:28,634
We're looking for...

493
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:34,515
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

494
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,395
Hey, look at this.

495
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:47,570
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.

496
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:52,825
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

497
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,995
He made Chinese puzzle boxes.

498
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,421
- Oh...
- What?

499
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:11,093
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

500
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,722
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

501
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:16,724
What about a year?

502
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:21,604
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.

503
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,439
So you go one...

504
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:27,359
Eight.

505
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,449
One.

506
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:38,662
Nine.

507
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:44,209
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

508
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:46,587
on the statue in Paris. Let's try
that.

509
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:48,130
One.

510
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:51,717
Eight.

511
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,013
Seven.

512
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,144
Six.

513
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:29,880
Uh-oh.

514
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:31,632
New rules.

515
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:35,803
These markings, like Incan or Aztec.

516
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:38,097
I have never seen any symbols like this.

517
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:43,519
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

518
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:44,978
What do you think it means?

519
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,607
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

520
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,402
Uh-oh.

521
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,780
Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of
there.

522
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:04,665
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.

523
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,671
The fire alarm's gone off.

524
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,798
Uh-oh. God save the queen.

525
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,759
All units, go to action zebra.

526
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,928
- What's going on?
- Haven't the foggiest.

527
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:24,101
Someone or something is causing this.

528
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:27,437
- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.

529
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:30,774
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.

530
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:50,752
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.

531
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:54,464
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.

532
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:59,887
- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- I got them. They're at the main gate.

533
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:20,866
- Oi! Sparkle. Come on.
- OK. Here we go.

534
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:22,492
I'm a little bit allergic.

535
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:24,745
- Riley.
- Thank you. OK.

536
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,123
- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sit! Sorry!

537
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,752
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can I see the thing?

538
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:34,671
Daniel, hold it.

539
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:38,508
What is that?

540
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:41,261
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?

541
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:44,014
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

542
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,350
It's an incredible discovery.

543
00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:51,438
- Wilkinson.
- Stop them. Go, go, go!

544
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,942
- He's the one after the treasure.
- I'll drive.

545
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:00,739
We're in England.

546
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,122
It's a gun! Get down!

547
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:15,670
- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.

548
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,225
Hey, who are you?

549
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:45,367
Sorry.

550
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,580
- Hey!
- Oi!

551
00:38:56,878 --> 00:39:00,048
- Ben, they're getting closer.
- What is their problem?

552
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,344
Whoa!

553
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,973
- Go left! Go left!
- Hold on.

554
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,356
Turn, turn!

555
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,316
Watch out!

556
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,116
Everybody OK?

557
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:34,416
- Come on, come on.
- Danny, I want them stopped.

558
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,171
Look out!

559
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:41,923
Ah!

560
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:51,683
Ah!

561
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:15,206
Go. Go, go, go, go!

562
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,377
Did you see where he went?

563
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:27,177
- What is that? Someone's phone.
- It's him.

564
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:30,430
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...

565
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:32,682
This has to end
before someone gets hurt.

566
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:35,769
Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.

567
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,145
Tell that to my father.

568
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:42,942
Moron!

569
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,570
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?

570
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:50,784
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?

571
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:56,498
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!

572
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:01,002
Get out of the way!

573
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:06,341
- Did I just run over a man's foot?
- Watch the people!

574
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,643
Go! Go! Faster!

575
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,116
- Right over there.
- I got them.

576
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:35,245
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?

577
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:38,790
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.

578
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:45,004
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.

579
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,257
Ah! Ah!

580
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:59,686
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.

581
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:02,439
- Okey-dokey.
- You can't do it?

582
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:05,358
No, I can. I just don't like
that you assume that I can.

583
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,027
Why, thank you, Riley.

584
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,177
Get it!

585
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:36,556
Stop! Stop!

586
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,454
- He's got it.
- What is it?

587
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,998
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

588
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:13,217
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.

589
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:16,346
Nice to see you two together again.

590
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:18,598
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

591
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:22,143
Oh, I was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.

592
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:35,323
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that

593
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,910
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

594
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:42,372
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

595
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:49,128
I can identify one symbol.

596
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:52,256
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

597
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:54,342
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.

598
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:57,345
That symbol is CÃ­bola.

599
00:43:58,179 --> 00:43:59,305
That's CÃ­bola.

600
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:02,684
The City of Gold.

601
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,560
The City of Gold.

602
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:11,567
"In 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

603
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:13,486
There were only four survivors.

604
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:18,574
One was a slave named EstebÃ¡n
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

605
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,494
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

606
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:23,454
a city built from solid gold.

607
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:29,544
Later, when EstebÃ¡n tried to find
the city again, he never could.

608
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:35,216
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

609
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:40,096
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

610
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:44,600
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it. "

611
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:55,027
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

612
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:57,196
My God.

613
00:44:58,156 --> 00:44:59,699
I'm going to go talk to her.

614
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,997
- You're coming with me.
- No!

615
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:10,334
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

616
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:11,752
There are several others.

617
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:14,172
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

618
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:17,216
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

619
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:20,511
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

620
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:23,431
That long?

621
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:27,852
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

622
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:30,646
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

623
00:45:31,314 --> 00:45:35,109
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

624
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:37,612
- Who?
- His mom.

625
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:44,702
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

626
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:48,539
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.

627
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:50,791
I hate her!

628
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:54,295
We're in the right place.

629
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,593
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

630
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:02,511
- Hi, Mom.
- Benjamin!

631
00:46:02,637 --> 00:46:05,765
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

632
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:06,807
Hi.

633
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,060
Oh.

634
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:14,273
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

635
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:16,192
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

636
00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:19,153
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

637
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:22,198
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

638
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:25,242
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

639
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:29,455
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

640
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:32,625
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

641
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,878
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

642
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:39,298
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

643
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:42,426
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

644
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:44,595
You thought it had secret stitching.

645
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,139
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

646
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:50,559
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

647
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:54,855
I need you to take a look at this.

648
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:58,567
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

649
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:01,195
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

650
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:04,949
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

651
00:47:05,074 --> 00:47:08,202
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

652
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,538
Yes, of course you were.

653
00:47:13,457 --> 00:47:16,711
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

654
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:19,630
Mom, this is actually very important.

655
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:24,009
All right. What have we got here?

656
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,432
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird. " And that means...

657
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:36,522
Uh, "noble bird. "

658
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:39,775
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

659
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:43,112
and give you passage
to the sacred temple. "

660
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:52,997
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for CÃ­bola, don't you?

661
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:55,416
Well, that is exactly what it is.

662
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:59,587
No, this glyph doesn't mean "CÃ­bola. "
It means "the center of the world. "

663
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:03,549
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

664
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:07,344
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

665
00:48:07,428 --> 00:48:09,263
- Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.

666
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:12,808
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

667
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,060
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

668
00:48:15,144 --> 00:48:17,396
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

669
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:22,401
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

670
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,739
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

671
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:31,577
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

672
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:33,996
I'm sorry.

673
00:48:34,872 --> 00:48:36,290
Not that I'm surprised.

674
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:40,836
At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

675
00:48:41,504 --> 00:48:42,796
What?

676
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:45,633
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

677
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:48,385
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

678
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,975
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

679
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:56,518
So where is it?

680
00:48:56,685 --> 00:49:01,232
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute. "

681
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:04,777
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

682
00:49:04,902 --> 00:49:08,405
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

683
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,366
President's desk?

684
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,785
The president. What president?

685
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:15,788
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.

686
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,373
But that means...

687
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:18,791
Wait, so we have to...

688
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,252
The White House?

689
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:26,131
The Oval Office... to be exact.

690
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:30,511
Why would I overreact to that?

691
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:39,061
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

692
00:49:41,188 --> 00:49:42,189
Thank you.

693
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:48,112
It's early, pre-Columbian.

694
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:50,447
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

695
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:53,826
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

696
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:56,704
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

697
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:58,163
Where are we to find them?

698
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:02,209
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

699
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:03,293
What do you mean?

700
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:07,631
These glyphs here... they're cut off.

701
00:50:07,715 --> 00:50:10,843
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

702
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:13,762
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

703
00:50:14,138 --> 00:50:18,517
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

704
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,811
Look at this. Look.

705
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:22,688
Small door on the front of the desk.

706
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:26,233
FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

707
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:29,236
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

708
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:32,489
This could work.

709
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:36,285
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

710
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:38,829
I think you're right.

711
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:45,335
We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.

712
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:49,506
Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.

713
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:54,553
- That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

714
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:57,765
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

715
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,558
Yeah, I love it.

716
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:05,230
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

717
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:07,733
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

718
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:09,902
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

719
00:51:10,027 --> 00:51:13,405
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

720
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,908
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

721
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:18,952
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

722
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:22,080
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

723
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:25,584
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

724
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:29,171
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

725
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:32,216
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

726
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:35,427
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

727
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:38,472
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

728
00:51:40,224 --> 00:51:42,684
What is going on
with the education in America?

729
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,729
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

730
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:48,273
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

731
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,901
...with Gates.
- Connor.

732
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:53,028
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

733
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:58,617
Aren't you going to ask him?

734
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,160
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

735
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:03,372
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

736
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:08,585
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

737
00:52:08,669 --> 00:52:11,797
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

738
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,717
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

739
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:18,971
- I can do that.
- Really?

740
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:20,013
You see?

741
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:22,015
- You can?
- Yeah.

742
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:26,353
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

743
00:52:26,436 --> 00:52:28,105
Connor rocks.

744
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:31,775
Well... here we are.

745
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:34,236
- Mm.
- Wow.

746
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:38,907
Empire furnishings
and crenelated molding. Love it.

747
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:40,826
Hm.

748
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:43,787
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

749
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:46,832
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

750
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:48,041
Oh. Sorry.

751
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:54,339
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

752
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:58,051
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

753
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,762
playing underneath
while his father was working.

754
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:02,723
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

755
00:53:02,806 --> 00:53:05,642
But many people don't know

756
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:09,146
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

757
00:53:09,271 --> 00:53:11,273
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

758
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:13,608
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

759
00:53:13,734 --> 00:53:16,611
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

760
00:53:16,737 --> 00:53:18,155
And Ford, of course.

761
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,741
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

762
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:22,826
- No.
- Yes.

763
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:25,620
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

764
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:29,332
Oh! I... I did, yes.

765
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:32,669
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

766
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:36,548
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

767
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:39,551
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

768
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:40,969
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

769
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:43,346
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

770
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:46,641
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

771
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:48,060
and check it out?

772
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,772
I'll check over here.

773
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,283
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

774
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:13,335
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

775
00:54:21,468 --> 00:54:23,136
Oh, no.

776
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:32,312
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

777
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,277
Connor!

778
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:43,573
- You found it.
- I did.

779
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,418
Thank you so much!

780
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:57,337
Uh...

781
00:54:58,213 --> 00:55:00,966
You're just the best. Mm.

782
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:06,096
Mm!

783
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,061
Mm!

784
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,146
Mm!

785
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:20,944
Thank you.

786
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:25,156
OK.

787
00:55:27,784 --> 00:55:29,995
- Empty.
- Someone must've taken it.

788
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,665
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

789
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,875
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

790
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:39,504
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.

791
00:55:39,629 --> 00:55:41,423
It's not the presidential seal.

792
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:45,135
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

793
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,138
- I'm not sure what this is.
- What do we do?

794
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:49,806
Did none of you read my book?

795
00:55:51,808 --> 00:55:53,977
The eagle clutching the scroll.

796
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:56,146
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

797
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:58,315
But it's not something I could tell you.

798
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:03,361
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

799
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:13,371
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

800
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:14,998
Chapter 13.

801
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:24,049
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book. "

802
00:56:24,174 --> 00:56:28,303
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

803
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:31,765
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

804
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:35,643
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

805
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:40,065
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

806
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:44,903
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

807
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:48,907
And the coup de grÃ¢ce... Area 51.

808
00:56:49,032 --> 00:56:52,118
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

809
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:55,121
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

810
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:57,373
It's just totally...

811
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:58,708
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

812
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:03,546
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

813
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,758
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

814
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:09,385
Same symbol.

815
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:12,889
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.

816
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:14,682
The eagle and the scroll,

817
00:57:14,808 --> 00:57:19,020
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

818
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,898
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

819
00:57:22,023 --> 00:57:24,859
is now in the President's Secret Book?

820
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:28,571
Ben.

821
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,324
If it was you trying to convince me...

822
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:35,829
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

823
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,293
The eagle with the scroll?

824
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:47,048
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

825
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:49,968
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

826
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:51,636
You bought Riley's book.

827
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:55,139
Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

828
00:57:55,223 --> 00:57:57,684
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

829
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:00,144
Does the president have a secret book?

830
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,319
Do you like ducks?

831
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:12,991
There is a book.

832
00:58:14,576 --> 00:58:16,369
Why are you telling me out here?

833
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,998
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

834
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:22,333
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

835
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:26,796
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

836
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,465
The book is passed
from president to president,

837
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:31,801
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

838
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:33,886
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?

839
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:37,515
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

840
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,976
Well, you never know.

841
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:44,063
All I need is a few minutes with him.

842
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:46,733
A few minutes? Really?

843
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,027
Even if you were married
to the president,

844
00:58:49,152 --> 00:58:51,404
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

845
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:54,449
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

846
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,826
How do you expect
to get the president alone?

847
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:59,996
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

848
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:03,875
People used to say, "The
United States are. " Are

849
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:09,297
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is. "

850
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:15,636
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

851
00:59:15,762 --> 00:59:17,889
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

852
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,475
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

853
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:22,852
With his life.

854
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:28,316
So how am I gonna get him alone?

855
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,279
I'm gonna kidnap him.

856
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,909
I'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.

857
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:43,706
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

858
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:47,043
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

859
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:49,087
Are you out of your mind?

860
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,215
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

861
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,675
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

862
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:58,930
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

863
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:01,224
- What?
- I'm in.

864
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:04,102
Sir, we have to move the party.

865
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:07,105
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

866
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:09,649
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

867
01:00:09,774 --> 01:00:13,194
- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the Washington Gazette.

868
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:17,365
They want a quote on, "Is the president
being insensitive to minority issues?"

869
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:20,618
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

870
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,287
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

871
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:27,083
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

872
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:32,171
- I... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

873
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:35,007
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

874
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:37,343
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

875
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:40,805
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

876
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:45,059
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

877
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,312
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

878
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:50,565
Book it before someone else does.

879
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,864
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here

880
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,324
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.

881
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:32,607
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

882
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:35,359
Are you aware that you are
in a restricted area?

883
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:37,987
Yeah, but this is
where the fish are, son.

884
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:41,449
That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.

885
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,665
Are you aware that according
to article one, section 25

886
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:53,336
of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?

887
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:58,299
Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?

888
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:03,471
I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.

889
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:14,523
Maybe one day I'll wear this thing
to a party I was actually invited to.

890
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:27,203
Twenty hundred time check. Station 11.

891
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:29,872
- All clear. Perimeter secure.
- Hey.

892
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:33,250
You didn't happen to see
a cute brunette wandering around?

893
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:36,420
- Went to get a drink, she disappeared.
- No, sir.

894
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,631
I've got no game tonight.

895
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:49,558
Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.

896
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:53,646
Prime Minister, it's a delight
to have you back in the States.

897
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:57,858
Spread the word, contribution limits
not enforced on the president's birth...

898
01:02:58,025 --> 01:02:59,527
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

899
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:03,280
- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure?
- Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah.

900
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:06,659
- We won't keep you.
- Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.

901
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:11,038
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
for me to be invited here tonight, sir.

902
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:14,959
Yeah, you must have
the Secret Service hopping about now.

903
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:16,377
Sir?

904
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:18,504
Considering your discovered lineage.

905
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:21,132
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that...
- Carry on.

906
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:24,385
I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are

907
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:28,472
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.

908
01:03:28,556 --> 01:03:30,099
Have a look at that.

909
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:33,769
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.

910
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:36,689
Mr. President,
that is exactly what it is.

911
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:40,526
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.

912
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,403
It belonged to my great uncle.

913
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,655
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.

914
01:03:44,697 --> 01:03:47,992
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

915
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:51,620
Charlotte, who lived here
and worked here at Mount Vernon.

916
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:55,040
- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.

917
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:59,378
This line is an underground tunnel,
an escape route that was never found.

918
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:03,132
I wonder...
I wonder if it's still there.

919
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:06,302
Well...

920
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:10,055
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

921
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,349
Are we allowed to do that?

922
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:16,145
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the president.

923
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,479
Can I come with you?

924
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,775
- You guys are just everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

925
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:24,361
- Give my friend your flashlight.
- Thank you.

926
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,240
According to this map, it should be...

927
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:33,329
It's one... two. In here.

928
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:35,039
Yeah, should be in here.

929
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:38,042
- May I?
- Absolutely.

930
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,627
All right.

931
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:46,467
You know, Craig,
I appreciate you doing your job,

932
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,510
but I have no enemies down here.

933
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,348
In the cellar. In this tiny little room.

934
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:55,100
I'll just wait here, then.

935
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,571
Over here.

936
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:14,912
- That's the mark of George Washington.
- Only it's slightly different.

937
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:18,499
- How?
- These axes, the angle's off.

938
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:25,255
For it to correspond with the ones on
the map, it should form a perfect V.

939
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:32,680
OK, what else?

940
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:35,516
The arrowhead...

941
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,770
...is sideways.

942
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:49,613
We're all right.
Don't worry.

943
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:56,286
Look at that.

944
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,080
Come on.

945
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:05,337
Mr. President?

946
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:09,466
We have a breach
in zone nine! There's...

947
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:15,931
- Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One!
- Perimeter detail, lock down all exits!

948
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:19,518
- Gates, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

949
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:23,313
I need to ask you a question,
which I know you can't answer

950
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:26,233
- unless we're alone.
- Two coming in!

951
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:30,446
I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar,
I want a jackhammer, now!

952
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,991
Tom, alert the vice president.

953
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:37,786
Mr. President, sometime between 1880,

954
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,956
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,

955
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:45,586
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

956
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:49,381
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

957
01:06:49,548 --> 01:06:54,219
A treasure map to CÃ­bola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

958
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,680
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

959
01:06:56,805 --> 01:07:00,100
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

960
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:04,396
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

961
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,023
You've been in my desk too?

962
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:09,151
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

963
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:12,029
...in the President's Book, sir.

964
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,075
The book known only to our presidents.

965
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:20,621
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

966
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:28,170
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

967
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:34,092
I saw the seal in the desk, sir.
I know the map exists.

968
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:38,180
You're not going to tell me
how to get out of here

969
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:41,600
- unless you get what you want.
- The way out is that direction,

970
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,560
and I'll show you.

971
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:45,687
You don't negotiate very well, do you?

972
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:47,898
No, sir.

973
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:49,775
Mr. President!

974
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,485
Where are my sledgehammers?

975
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,617
I don't get you, Gates.

976
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:01,536
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,

977
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:03,956
just to clear your ancestor's name.

978
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:07,084
The way out is just down those stairs.

979
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:11,213
Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

980
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,758
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

981
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:17,427
to his country to stop the KGC.

982
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:21,348
When someone dies for their country,
I believe they should be honored.

983
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,308
"Last full measure of devotion"?

984
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:26,812
Lincoln is my favorite president, sir.
No offense.

985
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:31,400
None taken. He's my favorite too.

986
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:36,363
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,

987
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:39,783
"Will you agree to let me see it?"

988
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:43,120
Even if something like that
really did exist,

989
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:46,123
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

990
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,583
Because it will probably lead us

991
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:52,796
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.

992
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:56,383
A huge piece of culture lost.

993
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:59,553
You can give that history
back to its descendants.

994
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:03,807
And because you're the president
of the United States, sir.

995
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:08,729
Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,

996
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:11,690
or the weight of history
that falls upon you.

997
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,318
I believe you
to be an honorable man, sir.

998
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,698
People don't believe that stuff anymore.

999
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,285
They want to believe it.

1000
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:50,270
Nearest highway is that direction.
You'll understand if we part ways here.

1001
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,652
- Gates.
- Sir?

1002
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:00,780
The following conversation
never happened.

1003
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:03,617
The book exists.

1004
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:07,245
- Where is it?
- Where else do you keep a book?

1005
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:09,164
In the Library of Congress.

1006
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:14,544
X, Y, two, three, four,
seven, eight, six.

1007
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:15,921
Thank you, sir.

1008
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:21,801
You'll also need to know
three, seven, nine, four.

1009
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:23,178
Got it.

1010
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:27,891
- And, Gates...
- Sir?

1011
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:33,271
Two hundred people know you held me
against my will. I can't tell them why.

1012
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:35,690
Unless you find what you're looking for,

1013
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:38,526
you'll be charged
with kidnapping the president.

1014
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:42,948
- You know what that means.
- Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.

1015
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:50,497
- I want you to do something for me.
- It would be a privilege, sir.

1016
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:55,377
Page 47. Just have a look at that.

1017
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:01,841
Riley, meet me at the
Library of Congress in 20 minutes.

1018
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:05,553
OK.

1019
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:13,812
Sadusky.

1020
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:19,317
The president's been what?

1021
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,737
Gates.

1022
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,328
X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1023
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:34,833
X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.
X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1024
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,501
- Hey.
- Hey.

1025
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,294
We're close.

1026
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:51,850
- Where do we start?
- XY is the book classification code.

1027
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:55,437
Stands for special collections,
which means very special books.

1028
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:58,481
- Where are they?
- This way. We'll sneak in.

1029
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,422
This will be good.

1030
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:27,844
Here we go. XA... XM...

1031
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:36,311
Look. Do you have a code?

1032
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:39,439
Three-seven-nine-four.

1033
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,490
What did the president say
the number was?

1034
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,742
Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1035
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,835
Two-three-six-seven...

1036
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,005
X- Y-two-three-three,
two-three-seven-eight... Here.

1037
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,715
Two-three-four-seven-nine-one.

1038
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:08,718
- Two-three-four-seven-nine...
- Seventy-six, 78...

1039
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,053
It's not there.

1040
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:14,682
Maybe someone checked it out.

1041
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:20,522
- Why send us here if there's no book?
- He probably wanted us to get caught.

1042
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,282
Here.

1043
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:50,718
- What is that?
- It's a six-dial combination lock.

1044
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,681
The location is the combination.

1045
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,809
The location is the combination.

1046
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,953
Yes. I was right.

1047
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,247
Well done, Mr. Poole.

1048
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,006
Eagle and the scroll.

1049
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:42,311
- Area 51!
- Shh!

1050
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,942
- Kennedy assassination.
- Shh! We don't have time.

1051
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,069
Yeah, it's true.

1052
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,742
Here. Wait.

1053
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:59,954
"April 1865. Queen Victoria
sends Pike two coded missives.

1054
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:04,584
The first is received.
Contains information regarding

1055
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:08,004
New World treasure. The City of Gold. "

1056
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,966
Wait. The queen
wanted to help the Confederacy?

1057
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,720
- A divided America'd have been weaker.
- Needed cotton from the South.

1058
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,890
"The second missive was thought
to contain a Playfair cipher

1059
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:22,894
suggesting contact with Laboulaye,
who'll hide clues before his death. "

1060
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:26,689
The cipher written into the Booth
diary page that Thomas tried to burn.

1061
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:29,066
- The one we have.
- Exactly. "1880.

1062
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:34,071
Resolute desk arrives in Washington,
sent by queen to President Hayes. "

1063
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,116
Look at that.

1064
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:42,163
Missing plank from the White House. Wow.

1065
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,667
Here's the final entry
by President Coolidge.

1066
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:50,797
"1924. I found a plank
in secret desk compartment.

1067
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:54,550
Plank photographed and then destroyed.

1068
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,470
Borglum commissioned
to destroy landmarks

1069
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,639
in sacred Black Hills mountains. "

1070
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:05,853
Borglum. Mount Rushmore?

1071
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:11,526
He carved Mount Rushmore
to erase the map's landmarks

1072
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,111
in order to protect the City of Gold.

1073
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,782
Mount Rushmore was a cover-up.

1074
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:20,576
What is it?

1075
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:25,581
There's my tax dollars at work,
coming to arrest me.

1076
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:28,251
Not coming for you,
they're for me. Go to the car.

1077
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:30,253
- No!
- Go! I'll meet up with you.

1078
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:31,796
This way.

1079
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,057
So Gates abducts the president,
lets him go

1080
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,101
and heads to the Library of Congress?

1081
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,812
- Why?
- Maybe he wants to check out a book.

1082
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,833
This way.

1083
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,231
All agents...

1084
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,704
- Dad.
- Ben.

1085
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,040
Get out of there.
I had to move the car.

1086
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,584
FBI, Secret Service all over the place.

1087
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,336
Calm down. I sent a picture
of the plank to your cell.

1088
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,380
- You can do that?
- Yes, I can do that.

1089
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:58,090
Did you get it?

1090
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,217
- I got it.
- Look.

1091
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:05,973
- Take it to Mom for translation.
- Why me?

1092
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,142
He say his mom
could translate the plank?

1093
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,102
Find out who she is.

1094
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,075
- How are we going to find Ben?
- I don't know.

1095
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,077
- Hold it! Who are you?
- We work here.

1096
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,287
- IDs.
- Here. We were told to evacuate.

1097
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,080
I don't know what's going on.

1098
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,708
- My car's parked...
- One second I'm reading...

1099
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:36,337
- Special section for...
... a book, then we're rushed out...

1100
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,922
- Go ahead.
- OK. Thank you.

1101
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:41,091
- Thank you for your help, officer.
- Best of luck.

1102
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,428
Have a good night.

1103
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,227
Hey, go
to the northeast sectors...

1104
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,065
Start the car.

1105
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,277
Put it in gear.

1106
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,240
- Uh-oh.
- What's the problem?

1107
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,407
It's clear. Let's go!

1108
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,326
We're going to jail.

1109
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,206
I want to run a check...

1110
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,418
Get in! Hang on!

1111
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,213
Mercedes SUV...

1112
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:21,882
- He's in! Go!
- Hang on!

1113
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:23,592
Whoa!

1114
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:25,928
OK. We can do this.

1115
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:32,309
Close the barricade, lock it down!

1116
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,436
Lock it down!

1117
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,983
- Drive, drive, drive!
- OK.

1118
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,820
I don't think so!

1119
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,780
Whoa, whoa!

1120
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:51,579
Go, go, go, go, go!

1121
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,872
Let's go! Let's go!

1122
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,961
That did not turn out
the way it was supposed to!

1123
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,672
- How'd they find us so quick?
- I'll tell you how.

1124
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:05,426
- The president is a tattletale!
- Sadusky. He was there.

1125
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,845
He knows more about the book
than I thought.

1126
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,597
How'd the president
feel about being kidnapped?

1127
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,266
He was OK.

1128
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:21,608
- Dr. Appleton.
- This office is closed. I'm sorry.

1129
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:24,194
I do apologize
for the lateness of the hour.

1130
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,698
My name is Mitch Wilkinson.

1131
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:31,452
I've got something I want you
to take a look at. Just take a minute.

1132
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,545
- You're a treasure hunter.
- No, ma'am.

1133
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:44,340
I'm just a man trying
to make his mark on history.

1134
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,175
Can you help me?

1135
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:51,847
Um... No, I don't know that language.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1136
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,475
Oh, excuse me.

1137
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:58,771
Yes.

1138
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,857
Got it.

1139
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:06,195
Your ex-husband's on his way up.
He wants the translation.

1140
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:12,785
Tell him anything but the truth.
Get rid of him. His life depends on it.

1141
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,004
Emily?

1142
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:38,936
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

1143
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:44,274
and I'm not comfortable either,
but we need you to translate something.

1144
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:50,280
- Ben sent me. He needs your help.
- Yes, of course.

1145
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:53,575
If it's for Ben, of course. What is it?

1146
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:56,995
Oh. Uh...

1147
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,873
It's in the cell phone.
I'm not sure how to...

1148
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,917
- Give it to me.
... bring it out.

1149
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:12,219
We know it leads to Mount Rushmore.

1150
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:19,434
Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass. "

1151
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,147
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

1152
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:25,858
Right.

1153
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:33,574
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird. "

1154
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,162
That's it?

1155
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:51,133
Did it ever occur to you?
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1156
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:56,263
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

1157
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:02,894
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

1158
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,315
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

1159
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:08,358
Certainly wasn't going to be you.

1160
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:13,697
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

1161
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,868
No, of course not.

1162
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,162
So just go away.

1163
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,761
Lousy tequila.

1164
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,559
Don't feel bad. You did good.

1165
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,728
Patrick believed every word you said.

1166
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,357
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

1167
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,233
You don't know Benjamin.

1168
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:53,904
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

1169
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:02,412
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

1170
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:06,708
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.

1171
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:10,379
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.

1172
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:15,509
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.

1173
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:21,473
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.

1174
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:24,726
It's ironic, isn't it?

1175
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:29,606
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends

1176
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:33,151
with the burning of this,
the final clue.

1177
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,779
Making me the only one...

1178
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,406
...who can find CÃ­bola.

1179
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:41,785
Get your coat.

1180
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:57,634
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says

1181
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:01,304
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.

1182
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:02,931
I don't think so.

1183
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,607
How do I get to, um, this...

1184
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:15,694
Hello, Mitch.

1185
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:18,446
Mom...

1186
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:21,366
- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.

1187
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:24,744
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.

1188
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:28,081
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

1189
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:31,877
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

1190
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:36,214
I kidnapped the president. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,

1191
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,300
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

1192
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,510
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

1193
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:43,305
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

1194
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:46,474
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

1195
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,894
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

1196
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,813
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

1197
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:56,359
I'm afraid he's burned it.

1198
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:04,409
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

1199
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:08,413
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

1200
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:11,666
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

1201
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,627
- What?
- I'm going with you.

1202
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:17,505
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

1203
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:18,798
it's going to be me.

1204
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:21,968
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

1205
01:26:22,093 --> 01:26:23,720
What makes you think I'd agree?

1206
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:29,142
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

1207
01:26:33,813 --> 01:26:35,982
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

1208
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:42,739
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

1209
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:51,456
- Which president? The president?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

1210
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:08,473
I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.

1211
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,352
All right. Let's have it.

1212
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:16,856
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

1213
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:22,237
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain. "

1214
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,863
Figure that one out.

1215
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:27,575
So we come back when it's raining?

1216
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,415
"Cloudless. " Could simply mean the sun.

1217
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:37,127
You need a sunny day... and rain.

1218
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:39,462
We need water.

1219
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,381
Water.

1220
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:53,143
Abigail.

1221
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,772
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

1222
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:59,065
Em? Water?

1223
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:03,236
- What's this in my hand? Are you blind?
- Good, good, good.

1224
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:18,501
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

1225
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:29,637
That's it.

1226
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:34,309
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

1227
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:37,645
Look at this!

1228
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,231
It's an eagle.

1229
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:44,819
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

1230
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:48,072
- "The noble bird... "
- "Will give you passage. "

1231
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,659
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,

1232
01:28:51,784 --> 01:28:56,623
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

1233
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,294
- It indicates direction...
- Somehow that bird...

1234
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:05,173
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

1235
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:09,510
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.

1236
01:29:10,803 --> 01:29:13,723
"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior. "

1237
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:17,560
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

1238
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:25,151
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

1239
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:27,945
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

1240
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,530
It's a horrible trap.

1241
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:33,242
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

1242
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:35,953
I'll do it, Ben.

1243
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:37,580
It's OK.

1244
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,003
Surrender your hand.

1245
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:04,107
- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.
- You!

1246
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,862
Lt, uh... feels like a latch.

1247
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,373
Look at this.

1248
01:30:32,343 --> 01:30:35,054
All right, good. Let's go.

1249
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:57,034
Oh!

1250
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:02,832
Ben, look at this.

1251
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,918
Oh, that's beautiful!

1252
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:12,800
- Patrick. Patrick!
- Ben, what is that?

1253
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:15,845
Appears to be a counterweight
to hold the door open.

1254
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,014
What is that sound?

1255
01:31:18,097 --> 01:31:19,390
Fascinating.

1256
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:25,229
Ah!

1257
01:31:25,354 --> 01:31:26,355
Ben!

1258
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,117
Sorry.

1259
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:39,785
- You OK?
- No.

1260
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,245
Get up.

1261
01:31:43,122 --> 01:31:44,081
It's locked.

1262
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:48,920
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

1263
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,963
Only one way out of here now.

1264
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,258
Forward.

1265
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:01,933
Oh!

1266
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:09,231
Never seen so many relics.

1267
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,400
So beautifully preserved.

1268
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,406
Looks like we're going
to be moving some rocks.

1269
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:20,910
- There's a tunnel back in through here.
- Guys, look at this.

1270
01:32:23,996 --> 01:32:25,498
It's a little golden man.

1271
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:32,922
Look. It's got a tiny little torso.
Look at that. It looks like...

1272
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:47,895
- Ben!
- Ben!

1273
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:56,904
Move back! Move back!
All of you! Other side!

1274
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:00,950
Back up! Back up!

1275
01:33:01,867 --> 01:33:02,993
Ah!

1276
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:09,291
Riley, move forward! Move forward!

1277
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:11,961
No, back up, back up.

1278
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:16,173
- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!

1279
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:23,556
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.

1280
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,769
- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?

1281
01:33:28,894 --> 01:33:31,605
Figure something out.
Tell you what we're going to do.

1282
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:34,024
- No, I'll tell you.
- No. I'll tell you!

1283
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,944
No, I'll tell you!
There's that passageway.

1284
01:33:37,027 --> 01:33:41,282
You go, pull those stones out,
because that leads somewhere.

1285
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:43,492
That is a good idea.

1286
01:33:47,037 --> 01:33:50,124
There's nothing.
Just a big old black hole.

1287
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:56,505
Ben, look!
There's a ladder.

1288
01:33:56,630 --> 01:34:00,634
- I mean, what's left of a ladder.
- Toss me the light.

1289
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:07,099
Riley. Move slowly to that corner.
No! Wait. Just...

1290
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:10,269
- As I move to this corner.
- OK.

1291
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,898
One step at a time. Good.

1292
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,405
If we can raise this corner,
I think I'll reach it.

1293
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:27,203
- Stop! Red light!
- You're not helping!

1294
01:34:27,369 --> 01:34:29,371
I can get up there just as easy as you.

1295
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:32,583
Just stop.

1296
01:34:34,084 --> 01:34:36,212
- Guys!
- It's three against one here.

1297
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,965
I ain't going last, and if I'm not
going last, I might as well go first.

1298
01:34:41,383 --> 01:34:42,301
Look!

1299
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:46,847
What's it gonna be?

1300
01:34:56,273 --> 01:34:58,025
We'll do this your way.

1301
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:15,918
The rest of us, on my count of three,
all move together.

1302
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,503
One step at a time.

1303
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:21,382
One, two, three.

1304
01:35:40,776 --> 01:35:42,319
- You ready?
- Go.

1305
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:54,957
Ah!

1306
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,188
Mitch, what do you see?

1307
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:21,066
Is there a way out?

1308
01:36:22,693 --> 01:36:24,194
What's up there, Mitch?

1309
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:37,207
Em?

1310
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:42,755
- Are you all right?
- Just promise me he's gonna be OK.

1311
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:48,469
All right.

1312
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,388
Let's go.

1313
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:54,850
Mitch! Come on!

1314
01:36:55,684 --> 01:36:58,312
- I've been doing the math here, and...
- I know.

1315
01:36:58,812 --> 01:37:01,231
We're gonna have to leave
one person behind.

1316
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:03,400
Promise you'll
come back for me.

1317
01:37:03,525 --> 01:37:05,235
I can do the math too.

1318
01:37:06,653 --> 01:37:09,323
- That makes you next.
- I'll go last.

1319
01:37:11,033 --> 01:37:15,496
"No, we'll figure something else out. "
"We need you there. Please, Riley. "

1320
01:37:17,247 --> 01:37:18,415
I'm just kidding. Go.

1321
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,501
OK...

1322
01:37:49,404 --> 01:37:54,076
- One... two... three!
- Go!

1323
01:37:59,289 --> 01:38:00,540
Oh!

1324
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,335
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1325
01:38:03,418 --> 01:38:04,920
Uh!

1326
01:38:08,924 --> 01:38:09,883
I can't get it.

1327
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,934
Just go! Go now! Go!

1328
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,313
- All right, ready?
- Now!

1329
01:38:23,438 --> 01:38:25,607
Ah!

1330
01:38:25,732 --> 01:38:27,401
Riley! Hang on!

1331
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:34,950
OK. Mitch, the idol.
OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here!

1332
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,786
We can roll it over
to offset your weight!

1333
01:38:37,869 --> 01:38:39,162
Then roll it!

1334
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:43,458
Here it comes!

1335
01:38:52,342 --> 01:38:53,719
Come on, Ben!

1336
01:38:56,638 --> 01:38:58,348
Here! Give me your hand!

1337
01:39:00,767 --> 01:39:02,269
Ben!

1338
01:39:03,478 --> 01:39:04,479
Thanks, Riley.

1339
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:09,609
Why couldn't a girl see me do that?

1340
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:17,492
- You all right?
- You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.

1341
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:21,955
So... forward.

1342
01:39:25,542 --> 01:39:28,670
What is this?

1343
01:39:28,795 --> 01:39:31,506
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1344
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,301
Oh!

1345
01:39:39,097 --> 01:39:40,932
Put your light over there.

1346
01:39:43,935 --> 01:39:45,312
What are you doing?

1347
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:13,840
I can't see anything!
Is this it?

1348
01:40:19,429 --> 01:40:20,347
It's oil!

1349
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:02,889
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!

1350
01:41:03,598 --> 01:41:05,016
We have to turn back!

1351
01:41:14,693 --> 01:41:15,944
OK.

1352
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:21,533
No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.

1353
01:41:24,452 --> 01:41:25,412
OK.

1354
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:31,793
I got it!

1355
01:41:34,087 --> 01:41:36,589
I got you! I got you!

1356
01:42:05,535 --> 01:42:07,037
There's no forward!

1357
01:42:10,081 --> 01:42:12,250
It's not forward, it's down!

1358
01:42:13,251 --> 01:42:17,797
All this water has to go out somewhere.
Otherwise, it'd be filled up.

1359
01:42:28,183 --> 01:42:30,143
Help me turn this wheel!

1360
01:43:03,426 --> 01:43:05,261
The water's going down.

1361
01:43:55,478 --> 01:43:57,063
It is... Em.

1362
01:43:58,231 --> 01:44:00,191
Em. Em.

1363
01:44:06,447 --> 01:44:08,241
Ben! Hey!

1364
01:44:08,324 --> 01:44:12,620
Dad! We found it!

1365
01:44:13,037 --> 01:44:16,541
- Thomas was right!
- No, you were right!

1366
01:44:22,005 --> 01:44:25,216
Sorry I smeared your
great-great granddaddy's good name.

1367
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,802
Seemed like the only way
to get you in on the hunt.

1368
01:44:27,927 --> 01:44:32,640
But this was a chance for the Wilkinson
family to make its mark on history,

1369
01:44:32,765 --> 01:44:36,644
to find the City of Gold,
to be remembered.

1370
01:45:07,508 --> 01:45:10,845
What happened to you?
Your father was worried sick about you.

1371
01:45:10,928 --> 01:45:13,222
She was frantic. She was frantic.

1372
01:45:14,265 --> 01:45:17,643
Dad, coming through,
did you happen to see?

1373
01:45:17,727 --> 01:45:21,647
Stop it. Coming through, did you see
any branches that could lead out?

1374
01:45:21,731 --> 01:45:25,693
No, it's all blocked. You can't even
get back to the big, round stone door.

1375
01:45:26,277 --> 01:45:27,737
Where's your mother going?

1376
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:33,659
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Have a look at this.

1377
01:45:33,785 --> 01:45:34,827
- What?
- Look.

1378
01:45:34,952 --> 01:45:37,371
This is gonna unlock
the Olmec language.

1379
01:45:37,455 --> 01:45:41,000
It's gonna give us incredible
insight into pre-Columbian history.

1380
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:42,919
Oh!

1381
01:45:43,044 --> 01:45:44,754
Em?

1382
01:45:44,879 --> 01:45:47,465
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.

1383
01:45:48,466 --> 01:45:51,385
- Ben! Look at this! Look!
- Oh, yeah.

1384
01:45:51,969 --> 01:45:54,806
That's where they slit the throat,
cut the heart out.

1385
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,201
- What was that?
- Listen.

1386
01:46:35,263 --> 01:46:36,973
Ah!

1387
01:46:41,352 --> 01:46:44,981
I tried to find a way out.
All those portals are blocked off!

1388
01:46:45,106 --> 01:46:48,568
I'm telling you, all this water
goes out somewhere. We'll find it.

1389
01:46:56,075 --> 01:46:57,952
Ben, there's a current!

1390
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:01,414
Follow it!
There's got to be a central drain!

1391
01:47:01,539 --> 01:47:03,583
It's under us. Right here!

1392
01:47:12,883 --> 01:47:13,843
Come on!

1393
01:47:15,303 --> 01:47:17,305
Let's go! Get in there!

1394
01:47:24,395 --> 01:47:26,480
The water's rising too fast!

1395
01:47:26,522 --> 01:47:29,233
Let's get that door open
so we don't all drown!

1396
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,128
Ben, it slopes down!
It's a drainage tunnel.

1397
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:51,964
It fills with water
when you open the door!

1398
01:47:52,089 --> 01:47:55,176
We need to find something
to stick under it to keep it open!

1399
01:47:55,259 --> 01:47:58,262
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.

1400
01:47:58,387 --> 01:48:01,057
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.

1401
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:02,808
Patrick, Emily, go!

1402
01:48:08,272 --> 01:48:09,273
- No.
- No!

1403
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:11,817
No!

1404
01:48:11,942 --> 01:48:14,653
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!

1405
01:48:15,279 --> 01:48:16,989
Nobody leaves unless I say so.

1406
01:48:18,532 --> 01:48:21,077
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.

1407
01:48:21,243 --> 01:48:23,412
We both know what has to happen here.

1408
01:48:23,913 --> 01:48:27,291
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

1409
01:48:29,293 --> 01:48:30,378
I vote Mitch.

1410
01:48:31,504 --> 01:48:33,339
This isn't a democracy.

1411
01:48:38,052 --> 01:48:41,972
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

1412
01:48:42,932 --> 01:48:45,393
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

1413
01:48:45,518 --> 01:48:48,187
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

1414
01:48:48,312 --> 01:48:52,525
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

1415
01:48:52,691 --> 01:48:55,111
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

1416
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:59,031
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

1417
01:49:00,991 --> 01:49:04,370
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

1418
01:49:08,457 --> 01:49:11,043
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

1419
01:49:13,087 --> 01:49:14,004
Abigail.

1420
01:49:18,175 --> 01:49:21,887
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

1421
01:49:31,272 --> 01:49:32,523
- No!
- Let's go!

1422
01:49:33,023 --> 01:49:36,944
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

1423
01:49:37,778 --> 01:49:39,321
Please, come on.

1424
01:49:41,323 --> 01:49:42,491
Push, Ben!

1425
01:49:46,203 --> 01:49:48,080
The current's too strong!

1426
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:53,544
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

1427
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,519
Ah!

1428
01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:17,776
Mom!

1429
01:50:18,402 --> 01:50:20,613
Hang on!

1430
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:24,700
Hold your breath!

1431
01:50:34,501 --> 01:50:36,295
Ah!

1432
01:50:36,378 --> 01:50:38,088
We got to get Ben out of there!

1433
01:50:41,175 --> 01:50:45,429
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

1434
01:50:45,512 --> 01:50:48,432
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

1435
01:50:48,557 --> 01:50:52,645
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

1436
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:55,272
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

1437
01:50:55,356 --> 01:50:56,649
I'll get you out!

1438
01:50:56,774 --> 01:51:01,153
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

1439
01:51:01,278 --> 01:51:03,197
And no one will ever know?

1440
01:51:03,322 --> 01:51:07,493
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

1441
01:51:07,576 --> 01:51:11,121
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

1442
01:51:11,288 --> 01:51:14,375
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

1443
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:18,671
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

1444
01:51:20,214 --> 01:51:22,299
Mitch!

1445
01:51:31,475 --> 01:51:32,518
Ah!

1446
01:52:02,798 --> 01:52:03,882
Thank you.

1447
01:52:21,441 --> 01:52:25,362
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- Oh, hi.

1448
01:52:31,702 --> 01:52:34,204
Sir! It's for you.

1449
01:52:35,539 --> 01:52:36,498
Sadusky.

1450
01:52:37,499 --> 01:52:40,252
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

1451
01:52:40,669 --> 01:52:44,506
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

1452
01:52:44,631 --> 01:52:48,260
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

1453
01:52:48,343 --> 01:52:51,138
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

1454
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:14,202
Stop. Stop it.

1455
01:53:15,370 --> 01:53:17,664
- Mr. President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

1456
01:53:17,789 --> 01:53:21,460
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

1457
01:53:21,627 --> 01:53:24,296
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

1458
01:53:24,421 --> 01:53:28,008
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

1459
01:53:28,342 --> 01:53:29,468
Yes, sir.

1460
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,472
- Gates.
- Sir.

1461
01:53:34,556 --> 01:53:39,144
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

1462
01:53:39,227 --> 01:53:42,689
you have brought honor
to your country and your family.

1463
01:53:44,316 --> 01:53:47,194
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

1464
01:53:47,736 --> 01:53:50,405
- Thank you.
- Craig.

1465
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:55,994
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

1466
01:53:57,579 --> 01:53:58,538
Tomorrow?

1467
01:54:06,797 --> 01:54:08,006
Thank you, sir.

1468
01:54:09,049 --> 01:54:11,468
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

1469
01:54:11,593 --> 01:54:13,679
will get credit for this discovery.

1470
01:54:20,852 --> 01:54:23,146
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

1471
01:54:24,106 --> 01:54:27,901
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

1472
01:54:29,528 --> 01:54:32,489
Ben, I am curious
about that favor I asked you.

1473
01:54:34,116 --> 01:54:36,451
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

1474
01:54:36,576 --> 01:54:38,704
I believe I can help with that, sir.

1475
01:54:38,829 --> 01:54:41,998
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

1476
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:49,339
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

1477
01:54:52,592 --> 01:54:53,677
What book?

1478
01:54:55,303 --> 01:54:59,349
Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

1479
01:54:59,474 --> 01:55:01,685
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

1480
01:55:01,768 --> 01:55:03,061
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

1481
01:55:03,186 --> 01:55:06,189
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

1482
01:55:06,314 --> 01:55:09,609
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

1483
01:55:13,655 --> 01:55:14,990
Excuse me.

1484
01:55:15,115 --> 01:55:18,994
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

1485
01:55:19,077 --> 01:55:22,914
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

1486
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:27,377
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognize you from your book.

1487
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:30,088
Will you sign it?

1488
01:55:30,172 --> 01:55:31,131
OK.

1489
01:55:40,390 --> 01:55:41,391
Thank you.

1490
01:55:42,726 --> 01:55:45,937
So, um, the tea tables...

1491
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:50,650
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

1492
01:55:51,651 --> 01:55:53,612
I was going to say
you can keep them.

1493
01:55:54,529 --> 01:55:58,617
And maybe you could...

1494
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:00,952
...come and move back in with me.

1495
01:56:02,162 --> 01:56:04,915
- No. You used the word "so. "
- So?

1496
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,417
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.

1497
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:11,421
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

1498
01:56:11,546 --> 01:56:13,882
It's sort of like a puzzle.

1499
01:56:15,425 --> 01:56:19,095
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1500
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:22,849
So...

1501
01:57:09,604 --> 01:57:11,189
I love this car.
