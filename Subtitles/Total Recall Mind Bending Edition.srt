Honey, are you all right?

You were dreaming. Doug?

Was it about Mars?

00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,168
- Is that better?
- Hmm.

00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,668
This is getting to be an obsession.

Was she there?

Who?

The brunette.

Oh, Lori.

16
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,626
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.

17

- Who is she?
- Nobody.

"Nobody"? What's her name?

-(Laughs)

You better tell me!

22
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,293
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

23
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,043
And I'm always back
in the morning.

Now, help me out here, Doug.

00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:59,585
- You were interested in a memory of...
- Of Mars.

126
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:01,793
Yeah. Mars.

127

- Is there a problem?
- Uh...

128
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,501
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug,
if outer space is your thing,

129
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:11,585
you'd be much happier
with one of our Saturn cruises.

130
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,168
Everybody raves about them.

131
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,168
No. I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

132
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:19,168
OK. You're the boss.

133
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:21,835
Mars it is.

134
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,251
Now, let me see.

135
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:29,751
The basic Mars package
will run you 899 credits.

136
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:33,210
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

137
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,835
If you want a longer trip, that'll cost you
more cos it's a deeper implant.

138
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,293
What's in the two-week package?

139
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,001
When you go Recall, you get nothing
but first-class memories.

140
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:48,043
Private cabin on the shuttle, deluxe suite
at the Hilton, all the major sights:

141
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,043
Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals
and of course, Venusville.

142
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,960
But how real does it seem?

143
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,210
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Come on. Don't bullshit me.

144
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:02,168
No. I'm telling you, Doug.
Your brain will not know the difference.

145
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:04,335
And that's guaranteed
or your money back.

146
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:07,876
What about the guy you lobotomised?
Did he get a refund?

147
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,543
You're talking ancient history.

148
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,501
Nowadays, travelling with Recall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

<i>Check out those statistics.</i>

150
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:23,335
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.

151
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:28,210
You got lost luggage, lousy weather,
crooked taxi drivers.

152
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:33,626
When you travel with Recall,
everything is perfect.

153
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:35,876
So, what do you say?

154
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,626
- All right.
- Smart move.

155
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:43,085
All right,
while you fill out this questionnaire,

156
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:45,668
I'm going to familiarise you
with some of our options.

157
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,418
No options.

158
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:51,793
Whatever you say.
Can I ask you just one question?

159
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,710
What is that is exactly the same

160
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,876
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?

161
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,085
<i>L</i> give UP-

162
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,876
You. You're the same.

163
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:05,626
No matter where you go, there you are.
It's always the same old you.

164
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:10,460
Let me suggest that you take
a vacation from yourself.

165
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:12,251
I know, it sounds wild.

166
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:15,126
It is the latest thing in travel.
We call it the Ego Trip.

167
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:17,335
No. I'm not interested in that.

168
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,251
You're gonna love this, Doug.

169
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,960
We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.

170
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:26,626
Why go to Mars as a tourist,
when you can go as a playboy?

171
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,751
- Or a famous jock or...?
- "Secret agent."

172
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:31,626
How much is that?

173
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,168
A-ha! Let me tantalise you.

174
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:42,001
You are a top operative under deep cover
on your most important mission.

175
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:44,668
People are trying to kill you.
Left and right!

176
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:47,793
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.

177
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,043
Go on.

178
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,835
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug,

179
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,043
but by the time the trip is over,

180
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,126
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.

181
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:03,001
Now, you tell me.
Isn't that worth a measly 300 credits?

182
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:09,418
(Machine revs up)

183
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,585
- Your first trip?
- Mm-hm.

184
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:22,918
Well, don't worry. Things hardly ever
fuck up around here.

185
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Good evening... Doug.

186
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:28,210
- I'm Dr Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

187
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:32,210
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37.

188
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,251
And would you like us
to integrate some alien stuff?

189
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:37,501
Sure. Why not?

190
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:42,168
- Two-headed monsters?
- Don't you keep up with the news?

191
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,918
- We're doing alien artefacts now.
- It's wild.

192
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,668
Yeah, they date back a million years.

193
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:51,751
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

194
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:53,668
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

195
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:57,376
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

196
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:59,710
Slipping away for
a little hanky-panky.

197
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:02,668
- No. I'm fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

198
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,626
Then we're set.

199
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:07,543
- Ready for dreamland?
- (Groans)

200
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,793
I'll be asking you some questions
so we can fine-tune the Ego program.

201
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,793
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more.

202
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,710
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

203
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,293
So, how do you like your women?

204
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,251
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

205
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,418
Brunette.

206
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:38,043
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

207
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:42,543
Athletic.

208
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:50,710
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

209
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:53,876
- Be honest.
- Sleazy.

210
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,418
Demure.

211
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,043
41A, Ernie.

212
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
Boy, is he gonna have a wild time.

213
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:11,960
- He's not gonna want to come back.
- Oh, that's for sure.

214
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,251
So...

215
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:36,251
what do you say?

216
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:39,335
I'm not so sure,
and I don't get a souvenir.

217
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,668
Not true. For just a few more credits

218
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:44,626
we supply T-shirts,
snapshots of you at the site,

219
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:46,668
and even letters from...

220
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,126
' (Teleph
<i>_</i> -Bob!' one ringing)

221
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:52,418
- What is it?
- 'You'd better get down here.'

222
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:54,626
I am with a very important client.

223
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:57,251
'Looks like we got
another schizoid embolism.'

224
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,626
- I'll be right back.
- Uh... Mr McClane?

225
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:05,168
- Mr McClane?
- Bob! What's wrong?

226
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:07,251
Don't let her leave!

227
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:10,293
(Groaning)

228
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,626
Get off!

229
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:15,418
Ah!

230
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:17,251
You blew my cover!

231
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:20,543
What's going on? You can't do
a simple goddamn double implant?

232
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,376
It's not my fault we hit a memory cap.

233
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:25,001
They'll be here any minute!
They'll kill you all!

234
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:27,460
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

235
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,460
Mr Quaid, try to calm down!

236
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:33,835
My name is not Quaid.

237
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:36,835
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

238
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,501
- Untie me!
- Hold him down!

239
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:40,585
Let me go!

240
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,168
(Groans)

241
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:48,668
Ah!

242
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,293
Are you all right?

243
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,751
Listen to me.
He's been going on and on about Mars.

244
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,501
- He has really been there.
- Use your head, you dumb bitch.

245
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:16,043
He's just acting out the "secret agent"
portion of his ego trip.

246
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,876
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Why not?

247
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:19,876
Because we haven't implanted it yet.

248
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,251
Oh, shit.

249
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:26,793
Oh, shit!

250
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,376
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

251
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:33,626
Excuse me. "Someone"?

252
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:35,835
We're talking about the fucking Agency.

253
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,668
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

254
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:42,126
OK, all right. All right, look.
Here's what we're going to do.

255
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:44,918
Renata, cover up any memory
he's got of us or Recall.

256
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,918
I'll do what I can.
It's pretty messy in there.

257
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:50,085
Ernie, dump him in a cab around
the corner. Tiffany, you help him.

258
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:52,168
I'm gonna destroy his file
and refund his money.

259
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,585
And if anybody comes asking,
we never heard of Douglas Quaid.

260
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:03,501
(Driver whistles)

261
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:12,418
Where am I?

262
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,376
- You're in a Johnnycab.
- What am I doing here?

263
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,835
I'm sorry. Would you please
rephrase the question?

264
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,043
How did I get in this taxi?

265
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,960
The door opened, you got in.

266
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:31,460
Hell of a day, isn't it?

267
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,085
- This OK?
- Right here.

268
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:49,918
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

269
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,251
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

270
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:53,793
Hey, Quaid.

271
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:57,251
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

272
00:21:57,418 --> 00:22:00,835
- What trip?
- You went to Recall. Remember?

273
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:03,876
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

274
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:07,335
- I told you not to, but you went anyway.
- What are you, my father?

275
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:12,126
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Listen. I'm already late. Thank you...

276
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,960
OK, bring him...
Come on, move it!

277
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:19,210
Let's go get that drink. Move it!

278
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:22,751
What the hell is going on?
What the fuck did I do wrong?

279
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:25,876
- Tell me!
- You blabbed about Mars!

280
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:29,168
Are you crazy? I don't even know
anything about Mars!

281
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:33,751
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

282
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:39,918
You're making a big mistake. You got me
mixed up with somebody else.

283
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:42,418
Uh-uh, pal.
You got yourself mixed up with...

284
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,918
Ah!

285
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,876
(Groaning)

286
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:03,126
(Bones cracking)

287
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,668
Ah!

288
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,251
(Machine) 'And pivot... and serve...

289
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:39,335
'and shift... and stroke... and pivot.

290
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:43,210
'And serve... and shift... and stroke.

291
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:45,293
'Very good. Perfect form.

292
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,501
'And serve... and shift... and stroke.'

293
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:50,418
Hi, honey.

294
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:55,585
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

295
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,126
Muggers? Are you all right?

296
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,335
No, they were spies or something.

297
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:02,168
And Harry from work, he was the...
Get down!

298
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:06,043
- Harry from work, he was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, OK?

299
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,126
Tell me exactly what happened.
Why would spies want to kill you?

300
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:11,835
I don't know.
But it had something to do with Mars.

301
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,626
You've never been to Mars.

302
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:17,126
It sounds crazy, but I went
to this Recall place after work...

303
00:24:17,293 --> 00:24:19,460
- You went to those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

304
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,043
- What did they do to you?
- I got a trip to Mars.

305
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,001
- So what happened...
- Oh...

306
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:27,418
Forget about Recall. Will you?
These guys were going to kill me.

307
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:30,293
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

308
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,418
But I killed them.

309
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:35,960
Listen to me, sweetheart.

310
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:39,085
Those assholes at Recall
have fucked up your mind.

311
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:41,293
You're having paranoid delusions.

312
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,043
You call this a delusion?

313
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:51,668

- Lori?

321
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,293
Why are you doing this, Lori?

322
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:38,335
Talk! I said talk.

323
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:40,418
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

324
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:42,626
I never saw you
before six weeks ago.

325
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:44,876
Our marriage
is just a memory implant.

326

You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

327

It was implanted by the Agency.

328
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:51,251
- Falling in love.
- Implanted.

329
00:26:51,418 --> 00:26:55,043
Our friends, my job, 8 years together.
All of this was implanted too?

330
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,876
The job's real.
The Agency set it up.

331
00:26:58,043 --> 00:26:59,835
Bullshit.

332
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:04,668
They erased your identity
and implanted a new one.

333
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:07,043
I was written in as your wife
so I could watch you

334
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,418
and make sure the erasure took.

335
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:18,626
Sorry, Quaid.
Your whole life is just a dream.

336
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:25,168
OK, then if I'm not me,
who the hell am I?

337
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:26,501
Beats me.

338
00:27:27,918 --> 00:27:30,126
I just work here.

340
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:40,626
Doug, there's something
I want you to know.

341
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:46,168
You were the best assignment
I ever had. Really.

342
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:47,876
I'm honoured.

343
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:52,001
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

344
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:56,126
Come on. If you don't trust me,
you can tie me up.

345
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:02,043
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

346
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,043
Clever girl.

347
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:15,543
You wouldn't shoot me, would you,
Doug? After all we've been through.

348
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,543
Some of it was fun.

349
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:23,043
Nice knowing you.

350
00:28:57,543 --> 00:28:59,168
Don't touch her.

351

(Man) Nobody here.

352
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:05,793
- Are you OK?
- I guess I blew it.

353
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,543
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

354
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,210
I've got him.

Let's get him. Go.

Let's go. Move it.

358

Pack your stuff
and get outta here.

359
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:46,710
What if they bring him back?

360
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:49,210
Not a chance.

361
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,710

00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:48,043
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.

469
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,460
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

470
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:52,043
Split up. Find him.

471
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,126
'First let's get rid
of that bug in your head.

472
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:58,960
'Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.

473
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,168
'Don't worry. It's self-guiding.

474
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:09,126
'Just shove real hard.'

475
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:12,001
(Breathes deeply)

476
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:14,918
(Groans)

477
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:16,835
'When it crunches, you're there.

478
00:41:18,418 --> 00:41:20,210
'Just pull it out.

00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,543
'Be careful. It's my head too.'

480
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,335
Ah! Ah!

481
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,293
- I've got a lock.
- Up. Let's go.

482
00:41:50,126 --> 00:41:51,876
'This is the plan.

483
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,501

'then go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker ID at the desk.

486
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:00,543
'Just do what I tell you.

00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,668
'And we can nail that son of the bitch
who fucked you and me.

488
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:06,751
'I'm counting on you, buddy.

489
00:42:06,918 --> 00:42:08,585
'Don't let me down.'

490
00:42:33,793 --> 00:42:35,543
(Sq ueaking)

491
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:38,585
Straight ahead.

492
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:44,251
In there.

493
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,043
There!

494
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,043
- (Device beeps)
- There!

495
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:05,460
There!

496
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:13,251
What? Give me that.

497
00:43:13,418 --> 00:43:15,501
(Hauser) 'Get your ass to Mars.'

498
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:19,876
- 'Get your ass to Mars.'
- Shit.

499
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,543
'Get your ass to Mars...
Get your ass to Mars...'

500
00:43:58,418 --> 00:44:00,876

Hmm?

(Man) Get out of the way.
Make way! Stand back!

510
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:47,585
Mr Cohaagen wants to see you
right away.

511
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,126
Any news of Quaid?

512
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:53,251
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain...

513
00:44:54,335 --> 00:44:57,335
- So how long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

514
00:44:57,918 --> 00:45:00,210
Look at that shit.

515
00:45:00,376 --> 00:45:03,876
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.

516
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:06,043
They think he's fuckin'
George Washington.

517
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,835
Kill the bastard.

518
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:09,585
Nobody knows who he is.

519
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,543
Have you brought
any fruits or vegetables?

520
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,460
Two weeks.

521
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,126
Excuse me?

522
00:45:18,293 --> 00:45:20,751
Two weeks.

523
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:24,168
Two weeks!

524
00:45:26,001 --> 00:45:27,751
(Groaning)

525
00:45:27,918 --> 00:45:32,626
It's not just graffiti. The rebels
took over the refinery last night.

526
00:45:32,793 --> 00:45:34,710
No terbinium is going out.

527
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:36,376
And it gets worse.

528
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:38,585
T-w-0...

529
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,126
(Groaning)

530
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:58,251
Quaid.

531
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:01,001
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

532
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:02,876
The woman!
Get him... her!

533
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:05,335
Arrest that woman!

534
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:07,001
Get that woman. Grab her!

535
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:37,835
Catch!

536
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:42,126
Get ready for a surprise!

537
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:49,293
(Hissing)

538
00:46:53,668 --> 00:46:55,585
(Wind blowing)

539
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,210
(Screaming)

540
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,251
(Screams)

541
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:26,335
(Screaming)

542
00:47:27,835 --> 00:47:28,960
Ah!

543
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:54,960
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

544
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:56,335
Open it!

545
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,293
They're all connected!

546
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:08,918
That's terrible.

547
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:11,001
A few days ago
Cohaagen raised the price of air.

548
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:12,335
Again?

549
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:14,793
Nobody on Earth gives a damn
what happens up here.

550
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,418
They just want our terbinium
so they can fight their war.

551
00:48:17,585 --> 00:48:19,501
Excuse me. What's that?

552
00:48:19,668 --> 00:48:21,710
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

553
00:48:21,876 --> 00:48:25,335
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.

554
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,335
Well, that's a rumour, isn't it?

555
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:29,251
Think so?

556
00:48:58,876 --> 00:49:00,293
Mr Cohaagen.

557
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:09,710
You wanted to see me, sir?

558
00:49:13,293 --> 00:49:14,710
Richter...

559
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:17,960
Do you know why
I'm such a happy person?

560
00:49:18,126 --> 00:49:19,460
No, sir.

561
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:24,835
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.

562
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:28,376
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

563
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,793
Anything-

564
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,293
In fact, the only thing
that I ever worry about

565
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,793
is that one day, if the rebels win,
it all might end...

566
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:43,543
and you're fucking making it happen!

567
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,585
First you try to kill Quaid,
then you let him get away.

568
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,001
He had help from our side, sir.

569
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:52,251
I know that.

570
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:56,626
- But I thought...
- Who told you to think?

571
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,793
I don't give you enough information
to think.

572
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:05,001
You do what you're told.
That's what you do.

573
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,876
Yes, sir.

574
00:50:09,585 --> 00:50:11,501
Now...

575
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:15,418
Let's get to business.

576
00:50:17,168 --> 00:50:19,460
We've got a tricky situation here.

577
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:21,835
Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.

578
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:26,626
And he might be able to get it,
cos they say he's psychic.

579
00:50:28,168 --> 00:50:31,210
And I have a plan
to keep this from happening.

580
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:36,251
Do you think you could play along?

581
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,460
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

582
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:41,001
Cos otherwise, I'll erase your ass.

583
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:59,210
(Officer) You've got some
identification? Yeah, you too.

584
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:03,293
Taxi? You need a taxi, sir?
I got magazines, music, whisky.

585
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,001
Hey, man, you need a cab, man?
Come on! Come on!

586
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:16,501
(indistinct chatter)

587
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:32,751
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

588
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:35,335
Yes, I would like
to have a room, please.

589
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:43,418
Nice to have you back, Mr Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?

590
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:45,251
Oh, definitely.

591
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:49,376
Seems you've left something
in our safe.

592
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:51,210
Could you get it, please?

593
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:58,210
Identification?

594
00:52:07,668 --> 00:52:10,293
- I'll encode your room key.
- Thank you.

595
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:29,835
- Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

596
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:32,585
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

597
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:45,460
Thank you.

598
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,210
Hey, man, you need a cab?

599
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:57,751
- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

600
00:52:57,918 --> 00:53:01,043
- Where's yours?
- Right over there, man.

601
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,293
Hey! Hey, man.

602
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,293
Hey, asshole! That's my fare!

603
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,126
- Eat this!
- Damn you, Benny!

604
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:10,543
(Explosion and screaming)

605
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,001
Welcome to Mars, man!

606
00:53:20,168 --> 00:53:21,751
What the hell was that, an accident?

607
00:53:21,918 --> 00:53:25,210
That's the rebels, man.
Let's get outta here...

608
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:27,168
Before they arrest us!

609
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:29,043
What do the rebels want?

610
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,668
The usual.
More money, more freedom, more air.

611
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:38,918
So, where to?

612
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:40,793
Last Resort.

613
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,876
You're getting off to an early start.

614
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:46,126
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

615
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:49,543
Well, actually, no. Well, sort of.

616
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,876
(Laughs) The man don't even know
whether he's been to Mars or not.

617
00:53:57,585 --> 00:53:59,335
(Metallic rattling)

618
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:06,793
Voila. Venusville.

619
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,293
Ha, ha!
Hey, you see anything you like?

620
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,585
Well, this is the end of the line.
We'd better walk from here.

621
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,668
I'll show you where.

622
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:23,376
- Do you want to know the future?
- What about the past?

623
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:27,210
Come on. It's around the corner,
right down this alley.

624
00:54:27,376 --> 00:54:29,418
They got everything.

625
00:54:32,085 --> 00:54:33,751
Notbad,huh?

626
00:54:35,418 --> 00:54:39,793
Read your palm? Your mind? Your aura?
Probe the secrets of your heart?

627
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,085
I bet I can guess your birthday.

628
00:54:42,251 --> 00:54:45,210
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

629
00:54:47,876 --> 00:54:50,085
- Tell me, are all psychics...?
- Freaks?

630
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:52,210
Afraid so, man.
It goes with the territory.

631
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:57,335
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes, no air to clean the rays.

632
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:01,376
So, this is it. The Last Resort.
You sure you want to go in here?

633
00:55:01,543 --> 00:55:04,876
- Why not?
- There's a better place down there.

634
00:55:05,043 --> 00:55:07,710
The girls are cleaner,
the liquor ain't watered down...

635
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:10,210
- Sure, and you get kickbacks.
-(Laughs)

636
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:13,210
Hey, man, I got five kids to feed.

637
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,918
Take them to the dentist.

638
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:17,585
Hey, thanks, mister!
I'll be waiting for you.

639
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:19,876
You just take your time.
Benny's the name.

640
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:22,293
(Upbeat music playing)

641
00:55:40,126 --> 00:55:42,085
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Melina.

642
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,960
She's busy.

643
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:45,960
But Mary here, she's free.

644
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,418
Well, not free, honey, but...

645
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,626
...available.

646
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:54,376
Ha-ha-ha!

647
00:55:54,543 --> 00:55:56,835
Thanks. I'll wait for Melina.

648
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:58,126
Earth slime.

649
00:55:58,293 --> 00:56:00,876
Thing is, friend, Mel's real picky.

650
00:56:01,043 --> 00:56:03,251
She kind of sticks to her regulars.

651
00:56:03,418 --> 00:56:05,418
She'll like me.

652
00:56:06,418 --> 00:56:07,626
Mel!

653
00:56:07,793 --> 00:56:09,293
- Hey, Mel!
- (Laughter)

654
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:46,918
Hello, Hauser.

655
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:49,585
Still bulging, I see.

656
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:51,001
(Groans)

657
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:54,376
- What you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

658
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:58,376
I think it's still hungry.

659
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,626
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here, Hauser.

660
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:05,710
Look who's talking.

661
00:57:05,876 --> 00:57:08,585
Hey, Tony,
give the big guy a break.

662
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:11,001
Relax. You'll live longer.

663
00:57:11,168 --> 00:57:12,918
Come on.

664
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:21,168
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

665
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:24,876
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

666
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:41,710
You son of a bitch.

667
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,543
You're alive? I thought that
Cohaagen tortured you to death.

668
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,501
Well, I guess he didn't.

669
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:50,418
And you couldn't get me a message? You
never wondered what happened to me?

670
00:57:58,001 --> 00:58:00,335
Hauser, thank God you're alive.

671
00:58:01,418 --> 00:58:03,835
Melin... Melina. Melina.

672
00:58:04,668 --> 00:58:08,585
- Melina, I have to tell you something.
- What?

673
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,293
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

674
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,543
I don't remember you.

675
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,043
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

676
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,501
Did you get amnesia?
How did you get here?

677
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:24,960
- Hauser left me a note.
- Hauser? You're Hauser.

678
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,001
Not anymore.

679
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:30,168
Now I'm Quaid. Douglas Quaid.

680
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:37,418
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- I didn't. Cohaagen stole it.

681
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:42,043
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

682
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,585
This is too weird.

683
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:46,168
He dumped me on earth
with a wife and a lousy job...

684
00:58:46,335 --> 00:58:49,168
Did you say wife?
Are you fucking married?

685
00:58:49,335 --> 00:58:51,293
- She wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't?

686
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,710
How stupid of me.
She was Hauser's wife?

687
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:56,876
- Look. Forget that I said wife.
- Let's just forget everything.

688
00:58:57,043 --> 00:59:00,543
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

689
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:05,001
Because you're still
working for Cohaagen.

690
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:07,585
Don't be ridiculous.

691
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,501
You never loved me, Hauser.

692
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:14,585
You just used me to get inside.

693
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,710
Inside what?

694
00:59:20,793 --> 00:59:22,793
I think you'd better leave.

695
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,043
- Hauser sent me to do something.
- I'm not falling for it.

696
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,376
He says there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

697
00:59:28,543 --> 00:59:30,376
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

698
00:59:30,543 --> 00:59:32,668
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

699
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,626
People are trying to kill me.

700
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:37,126
Really?

701
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:41,543
All right, I'm leaving.

702
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:52,043
(Benny chuckles)

703
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:56,376
Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands.

704
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,210
I think you're doing
just fine with two.

705
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:01,668
Excuse me, baby.
We'll pick this up later.

706
01:00:01,835 --> 01:00:04,168
Hey, that didn't take long.

707
01:00:04,335 --> 01:00:06,835
Listen. Let me ask you a question.
Did you ever fuck a mutant?

708
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:09,376
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

709
01:00:09,543 --> 01:00:12,335
Man, you won't know
if you're coming or going.

710
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:25,585
'This afternoon at 4:30pm,
I signed an order declaring martial law

711
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:27,835
'throughout the Mars federal colony.

712
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:32,751
'I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.

713
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:34,918
'Mr Kuato and his terrorists
must understand

714
01:00:35,085 --> 01:00:38,710
'that their self- defeating efforts
will only bring misery and suffering...'

715
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:42,168
(Knocks on door)

716
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:45,168
- (Man) Mr Quaid?
- What?

717
01:00:45,335 --> 01:00:47,835
I need to talk to you
about Mr Hauser.

718
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:51,251
- Who are you?
- Dr Edgemar from Recall.

719
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:53,585
- How did you find me?
- It's difficult to explain.

720
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,835
Could you open the door?
I'm unarmed.

721
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:01,210
Don't worry. I'm alone.
May I come in?

722
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,335
What do you want?

723
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:06,751
This is going to be very difficult
for you to accept, Mr Quaid.

724
01:01:06,918 --> 01:01:11,876
- I'm listening.
- You're not really standing here now.

725
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,043
- Doc, you could have fooled me.
- I'm quite serious.

726
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:18,293
You're not here and neither am I.

727
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,793
That's amazing.

728
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,585
- Where are we?
- At Recall.

729
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,793
You're strapped into
an implant chair,

730
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,210
and I'm monitoring you
from the psychoprobe console.

731
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:31,626
Ah, I get it. I'm dreaming.

732
01:01:31,793 --> 01:01:35,001
And all this is part of the delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

733
01:01:35,168 --> 01:01:36,501
Not exactly.

734
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:40,751
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes

735
01:01:40,918 --> 01:01:43,876
but you're inventing it yourself
as you go along.

736
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,376
If it is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

737
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:52,168
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

738
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:55,668
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

739
01:01:55,835 --> 01:01:58,043
We can't snap you
out of your fantasy,

740
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:01,335
and I've been sent in
to try to talk you down.

741
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:03,251
How much is Cohaagen
paying you for this?

742
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:08,876
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

743
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:11,251
Everything after that,
the chases, the trip to Mars,

744
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:15,876
the suite at the Hilton, are elements
of your Recall Holiday and Ego Trip.

745
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:18,335
You paid to be a secret agent.

746
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,918
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

747
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:23,751
And what about the girl?

748
01:02:23,918 --> 01:02:26,460
Brunette, athletic,
sleazy and demure?

749
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:29,001
Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

750
01:02:29,168 --> 01:02:32,710
She's real. I dreamt about her
before I even went to Recall.

751
01:02:32,876 --> 01:02:34,835
Ha, Mr Quaid.

752
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:39,001
Can you hear yourself?
She's real because you dreamed her?

753
01:02:39,168 --> 01:02:42,085
- That's right.
- Maybe this will convince you.

754
01:02:42,251 --> 01:02:44,626
Would you mind opening the door?

755
01:02:46,626 --> 01:02:51,085
- You open it.
- No need to be rude. I'll do it.

756
01:02:57,501 --> 01:02:58,751
Sweetheart?

757
01:03:01,293 --> 01:03:03,710
Come in, Mrs Quaid.

758
01:03:07,585 --> 01:03:12,210
- I suppose you're not here either.
- I'm here...at Recall.

759
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,626
I love you.

760
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:22,043
Right.
That's why you tried to kill me.

761
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:25,251
No. I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

762
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:28,501
I want you to come back to me.

763
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:33,960
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr Quaid?

764
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:35,960
That you're having
a paranoid episode

765
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:38,710
triggered by acute
neurochemical trauma?

766
01:03:38,876 --> 01:03:42,751
Or that you're really an invincible
secret agent from Mars,

767
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:46,960
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think

768
01:03:47,126 --> 01:03:49,043
he's a lowly construction worker?

769
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:58,835
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

770
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,918
You're a fine, upstanding man.
You have a beautiful wife who loves you.

771
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,418
- Your whole life is ahead of you.
- I do.

772
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,043
But you've got to want
to return to reality.

773
01:04:12,418 --> 01:04:15,001
Let's assume I do. Then what?

774
01:04:17,918 --> 01:04:20,960
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

775
01:04:21,126 --> 01:04:24,335
It's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.

776
01:04:25,251 --> 01:04:27,835
Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

777
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:36,126
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

778
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:38,251
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.

779
01:04:38,418 --> 01:04:41,376
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a difference to me.

780
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:45,960
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.

781
01:04:46,126 --> 01:04:49,418
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

782
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,793
Doug, let Dr Edgemar help you.

783
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,043
The walls of reality
will come crashing down.

784
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,376
One minute you'll be
the saviour of the rebel cause,

785
01:04:56,543 --> 01:05:00,001
and the next thing you know
you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

786
01:05:00,168 --> 01:05:04,085
You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilisations, as you requested,

787
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:06,876
but in the end, back on earth
you'll be lobotomised!

788
01:05:09,418 --> 01:05:13,335
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!

789
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:22,501
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.

790
01:05:26,793 --> 01:05:28,918
Swallow it!

791
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:33,960
Go ahead, sweetheart.

792
01:05:56,668 --> 01:06:00,001
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

793
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,835
(Groaning)

794
01:06:14,668 --> 01:06:16,001
Ah!

795
01:06:19,668 --> 01:06:20,626
Aargh!

796
01:06:20,793 --> 01:06:23,293
That's for making me come to Mars.

797
01:06:24,585 --> 01:06:28,001
You know how much I hate
this fucking planet!

798
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:31,126
Cuff him.

799
01:06:37,835 --> 01:06:41,210
- 'I got him.'
- Bring him down in the service elevator.

800
01:06:43,376 --> 01:06:44,918
Let's go.

801
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,626
(Grunts)

802
01:07:00,126 --> 01:07:02,001
(Lift bell rings)

803
01:07:11,168 --> 01:07:13,960
(Beeping)

804
01:07:16,585 --> 01:07:18,210
(Beeps)

805
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,335
FUCK you!

806
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,751
(Gunshot)

807
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:11,126
Dot-I9

808
01:08:13,126 --> 01:08:15,168
Honey...

809
01:08:15,335 --> 01:08:17,793
You wouldn't hurt me,
would you, sweetheart?

810
01:08:19,585 --> 01:08:22,835
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

811
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:25,126
After all, we're married.

812
01:08:30,543 --> 01:08:32,043
Consider that a divorce.

813
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:36,168
That was your wife?

814
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,626
What a bitch.

815
01:08:43,418 --> 01:08:45,668
(Beeping)

816
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,835
Hey, get out of the way!

817
01:08:55,168 --> 01:08:56,835
I thought you didn't like me.

818
01:08:57,001 --> 01:08:59,626
If Cohaagen wants you dead,
you might be OK.

819
01:08:59,793 --> 01:09:03,168
- Got it.
- So you've come back to apologise.

820
01:09:03,335 --> 01:09:05,001
Kuato wants to see you.

821
01:09:05,168 --> 01:09:06,918
(Beeping)

822
01:09:07,085 --> 01:09:08,626
Come on.

823
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,501
- Now what?
- Jump!

824
01:09:42,293 --> 01:09:44,001
Ah!

825
01:09:58,918 --> 01:10:00,626
(Grunts)

826
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:12,001
No! Don't do it!
You'll crack the fucking dome!

827
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:18,710
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

828
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,543
- Move!
- Hey!

829
01:10:34,085 --> 01:10:36,001
Taxi!

830
01:10:36,876 --> 01:10:39,001
Melina! Melina!

831
01:10:42,126 --> 01:10:43,543
- Need a ride?
- Last Resort. Quick!

832
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,168
You guys are going in circles.

833
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:51,126
Jesus!

834
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:53,418
Come on! You drive!

835
01:10:53,585 --> 01:10:54,626
You guys are in trouble?

836
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:56,501
Go! Go!

837
01:11:07,293 --> 01:11:10,126
- What are you trying to do to me?
- Shut up and drive!

838
01:11:10,293 --> 01:11:12,501
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

839
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,210
Aargh!

840
01:11:46,585 --> 01:11:47,626
Shit!

841
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:49,501
- No brakes! Ah!
- Stop it!

842
01:11:49,668 --> 01:11:51,293
You idiot!

843
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:55,710
What are you doing?

844
01:12:02,043 --> 01:12:03,460
(People screaming)

845
01:12:08,293 --> 01:12:11,001
Oh, Christ! Now they're after me!

846
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:13,501
Give me that!

847
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:15,626
Get out of the way!

848
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,210
Hey!

849
01:12:22,126 --> 01:12:23,543
Tony!

850
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,626
Get out of the way!
Come on!

851
01:12:29,793 --> 01:12:32,168
Come on! Come on!

852
01:12:32,335 --> 01:12:33,585
Quick!

853
01:12:35,543 --> 01:12:36,918
- Thank you, Tony.
- Uh-um.

854
01:12:40,918 --> 01:12:42,668
(People screaming)

855
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:04,001
Hey! You wanna have some fun?

856
01:13:04,168 --> 01:13:05,293
Where are they?

857
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,918
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

858
01:13:09,043 --> 01:13:10,501
(Screaming)

859
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:17,876
Maybe you know.

860
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:26,543
Kill them all!

861
01:13:29,501 --> 01:13:30,793
(Screaming)

862
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:39,251
Ah!

863
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:42,126
Thumbelina!

864
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,335
Richter!

865
01:14:08,501 --> 01:14:11,835
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

866
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:14,668
- We've got them pinned down.
- 'Stop fighting and pull out.'

867
01:14:14,835 --> 01:14:16,710
But they've got Quaid.
They're protecting him.

868
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:21,085
'Perfect.
Get out of Sector G now.

869
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:22,710
'Don't think.'

870
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:25,293
- 'Do it!'
- Yes, sir.

871
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,293
Pull 'em out.

872
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,751
Everybody, pull out!

873
01:14:29,918 --> 01:14:31,460
Move!

874
01:14:40,293 --> 01:14:43,418
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

875
01:14:43,585 --> 01:14:45,543
(Groans)

876
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:46,876
The first settlers are buried here.

877
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:51,001
They worked themselves to death, but
Cohaagen ended up with all the money.

878
01:15:51,168 --> 01:15:53,751
He built cheap domes and
watched the kids turn into freaks.

879
01:15:53,918 --> 01:15:55,085
I saw them.

880
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:57,876
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

881
01:15:58,043 --> 01:15:59,626
Maybe you can change all that.

882
01:16:00,418 --> 01:16:03,876
(Benny) Hey, I think my grandpa
might be here.

883
01:16:04,043 --> 01:16:05,626
So what can I do?

884
01:16:05,793 --> 01:16:08,460
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

885
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:11,126
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

886
01:16:11,293 --> 01:16:14,251
- Maybe you'll remember you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

887
01:16:15,543 --> 01:16:17,460
Since when?

888
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:28,876
Freeze!

889
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,710
Come on, Melina.

890
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:33,293
Kuato's waiting.

891
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:35,835
I didn't find Grandpa, but...

892
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:38,376
Oh, shit.

893
01:16:38,543 --> 01:16:41,626
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

894
01:16:41,793 --> 01:16:45,960
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
I'm on your side.

895
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:58,418
You're a mutant, huh?

896
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:00,835
All right, let's go.

897
01:17:16,043 --> 01:17:18,751
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

898
01:17:18,918 --> 01:17:20,626
(Mutant) 'It won't do any good.

899
01:17:20,793 --> 01:17:24,085
- 'Cohaagen depressurised the tunnels.'
- Then drill through to Section M.

900
01:17:24,251 --> 01:17:27,126
'We can't.
We're running out of air.

901
01:17:27,293 --> 01:17:29,293
'We need help.'

902
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:32,085
Sit tight.
Melina just got here with Quaid.

903
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:34,835
'I hope he was worth it.'

904
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:36,835
So do I.

905
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:40,876
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look glad.

906
01:17:41,043 --> 01:17:44,251
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
He shut off the air.

907
01:17:44,418 --> 01:17:46,501
You must know something
pretty important, Quaid.

908
01:17:46,668 --> 01:17:48,668
He wants you.

909
01:17:48,835 --> 01:17:52,168
If we don't hand you over, everybody
in this sector will be dead by morning.

910
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,168
Then we don't have much choice.
Do we?

911
01:17:54,335 --> 01:17:55,876
We can't turn him in.

912
01:17:57,168 --> 01:17:59,501
That's up to Kuato.
Come with me, Quaid.

913
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:15,668
Sit down.

914
01:18:15,835 --> 01:18:18,126
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

915
01:18:18,793 --> 01:18:21,168
You heard the rumours
about the Pyramid Mine?

916
01:18:21,335 --> 01:18:23,126
Yeah.

917
01:18:23,293 --> 01:18:26,543
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

918
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,960
What? Aliens?

919
01:18:30,585 --> 01:18:33,293
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

920
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:35,918
Yes, you do.
That's why we brought you here.

921
01:18:36,085 --> 01:18:38,626
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole

922
01:18:38,793 --> 01:18:40,835
you call a brain.

923
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,251
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

924
01:18:45,418 --> 01:18:48,168
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

925
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,835
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

926
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,293
Ah!

927
01:19:31,376 --> 01:19:33,460
What do you want, Mr Quaid?

928
01:19:34,543 --> 01:19:36,251
The same as you. To remember.

929
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:38,585
But Why?

930
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:42,460
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

931
01:19:45,876 --> 01:19:49,085
A man is defined by his actions...

932
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,376
not his memory.

933
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:55,585
Please take my hands.

934
01:19:57,835 --> 01:19:59,668
Ah!

935
01:20:01,335 --> 01:20:03,793
Now open your mind to me.

936
01:20:04,918 --> 01:20:06,793
Please.

937
01:20:09,126 --> 01:20:11,835
Open your mind.

938
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:16,376
Open your mind.

939
01:20:18,585 --> 01:20:22,251
Open your mind.

940
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:27,376
Open your mind.

941
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,835
Open your mind.

942
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,710
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

943
01:21:06,876 --> 01:21:09,168
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.

944
01:21:09,335 --> 01:21:11,293
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

945
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:14,293
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

946
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:17,293
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

947
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,793
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

948
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,960
Who knows what the hell they thought?
They weren't human.

949
01:21:23,126 --> 01:21:25,585
Maybe it's a trap.
Maybe they want a meltdown.

950
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:27,835
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.

951
01:21:28,001 --> 01:21:30,501
What is it?
A million? Half a million?

952
01:21:30,668 --> 01:21:33,626
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

953
01:21:33,793 --> 01:21:35,668
Let's make sure Kuato...

954
01:22:01,376 --> 01:22:03,126
(Heavy rumbling)

955
01:22:06,585 --> 01:22:09,918
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

956
01:22:11,335 --> 01:22:13,876
They found us! Shit! Let's go!

957
01:22:15,126 --> 01:22:17,751
Wake up! Snap out of it now!
Come on!

958
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:24,835
- They found us! Everybody out!
- Melina!

959
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:26,835
(Kuato) Get moving! Get out!

960
01:22:28,335 --> 01:22:30,001
Get out!

961
01:22:39,043 --> 01:22:41,085
Everybody out! Get out!

962
01:22:46,751 --> 01:22:49,043
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

963
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:52,376
Benny, come on!

964
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:59,126
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

965
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:12,585
- Ah!

966
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:21,918
Put these spacesuits on!
We're going outside!

967
01:23:24,585 --> 01:23:26,585
Benny, hurry.

968
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:38,210
Congratulations, Quaid.
You led us right to him.

969
01:23:38,376 --> 01:23:41,126
How can you do this?
You're a mutant.

970
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:46,168
- I got four kids to feed.
- So what happened to number five?

971
01:23:48,085 --> 01:23:51,293
(Laughs) Oh, shit, man. You got me.

972
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,043
I ain't even married.

973
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:55,335
Now put your fucking hands
in the air!

974
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:03,126
(Kuato) Quaid.

975
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,710
Quaid.

976
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:11,876
Forget it, man.
His fortunetelling days are over.

977
01:24:14,585 --> 01:24:17,293
Start the reactor.

978
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:19,293
Free Mars.

979
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,793
(Gunshot)

980
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:27,043
Mr Cohaagen
would like to talk to you.

981
01:24:35,043 --> 01:24:37,835
So this is the great man.

982
01:24:42,376 --> 01:24:44,501
No wonder he kept out of sight.

983
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,668
Well, my boy...

984
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,876
- You're a hero.
- Fuck you.

985
01:24:53,043 --> 01:24:56,710
Uh? Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.

986
01:24:56,876 --> 01:25:01,085
The resistance is completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

987
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:02,585
He's lying.

988
01:25:03,585 --> 01:25:06,251
You two-faced bastard.

989
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:11,085
Ha, ha. You can't blame him, angel.
He's innocent.

990
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,793
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.

991
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:20,126
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.

992
01:25:20,293 --> 01:25:24,376
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.

993
01:25:24,543 --> 01:25:27,626
You know you're lying.
Hauser turned against you.

994
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,460
That's what we wanted
you to think.

995
01:25:34,376 --> 01:25:37,543
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.

996
01:25:38,835 --> 01:25:40,668
It was the only way
to fool the psychics.

997
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:42,293
Get your story straight.

998
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:45,876
This idiot here has been trying to kill me
ever since I went to Recall.

999
01:25:46,043 --> 01:25:48,251
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.

1000
01:25:48,418 --> 01:25:51,668
He wasn't in on it.
You set him off by going to Recall.

1001
01:25:52,418 --> 01:25:55,251
- So why am I still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

1002
01:25:55,418 --> 01:25:57,210
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

1003
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,876
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money,

1004
01:26:01,043 --> 01:26:04,876
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.

1005
01:26:05,043 --> 01:26:07,460
Sorry. Too perfect.

1006
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:09,210
Perfect, my ass!

1007
01:26:09,376 --> 01:26:11,960
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

1008
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:16,085
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

1009
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:20,001
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

1010
01:26:20,168 --> 01:26:21,501
Well, Cohaagen,

1011
01:26:21,668 --> 01:26:25,210
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.

1012
01:26:26,543 --> 01:26:29,210
Well, don't take my word for it.

1013
01:26:31,043 --> 01:26:36,168
- Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
- Who is it this time? My mother?

1014
01:26:38,251 --> 01:26:39,585
'Howdy, Quaid.

1015
01:26:39,751 --> 01:26:43,210
'If you're listening to this,
it means that Kuato is dead

1016
01:26:43,376 --> 01:26:45,585
'and you have led us to him.

1017
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:47,710
'I knew you wouldn't let me down.

1018
01:26:47,876 --> 01:26:52,501
'Sorry for the shit I've put you through,
but hey, what are friends for?

1019
01:26:52,668 --> 01:26:55,876
'I would like to wish you
happiness and long life, old buddy,

1020
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:58,876
'but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.

1021
01:26:59,043 --> 01:27:03,210
'You see, it's my body
you've got there and I want it back.

1022
01:27:03,376 --> 01:27:07,501
'Sorry to be an Indian giver,
but I was here first.

1023
01:27:07,668 --> 01:27:10,210
'So adios, amigo.

1024
01:27:10,376 --> 01:27:13,501
'And thanks for not
getting yourself killed.

1025
01:27:13,668 --> 01:27:16,251
'Hey, maybe we'll meet
in our dreams.

1026
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:21,876
'You never know.'

1027
01:27:26,543 --> 01:27:28,668
(Quaid) You bastards!

1028
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:48,251
Let go of me!

1029
01:28:04,376 --> 01:28:06,376
(Man #1) Ready?
(Man #2) Auto.

1030
01:28:06,543 --> 01:28:09,460
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

1031
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,585
Relax, Quaid.

1032
01:28:13,751 --> 01:28:17,085
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

1033
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:20,376
Not true.
He's one of my best friends.

1034
01:28:20,543 --> 01:28:23,376
Besides, he's got
a big house and a Mercedes.

1035
01:28:23,543 --> 01:28:27,501
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.

1036
01:28:27,668 --> 01:28:30,543
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

1037
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:32,876
I'll bust his balls.

1038
01:28:35,168 --> 01:28:37,376
Uh-uh, princess.

1039
01:28:37,543 --> 01:28:39,876
We're having you fixed.

1040
01:28:40,043 --> 01:28:43,210
You're going to be
respectful, compliant

1041
01:28:43,376 --> 01:28:46,793
and appreciative,
the way a woman should be.

1042
01:28:50,668 --> 01:28:52,751
Mr Cohaagen, telephone.

1043
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:57,085
Yes? What is it?

1044
01:28:57,251 --> 01:28:59,876
'The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.

1045
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,210
'What do you want me
to do about it?'

1046
01:29:02,376 --> 01:29:06,376
- Don't do anything.
- 'But they won't last an hour, sir.'

1047
01:29:06,543 --> 01:29:08,918
Fuck 'em. It'll be a good lesson
to the others.

1048
01:29:09,085 --> 01:29:12,876
Come on, you got what you want.
Give these people air.

1049
01:29:13,043 --> 01:29:16,793
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.

1050
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,085
Fire it up, Doc.

1051
01:29:18,251 --> 01:29:20,293
Excuse me, Doctor.

1052
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,501
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

1053
01:29:23,543 --> 01:29:24,751
Oh, really?

1054
01:29:35,251 --> 01:29:38,585
Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.
Why don't you and Melina drop by?

1055
01:29:38,751 --> 01:29:40,251
- Remind him, Doc.
- Sure.

1056
01:29:40,418 --> 01:29:42,001
See you at the party.

1057
01:29:56,668 --> 01:29:59,168
Keep still.
Fighting just makes it hurt.

1058
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,751
If you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.

1059
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,460
Hey, don't!

1060
01:30:27,376 --> 01:30:29,043
Melina, hold on!

1061
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:55,210
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

1062
01:30:55,376 --> 01:30:58,751
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

1063
01:31:01,668 --> 01:31:04,043
Let's get the hell out of here.

1064
01:31:30,293 --> 01:31:32,626
You have to make a decision, sir.

1065
01:31:43,126 --> 01:31:44,418
Kill him.

1066
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:47,626
It's about goddamn time.

1067
01:32:39,918 --> 01:32:42,543
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

1068
01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:46,335
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

1069
01:32:46,501 --> 01:32:50,460
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

1070
01:32:50,626 --> 01:32:53,751
The reactor makes air.
That's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

1071
01:32:53,918 --> 01:32:55,335
Where's this reactor come from?

1072
01:32:55,501 --> 01:32:57,460
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

1073
01:32:57,626 --> 01:33:01,001
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

1074
01:33:03,626 --> 01:33:05,835
What the hell?

1075
01:33:29,293 --> 01:33:33,335
Quaid! Hey, Quaid,
you remember me?

1076
01:33:33,501 --> 01:33:35,751
Benny! Benny's the name!

1077
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:51,501
Oh, that's good!

1078
01:33:57,293 --> 01:34:01,460
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!
I'm gonna grind you up!

1079
01:34:07,168 --> 01:34:10,418
Ha-ha! I'm coming!

1080
01:34:10,585 --> 01:34:12,418
I'm coming for you, baby!

1081
01:34:27,918 --> 01:34:29,960
What the fuck is this?

1082
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:38,585
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

1083
01:34:41,001 --> 01:34:43,418
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!

1084
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:46,585
Benny, here!

1085
01:34:49,793 --> 01:34:51,418
Where the fuck are you?

1086
01:34:57,085 --> 01:34:58,793
Screw you!

1087
01:35:04,918 --> 01:35:08,793
- Quaid, get over here!
- What is it?

1088
01:35:09,793 --> 01:35:13,585
- There's an opening.
- I knew it.

1089
01:35:42,418 --> 01:35:45,626
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.

1090
01:35:45,793 --> 01:35:49,043
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The bastard won't turn it on.

1091
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:53,501
Of course not. If Mars had
an atmosphere, he'd lose control.

1092
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:56,085
See down there?

1093
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:59,543
It's a glacier.

1094
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:02,751
The whole core of Mars is ice.

1095
01:36:02,918 --> 01:36:07,126
The reactor melts it
and it releases the oxygen.

1096
01:36:07,293 --> 01:36:08,543
Come on.

1097
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:11,626
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

1098
01:36:11,793 --> 01:36:14,626
Enough for the whole planet.

1099
01:36:14,793 --> 01:36:17,085
If we turn it on in time.

1100
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:25,710
Come on. Come on!

1101
01:36:42,626 --> 01:36:43,876
Hold on.

1102
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:16,085
Now!

1103
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,710
Son of a bitch.

1104
01:37:55,585 --> 01:37:57,168
Move!

1105
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:02,001
He's got a hologram!

1106
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:26,710
You think this is
the real Quaid? It is.

1107
01:39:46,126 --> 01:39:48,376
You're coming with me!

1108
01:40:02,085 --> 01:40:04,293
See you at the party, Richter.

1109
01:40:42,585 --> 01:40:47,001
- Don't touch that! Get back!
- What are you afraid of?

1110
01:40:47,168 --> 01:40:49,460
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

1111
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:52,751
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

1112
01:40:52,918 --> 01:40:55,168
Mars will go into global meltdown.

1113
01:40:55,335 --> 01:40:57,835
That's why the aliens
never turned it on.

1114
01:40:58,001 --> 01:40:59,960
And you expect me to believe you?

1115
01:41:00,126 --> 01:41:04,751
Who gives a shit what you believe?
In 30 seconds you'll be dead.

1116
01:41:04,918 --> 01:41:08,126
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for cornflakes.

1117
01:41:11,835 --> 01:41:15,793
I didn't want it to end this way.
I wanted Hauser back. But no.

1118
01:41:17,126 --> 01:41:19,126
You had to be Quaid!

1119
01:41:19,293 --> 01:41:21,626
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

1120
01:41:21,793 --> 01:41:24,876
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

1121
01:41:25,043 --> 01:41:29,001
Well, all dreams come to an end.

1122
01:42:43,793 --> 01:42:46,043
Melina, hold on!

1123
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:49,751
Don"t do it! We'll all die!

1124
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:53,210
Everybody will die!

1125
01:43:56,293 --> 01:43:57,626
Quaid!

1126
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,418
(Gasping and groaning)

1127
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:01,585
(Distant, low rumbling)

1128
01:46:47,626 --> 01:46:50,085
(Gasping and groaning)

1129
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,835
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

1130
01:49:16,168 --> 01:49:17,668
What's wrong?

1131
01:49:17,835 --> 01:49:21,668
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

1132
01:49:23,168 --> 01:49:26,251
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.
