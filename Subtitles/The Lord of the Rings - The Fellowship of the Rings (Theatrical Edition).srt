2
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,661
The world is changed.

3
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,873
I feel it in the water.

4
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,543
I feel it in the earth.

5
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,131
I smell it in the air.

6
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,425
Much that once was...

7
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,177
...is lost.

8
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,930
For none now live who remember it.

9
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,198
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

10
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,325
Three were given to the Elves:

11
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,287
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

12
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,415
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

13
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,587
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,297
And nine...

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,509
...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

16
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,554
...who, above all else, desire power.

17
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:43,894
For within these rings was bound the
strength and will to govern each race.

18
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,565
But they were all of them deceived.

19
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,901
For another ring was made.

20
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:55,322
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,202
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

22
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,454
...to control all others.

23
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,625
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

24
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,046
...and his will to dominate all life.

25
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,884
One Ring to rule them all.

26
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,387
One by one...

27
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:23,267
...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

28
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,520
But there were some who resisted.

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,650
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,488
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for Middle-earth's freedom.

31
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,438
Victory was near.

32
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,944
But the power of the Ring...

33
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,197
...could not be undone.

34
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,723
It was in this moment...

35
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,309
...when all hope had faded...

36
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,647
...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

37
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,226
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

38
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,277
The Ring passed to Isildur...

39
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,698
...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

40
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,534
But the hearts of Men...

41
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,245
...are easily corrupted.

42
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,125
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.

43
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,637
It betrayed Isildur to his death.

44
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,685
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,229
...were lost.

46
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,274
History became legend...

47
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,484
...legend became myth.

48
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,571
And for 2500 years...

49
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,450
...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,911
Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,707
...it ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:39,921
My precious.

53
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,716
The Ring came to the creature Gollum...

54
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,803
...who took it deep
into the Misty Mountains.

55
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,973
And there it consumed him.

56
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,225
It came to me.

57
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,855
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:01,777
My precious.

59
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,825
The Ring
brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

60
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,871
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,667
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

62
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,129
Darkness crept back into
the forests of the world.

63
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,216
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

64
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,219
...whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,722
And the Ring of Power perceived...

66
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,725
...its time had now come.

67
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,814
It abandoned Gollum.

68
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,985
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

69
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,408
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

70
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,659
What's this?

71
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,327
A Hobbit.

72
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,247
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

73
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,207
A ring.

74
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,292
Lost!

75
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,507
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,009
For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:13,432
...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,458
Down from the door where it began

79
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,091
And I must follow if I can

80
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:53,221
The road goes ever on and on

81
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,892
Down from the door where it began

82
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:02,063
Now far ahead the road has gone

83
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,485
- And I must follow if I can
- You're late.

84
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,575
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

85
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:18,997
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

86
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,428
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

87
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,019
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

88
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,315
What news of the world?
Tell me everything.

89
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,319
Everything? You're far too eager
and curious for a Hobbit.

90
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,946
Most unnatural.

91
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,950
What can I tell you?

92
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:59,538
Life in the wide world goes on
much as it has this past Age.

93
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,374
Full of its own comings and goings.

94
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,460
Scarcely aware of the existence
of Hobbits.

95
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,713
For which I am very thankful.

96
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,679
It's Gandalf!

97
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,902
Oh, the long-expected party.

98
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,702
How is the old rascal?

99
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,330
I hear it'll be a party
of special magnificence.

100
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,500
You know Bilbo.
He's got the place in an uproar.

101
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,419
That should please him.

102
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,005
- Half the Shire's invited.
- Gracious me.

103
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:54,342
He's up to something.
All right, then. Keep your secrets.

104
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,846
Before you came along,
Bagginses were well thought of.

105
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,265
Never had any adventures.

106
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,730
If you're referring to the dragon
incident, I was barely involved.

107
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,525
All I did was give your uncle
a nudge out of the door.

108
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,821
Well, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

109
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,073
Oh, really?

110
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,581
Gandalf! Gandalf!

111
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,047
Fireworks, Gandalf!

112
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,761
Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!

113
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,405
Gandalf?

114
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,077
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

115
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,999
So am I.

116
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,394
Whoa, whoa.

117
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,282
No, thank you!

118
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,412
We don't want any visitors,
well-wishers or relations!

119
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,124
And what about very old friends?

120
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,003
Gandalf?

121
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,133
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

122
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:03,471
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

123
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,225
You haven't aged a day.

124
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,859
Come on, come in!

125
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,445
Welcome, welcome.

126
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,157
Oh, here we are.

127
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,286
Tea? Or maybe something stronger?

128
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,248
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

129
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,502
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

130
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:40,175
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

131
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,011
Just tea, thank you.

132
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,679
Oh.

133
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,060
I expected you last week.

134
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,564
But you come and go as you please.
You always have.

135
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:00,028
I'm a bit unprepared. We've only got
cold chicken and pickle...

136
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,573
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

137
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,702
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

138
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,373
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

139
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,418
I've just found some sponge cake.

140
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,631
I could make eggs...

141
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,758
Oh, Gandalf?

142
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,137
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

143
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,557
- Mind if I eat?
- No, not at all.

144
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,519
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

145
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,312
I'm not at home!

146
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,066
I must get away
from these confounded relatives...

147
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,193
...never giving me any peace.

148
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,947
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

149
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:48,701
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

150
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,831
- You mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes. It's all in hand.

151
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,250
All the arrangements are made.

152
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,920
Oh, thank you.

153
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,464
Frodo suspects something.

154
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,092
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

155
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,928
...not some blockhead from Hardbottle.

156
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,265
You will tell him, won't you?

157
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,184
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

158
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,938
I know.

159
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,652
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

160
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,698
In his heart, Frodo's still in love
with the Shire.

161
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,618
The woods, the fields.

162
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,121
Little rivers.

163
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,295
I am old, Gandalf.

164
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:46,926
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

165
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,639
I feel thin.

166
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,516
Sort of stretched...

167
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,146
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

168
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,817
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

169
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,237
And I don't expect I shall return.

170
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,659
In fact, I mean not to.

171
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,416
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

172
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,849
Ah.

173
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,353
Gandalf, my old friend...

174
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,356
...this will be a night to remember.

175
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,254
Hello, hello.

176
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:09,550
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

177
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,137
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

178
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,310
- I'll just have another ale.
- No, you don't.

179
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,146
Go on!

180
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,117
So there I was...

181
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,413
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

182
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,581
And they were all arguing...

183
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,167
...about how to cook us.

184
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,423
Whether it be turned on a spit or
if they should squash us into jelly.

185
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,969
They spent so much time arguing
whithertos and whyfors...

186
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,764
...that the sun's first light
crept over the trees...

187
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,268
...and turned them all to stone!

188
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,941
Quickly.

189
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,945
Whoa!

190
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,156
Up they go!

191
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,243
No, the big one.

192
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,464
- Done!
- It should be in the ground.

193
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,175
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

194
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,026
Bilbo!

195
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,155
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

196
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,742
There hasn't been a dragon here
for 1000 years.

197
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,842
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

198
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,681
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

199
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,725
I might've known.

200
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,691
Speech, Bilbo!

201
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,860
Speech!

202
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,154
Speech!

203
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,702
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

204
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,705
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

205
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,375
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

206
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,626
...Hornblowers...

207
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,462
...Bolgers...

208
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,381
...Bracegirdles...

209
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,217
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

210
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,556
Today is my 111th birthday!

211
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,892
Happy birthday!

212
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:09,397
But alas, 111 years is far too short
a time to live among...

213
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,483
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

214
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,154
I don't know half of you
as well as I'd like...

215
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,950
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

216
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,414
I, uh...

217
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,296
I have things to do.

218
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,804
I've put this off far too long.

219
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,604
I regret to announce this is the end!

220
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,939
I'm going now.

221
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,943
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

222
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,530
Goodbye.

223
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,900
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

224
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,487
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

225
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:44,700
There are many magic rings in this
world. None should be used lightly.

226
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,078
It was just a bit of fun.

227
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,998
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

228
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,920
- You will keep an eye on Frodo?
- Two eyes.

229
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,798
As often as I can spare them.

230
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,176
- I'm leaving him everything.
- What about the ring?

231
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,721
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

232
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,226
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

233
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,272
No. Wait, it's...

234
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,485
...here in my pocket.

235
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,326
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

236
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,498
Yet, after all, why not?

237
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:38,921
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- You should leave the ring behind.

238
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,549
Is that so hard?

239
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,050
Well, no.

240
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,971
And yes.

241
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,018
Now it comes,
I don't feel like parting with it.

242
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,978
It's mine. It came to me!

243
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:58,399
- There's no need to get angry.
- Lf I'm angry, it's your fault!

244
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,651
It's mine.

245
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,405
My own.

246
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,743
- My precious.
- Precious?

247
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,787
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

248
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,582
What business is it of yours
what I do?

249
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,543
I think you've had that ring
long enough.

250
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,588
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

251
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:25,051
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

252
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,929
I am not trying to rob you.

253
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,644
I'm trying to help you.

254
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,448
All your long years,
we've been friends.

255
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,992
Trust me as you once did.

256
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,704
Let it go.

257
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,249
You're right, Gandalf.

258
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,046
The ring must go to Frodo.

259
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,342
It's late. The road is long.

260
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,053
Yes, it is time.

261
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,891
- Bilbo.
- Hm?

262
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,852
The ring is still in your pocket.

263
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,148
Yes.

264
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,598
I've thought up an ending for my book:

265
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:01,272
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days. "

266
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,859
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

267
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,361
Goodbye, Gandalf.

268
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,741
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

269
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,795
The road goes ever on and on

270
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,758
Until our next meeting.

271
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,748
It's mine. My own.

272
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,376
My precious.

273
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,421
Riddles in the dark.

274
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,008
Bilbo! Bilbo!

275
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,515
My precious.

276
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,352
Precious.

277
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,063
He's gone, hasn't he?

278
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,902
He talked for so long about leaving...

279
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,821
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

280
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,495
Gandalf?

281
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,129
Bilbo's ring.

282
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,840
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

283
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,135
He's left you Bag End.

284
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,308
Along with all his possessions.

285
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,395
The ring is yours now.

286
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,484
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

287
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,945
- I must see to things.
- What things?

288
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:17,408
- Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

289
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,911
I don't understand.

290
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,249
Neither do I.

291
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,629
Keep it secret.

292
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,798
Keep it safe.

293
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,960
Shire!

294
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,380
Baggins!

295
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,848
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

296
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:09,436
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

297
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,315
...and the finding
of the Ring of Power. "

298
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,654
"It has come to me.

299
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,324
The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

300
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,953
All those in my line
shall be bound to its fate...

301
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,957
...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.

302
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,668
It is precious to me...

303
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,171
...though I buy it with great pain.

304
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,512
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

305
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:48,559
The writing, which was as clear
as flame, has all but disappeared.

306
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,813
A secret now
that only fire can tell. "

307
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,332
Shire.

308
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,501
Baggins.

309
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:19,047
There's no Bagginses here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

310
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,259
That way.

311
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,685
- Good night.
- Good night.

312
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,772
Good night, Sam.

313
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,383
Is it secret? Is it safe?

314
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,682
Ah.

315
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,394
What are you doing?

316
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,576
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

317
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,911
It's quite cool.

318
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,208
What can you see?

319
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,379
Can you see anything?

320
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,466
Nothing.

321
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,135
There's nothing.

322
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,721
Wait.

323
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,061
There are markings.

324
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,941
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

325
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,735
There are few who can.

326
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:09,116
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

327
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,826
Mordor!

328
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,078
In the common tongue, it says:

329
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,790
"One Ring to rule them all...

330
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,334
...One Ring to find them...

331
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,753
...One Ring to bring them all...

332
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,048
...and in the darkness bind them. "

333
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,719
This is the One Ring...

334
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:34,182
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

335
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:38,437
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

336
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,773
Bilbo found it.

337
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,151
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

338
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,906
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

339
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:52,492
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

340
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:57,539
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

341
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,167
The Ring has awoken.

342
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,128
It's heard its master's call.

343
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,215
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

344
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,015
No, Frodo.

345
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,269
The spirit of Sauron endured.

346
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:24,816
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

347
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,277
Sauron has returned.

348
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,280
His Orcs have multiplied.

349
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,534
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in Mordor.

350
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:39,498
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

351
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,750
He is seeking it.

352
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,837
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

353
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,757
For the Ring yearns above all else...

354
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,386
...to return to the hand
of its master.

355
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,388
They are one...

356
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,641
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

357
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,892
Frodo...

358
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,353
...he must never find it.

359
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,562
All right.

360
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:07,234
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

361
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,070
No one knows it's here, do they?

362
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,952
Do they, Gandalf?

363
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,415
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

364
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,669
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

365
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,005
But the enemy found him first.

366
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,259
I don't know
how long they tortured him.

367
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:36,930
But amidst the screams and inane
babble, they discerned two words:

368
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,266
Shire!

369
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,059
Baggins!

370
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,103
Shire.

371
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,148
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

372
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,027
Who goes there?

373
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,988
Take it, Gandalf!

374
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,448
- Take it!
- No.

375
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,992
- You must!
- You cannot offer me this!

376
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,537
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

377
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,291
I dare not take it.

378
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,085
Not even to keep it safe.

379
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,213
Understand, Frodo...

380
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,509
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

381
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:25,645
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

382
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,149
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

383
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,652
No, it can't.

384
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,367
What must I do?

385
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,581
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where do I go?

386
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,043
Out of the Shire. The village of Bree.

387
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,419
Bree.

388
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,380
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

389
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,050
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

390
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,012
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

391
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,181
I don't have any answers.

392
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:08,230
I must see the head of my order.
He's both wise and powerful. Trust me.

393
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,565
He'll know what to do.

394
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,027
You'll have to leave the name
Baggins behind.

395
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,738
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

396
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,700
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

397
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,538
I can cut across country
easily enough.

398
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,375
My dear Frodo.

399
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,711
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

400
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,798
You can learn all their ways
in a month.

401
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,384
And yet, after 100 years...

402
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,594
...they can still surprise you.

403
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,556
Get down.

404
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,280
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Were you eavesdropping?

405
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:02,951
I haven't been dropping no eaves.
I was cutting grass under the window.

406
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,579
A little late for trimming the verge!

407
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,623
- I heard voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

408
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,916
Nothing important.

409
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,588
I heard about a ring, a Dark Lord
and the end of the world...

410
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:19,509
Please, Mr. Gandalf, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

411
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,845
No?

412
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,181
Perhaps not.

413
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,852
I've thought of a better use for you.

414
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,607
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

415
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,319
Be careful, both of you.

416
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,363
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

417
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,533
Birds, beasts.

418
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,120
Is it safe?

419
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,165
Never put it on...

420
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,793
...for the Dark Lord's agents
will be drawn to its power.

421
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,462
Always remember...

422
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,132
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

423
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,635
It wants to be found.

424
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,427
This is it.

425
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,888
This is what?

426
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,307
If I take one more step...

427
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,687
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

428
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,401
Come on, Sam.

429
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,703
Remember what Bilbo said:

430
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:14,040
- "It's a dangerous business... "
"Frodo, going out your door.

431
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:18,670
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

432
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,008
...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to. "

433
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,368
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

434
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,203
The hour grows late.

435
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,957
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...

436
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,585
...seeking my counsel.

437
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,797
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

438
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,257
My old friend.

439
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,134
Saruman.

440
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,933
You are sure of this?
Beyond any doubt.

441
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,062
So the Ring of Power has been found.

442
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,440
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

443
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,860
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not see it.

444
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,865
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

445
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:33,787
But we still have time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

446
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,455
Time?

447
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,042
What time do you think we have?

448
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,338
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

449
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,757
He cannot yet take physical form...

450
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,635
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

451
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:54,391
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

452
00:39:54,934 --> 00:40:00,897
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

453
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,527
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

454
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:11,699
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

455
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,452
The Eye of Sauron.

456
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,247
He is gathering all evil to him.

457
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:22,335
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army
great enough to attack Middle-earth.

458
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,046
You know this?

459
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,090
How?

460
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,342
I have seen it.

461
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,971
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

462
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,181
Why?

463
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,351
Why should we fear to use it?

464
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,983
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

465
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,361
We do not know who else
may be watching.

466
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,700
The hour is later than you think.

467
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,202
Sauron's forces are already moving.

468
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,207
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

469
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,625
The Nine?

470
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,879
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

471
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,715
...disguised as riders in black.

472
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,886
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

473
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,723
And kill the one who carries it.

474
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,725
Frodo!

475
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,742
You did not think a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

476
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,287
There are none who can.

477
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,542
Against the power of Mordor...

478
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,337
...there can be no victory.

479
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,467
We must join with him, Gandalf.

480
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,095
We must join with Sauron.

481
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,434
It would be wise, my friend.

482
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,269
Tell me...

483
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,604
...friend...

484
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:10,151
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

485
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,359
I gave you the chance...

486
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,154
...of aiding me willingly...

487
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:59,492
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

488
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,309
Mr. Frodo?

489
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,686
Frodo! Frodo!

490
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,357
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

491
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,527
- It's something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

492
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:39,240
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee. "
And I don't mean to.

493
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:43,119
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

494
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,626
- Frodo! Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello.

495
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,210
Get off him.

496
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,212
Come on, Frodo.

497
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,256
What's the meaning of this?

498
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,467
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

499
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,096
You get back here!

500
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,432
Get out of my field!

501
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,435
You'd better watch out
when I catch you!

502
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,605
I don't know why he's upset.
It's only carrots.

503
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,898
And some cabbages.

504
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,026
And those bags of potatoes
we lifted last week.

505
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:19,238
- And the mushrooms the week before.
Yes, Pippin. My point is...

506
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,616
...he's clearly overreacting.

507
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,326
Run!

508
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,342
Oh, that was close.

509
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,554
I think I've broken something.

510
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,933
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

511
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,770
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut.

512
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,189
- Shortcut to what?
- Mushrooms!

513
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,449
That's mine.

514
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,829
That's nice, Merry.

515
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,415
Here's a nice one, Sam.

516
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,126
I think we should get off the road.

517
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,678
Get off the road!

518
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,388
Quick!

519
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,902
Be quiet!

520
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,054
What was that?

521
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,255
Anything?

522
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,423
Nothing.

523
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,426
What is going on?

524
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,764
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

525
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,809
Frodo?

526
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,353
Get down!

527
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,454
I have to leave the Shire.

528
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,791
Sam and I must get to Bree.

529
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,418
Right.

530
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,046
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

531
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,681
Run!

532
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,893
This way! Follow me!

533
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,522
Run!

534
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,579
Get the rope, Sam!

535
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,000
Frodo!

536
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,877
Run, Frodo!

537
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,337
Go!
Hurry!

538
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,131
Come on!

539
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,092
Come on! Faster!
Jump!

540
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:09,236
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

541
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,336
Come on.

542
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,976
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

543
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,315
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

544
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,902
- What brings you to Bree?
- We wish to stay at the inn.

545
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,113
Our business is our own.

546
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,824
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

547
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,535
It's my job to ask questions
after dark.

548
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,579
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

549
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,915
Can't be too careful.

550
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:26,105
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

551
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,756
Excuse me.

552
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,675
Good evening, little masters.

553
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:59,722
If you need accommodation, we got
cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

554
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,807
Mister?

555
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,186
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

556
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,981
- Underhill.
- We're friends of Gandalf.

557
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:13,486
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf? Gandalf.

558
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,989
Oh, yes...

559
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,325
...I remember. Elderly chap.

560
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,578
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

561
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,789
Not seen him for six months.

562
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,880
What do we do now?

563
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,347
Sam...

564
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,390
...he'll be here. He'll come.

565
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,229
Get out of my way!

566
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,274
What's that?

567
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,985
This, my friend, is a pint.

568
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,779
It comes in pints?

569
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:00,866
- I'm getting one.
- You got a half already!

570
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:11,043
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

571
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,090
Excuse me.

572
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,886
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

573
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:26,433
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

574
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:31,230
I've never heard his right name,
but he's known as Strider.

575
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,817
Strider.

576
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,083
Baggins.

577
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,088
Baggins.

578
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,686
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

579
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,356
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

580
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,610
He's my cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

581
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,029
...and twice removed...

582
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,327
- Pippin!
- Steady on.

583
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,317
You cannot hide.

584
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,406
I see you.

585
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,827
There is no life...

586
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,205
...in the void.

587
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,873
Only...

588
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,292
...death.

589
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:26,178
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill. "

590
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,103
- What do you want?
- More caution. That's no trinket.

591
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,523
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

592
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,359
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

593
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,238
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

594
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,366
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

595
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,618
Yes.

596
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,706
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

597
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,254
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

598
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:06,051
You have a stout heart, Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

599
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,179
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

600
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,431
They're coming.

601
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,139
What are they?

602
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,435
They were once Men.

603
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,854
Great kings of Men.

604
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:44,191
Then Sauron gave to them
nine rings of power.

605
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,945
Blinded by greed,
they took them without question.

606
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,490
One by one, falling into darkness.

607
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,159
Now they are slaves to his will.

608
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,247
They are the NazgûI.

609
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:01,166
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

610
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,377
At all times they feel...

611
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,504
...the presence of the Ring...

612
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:10,217
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

613
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,147
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

614
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:30,362
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

615
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,824
We have no choice but to trust him.

616
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,411
- Where is he leading us?
To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

617
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,873
- To the house of Elrond.
Did you hear? Rivendell.

618
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,209
We're going to see the Elves.

619
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:06,482
- We do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

620
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,401
- You had it.
- We've had one, yes.

621
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,778
What about second breakfast?

622
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,368
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast.

623
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:23,790
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

624
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,170
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

625
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,260
Pippin!

626
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:42,643
The power of Isengard
is at your command...

627
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:47,272
...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

628
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:56,406
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

629
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:06,458
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

630
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,835
We have work to do.

631
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:56,174
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

632
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,385
Rip them all down.

633
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,707
This was the great watchtower
of Amon SûI.

634
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,045
We shall rest here tonight.

635
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:48,185
These are for you.
Keep them close.

636
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,896
I'm going to have a look around.

637
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,150
Stay here.

638
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,905
My tomato's burst.

639
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,990
Could I have some bacon?

640
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,159
Want a tomato?

641
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:08,246
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, crispy bacon.

642
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:11,083
We saved some for you.
Put it out, fools!

643
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:15,170
That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

644
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,472
Go!

645
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,402
Back, you devils!

646
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,111
Frodo!

647
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,117
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.

648
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,114
Strider!

649
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:37,372
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

650
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:43,795
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

651
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,384
Hurry!

652
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:53,555
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

653
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,640
Hold on, Frodo.

654
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,058
Gandalf!

655
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,338
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

656
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,968
Is he going to die?

657
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:42,057
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll become a Wraith like them.

658
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:50,982
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

659
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,650
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

660
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:53,902
It's a weed.

661
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,280
It may help slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

662
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:15,840
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

663
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,699
Frodo.

664
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,468
Who is she?

665
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,887
Frodo.

666
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,431
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

667
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:11,062
He's not going to last.

668
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,940
We must get him to my father.

669
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,569
- I've been looking for you.
- Where are you going?

670
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:23,867
There are five Wraiths behind you.
I don't know where the other four are.

671
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:32,917
What are they saying?

672
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,128
ARWEN:

673
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,633
I do not fear them.

674
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,936
Arwen...

675
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:55,315
...ride hard. Don't look back.

676
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:04,699
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

677
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:02,066
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

678
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,570
If you want him, come and claim him.

679
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,959
No. No!

680
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,507
Frodo, no.

681
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,009
Frodo, don't give in.

682
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,220
Not now.

683
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,650
What grace is given me...

684
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,152
...let it pass to him.

685
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,530
Let him be spared.

686
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,199
Save him.

687
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:50,800
- Where am I?
You're in the house of Elrond.

688
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:57,723
It's 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

689
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:03,438
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

690
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,192
And you're lucky to be here too.

691
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,864
A few more hours and you'd
have been beyond our aid.

692
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:17,201
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

693
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:27,336
What happened, Gandalf?

694
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:33,676
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

695
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,141
I was delayed.

696
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:45,229
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

697
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:53,946
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

698
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,991
Embrace the power of the Ring...

699
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,119
...or embrace your own destruction!

700
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:06,292
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

701
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:10,505
Only one who can bend it to his will.

702
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:15,301
And he does not share power.

703
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,985
So you have chosen death.

704
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,874
Gandalf? What is it?

705
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,627
Nothing, Frodo.

706
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,213
Frodo!

707
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:53,631
Frodo!

708
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,967
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

709
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,928
Sam has hardly left your side.

710
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:01,305
We were that worried about you.

711
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:06,811
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

712
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:11,899
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

713
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:03,284
Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

714
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,994
Bilbo.

715
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,917
"There and Back Again:

716
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,920
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins. "

717
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:21,552
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

718
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:25,681
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

719
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,434
...visit Lake-town...

720
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,063
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

721
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:37,401
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

722
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:51,290
I miss the Shire.

723
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:56,879
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

724
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,758
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

725
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,306
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

726
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,731
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

727
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,151
My dear boy.

728
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:27,243
Now, what have I forgot?
- Packed already?

729
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,829
No harm in being prepared.

730
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,623
- But you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

731
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,668
- More than anything.
- I did.

732
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,795
It's just...

733
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:41,173
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

734
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:45,052
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

735
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:48,556
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

736
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,474
Off home.

737
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,647
You're right, Sam.

738
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:01,569
We did what we set out to do.

739
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,697
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

740
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,162
I am ready to go home.

741
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,998
His strength returns.

742
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:19,879
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

743
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,007
To have come so far
bearing the Ring...

744
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:26,886
...he's shown extraordinary resilience
to its evil.

745
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:30,473
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

746
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:36,103
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

747
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:40,983
Sauron's forces are massing
in the East. He's fixed on Rivendell.

748
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,944
Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

749
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:47,364
Our list of allies grows thin.

750
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,910
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

751
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,747
Saruman has crossed Orcs
with Goblin-men.

752
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:57,416
He's breeding an army in Isengard.

753
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:02,296
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

754
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,882
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

755
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,386
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

756
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:13,974
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

757
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:18,896
Gandalf...

758
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,775
...the Ring cannot stay here.

759
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:45,548
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

760
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:48,467
They must decide now how to end it.

761
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:53,097
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving.

762
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:57,351
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

763
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:02,648
They seek riches. They care nothing
for the troubles of others.

764
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,111
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

765
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:09,154
Men?

766
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:13,284
Men are weak. The race of Men is failing.

767
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:17,872
The blood of Númenor is spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

768
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:21,709
It is because of Men the Ring survives.

769
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,544
I was there, Gandalf.

770
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,047
I was there 3000 years ago...

771
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,307
...when Isildur took the Ring.

772
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:40,352
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

773
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,482
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

774
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,696
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

775
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,491
...where the Ring was forged
and could be destroyed.

776
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,244
Cast it into the fire!

777
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:06,211
- Destroy it!
- No.

778
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,715
Isildur!

779
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:14,887
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

780
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:23,270
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

781
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,858
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

782
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:32,863
- They're divided, leaderless.
- There's one who can unite them.

783
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:36,408
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

784
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,914
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

785
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,249
He has chosen exile.

786
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:20,035
The shards of Narsil.

787
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,002
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

788
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,132
It's still sharp.

789
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:45,102
But no more than a broken heirloom.

790
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:14,965
Why do you fear the past?

791
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:21,221
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

792
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,850
You are not bound to his fate.

793
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:29,354
The same blood flows in my veins.

794
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,943
The same weakness.

795
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:40,449
Your time will come.

796
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:45,079
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

797
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:38,298
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

798
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:45,305
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

799
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,392
And to that I hold.

800
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,187
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

801
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:56,233
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

802
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:08,495
I choose a mortal life.

803
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:14,084
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

804
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,840
...like my heart.

805
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:39,276
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

806
01:26:39,485 --> 01:26:43,447
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

807
01:26:44,073 --> 01:26:48,952
Middle-earth is on the brink of
destruction. None can escape it.

808
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:52,706
You will unite, or you will fall.

809
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:57,169
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

810
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,549
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

811
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,315
So it is true.

812
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:35,916
The doom of Man.
- It is a gift.

813
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:39,211
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

814
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,256
Why not use this Ring?

815
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,509
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

816
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:49,846
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

817
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:52,266
...are your lands kept safe.

818
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:58,397
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

819
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:02,359
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

820
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:07,030
The Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

821
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,784
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

822
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,078
This is no mere Ranger.

823
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:17,708
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

824
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:21,128
You owe him your allegiance.

825
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:27,134
Aragorn.

826
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,722
This is Isildur's heir?

827
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,810
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

828
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:46,528
Gondor has no king.

829
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:50,115
Gondor needs no king.

830
01:28:56,789 --> 01:29:00,459
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

831
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:04,963
You have only one choice.

832
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,507
The Ring must be destroyed.

833
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,349
What are we waiting for?

834
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:30,489
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of GIóin...

835
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:34,910
...by any craft that we here possess.

836
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:39,581
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

837
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:43,627
Only there can it be unmade.

838
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:47,297
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

839
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:52,469
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

840
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:56,473
One of you...

841
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:59,142
...must do this.

842
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:05,774
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

843
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:10,320
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

844
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:15,283
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

845
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:19,746
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

846
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,541
It is a barren wasteland...

847
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:26,336
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

848
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:30,382
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

849
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:34,886
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

850
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,098
Have you heard nothing
Lord Elrond has said?

851
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:42,352
- The Ring must be destroyed.
- And you think you can do it!

852
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:47,232
And if we fail, what happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

853
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:52,696
I'll be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

854
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:57,200
Never trust an Elf!

855
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:04,207
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

856
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:07,419
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

857
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:32,944
I will take it.

858
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,828
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

859
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,171
Though...

860
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,092
...I do not know the way.

861
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:02,432
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

862
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:06,019
...as long as it is yours to bear.

863
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,190
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

864
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,275
...I will.

865
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,822
You have my sword.

866
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:21,701
And you have my bow.

867
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:24,788
And my ax.

868
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,798
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

869
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,470
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

870
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,390
...then Gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

871
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:50,730
- He can't go without me.
- It's not possible to separate you...

872
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:55,819
...even when he's summoned
to a secret Council and you're not.

873
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,321
We're coming too!

874
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:03,118
You'll have to tie us up to stop us.

875
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:06,705
You need people of intelligence
on this sort of...

876
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:08,331
...mission.

877
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:10,041
Quest.

878
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:11,501
Thing.

879
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:16,089
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

880
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:19,551
Nine companions.

881
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:23,179
So be it.

882
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:26,558
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

883
01:33:27,184 --> 01:33:29,019
Great!

884
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,521
Where are we going?

885
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:42,699
My old sword!

886
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,659
Sting.

887
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:46,036
Here, take it.

888
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:55,420
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

889
01:33:56,088 --> 01:34:00,258
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

890
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:05,055
It's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

891
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:07,724
Here's a pretty thing.

892
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,434
Mithril.

893
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:14,606
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

894
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:18,068
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

895
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:22,989
Oh!

896
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:28,161
My old ring.

897
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:33,333
I should very much like...

898
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:37,587
...to hold it again, one last time.

899
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:58,608
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

900
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:03,029
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

901
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:10,620
I'm sorry for everything.

902
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,781
We hold to this course,
west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

903
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:31,743
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will be open to us.

904
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:35,538
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

905
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:39,542
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

906
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:42,378
Move your feet.

907
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:43,922
- Good, Pip.
- Thanks.

908
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,548
Faster!

909
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:50,720
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which they're not...

910
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:53,640
...I'd say we were taking
the long way.

911
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,227
We could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

912
01:36:57,853 --> 01:37:01,731
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

913
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:07,278
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

914
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:17,622
Sorry!

915
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:19,833
Get him!

916
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:23,753
For the Shire!
Hold him down, Merry!

917
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:25,588
You've got my arm!

918
01:37:26,048 --> 01:37:28,675
- What is that?
- It's just a wisp of cloud.

919
01:37:28,884 --> 01:37:31,594
It's moving fast.

920
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:34,013
Against the wind.

921
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,891
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

922
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,853
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

923
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:14,971
Spies of Saruman.

924
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:19,017
The passage south is being watched.

925
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:23,479
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

926
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:37,827
Frodo!

927
01:38:56,805 --> 01:38:59,098
Boromir.

928
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:03,519
It is a strange fate we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

929
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:06,856
...over so small a thing.

930
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:12,028
Such a little thing.

931
01:39:12,237 --> 01:39:13,696
Boromir!

932
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:16,991
Give the Ring to Frodo.

933
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:28,878
As you wish.

934
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:31,631
I care not.

935
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:11,713
So, Gandalf, you tried
to lead them over Caradhras.

936
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:16,509
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

937
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:20,763
If the mountain defeats you...

938
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:25,435
...will you risk
a more dangerous road?

939
01:40:37,781 --> 01:40:40,700
There is a fell voice on the air.

940
01:40:41,785 --> 01:40:43,286
It's Saruman!

941
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:56,883
He's trying to bring down the
mountain! We must turn back!

942
01:40:57,092 --> 01:40:58,926
No!

943
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:07,203
Get off the mountain!

944
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:12,041
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

945
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:15,586
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

946
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:19,507
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

947
01:42:19,716 --> 01:42:22,552
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

948
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:28,224
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

949
01:42:28,892 --> 01:42:33,938
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

950
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:39,610
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

951
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:44,407
Shadow and flame.

952
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:50,496
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

953
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:57,503
Frodo?

954
01:43:00,549 --> 01:43:03,426
We will go through the mines.

955
01:43:04,136 --> 01:43:05,178
So be it.

956
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:15,605
The walls...

957
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:18,357
...of Moria.

958
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:30,453
Well, let's see.

959
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,996
Ithildin.

960
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:36,000
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

961
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:54,143
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

962
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:59,357
- Speak, friend, and enter. "
- What do you suppose that means?

963
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:04,320
Simple. If you're a friend, speak
the password. The doors will open.

964
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:38,062
Mines are no place for a pony.

965
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:42,358
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

966
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:46,320
Go on, Bill. Go on.

967
01:44:46,863 --> 01:44:50,408
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

968
01:44:57,207 --> 01:44:59,792
Do not disturb the water.

969
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:01,877
Oh, it's useless.

970
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,726
It's a riddle.

971
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:22,606
"Speak 'friend' and enter. "

972
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,901
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

973
01:45:27,362 --> 01:45:28,654
Mellon.

974
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:51,594
Soon, Master Elf, you'll enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

975
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:57,767
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

976
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:02,355
This, my friend,
is my cousin Balin's home.

977
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:05,107
And they call it a mine.

978
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:07,276
A mine!

979
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,655
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

980
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:16,952
No.

981
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,372
No...

982
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,291
No!

983
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,462
Goblins.

984
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:34,678
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

985
01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:38,307
Now, get out of here. Get out!

986
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:43,479
Frodo!
Help!

987
01:46:43,688 --> 01:46:45,314
Strider!

988
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:48,317
Help!
Get off him!

989
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:50,152
Aragorn!

990
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:00,955
Frodo!

991
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:03,707
Strider!

992
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:28,357
Into the mines!

993
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:31,735
- Legolas!
Into the cave!

994
01:47:36,032 --> 01:47:37,783
Run!

995
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:58,262
We now have but one choice.

996
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:03,350
We must face the long dark of Moria.

997
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:05,561
Be on your guard.

998
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:09,231
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

999
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:12,943
...in the deep places of the world.

1000
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:24,830
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1001
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,876
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1002
01:48:53,276 --> 01:48:54,985
Pippin.

1003
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:18,300
I have no memory of this place.

1004
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:21,804
Are we lost?
No.

1005
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:24,515
I think we are.
Gandalf's thinking.

1006
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:26,183
Merry?
What?

1007
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:28,310
I'm hungry.

1008
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:44,118
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1009
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:48,455
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1010
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:52,835
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1011
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:55,170
...or was set loose.

1012
01:50:01,344 --> 01:50:06,515
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1013
01:50:06,683 --> 01:50:09,268
He'll never be rid of his need for it.

1014
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:12,438
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him.

1015
01:50:12,647 --> 01:50:13,856
Pity?

1016
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:17,860
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1017
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:23,949
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1018
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,870
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1019
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:34,251
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1020
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:37,379
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1021
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:43,886
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1022
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:47,556
...before this is over.

1023
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:52,895
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1024
01:50:59,569 --> 01:51:02,905
I wish the Ring
had never come to me...

1025
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:06,408
...and none of this had happened.

1026
01:51:06,576 --> 01:51:11,622
So do all who live to see such
times. That isn't for them to decide.

1027
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:17,920
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that's given to us.

1028
01:51:19,422 --> 01:51:23,425
There are other forces at work
besides the will of evil.

1029
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:26,261
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1030
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:31,100
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1031
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:34,436
And that is an encouraging thought.

1032
01:51:37,232 --> 01:51:38,607
Ah!

1033
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:41,276
It's that way.

1034
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:43,737
- He's remembered.
No...

1035
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:47,741
...but the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1036
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:53,163
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1037
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:12,141
Let me risk a little more light.

1038
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:18,856
Behold...

1039
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:24,528
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1040
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,409
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1041
01:52:55,393 --> 01:52:57,227
Gimli!

1042
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:04,318
No.

1043
01:53:04,486 --> 01:53:06,111
No!

1044
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:14,870
No.

1045
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:24,254
"Here lies Balin...

1046
01:53:24,714 --> 01:53:26,715
...son of Fundin...

1047
01:53:27,008 --> 01:53:29,635
...Lord of Moria. "

1048
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,387
He is dead, then.

1049
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:35,849
It's as I feared.

1050
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:56,995
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1051
01:53:57,205 --> 01:54:01,917
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1052
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:05,587
We have barred the gates...

1053
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:08,757
...but cannot hold them for long.

1054
01:54:08,925 --> 01:54:11,760
The ground shakes.

1055
01:54:12,178 --> 01:54:13,762
Drums...

1056
01:54:14,138 --> 01:54:17,516
...drums in the deep.

1057
01:54:21,062 --> 01:54:23,105
We cannot get out.

1058
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:28,944
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1059
01:54:30,613 --> 01:54:33,198
We cannot get out.

1060
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:38,120
They are coming. "

1061
01:55:21,164 --> 01:55:22,998
Fool of a Took!

1062
01:55:23,374 --> 01:55:27,169
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1063
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:54,780
Frodo!

1064
01:55:57,075 --> 01:55:58,533
Orcs.

1065
01:56:05,541 --> 01:56:07,542
Back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1066
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:16,593
They have a cave-troll.

1067
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:33,568
Let them come!

1068
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:37,614
There is one Dwarf in Moria
who still draws breath.

1069
01:58:28,101 --> 01:58:30,852
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1070
01:58:35,608 --> 01:58:37,359
Frodo!

1071
01:59:10,893 --> 01:59:12,769
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1072
01:59:13,771 --> 02:00:07,199
Frodo!

1073
02:01:02,922 --> 02:01:04,214
Oh, no.

1074
02:01:12,598 --> 02:01:14,516
He's alive.

1075
02:01:16,978 --> 02:01:19,938
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1076
02:01:20,147 --> 02:01:22,357
You should be dead.

1077
02:01:22,566 --> 02:01:25,068
That would have skewered a wild boar.

1078
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:30,031
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1079
02:01:35,913 --> 02:01:36,955
Mithril.

1080
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:42,377
You're full of surprises, Mr. Baggins.

1081
02:01:48,384 --> 02:01:50,302
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1082
02:02:05,276 --> 02:02:06,943
This way!

1083
02:03:17,306 --> 02:03:20,308
What is this new devilry?

1084
02:03:36,367 --> 02:03:39,160
A Balrog.

1085
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:42,622
A demon of the ancient world.

1086
02:03:44,834 --> 02:03:47,252
This foe is beyond any of you.

1087
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:50,004
Run!

1088
02:03:57,346 --> 02:03:58,847
Quickly!

1089
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:16,739
Gandalf.

1090
02:04:17,366 --> 02:04:18,950
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1091
02:04:20,369 --> 02:04:22,871
The bridge is near.

1092
02:04:24,915 --> 02:04:29,043
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1093
02:04:58,157 --> 02:04:59,908
Gandalf!

1094
02:05:18,177 --> 02:05:19,427
Merry! Pippin!

1095
02:05:30,523 --> 02:05:32,065
Sam!

1096
02:05:34,777 --> 02:05:38,029
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1097
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:42,492
Not the beard!

1098
02:05:55,714 --> 02:05:57,632
Steady.

1099
02:05:59,718 --> 02:06:01,219
Hold on!

1100
02:06:22,449 --> 02:06:23,658
Hang on!

1101
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:36,170
Lean forward!

1102
02:06:39,174 --> 02:06:40,216
Steady.

1103
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:42,677
Come on!

1104
02:06:42,886 --> 02:06:44,387
Now!

1105
02:07:01,572 --> 02:07:03,406
Over the bridge!

1106
02:07:03,616 --> 02:07:05,199
Fly!

1107
02:07:49,828 --> 02:07:51,913
You cannot pass!

1108
02:07:52,081 --> 02:07:53,665
Gandalf!

1109
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:02,799
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1110
02:08:03,801 --> 02:08:07,595
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1111
02:08:17,564 --> 02:08:19,524
Go back to the Shadow.

1112
02:08:27,366 --> 02:08:31,828
You shall not pass!

1113
02:08:58,981 --> 02:09:02,859
No! No!
- Gandalf!

1114
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:12,994
Fly, you fools!

1115
02:09:17,124 --> 02:09:19,292
No!

1116
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:27,592
Aragorn!

1117
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:27,693
Legolas, get them up.

1118
02:10:31,782 --> 02:10:33,658
Give them a moment!

1119
02:10:33,867 --> 02:10:37,495
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1120
02:10:37,704 --> 02:10:41,040
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1121
02:10:41,959 --> 02:10:45,253
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1122
02:10:46,755 --> 02:10:48,965
On your feet, Sam.

1123
02:10:49,299 --> 02:10:50,800
Frodo?

1124
02:10:52,845 --> 02:10:54,554
Frodo!

1125
02:11:47,065 --> 02:11:49,609
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1126
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:54,488
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1127
02:11:54,698 --> 02:11:57,241
An Elf-witch...

1128
02:11:57,784 --> 02:12:00,661
...of terrible power.

1129
02:12:01,204 --> 02:12:03,414
All who look upon her...

1130
02:12:03,624 --> 02:12:05,416
...fall under her spell.

1131
02:12:05,626 --> 02:12:06,918
Frodo!

1132
02:12:09,171 --> 02:12:11,213
And are never seen again.

1133
02:12:11,423 --> 02:12:15,927
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1134
02:12:16,136 --> 02:12:19,847
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

1135
02:12:20,057 --> 02:12:21,807
Mr. Frodo?

1136
02:12:27,105 --> 02:12:32,693
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1137
02:12:32,903 --> 02:12:37,448
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1138
02:12:45,123 --> 02:12:49,710
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1139
02:12:59,012 --> 02:13:03,224
Aragorn, these woods are perilous.
We should go back.

1140
02:13:03,433 --> 02:13:09,355
You have entered the realm of the
Lady of the Wood. You cannot go back.

1141
02:13:11,733 --> 02:13:15,236
Come. She is waiting.

1142
02:14:22,304 --> 02:14:26,724
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1143
02:14:26,975 --> 02:14:28,809
Where is Gandalf?

1144
02:14:28,977 --> 02:14:32,897
For I much desire to speak with him.

1145
02:14:34,524 --> 02:14:37,735
He has fallen into Shadow.

1146
02:14:42,574 --> 02:14:45,659
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1147
02:14:46,495 --> 02:14:49,497
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1148
02:14:49,831 --> 02:14:52,666
...to the ruin of all.

1149
02:15:06,431 --> 02:15:11,018
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1150
02:15:14,356 --> 02:15:19,026
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1151
02:15:19,569 --> 02:15:23,114
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1152
02:15:25,575 --> 02:15:27,535
Tonight, you will sleep...

1153
02:15:27,702 --> 02:15:31,080
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1154
02:15:32,374 --> 02:15:34,416
...one who has seen the Eye!

1155
02:15:49,182 --> 02:15:51,600
A lament for Gandalf.

1156
02:15:53,562 --> 02:15:55,896
What do they say about him?

1157
02:15:56,064 --> 02:16:01,235
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.

1158
02:16:03,905 --> 02:16:06,198
Take some rest.

1159
02:16:06,658 --> 02:16:09,326
These borders are well-protected.

1160
02:16:09,536 --> 02:16:12,079
I will find no rest here.

1161
02:16:14,916 --> 02:16:17,918
I heard her voice inside my head.

1162
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:21,881
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1163
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:27,553
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left. "

1164
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:31,765
But I cannot see it.

1165
02:16:33,101 --> 02:16:35,603
It is long since we had any hope.

1166
02:16:45,822 --> 02:16:47,948
My father is a noble man.

1167
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:50,910
But his rule is failing...

1168
02:16:54,039 --> 02:16:56,665
...and our people lose faith.

1169
02:16:58,293 --> 02:17:01,629
He looks to me to make things right,
and I'd do it.

1170
02:17:01,796 --> 02:17:05,341
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1171
02:17:08,428 --> 02:17:11,180
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1172
02:17:11,806 --> 02:17:14,016
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1173
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:17,853
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1174
02:17:18,521 --> 02:17:22,024
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1175
02:17:24,903 --> 02:17:27,154
Have you ever been called home...

1176
02:17:27,322 --> 02:17:30,991
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1177
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:34,870
I have seen the White City...

1178
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,705
...long ago.

1179
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:42,628
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1180
02:17:43,588 --> 02:17:46,507
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1181
02:17:46,967 --> 02:17:50,302
"The Lords of Gondor have returned. "

1182
02:18:57,495 --> 02:19:00,080
Will you look into the mirror?

1183
02:19:00,248 --> 02:19:01,790
What will I see?

1184
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:07,087
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1185
02:19:08,006 --> 02:19:09,840
For the mirror...

1186
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:12,593
...shows many things.

1187
02:19:15,597 --> 02:19:17,973
Things that were...

1188
02:19:18,183 --> 02:19:20,768
...things that are...

1189
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:23,479
...and some things...

1190
02:19:27,067 --> 02:19:30,402
...that have not yet come to pass.

1191
02:20:52,944 --> 02:20:55,779
I know what it is you saw.

1192
02:20:58,199 --> 02:21:00,701
For it is also in my mind.

1193
02:21:02,495 --> 02:21:06,540
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1194
02:21:08,918 --> 02:21:13,797
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1195
02:21:14,424 --> 02:21:17,718
He will try to take the Ring.

1196
02:21:17,927 --> 02:21:19,928
You know of whom I speak.

1197
02:21:20,930 --> 02:21:25,601
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1198
02:21:27,103 --> 02:21:29,563
If you ask it of me...

1199
02:21:29,939 --> 02:21:33,025
...I will give you the One Ring.

1200
02:21:34,068 --> 02:21:36,236
You offer it to me freely.

1201
02:21:40,825 --> 02:21:44,745
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1202
02:21:51,127 --> 02:21:54,421
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1203
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:58,675
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1204
02:21:59,302 --> 02:22:02,346
Treacherous as the sea!

1205
02:22:02,847 --> 02:22:07,768
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1206
02:22:08,228 --> 02:22:10,604
All shall love me...

1207
02:22:10,813 --> 02:22:13,649
...and despair.

1208
02:22:27,747 --> 02:22:32,084
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1209
02:22:32,335 --> 02:22:34,795
...and go into the West...

1210
02:22:35,004 --> 02:22:39,466
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1211
02:22:43,096 --> 02:22:47,224
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1212
02:22:48,142 --> 02:22:49,643
...is to be alone.

1213
02:22:50,270 --> 02:22:53,689
This task was appointed to you.

1214
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:57,401
And if you do not find a way...

1215
02:22:58,278 --> 02:23:00,279
...no one will.

1216
02:23:00,655 --> 02:23:03,824
Then I know what I must do.

1217
02:23:04,492 --> 02:23:05,576
It's just...

1218
02:23:08,830 --> 02:23:11,081
...I'm afraid to do it.

1219
02:23:14,544 --> 02:23:19,673
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1220
02:23:25,013 --> 02:23:30,767
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1221
02:23:31,519 --> 02:23:34,855
They were Elves once.

1222
02:23:36,065 --> 02:23:39,401
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1223
02:23:39,611 --> 02:23:42,779
...tortured and mutilated.

1224
02:23:43,114 --> 02:23:48,410
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1225
02:23:48,703 --> 02:23:50,537
And now...

1226
02:23:51,998 --> 02:23:53,874
...perfected.

1227
02:23:54,584 --> 02:23:57,753
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1228
02:23:59,714 --> 02:24:02,049
...whom do you serve?

1229
02:24:02,216 --> 02:24:04,718
Saruman!

1230
02:24:25,573 --> 02:24:28,992
Hunt them down.
Do not stop until they are found.

1231
02:24:29,202 --> 02:24:32,120
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1232
02:24:32,330 --> 02:24:35,290
You will taste Man-flesh!

1233
02:24:40,338 --> 02:24:45,926
One of the halflings has something of
great value. Bring them to me alive...

1234
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:48,428
...and unspoiled.

1235
02:24:50,223 --> 02:24:51,515
Kill the others.

1236
02:25:19,419 --> 02:25:22,629
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1237
02:25:22,797 --> 02:25:26,216
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1238
02:25:26,968 --> 02:25:29,302
...our most beloved star.

1239
02:25:41,023 --> 02:25:45,444
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1240
02:25:45,653 --> 02:25:49,781
...when all other lights go out.

1241
02:27:28,756 --> 02:27:30,090
Frodo.

1242
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:33,468
The Argonath.

1243
02:27:36,931 --> 02:27:40,642
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1244
02:27:41,394 --> 02:27:43,311
My kin.

1245
02:29:02,308 --> 02:29:04,517
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1246
02:29:04,727 --> 02:29:07,312
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1247
02:29:07,521 --> 02:29:10,982
- We approach Mordor from the North.
Oh, yes?

1248
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:15,195
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1249
02:29:15,363 --> 02:29:18,615
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1250
02:29:18,824 --> 02:29:21,910
And after that, it gets even better.

1251
02:29:22,328 --> 02:29:27,248
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1252
02:29:27,458 --> 02:29:28,875
That is our road.

1253
02:29:30,378 --> 02:29:33,588
Take some rest
and recover your strength.

1254
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:35,548
Recover my...

1255
02:29:38,552 --> 02:29:40,512
- We should leave now.
- No.

1256
02:29:40,721 --> 02:29:45,141
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1257
02:29:45,351 --> 02:29:48,812
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1258
02:29:49,021 --> 02:29:53,024
A shadow and a threat has been growing
in my mind.

1259
02:29:53,526 --> 02:29:57,737
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1260
02:29:59,699 --> 02:30:04,661
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1261
02:30:05,162 --> 02:30:06,871
Where's Frodo?

1262
02:30:32,523 --> 02:30:34,441
We shouldn't wander alone.

1263
02:30:35,818 --> 02:30:37,944
You, least of all.

1264
02:30:38,154 --> 02:30:40,613
So much depends on you.

1265
02:30:41,657 --> 02:30:43,616
Frodo?

1266
02:30:50,708 --> 02:30:53,293
I know why you seek solitude.

1267
02:30:54,003 --> 02:30:57,422
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1268
02:30:58,215 --> 02:31:01,301
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1269
02:31:02,845 --> 02:31:05,513
There are other ways, Frodo.

1270
02:31:05,723 --> 02:31:09,559
- Other paths we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1271
02:31:09,769 --> 02:31:13,563
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1272
02:31:13,773 --> 02:31:16,858
Warning? Against what?

1273
02:31:17,068 --> 02:31:19,194
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1274
02:31:19,403 --> 02:31:23,031
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy our hope...

1275
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:27,035
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1276
02:31:28,788 --> 02:31:32,165
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1277
02:31:33,709 --> 02:31:35,752
- Lend me the Ring.
- No.

1278
02:31:37,004 --> 02:31:40,673
- Why do you recoil? I'm no thief.
- You're not yourself.

1279
02:31:42,468 --> 02:31:45,804
What chance do you think you have?

1280
02:31:46,013 --> 02:31:50,683
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1281
02:31:50,893 --> 02:31:54,604
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1282
02:31:56,732 --> 02:31:58,817
You fool!

1283
02:31:59,026 --> 02:32:03,029
It is not yours, save by chance!
It could have been mine.

1284
02:32:03,197 --> 02:32:06,032
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1285
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:07,492
- Give it to me!
- No!

1286
02:32:07,701 --> 02:32:09,536
- Give it!
- No.

1287
02:32:17,169 --> 02:32:19,212
I see your mind.

1288
02:32:19,421 --> 02:32:22,382
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1289
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:24,467
You will betray us!

1290
02:32:24,677 --> 02:32:27,887
You'll go to your death,
the death of us all!

1291
02:32:28,305 --> 02:32:31,975
Curse you!
Curse you and all halflings!

1292
02:32:39,024 --> 02:32:40,567
Frodo?

1293
02:32:44,864 --> 02:32:46,447
Frodo.

1294
02:32:50,369 --> 02:32:52,412
What have I done?

1295
02:32:52,621 --> 02:32:54,330
Please, Frodo.

1296
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:57,208
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1297
02:32:57,459 --> 02:32:59,335
Frodo!

1298
02:33:45,799 --> 02:33:47,217
Frodo?

1299
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:51,554
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1300
02:33:51,764 --> 02:33:53,556
Stay away!

1301
02:33:53,974 --> 02:33:55,558
Frodo!

1302
02:33:57,811 --> 02:34:01,648
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1303
02:34:11,325 --> 02:34:13,826
Would you destroy it?

1304
02:34:18,791 --> 02:34:20,750
Aragorn.

1305
02:34:24,171 --> 02:34:26,506
Aragorn.

1306
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:30,176
Elessar.

1307
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:41,187
I would have gone with you to the end.

1308
02:34:41,855 --> 02:34:44,691
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1309
02:34:48,028 --> 02:34:49,195
I know.

1310
02:34:51,657 --> 02:34:57,120
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1311
02:35:00,874 --> 02:35:02,583
Go, Frodo!

1312
02:35:05,587 --> 02:35:07,088
Run.

1313
02:35:07,339 --> 02:35:09,007
Run!

1314
02:35:33,574 --> 02:35:35,241
Mr. Frodo!

1315
02:35:44,501 --> 02:35:50,465
Find the halfling!

1316
02:35:53,927 --> 02:35:55,595
Elendil!

1317
02:36:02,102 --> 02:36:03,644
Aragorn, go!

1318
02:36:25,376 --> 02:36:26,667
Frodo!

1319
02:36:27,252 --> 02:36:28,878
Hide here. Quick!

1320
02:36:29,505 --> 02:36:30,963
Come on!

1321
02:36:33,425 --> 02:36:35,468
What's he doing?

1322
02:36:39,681 --> 02:36:41,682
He's leaving.

1323
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:49,399
- No!
- Pippin!

1324
02:36:54,321 --> 02:36:56,656
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1325
02:36:57,199 --> 02:37:00,326
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1326
02:37:00,702 --> 02:37:02,328
- Over here!
- This way!

1327
02:37:13,173 --> 02:37:15,508
- It's working!
- I know! Run!

1328
02:38:04,892 --> 02:38:07,977
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1329
02:38:32,794 --> 02:38:33,920
Run!

1330
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:54,745
No.

1331
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:01,544
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1332
02:42:01,795 --> 02:42:03,838
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1333
02:42:05,716 --> 02:42:07,174
I let Frodo go.

1334
02:42:07,843 --> 02:42:10,469
Then you did what I could not.

1335
02:42:11,471 --> 02:42:14,765
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1336
02:42:15,308 --> 02:42:19,562
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1337
02:42:19,771 --> 02:42:22,064
I did not see it.

1338
02:42:22,274 --> 02:42:25,484
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1339
02:42:26,236 --> 02:42:28,446
You fought bravely.

1340
02:42:28,989 --> 02:42:31,407
You have kept your honor.

1341
02:42:32,033 --> 02:42:33,909
Leave it.

1342
02:42:34,369 --> 02:42:36,328
It is over.

1343
02:42:37,539 --> 02:42:42,752
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1344
02:42:43,211 --> 02:42:46,213
...and my city to ruin.

1345
02:42:50,469 --> 02:42:53,345
I don't know what strength
is in my blood...

1346
02:42:53,513 --> 02:42:57,183
...but I swear to you,
I won't let the White City fall...

1347
02:42:58,185 --> 02:43:00,686
...nor our people fail.

1348
02:43:01,646 --> 02:43:08,944
Our people.

1349
02:43:30,717 --> 02:43:33,719
I would have followed you, my brother.

1350
02:43:35,263 --> 02:43:37,264
My captain.

1351
02:43:39,893 --> 02:43:41,811
My king.

1352
02:44:01,456 --> 02:44:03,707
Be at peace...

1353
02:44:04,084 --> 02:44:06,085
...son of Gondor.

1354
02:44:45,208 --> 02:44:46,959
Frodo!

1355
02:45:06,521 --> 02:45:09,815
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1356
02:45:11,067 --> 02:45:14,069
I wish none of this had happened.

1357
02:45:17,032 --> 02:45:19,825
So do all who live
to see such times...

1358
02:45:19,993 --> 02:45:23,495
...but that is not for them to decide.

1359
02:45:23,663 --> 02:45:26,290
All you have to decide...

1360
02:45:26,499 --> 02:45:31,253
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1361
02:46:00,075 --> 02:46:02,159
Frodo, no!

1362
02:46:02,619 --> 02:46:03,911
Frodo!

1363
02:46:04,704 --> 02:46:07,373
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1364
02:46:10,919 --> 02:46:12,878
Go back, Sam!

1365
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:16,966
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1366
02:46:17,175 --> 02:46:20,010
And I'm coming with you!

1367
02:46:20,470 --> 02:46:22,888
You can't swim!

1368
02:46:26,685 --> 02:46:35,317
Sam!

1369
02:47:16,234 --> 02:47:18,944
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1370
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:23,615
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee. "

1371
02:47:24,743 --> 02:47:27,369
And I don't mean to.

1372
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:29,788
I don't mean to.

1373
02:47:31,458 --> 02:47:33,292
Sam.

1374
02:47:48,183 --> 02:47:49,850
Come on.

1375
02:48:18,546 --> 02:48:22,841
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1376
02:48:37,941 --> 02:48:42,736
- You mean not to follow them.
- His fate is no longer in our hands.

1377
02:48:46,157 --> 02:48:51,036
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1378
02:49:02,882 --> 02:49:06,051
Not if we hold true to each other.

1379
02:49:07,595 --> 02:49:11,890
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1380
02:49:12,892 --> 02:49:18,147
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1381
02:49:19,649 --> 02:49:21,650
We travel light.

1382
02:49:21,860 --> 02:49:23,569
Let us hunt some Orc.

1383
02:49:26,781 --> 02:49:28,574
Yes!

1384
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:49,011
Mordor.

1385
02:49:49,637 --> 02:49:53,015
I hope the others find a safer road.

1386
02:49:53,933 --> 02:49:56,518
Strider will look after them.

1387
02:49:57,437 --> 02:50:00,814
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1388
02:50:01,149 --> 02:50:03,567
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1389
02:50:03,776 --> 02:50:05,360
We may.

1390
02:50:07,405 --> 02:50:08,488
Sam...

1391
02:50:12,076 --> 02:50:14,703
...I'm glad you're with me.
