RACHEL: The Second Amendment isn't
just obsolete. It's dangerous.

3
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,762
ANDY: I totally get
why you think that.

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,005
I'm sorry, I've just never known
someone who's into guns before.

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,684
I'm not into guns, Rachel.

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,330
I have a couple.

7
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,685
More than the one.

8
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,683
That doesn't mean
that I'm a fanatic.

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,656
Okay, it doesn't mean that
I'm not for restrictions

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,126
and waiting periods
and background checks.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,806
(CLEARS THROAT) So what
does it mean, Andy?

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,446
I just wanna be
able to protect myself.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,204
From what, exactly?

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,970
You googled me.

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,451
Yeah, isn't just.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,406

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,568
You have a very dark past.

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,721
Yeah.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,889
So why didn't you tell me?

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,530
Because I like you.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,327
I didn't wanna scare you away.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,571
I was six.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,805

That I'm aware of.

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,171
And they never caught him?

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,083
Put it this way,
justice was done.

I think you're a nice guy, but, uh,
this isn't just too much for me.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,171
I should go.

What about Rachel?

49
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,362
Didn't she wanna play?

50
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,682
Now we'll never know
if she's a natural redhead.

From the waist down,
she's a pincushion.

<i>the glint off his blade,
the screams of his victims.</i>

Whose victims, Nica?

75
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,723
The murders were real.

76
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,770
You know that.

77
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,324
But Chucky never was.

78
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,481
That's right.

79
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,770
He was a fantasy.

80
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,286
A delusion.

81
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,160
He was a mask I wore so I could
go on looking in the mirror,

82
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,167
so I could live with myself.

83
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,323
And now, when you look in the
mirror, what do you see?

84
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,925
I don't look.

85

DR. FOLEY: You'll have to, if you're

<i>Nica, you've made
tremendous progress.</i>

87
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,289
In the past four years,
you've had to accept

88
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,210
some hard truths about yourself.

89
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,009
That is very brave.

I'm having you transferred

<i>That's medium security, Nica.</i>

93
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,085
That means more privacy, more
independence, more freedom,

94
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400
within reason, of course...

95
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,648
Dr. Foley, what I did
was unforgivable.

96
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,807
Schizophrenia is an illness.

97
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,804
By definition,
and according to the law,

98
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,803
you weren't responsible
for your actions.

99
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,280
Do you think Alice
would accept that

100
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
as an apology for
making her an orphan?

101
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,084
Are there no cameras?

102
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,328
Not in medium security.

103
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,161
But don't abuse the privilege.

104
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,810
Bathroom's back there.

105

need help, ask for Ashley or Pam.

Well, I've never been dead before,

Oh, you're that girl who...

168
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,766
Yeah.

169
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,050
You still have
a thing for redheads?

170
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,441

'Cause the...
This, you... No.

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,089
Oh. Sorry.
That's too soon.

173
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,288
I'll trade you for a cigarette.

174
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,801
Okay.

175
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,966
Oh.

176
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,441
Juicy Fruit.

177
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,601
Mmm.

178
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,646
Huh.

CLAIRE: So Why'd you do it?
Claire.

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
We're all wondering the
same thing here, right?

184
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,130
Give her a break, okay?
She's new.

185
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,201
Fuck that!

186
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,800
If I'm gonna be
living down the hallway

187
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,416
from someone who butchered
her whole family,

188
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,856
I have a right to
know what set her off.

189
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,136
Well, Why'd you
burn your house down?

190
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,321
You always bring that up.

191
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,336
I'm just saying, if we're
pointing fingers here, then...

192
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,725
I didn't kill anyone.

193
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,881
Neither did Nica.

194
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,321
Chucky did it.

(SCOFFS)

196
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,721
I don't blame you for being
afraid after what I did.

197
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,090
I was very ill.

198
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,246
Are you feeling better now?

199
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,325
I understand your concerns, and,
absolutely, we should talk about it,

200
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,449
but, believe me, Nica isn't
a danger to anyone anymore.

201
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,176
And let's not forget,
she isn't the only one

202
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,770
here to benefit
from an insanity plea.

203
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,645
She's the only multiple
murderer, though.

204
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,610
Mass murderer, actually.

205
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,250
There's a difference.

206
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,561
Who cares?
We're all sick.

207
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,887
I wanna know why
she killed them.

208
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,041
I was pathologically
jealous of my sister,

209
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,169
and I was always too possessive
of Alice, who is my niece.

210
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,485
She's 12 now, and I'll
never see her again.

211
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,402
I only hope she's doing okay.

212
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,561
ANGELA: She's not okay.

213
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,686
Excuse me?

214
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,924
Chucky told me.

215
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,965
Angela.

216
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,769
He called me.

217
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,171
On the phone.

218
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,606
He said to tell you
he's coming for you...

219
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,928
Now that you can have visitors.

220
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,121

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,290
You think this is funny?

223
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,726
No.

224
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,286
I don't.

225
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,929
It's okay, Angie.

226
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,045
It's okay.

227
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,406
Okay, it was inevitable
that this would come up.

228
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,484
And it's important that we all
explore it together as a group.

229
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,405
I think I have
something that will help.

No, he said, "Chucky"!

235
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,411
They had 50 different names. Two
percent of them were "Chucky."

236
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,656
You're saying
it's a coincidence?

Not at all.
I paid for a Chucky.

Hot Topic.

Nica, this doesn't make you
uncomfortable, does it?

241
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,170
No, not at all.

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,130
He's my baby.

Madeleine, stop it!

Your baby is dead.
You know that.

253

What is your problem? Why can't
you just let her be happy?

254
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,136
You think that's
the way to make her happy?

255
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,360
Letting her play house with
some psycho killer's trophy?

Give him back.
"Him"?

That's an interesting
choice of pronoun.

259

trouble separating reality

No.

262

Unfortunately, these days,
reality is painfully clear.

263
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,011
Now give him back.

264

What are you gonna do, Nica?

265
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,160
You gonna stab me?
Cut my throat?

266

NICA: Don't be ridiculous.

We don't even have

The only thing I
could get my hands on

are the barbiturates they

Sure.
Are you okay, Chucky?

I'm Mark, by the way.

277
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,400
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,121
What?

279
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,721
From Michael.

He's in the pool right now,
getting ready for Tokyo in 2020,

It's actually
one of my triggers.

His real name is Malcolm.

That's right.

I'm sorry,
but you seem really familiar.

Did anyone ever tell you, you
look exactly like Jennifer Tilly?

Yeah, I get that a lot.

Somebody taller.

Well, I couldn't really argue
with evidence like that.

(VOICE BREAKS) I just wanna
be someone who matters.

990
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,451
But I'm not Mark.
I'm not Michael. I'm...

991
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,849
I'm just Malcolm.

992
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,331
Fucking Multiple Malcolm.

993
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,922
Sounds like it's getting
pretty crowded in there.

You sent me?

1017
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,410
Thanks for coming after me.
You saved me the trouble.

1018
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,601
FUCK you!

(EXHALES)

1020
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,764
You kill me, you kill her.

1021
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,211
Think about it.
(GUN CLICKS)

1022
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,801
Yeah, thinking is for losers.

Good to see you

It was kind of nice, having
Alice around, you know?
