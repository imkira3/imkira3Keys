2
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:04,707
Dad, what's happening?

3
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:09,700
Nick, listen to me, like we're the last
2 people on the planet. Okay? Nick,

4
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,959
Some day a girl is gonna
give you a flower.

5
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,295
You got that? A flower.

6
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:17,890
And you have to help her.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,934
You help her and you help us all.

8
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:22,028
Okay?

9
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,735
I know it doesn't make
any sense right now,

10
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:27,968
but I believe the woman
who told me that.

11
00:01:28,677 --> 00:01:30,406
You think you could believe me?

12
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:33,973
I love you.

13
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:40,645
I always said you were special, Nick.

14
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:42,246
Turns out I was right.

15
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,164
Division's here.
Just keep moving.

16
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:56,966
And don't make any decisions
that any watcher can track.

17
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,984
I just wanted to have a conversation.

18
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:06,796
What a waste.

19
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:10,070
Bring his body to the lab.

20
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,410
There are special people in this world.

21
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,951
We don't ask to be special.

22
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,218
We're just born this way.

23
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:30,129
We pass you on the streets every day,

24
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,896
unnoticed by most.

25
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:44,468
It started in 1945.

26
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:48,411
The Nazis were conducting
experiments in psychic warfare...

27
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,677
trying to turn those
with psychic abilities into soldiers.

28
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:56,246
Lots of us died.

29
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:57,585
The war ended,

30
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,860
but the experiments never stopped.

31
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,189
Other governments around the world

32
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,594
set up what they called "Divisions"...

33
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:10,133
trying to do what the Nazis couldn't,

34
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:11,829
to turn us into weapons.

35
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,170
Division's agents are trained to track
and hunt us down like animals...

36
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:18,609
take us away from our families
and friends.

37
00:04:19,546 --> 00:04:22,243
There are children stuffed away
all over the world.

38
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,883
They test us and categorize us.

39
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,016
I'm what they call a "watcher".

40
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:28,417
We can see the future,

41
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:30,616
even if that's not always
as simple as it sounds.

42
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:34,559
The jumbo jet crashed.
There are no reports of survivors.

43
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:36,118
Others are called "movers",

44
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:38,624
just an easy way
of saying "telekinetic".

45
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:45,771
"Pushers" put thoughts in your head

46
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:48,204
and make whatever lie
they come up with the truth.

47
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,799
They'd already begun
to control my mind...

48
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,415
"Sniffs", "shifters", "shadows",

49
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,953
"bleeders", it goes on and on.

50
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,589
In Division's eyes,
we're all just lab rats.

51
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,195
Only one problem: we keep dying.

52
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:13,357
The evidence shows that the kids
were given milk with radioactive iodine.

53
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:16,698
No one has ever survived
the drug meant to boost our powers.

54
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:18,570
My name is Cassie Holmes.

55
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:20,798
Division took my mom from me.

56
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:23,838
Right now the future
I see doesn't look so great.

57
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,902
The good news is the future
is always changing...

58
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:30,944
in the largest of ways
by the smallest of things.

59
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:33,683
They've been winning a lot of battles.

60
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,555
Now it's our turn to win the war.

61
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,789
" PRESENT DAY "

62
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:45,189
" DIVISION LAB "

63
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:16,915
She survived the injection.

64
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:21,585
She's our patient zero.
Bring me every sniffer we have.

65
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:23,787
But she's on foot.
She can't get far.

66
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:28,323
She'll get help from anyone
she can lay her eyes on.

67
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:35,363
Do whatever is necessary to get her
and that syringe back! Now!!

68
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:42,565
" 2 DAYS FROM NOW "

69
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

70
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,100
You-- You are lucky.

71
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,199
Dude!

72
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:24,100
You still want to play?
You've lost 5 grand now...

73
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,601
Chan said you still haven't
paid him off your debt, huh?

74
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,050
He lied...

75
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,695
He lied? Are you suggesting I'm lying?

76
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,432
- You already got 15 grand of debts, do the math.
- You want to bet or not?

77
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:38,404
How arrogant-- Okay!

78
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:40,401
If he loses again,
we gonna fix him up with punches.

79
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:41,302
<i>Hurry up!</i>

80
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:43,700
If you lose, we gonna have to
beat you up this time.

81
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:45,201
Watch your step.

82
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:22,564
You still owe me 5 grand!

83
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:00,105
What do you say, Nick?

84
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:02,640
Who are you?

85
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,680
- We're with Division.
- Like you didn't know.

86
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,050
- Go to hell.
- Easy, son.

87
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,017
If we wanted you,
you'd be in the back of a van.

88
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,383
You gonna let us in
or are we gonna have to be rude?

89
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,286
Smart move living
in a shithole like this.

90
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,724
One on top of the other.
Took you far off the radar.

91
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:22,025
Not far enough.

92
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,193
Would you believe
this is how we found you?

93
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,239
From your old toothbrush
from that encounter 10 years ago.

94
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,670
Barely a scent left.

95
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,878
Thought you were in Tokyo.

96
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,878
Then Malaysia.

97
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:54,324
Finally we got a few readings
on some buildings.

98
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:07,569
There's a lot of runaway psychics
in Hong Kong trying to disappear. Nick.

99
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:11,045
People with no country, no loyalty...

100
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:14,014
No desire to get involved
in political bullshit.

101
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,529
Nobody but you in this apartment
for a long time, Nick.

102
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:34,363
Why? You looking
for someone besides me?

103
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:37,872
A girl. She has something
belonging to us.

104
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,197
Better than a hunch you know her.

105
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,602
Obviously I don't.

106
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:51,284
In case we need to get hold
of you again.

107
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:54,048
I've got some old toilet paper
you boys might like more.

108
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,250
Don't bother running.

109
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,116
We know where you are now.

110
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,737
Shit.

111
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,594
- Yeah?
- Hey, Nick.

112
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,660
- Who is this?
- Open up, Nick.

113
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,996
And put your gun down.

114
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:57,540
Put that thing away.
Got you something.

115
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,788
Where's the chicken? There it is.

116
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:07,019
Hey, whoa! Excuse me?

117
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,394
Is this how you treat your guests?

118
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:13,456
This is how I treat random strangers
who barge into my apartment.

119
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,762
Like the Division sniffers
who were just here?

120
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:17,759
Who are you?

121
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:20,206
I'm Cassie.

122
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,773
I'm here to help you.

123
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:26,410
Listen, Cassie...

124
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,415
I'm sure your mom and dad are nervous
about you right now, so why don't you...

125
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,084
- You don't understand.
- You've got that right.

126
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,386
This is about us finding
6 million dollars.

127
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:39,519
That's us.

128
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:42,727
And that's our money.

129
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,791
And that's my toothbrush.

130
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:48,562
You're a watcher.

131
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:52,601
So is there a place we can
get something to eat besides chicken?

132
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,202
I'm buying.

133
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,915
Lose a bet with your hairdresser?

134
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,889
I like color.

135
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:01,368
First things first. I know you're
a second-generation mover.

136
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:02,999
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

137
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:04,407
I'll let you know when I see one.

138
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:06,011
You don't really use your powers,

139
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,842
which means you haven't practiced
and you kind of suck at it.

140
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:09,404
- How am I doing so far?
- Go on.

141
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:10,608
I'm a watcher.

142
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,075
Second generation, like you.

143
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:15,051
- Wow. That's.
- Complicated.

144
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,379
Because the future can change
just by talking about it.

145
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,117
So I see glimpses
and I draw in my book.

146
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,715
But I'm not really good at it.

147
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,488
I'm kind of a crappy artist, but...

148
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,552
I'm sure you already knew that.

149
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,461
But I got the sniffs
in your apartment, right?

150
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,326
That's why I brought you
a new toothbrush.

151
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,250
- Chief. I want to eat shrimps.
- Okay.

152
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:35,834
You speak Chinese?

153
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:38,804
Cantonese.
I'm surprised you didn't know that,

154
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:39,836
being a watcher.

155
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,608
I get things wrong sometimes.

156
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:42,905
I know the feeling.

157
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,785
Are you worried about
the thugs you owe money to?

158
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,449
Don't. Thank you.

159
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,386
We'll be able to take care
of it in a couple days.

160
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,983
With your 6 million dollars.

161
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,997
- Where's the money?
- It's on its way here.

162
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:01,124
With a girl.

163
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:03,456
Don't tell me.

164
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,593
Same girl Division sniffs are looking for.

165
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,641
It's Cassie, right?

166
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:12,842
Enjoy your food.

167
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,144
- That's it?
- That's it.

168
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:17,874
Sorry. Some 12-year old that knew
I needed a new toothbrush...

169
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:19,712
isn't enough to get me
involved with Division.

170
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:21,116
Even if it's not a con.

171
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:26,388
I'm 13. And I've been
told I look at least 14.

172
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,517
- Right.
- And this is not a con.

173
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,095
This is a way for everyone
to get something they want.

174
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:32,754
I've actually used that line before.

175
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,523
Fine. Don't believe me.

176
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,802
- But you will help me.
- Really?

177
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:40,496
Because I'm getting a message.

178
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:43,301
It's telling me "find somebody else".

179
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,239
If we don't find the case and that girl,

180
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:49,142
really bad things happen, Nick.

181
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:53,547
What? What's wrong?

182
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:01,353
Shit. They're here in the market.

183
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:02,551
Who?

184
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,590
- Who?
- They're in the market! Come on!

185
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:06,994
- Division?
- Bleeders!

186
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:08,224
We've got to get out of here!

187
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:24,042
- How does this end?
- I have no idea.

188
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:25,479
Where is the girl?

189
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:28,176
My daughter has already
seen you with her.

190
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:29,684
Told you.

191
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:33,550
I've told 3 people already today,
I don't know this girl.

192
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:38,452
Stupid child.
I already saw how you die.

193
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:41,191
Then you know it's not here
and it's not today.

194
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,565
Damn.

195
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,209
Go, go!

196
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:07,320
Go, go!

197
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:14,587
Go, go!

198
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,596
Nick!

199
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:32,072
The big tanks... Go!

200
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:33,874
- Quick!
- This way!

201
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:00,473
Stop!

202
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,011
- Stop!
- Run, Cassie!

203
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,543
Stop!

204
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:25,408
Not like this.
lf we kill him we lose the girl.

205
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:32,714
I already know you're here.

206
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:42,991
You must be Cassie Holmes.

207
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:46,199
- Who sent you?
- Your mother.

208
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,804
A week before she was captured
by Division,

209
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,268
she told me to be
at that fish market today.

210
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,475
Stay away from him.

211
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,409
If that's what you want.

212
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,311
Just be sure to add his picture
to the Wall of the Dead.

213
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:03,841
You're a stitch.

214
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:05,975
That should be obvious to a watcher.

215
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:09,312
If you had even a modicum
of your mother's talent...

216
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:10,720
I've been dealing with a lot.

217
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,658
Years ago your mother did me a favor.

218
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,854
Now it would seem
I need to pay off my debt.

219
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,144
I hear they've got your mother
buried deep inside Division.

220
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:45,584
Have her so drugged up
she can't even hold a spoon.

221
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:49,819
I bet they suck
the future right out of her.

222
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:26,893
You help her and you help us all.

223
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:29,427
A flower

224
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,584
Is he okay?

225
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:26,721
- You okay?
- Yeah.

226
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,389
Wow.

227
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:34,829
That woman's got magic fingers.

228
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:45,840
For you.

229
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:47,910
What is that?

230
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:50,337
It's a lotus.

231
00:27:11,436 --> 00:27:13,199
I heard what she said about
your mother.

232
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:16,304
You did?

233
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:21,836
Division's got her.

234
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:25,911
They locked her up because she's the...
greatest watcher they've ever seen.

235
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:28,509
They're afraid of her.

236
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:30,719
And they're afraid
they can't control her.

237
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:34,416
They killed my father
for the same reason.

238
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:38,752
But I guess you already knew that.

239
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,995
I see the future, not the past.

240
00:27:44,802 --> 00:27:48,067
And right now our future
isn't that great.

241
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:51,436
That's new?

242
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,774
Now the sniffs from your apartment

243
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:55,572
are going to get the girl and the case.

244
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:58,546
It's changed.

245
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,477
I don't know why...

246
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:04,477
something I did, a mistake I made...

247
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,953
Doesn't matter, it just has.

248
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:14,394
My mother told me that case...

249
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:17,831
is the key to bringing down Division
and freeing her.

250
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:22,936
There's no money in that case,
is there?

251
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:29,237
Unless I'm missing something,

252
00:28:30,347 --> 00:28:31,780
they don't have the case yet.

253
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,011
It's still out there.

254
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:40,213
If your mother's such
a great fortune-teller,

255
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:41,790
how did she get caught?

256
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:44,420
I'm just going to have
to ask her that myself.

257
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:47,629
I haven't even gotten
to the bad part yet.

258
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:52,729
What is that?

259
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:55,102
We die.

260
00:28:56,874 --> 00:28:58,431
Great.

261
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:25,501
Hello, Kira.

262
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,737
You have a plane to catch.

263
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:33,873
Come on.
You want to come with us.

264
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:50,550
Christ. Get a load of that.

265
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,188
She must use that 10 times a day.
That's a keeper.

266
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:58,157
You're not gonna have a lot of lipstick
opportunities where you're going.

267
00:29:58,234 --> 00:29:59,496
You know what I mean?

268
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,467
She's doing it again.

269
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,135
- Get the hell out of my head!
- No! No!

270
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:10,374
- What does she want?
- She's got to go to the bathroom.

271
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,271
To throw up or something.

272
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,577
Carver will kill us
if anything happens to her.

273
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:30,592
- Bathroom?
- This way.

274
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:33,793
Come on.

275
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,966
Coffee, black, with sugar.

276
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,021
Alright. In you go.

277
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:11,702
You're a good man, Agent Mack.

278
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,334
I bet you come from a good family.

279
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,510
It must have been hard
for you when he died.

280
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:21,542
Who died?

281
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:23,949
Your brother.

282
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,919
- I don't have a brother, sweetheart.
- No, you do.

283
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,621
I've got something
that will make you feel better.

284
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:32,757
And you loved him very much.

285
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:38,195
But he was murdered.

286
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,733
And you know who did it, don't you?

287
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:53,945
But he was murdered...

288
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,880
And you know who did it, don't you?

289
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:04,315
You know who did it, don't you?
But he was murdered...

290
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,673
You know who did it
he was murdered...

291
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,599
Lame.

292
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:30,833
We've got to work on your skills
if we're going to change anything.

293
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,394
Don't bite your nails.

294
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,566
The lollipop chick freaks me out.

295
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:41,471
- She's a watcher.
- Like you.

296
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:43,508
Yeah.

297
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:47,145
I know this place. This is...

298
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:51,783
I know this place.
Club B, boss. Science Museum Road.

299
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,787
Thank you.

300
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,053
Why is that olive out of the glass?

301
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:01,394
- That's not an olive. It's a bead.
- It's a bead?

302
00:35:02,035 --> 00:35:05,266
Yeah, it's a bead.
A shimmery kind of thing...

303
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,839
Well, it looks like a pimento.
If I was going to draw a bead, I'd...

304
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,875
It's a bead with a shimmer.

305
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:12,101
What does the bead have to do with it?

306
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:14,771
I don't know what the shiny,
shimmery bead has to do with it.

307
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:16,474
Great.

308
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,681
Let's keep it simple.

309
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,009
We'll start with the bead
and see where it takes us.

310
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:24,523
Sounds like a plan, but...
what about the part where we die?

311
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:41,365
I remember growing up together.

312
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,571
Where we went to school.

313
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,806
How he died.

314
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,570
So except for this brother
you never had...

315
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,041
is there anything else she might have
put in your head?

316
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,612
I'm only asking because I don't
want to be shot in the face...

317
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:58,246
for screwing some made up sister
you don't really have.

318
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:00,990
I don't have a sister?

319
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,797
Agent Mack,
you are relieved of duty.

320
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:12,768
Get on a plane, eat some peanuts,
and go home.

321
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:14,237
She won't push me again, sir.

322
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,705
She just caught me off-guard.

323
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,334
The only thoughts
in my head are my own.

324
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,613
You're willing to risk your life on that?

325
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:23,672
Yes, sir.

326
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,909
Then put the gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger.

327
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,153
Don't worry.

328
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,255
You already checked it.
It's not loaded.

329
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:46,327
Spread these beads to any sniff,
any watcher,

330
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,607
any goddamn expatriate reader
in Hong Kong

331
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,906
who knows up from down
until we find Kira.

332
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,976
What about the Chinese government
and their guys?

333
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:58,473
The story is out, bleeders all over
the country will be looking for her.

334
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,350
We can't let them get the drug.

335
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,582
Then we put a price on her head.

336
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:11,491
Yeah, this is it.

337
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,997
Hey, can you... I don't have any...

338
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,126
Yeah! Sure. I got it.

339
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,561
There you go.
You can keep it. Thanks.

340
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:25,743
How much do you have?

341
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,175
Don't give him all of that.

342
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:29,178
- It's not gonna be enough.
- It's enough.

343
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,611
- Just give me the...
- It's enough. / Excuse me, sir?

344
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:31,943
Hey. We need 5 minutes.

345
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,108
- 5 minutes
- Yeah!

346
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,948
Listen, this is a place for grown-ups,

347
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:39,887
- so behave yourself.
- Shut up.

348
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:41,956
That sounds about right.

349
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,268
- Choose another.
- Yeah! Show me...

350
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,529
- Concentrate.
- Yes.

351
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,672
- Queen of hearts.
- Okay. Watch. It's already here.

352
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:04,113
Show me... Ace of spades.

353
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,150
Think I know why we're here.

354
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,390
You've got good hands.

355
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,619
- Nick! You alright?
- Yeah.

356
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:18,957
What's going on? Sit down.

357
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:22,091
- Vodka martini?
- Thank you.

358
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,392
I'll have one of those.

359
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:25,594
She'll have a Coke.

360
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,863
My mom drinks when
she wants to get really clear images.

361
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:29,165
She's famous for it.

362
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:31,330
Maybe something without caffeine.

363
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:33,175
I've got it. Whoa.

364
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,409
There's 5.

365
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:38,107
Keep the change.

366
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:39,181
Thank you.

367
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,814
I know who you are.

368
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:47,387
When I was in Division,

369
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,483
her mother was at the top
of every watch list there was.

370
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,788
You worked for Division?

371
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,228
You want to know about Division?

372
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:03,031
10 years. No thank you, no pension.

373
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:05,972
I was put out on the street
with a threat to not shift again.

374
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,678
Only the sniffs caught up
with me in Chicago.

375
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:12,714
I was just trying to buy
something nice for my wife.

376
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:16,713
Next day I get a call, she's dead.

377
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:19,212
Car accident.

378
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:23,392
But my wife doesn't drive.

379
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:29,592
But I don't have to remind
you how that feels, right?

380
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:38,871
- We need this.
- An olive?

381
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:41,408
It's a bead.

382
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:45,581
It's supposed to lead us to someone
we need to find before Division does.

383
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:49,117
Excuse me! May I?

384
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,814
Thank you.

385
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,752
You're welcome.

386
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:00,218
Got it right?

387
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:03,663
It's a little more round and shinier.

388
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:06,366
That's it.

389
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:08,136
That's just how I saw it.

390
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,297
It won't last long.

391
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:16,138
I'd take it Emily Hu.
She's ex-pat sniff.

392
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:18,936
Only works by referral.
Here's her address.

393
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:21,982
Thank you, Hook.

394
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,814
Bye bye.

395
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:27,487
Good luck.

396
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:38,131
That's her comb.

397
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:45,874
Is she with another man?

398
00:40:57,786 --> 00:40:58,986
Yes

399
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:04,223
I see a man... and a boat

400
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:06,018
Is she happy?

401
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:08,323
Will she come back to me?

402
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,506
That was a very big yacht.

403
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:19,574
May I help you?

404
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:21,335
Hook Waters sent us.

405
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:25,672
A bead that looks like this one
is supposed to lead us to a girl.

406
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,420
You with Division?

407
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,182
Are you looking at us?

408
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:40,519
The truth is,
the girl who dropped that bead...

409
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:43,188
is supposed to have a suitcase
that will bring down Division.

410
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:46,563
Cassie here thinks that
if we don't find it, we die.

411
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:48,224
And you believe her?

412
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:51,497
She's pretty convincing.

413
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,973
Well, consider me unconvinced.

414
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:03,773
Looks like we've just got to wait.

415
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:04,975
For what?

416
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:06,816
You have about one minute to help us.

417
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:10,018
And what's that?

418
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:12,752
That's your... poster.

419
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:16,189
- That's the bead.
- That's the clock.

420
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:19,091
- It's... right now...
- You've got about a minute.

421
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,367
You guys can't be serious.

422
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:25,769
Don't look at me.

423
00:42:26,007 --> 00:42:28,168
This girl's been going
at it with that plan all day.

424
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:31,072
Everything that ends up on this pad
seems to be coming true.

425
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:33,573
I just see it like I'm looking
at a photograph.

426
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:40,251
Look... we want Division
out of Hong Kong...

427
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:41,854
just as much as you do.

428
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:45,248
It's going to be a whole lot easier
if you help us find the girl.

429
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,690
You remind me of someone...

430
00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:51,128
I used to know

431
00:42:55,403 --> 00:42:56,734
Fine.

432
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:03,171
They've been spreading these
all over the city.

433
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:19,784
You'll find who you're looking
for on Kwun Tong Pier.

434
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,800
<i>Where do you wanna go? Hmm?</i>

435
00:43:51,491 --> 00:43:52,788
Excuse me!

436
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:57,320
Excuse me. Speak any English?

437
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,590
- No.
- No.

438
00:43:58,698 --> 00:44:02,930
It doesn't really matter.
I just need a ride.

439
00:44:05,004 --> 00:44:06,471
We're old friends, right?

440
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,690
Didn't know you were here.
Long time no see.

441
00:44:11,706 --> 00:44:15,177
- You look great! Have you lost weight lately?
- I know, I know, I should have called.

442
00:44:15,178 --> 00:44:17,078
Hop in my car.

443
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:34,561
Whoa, whoa!

444
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:37,967
- Kira?
- Dammit!

445
00:44:38,104 --> 00:44:40,071
- What the hell are you doing here?
- There goes my ride!

446
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,800
- Don't.
- Don't. Don't what?

447
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:44,533
You're the girl everyone's looking for?

448
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,975
- I should kill you, Nick.
- Hey!

449
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:47,442
You know this psycho?

450
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,241
- What happened to you?
- Now you want to know?

451
00:44:49,783 --> 00:44:51,614
What does that suppose to mean?
I thought you left.

452
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:52,739
You stopped returning my calls.

453
00:44:52,852 --> 00:44:54,580
Division caught me
and locked me up.

454
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:56,587
- What?
- And you never came.

455
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:58,783
I looked for you. I did!

456
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:02,021
You didn't find me.

457
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:05,726
It's done! You had a thing.
Get over it.

458
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:08,626
I really suggest we discuss
this somewhere else.

459
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:11,500
Let's go, Nick.

460
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:27,681
Kira. Division's looking for you.

461
00:45:28,253 --> 00:45:30,084
They're looking for the case.

462
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:31,850
And so are you.

463
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,781
What's in that case?

464
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:35,621
I don't know.

465
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,518
All I know is that I woke up on a boat

466
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:39,722
next to a note I'd written
saying to look for you

467
00:45:39,798 --> 00:45:41,561
and you'd help me find the case.

468
00:45:43,802 --> 00:45:46,362
I don't remember anything
about the last couple of days...

469
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:48,870
no matter how hard I try.

470
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:51,199
You must have had yourself wiped.

471
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,771
Erased memories make it harder
for Division to track you.

472
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:58,940
Not the ones of you.

473
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,945
Can I talk to you for a sec?

474
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:05,983
Can it wait?

475
00:46:06,324 --> 00:46:07,417
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

476
00:46:07,526 --> 00:46:08,719
No.

477
00:46:13,465 --> 00:46:15,159
You, me, and my mom.

478
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:18,362
I've never seen my mom's
death before.

479
00:46:19,537 --> 00:46:20,766
It's her, Nick.

480
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:24,169
She's changing the future,
and she's making it worse.

481
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:25,867
- We've got to dump her.
- Dump her?

482
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:27,508
Cassie, we...

483
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:30,178
Cassie! We just found her.

484
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:31,806
And she doesn't have the case.

485
00:46:31,883 --> 00:46:32,851
Which is what we're looking for,

486
00:46:32,984 --> 00:46:34,418
- if you remember.
- Yeah! I know.

487
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:37,553
We find her, we find the case.

488
00:46:37,622 --> 00:46:39,852
- The 3 of us.
- Yeah, and then Division finds her.

489
00:46:40,024 --> 00:46:41,720
Oh yeah, the 3 of us.

490
00:46:44,963 --> 00:46:47,157
We'll get a shadow
so they can't trace her.

491
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:48,926
- Satisfied?
- No.

492
00:46:51,002 --> 00:46:52,333
Cassie, you've got to trust me.

493
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:54,337
I'm not the one
with the trust issues here.

494
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:55,565
You better do something quick

495
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,870
because I'm getting sick
of drawing dead bodies.

496
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:28,866
That's him.

497
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:31,673
- Hey, Pinky.
- Hey, Nick.

498
00:47:31,776 --> 00:47:34,335
- Hey.
- Alright, who's feeling the heat?

499
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,977
Alright.

500
00:47:38,883 --> 00:47:40,180
Here's how this works:

501
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:42,684
I get 10 grand a day
for shadowing Miss Trouble.

502
00:47:42,786 --> 00:47:44,584
As long as she stays
within 20 feet of me,

503
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,145
no sniff is gonna find her.

504
00:47:46,222 --> 00:47:47,247
I don't care
if they're standing right on top

505
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:49,053
of us with a piece of her fingernail.

506
00:47:49,627 --> 00:47:51,719
- Happy?
- Overcome.

507
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:54,122
Come on. Let's find a place to think.

508
00:47:57,167 --> 00:48:00,695
So Pinky,
your wife give you that name?

509
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:03,330
No, the Division did, sweetheart.

510
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:05,471
Back in the day.

511
00:48:14,418 --> 00:48:17,545
I'm sorry. I can't remember
anything about the case.

512
00:48:18,055 --> 00:48:19,646
Shocking.

513
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:25,187
Can I clean up without getting killed?

514
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:27,286
Don't forget to wash
behind your ears.

515
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:33,126
Nice girlfriend you've got there.

516
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:35,967
Yeah. She used to be.

517
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,974
I met her running cons
on Coney Island tourists.

518
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,001
We did everything together.
Everything.

519
00:48:42,078 --> 00:48:43,511
So we're just gonna sit around

520
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:45,342
and wait for her to get
her memory back...

521
00:48:45,415 --> 00:48:48,384
and hope that she'll tell us where
the case is before Carver gets it?

522
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:50,785
Or us.

523
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:53,019
Great plan.

524
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:54,717
Where you going?

525
00:48:54,923 --> 00:48:57,484
I saw a chicken place downstairs.
Want to come?

526
00:48:57,627 --> 00:49:00,118
No, I'm good. I want to stay here,
see if I can help.

527
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:01,492
Have fun with that.

528
00:49:21,651 --> 00:49:22,810
Where you going?

529
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:25,080
Relax, Romeo.

530
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,416
I can shade her just fine out
in the hall.

531
00:49:29,025 --> 00:49:31,220
I don't need to be a watcher
to see where this is going.

532
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,841
Oh! Sorry about that.

533
00:50:24,613 --> 00:50:27,173
I thought the bathroom was on fire.

534
00:50:27,281 --> 00:50:30,012
I had to get you to come
in somehow.

535
00:50:31,018 --> 00:50:32,281
Did you push me?

536
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:33,718
You didn't like it?

537
00:50:35,758 --> 00:50:37,282
Push back.

538
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:16,025
My father expects me to find
that suitcase.

539
00:51:16,097 --> 00:51:17,359
So does my mother.

540
00:51:17,766 --> 00:51:20,165
But you don't see it clearly, do you?

541
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:22,331
Too many things keep changing.

542
00:51:23,638 --> 00:51:25,663
I already saw how you die.

543
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,974
Did you see it yet?

544
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,571
You can change it, you know.

545
00:51:34,682 --> 00:51:37,173
Plenty of planes
leaving Hong Kong every day.

546
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:38,980
Oh, we are going to change it.

547
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,512
You put a shadow on the girl.

548
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:44,650
You know that's only temporary.

549
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:49,156
That girl is the one who brings
all your little fantasies crashing down.

550
00:51:49,764 --> 00:51:52,096
So tell Nick something for me,
little girl.

551
00:51:52,532 --> 00:51:55,934
Tell him my family is going to make
his brain pop like a tomato.

552
00:51:56,237 --> 00:51:59,001
Tell him that's the future I see.

553
00:52:13,955 --> 00:52:15,387
Oh, boy.

554
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:18,719
Hello?

555
00:52:20,328 --> 00:52:22,887
There you are.
Where is the chicky-chicky...

556
00:52:22,997 --> 00:52:24,861
- who gets us all killed?
- Are you drunk?

557
00:52:24,931 --> 00:52:26,024
Yeah.

558
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,964
I'm sorry. I didn't know the procedure
for stopping a blitzed 10-year-old.

559
00:52:29,035 --> 00:52:32,971
I'm 13!
And I am powering my use!

560
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:35,009
I can't believe this.

561
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:36,306
I am working.

562
00:52:37,278 --> 00:52:39,973
- You screw it all up!
- Alright...

563
00:52:40,046 --> 00:52:42,140
Give me this. What is this?
We talked about this, Cassie.

564
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:43,240
Nobody is going anywhere.

565
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:45,181
- What is this?
- You don't get it, Nick.

566
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:48,885
She is the one that kills us all,
basically.

567
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,989
Then I guess we're all gonna get killed.

568
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:51,523
Yeah. Screwed up.

569
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,718
By "we", you mean not...

570
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:54,885
You, too.

571
00:52:56,363 --> 00:52:59,025
Pop Girl's a better watcher than I am.

572
00:52:59,165 --> 00:53:01,463
Whoa! No one said anything
about a watcher.

573
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:03,559
I can only work long-term
against the sniffs.

574
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:05,935
- Good.
- No! True story.

575
00:53:06,006 --> 00:53:08,338
You've got a watcher after you.
It's just a matter of time.

576
00:53:09,609 --> 00:53:12,043
Then we'll split up.

577
00:53:12,178 --> 00:53:14,544
We'll give her 2 things
to track instead of one.

578
00:53:14,614 --> 00:53:18,050
- Pinky, take Kira somewhere safe
- I'm not going with him.

579
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:19,378
No offense.

580
00:53:19,486 --> 00:53:21,010
None taken, cupcake.

581
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:22,712
I know you're sweet on the champ.

582
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:24,484
I'll find you.

583
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,265
Let's let her sleep for a bit.

584
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,903
- She's one step ahead of our sister.
- Pa pa would be very angry.

585
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:07,364
She saw me coming.

586
00:54:10,102 --> 00:54:12,200
I think you underestimated her.

587
00:54:13,038 --> 00:54:14,563
She still dies!

588
00:54:22,414 --> 00:54:23,972
She's gone, you know.

589
00:54:26,785 --> 00:54:28,446
I'm just saying...

590
00:54:31,957 --> 00:54:34,255
- You okay?
- No...

591
00:54:36,195 --> 00:54:38,130
Not until we find that case.

592
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:40,364
When was the last time you saw it?

593
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,796
Not since yesterday.

594
00:54:42,568 --> 00:54:44,866
Not for lack of trying, though.

595
00:54:46,538 --> 00:54:50,030
If we don't find it soon,
they're gonna kill my mom.

596
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,500
And it's gonna be my fault.

597
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:11,026
Look at me.

598
00:55:11,597 --> 00:55:13,155
Hey! Look at me.

599
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:15,357
You really think
I'm gonna let that happen?

600
00:55:17,136 --> 00:55:18,728
You said the future's
always changing, right?

601
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:19,860
It can change just by knowing it?

602
00:55:19,938 --> 00:55:22,964
It can change.
It doesn't mean it will.

603
00:55:26,412 --> 00:55:28,004
- Good enough.
- What are you doing?

604
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,638
What are you gonna go do?

605
00:55:29,715 --> 00:55:31,148
I'm gonna try and make a better one.

606
00:55:32,418 --> 00:55:34,385
Going after Carver
doesn't change anything.

607
00:55:34,552 --> 00:55:36,042
It doesn't save me,
it doesn't save you,

608
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,246
it doesn't save her.

609
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:39,118
It's just a matter of time, Cassie.

610
00:55:39,223 --> 00:55:41,089
If I don't go to him, he'll come for us.

611
00:55:50,435 --> 00:55:51,562
Emily, it's Nick.

612
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,730
Division sent a pusher named Carver
to Hong Kong.

613
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:55,999
I need you to find him.

614
00:55:58,377 --> 00:56:01,277
Just use that bead they gave you.
I'm sure his hands were all over it.

615
00:56:29,607 --> 00:56:32,105
- We're not open yet.
- I'm not hungry.

616
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:31,524
Henry Carver.

617
00:57:35,473 --> 00:57:38,339
Now there's a face
I haven't seen in a long time.

618
00:57:44,581 --> 00:57:46,048
Sit down.

619
00:57:46,516 --> 00:57:48,711
The food is actually pretty good here.

620
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:57,216
Give me one good
reason not to kill you right now.

621
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:00,590
Good.

622
00:58:01,031 --> 00:58:02,896
Gonna try and get inside my head?

623
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:05,132
Go ahead.

624
00:58:05,202 --> 00:58:07,796
See if you can push me
before I pull the trigger.

625
00:58:09,272 --> 00:58:13,208
Wow! 10 years is a long time
to hold a grudge.

626
00:58:13,342 --> 00:58:15,004
My father would disagree.

627
00:58:15,212 --> 00:58:19,272
- You piece of shit.
- Your father I had respect for.

628
00:58:19,382 --> 00:58:21,577
He took a stand with great integrity,

629
00:58:21,651 --> 00:58:24,211
which is more than anyone
can say about you.

630
00:58:29,392 --> 00:58:32,054
- If this is your attempt at...
- Think I don't know this future?

631
00:58:32,728 --> 00:58:33,957
Huh?

632
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:37,056
I've got 20 of the best
watchers in the world...

633
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:40,101
tracking every moment
of this time right now.

634
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,128
You die, Nick.

635
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,032
You all die.

636
00:58:46,575 --> 00:58:47,975
You know who doesn't?

637
00:58:49,912 --> 00:58:51,777
- Me.
- You sure about that?

638
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:55,974
Okay.

639
00:58:57,019 --> 00:58:59,181
Kira is our patient zero.

640
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:02,649
And with her we're going to create
an army the world's

641
00:59:02,758 --> 00:59:05,394
- never seen before...
- I'm sorry. Am I supposed to care?

642
00:59:05,394 --> 00:59:08,761
Fine. Fuck patriotism.

643
00:59:09,164 --> 00:59:12,361
The girl will die unless she receives
the necessary injections.

644
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:16,766
And you're not going to find
it anywhere but with me.

645
00:59:19,074 --> 00:59:20,871
Maybe you care about that.

646
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:26,480
Tell me something, Nick.

647
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:29,714
Her blood turn black yet?

648
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:33,383
No? Insides running out?

649
00:59:37,493 --> 00:59:39,893
Or is she keeping that
away from you, too?

650
00:59:46,368 --> 00:59:48,427
I'll take that as a yes.

651
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,191
You already know
the ending to this story.

652
01:02:02,336 --> 01:02:04,394
You can only draw it so many ways.

653
01:02:07,442 --> 01:02:09,000
We're going to change it.

654
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:14,243
You don't believe that, do you?

655
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:16,214
Please...

656
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:20,276
don't make me do anything to myself.

657
01:02:21,288 --> 01:02:23,449
Hurting you would change the future.

658
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:26,350
And I like how this future goes.

659
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,692
So will killing him.

660
01:02:44,811 --> 01:02:46,073
Victor!

661
01:03:06,332 --> 01:03:08,198
I think I just saved your life.

662
01:03:09,435 --> 01:03:12,165
There's no need to thank me.
You should just start listening to me.

663
01:03:18,678 --> 01:03:19,975
You look like shit.

664
01:03:39,432 --> 01:03:41,194
- Where is she?
- 5-A.

665
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,995
- Is she safe?
- Yeah.

666
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,161
She's sick, though. Pretty bad.

667
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:35,515
I need to ask you a question.

668
01:04:37,756 --> 01:04:39,279
What's in the case?

669
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:46,560
It's a drug.

670
01:04:47,132 --> 01:04:50,932
Some sort of psychic steroid
that boosts our abilities...

671
01:04:51,536 --> 01:04:52,901
but kills us.

672
01:04:57,642 --> 01:04:59,371
They want me back

673
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:02,446
because I'm the only one...
who survived the injection.

674
01:05:07,986 --> 01:05:10,284
Tell me why I just drew a picture
of me holding her shoe.

675
01:05:24,436 --> 01:05:25,595
Is she okay?

676
01:05:27,538 --> 01:05:30,208
What? No.
You've got to be kidding me.

677
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:32,073
- She's dying.
- You are not bringing me into this.

678
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:33,736
You're already in it.

679
01:05:34,312 --> 01:05:36,177
We need to know
what this key unlocks.

680
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:38,378
Please.

681
01:05:40,618 --> 01:05:42,553
Cassie,
how much do the Chinese know?

682
01:05:42,754 --> 01:05:44,449
Whatever we do. It could be more.

683
01:05:45,089 --> 01:05:46,556
Their watcher is better than me.

684
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:49,125
We know there's a suitcase
with a Division drug in it.

685
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:50,682
Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong.

686
01:05:50,762 --> 01:05:51,854
Can you draw us a way out of this?

687
01:05:51,963 --> 01:05:53,759
We can't change anything
with that bitch tracking us.

688
01:05:53,898 --> 01:05:55,365
The second we do,
she's gonna see it.

689
01:05:55,433 --> 01:05:57,402
- What do you mean?
- She sees intentions.

690
01:05:57,402 --> 01:05:58,959
What we decide to do.

691
01:05:59,037 --> 01:06:01,766
I decide to cross the street,
so she sees me crossing the street.

692
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:04,173
What if nothing we did made sense?

693
01:06:05,076 --> 01:06:06,406
Or we just kept changing our mind,

694
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:08,570
we didn't know exactly
what we were gonna do?

695
01:06:09,013 --> 01:06:10,378
Would that throw her off?

696
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:12,643
It might, but we still have
to find the case.

697
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:26,252
Whatever this key unlocks
is being shadowed.

698
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:28,562
Like I've never seen before.

699
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:31,299
It's this way.

700
01:06:36,006 --> 01:06:37,667
That really narrows it down.

701
01:06:42,012 --> 01:06:44,207
If it's shadowed,
I won't be able to draw.

702
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:57,053
There's a building missing.

703
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:04,557
I thought shadows weren't supposed

704
01:07:04,634 --> 01:07:06,535
to be effective against
watchers like Cassie.

705
01:07:06,603 --> 01:07:07,934
They're not.

706
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:11,631
We're not supposed to be able
to shade entire buildings either.

707
01:07:36,398 --> 01:07:38,162
You wanted to see me?

708
01:07:41,605 --> 01:07:43,197
I'm going to need your help.

709
01:07:47,644 --> 01:07:49,771
Watchers from everywhere
are tracking us.

710
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:51,404
Carver... the Chinese...

711
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:53,210
Anything we think we're gonna do,
they know about it.

712
01:07:53,315 --> 01:07:55,715
That's why we all keep dying
in Cassie's book.

713
01:07:56,286 --> 01:07:58,913
- Pardon?
- You die outside an elevator.

714
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:01,322
Oh.

715
01:08:02,759 --> 01:08:05,090
How are we gonna make
the future unpredictable?

716
01:08:05,195 --> 01:08:07,162
By not knowing what we're gonna do

717
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:09,363
until right before we do it.

718
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:12,366
- Like a plan without planning.
- Yes. Right.

719
01:08:12,669 --> 01:08:13,726
Okay!

720
01:08:14,571 --> 01:08:17,835
I'll write letters to each of you
giving you specific instruction.

721
01:08:18,508 --> 01:08:20,270
You don't open them until I tell you.

722
01:08:22,946 --> 01:08:25,505
Then the last letter,
I write to myself...

723
01:08:27,016 --> 01:08:28,950
and wipe the memory
of ever having written them.

724
01:08:29,084 --> 01:08:31,450
That's why I need you to find
the guy that wiped Kira.

725
01:08:32,354 --> 01:08:34,845
- Sure thing.
- That sounds like a great plan.

726
01:08:36,358 --> 01:08:38,883
- Do you have a better one?
- We're flying blind.

727
01:08:39,195 --> 01:08:40,321
Yeah.

728
01:08:42,631 --> 01:08:43,928
Cassie...

729
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:45,998
I need one more drawing out of you.

730
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:49,327
I need to know the exact size
and shape of that case.

731
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:50,938
And that syringe.

732
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,200
Our watcher said that the
package is here now.

733
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:06,200
Pa pa, I know what
Division is looking for.

734
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:07,676
It's a syringe.

735
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:13,243
With this drug we'll be more
powerful than Division.

736
01:10:31,706 --> 01:10:35,767
The girl will die unless she receives
the necessary injections.

737
01:10:36,311 --> 01:10:39,610
You're not going to find the stuff
anywhere but with me.

738
01:10:45,752 --> 01:10:47,345
You die, Nick.

739
01:10:48,523 --> 01:10:50,718
You all die.

740
01:11:18,186 --> 01:11:20,050
You need the medicine
that Carver has.

741
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,448
I'm not gonna watch you die.

742
01:11:28,795 --> 01:11:30,524
I'll come back for you.

743
01:11:36,803 --> 01:11:38,168
I promise.

744
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:53,550
When do I open it?

745
01:11:55,789 --> 01:11:57,586
When you start to doubt the truth.

746
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,643
- You know when to open these.
- You sure this is right?

747
01:12:20,714 --> 01:12:22,079
No.

748
01:12:29,623 --> 01:12:30,715
Nick?

749
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,525
Take an umbrella.

750
01:12:35,394 --> 01:12:36,828
It's gonna rain.

751
01:12:38,532 --> 01:12:40,363
You be careful, too.

752
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:07,090
You make us chase
you halfway across the world...

753
01:13:07,193 --> 01:13:10,219
then you let a hack
like Pinky Stein bring you in?

754
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:12,728
- I'm sick.
- You're sick?

755
01:13:12,965 --> 01:13:14,432
You don't know what you are.

756
01:13:17,404 --> 01:13:18,768
Victor, pay the man.

757
01:13:39,558 --> 01:13:40,889
Of course.

758
01:13:48,868 --> 01:13:50,631
I knew I wouldn't get paid yet.

759
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:52,065
Wait here.

760
01:13:53,205 --> 01:13:54,398
Were you followed?

761
01:13:54,874 --> 01:13:56,397
I'm never followed.

762
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,571
Where is this guy?

763
01:14:00,111 --> 01:14:01,669
- Which one?
- The yellow one.

764
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,270
- The big one?
- Yep.

765
01:14:35,446 --> 01:14:36,743
Wo Chiang?

766
01:14:40,386 --> 01:14:41,876
You are here about the girl?

767
01:14:41,986 --> 01:14:43,544
You're the one that wiped Kira?

768
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:48,421
12 years ago, a woman told me
an American girl would come.

769
01:14:48,626 --> 01:14:51,390
That was 2 days ago,
Kira showed.

770
01:14:53,331 --> 01:14:54,525
I have a job for you.

771
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:00,068
2 hours ago, I wrote 7 letters.

772
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:02,366
I need you to erase the memory
of ever having written them.

773
01:15:05,076 --> 01:15:07,704
7 letters, 2 hours of memory.

774
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,507
The woman tell me those things.

775
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:14,948
She did not pay for you, too.

776
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,517
And when you're done,
I need you to open this and read it.

777
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:28,128
- I need a minute.
- As you wish.

778
01:15:36,473 --> 01:15:40,274
I'm not gonna wake up
and forget who I am, am I?

779
01:16:05,068 --> 01:16:07,969
Wait, wait. No, just... go.

780
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:34,895
It's all gone.

781
01:16:35,999 --> 01:16:39,127
The future has... disappeared.

782
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:40,734
I lost the connection.

783
01:16:59,622 --> 01:17:02,448
Sir, your credential, please.

784
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,700
I'm here for inspection.

785
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,628
I want to know where the lockers are.

786
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:12,100
The top floor, sir.
You can find them up there.

787
01:17:12,902 --> 01:17:15,098
- Up this way?
- Yes.

788
01:17:58,914 --> 01:18:00,677
No problem.

789
01:18:35,284 --> 01:18:36,716
The job is over.

790
01:18:36,786 --> 01:18:38,344
You don't have to shadow
the building anymore.

791
01:18:38,487 --> 01:18:40,181
The girl sent me...

792
01:19:01,076 --> 01:19:02,508
Thank you.

793
01:19:02,744 --> 01:19:04,007
You ready?

794
01:19:07,249 --> 01:19:08,943
Right size, right shape.

795
01:19:09,384 --> 01:19:10,749
No problem.

796
01:19:11,553 --> 01:19:13,487
Better hurry. Won't last long.

797
01:19:33,942 --> 01:19:35,239
Crap.

798
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,240
" Go Home "

799
01:20:34,301 --> 01:20:35,633
The Lord giveth.

800
01:20:41,909 --> 01:20:45,140
Did you really think
you could slip out of town with this?

801
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:58,414
Tell me, was this worth dying for?

802
01:21:16,777 --> 01:21:19,143
No. He dies slowly.

803
01:21:19,246 --> 01:21:22,977
Your sister promised me that
and a great deal of money.

804
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:40,423
Do you know how many people
in the world would kill for this drug?

805
01:21:44,271 --> 01:21:45,294
Now...

806
01:21:51,878 --> 01:21:53,344
Where is Cassie?

807
01:21:57,283 --> 01:21:59,114
Get me back on my feet.

808
01:22:18,103 --> 01:22:19,904
You don't seem to be reliable.

809
01:22:30,616 --> 01:22:32,641
Didn't see that one coming,
did you?

810
01:22:32,752 --> 01:22:35,277
Do you really want to do this,
little girl?

811
01:22:35,388 --> 01:22:36,980
I know where the drug is.

812
01:22:37,056 --> 01:22:40,082
More importantly,
I know how you die.

813
01:22:40,193 --> 01:22:42,319
Do you want to know
what the tiger means?

814
01:22:49,201 --> 01:22:50,566
The drug is here.

815
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:52,604
See if that will make him love you.

816
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:03,983
My note says I'm supposed
to tell you...

817
01:23:03,983 --> 01:23:06,577
the Division has Kira.
216 Batang Street.

818
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:10,721
It said a lot on there.
Was everyone's that complicated?

819
01:23:11,824 --> 01:23:13,291
I knew you could handle it.

820
01:23:19,665 --> 01:23:21,723
This immuno-suppressant
will save your life

821
01:23:21,834 --> 01:23:24,097
and allow you
to reach your full potential.

822
01:23:26,038 --> 01:23:28,598
You're going to be a better you, Kira.

823
01:23:32,945 --> 01:23:35,276
You need to accept this reality.

824
01:23:36,782 --> 01:23:39,046
We're not trying to hurt you. Kira.

825
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:42,285
Matter of fact, your well being means
everything to us.

826
01:23:42,788 --> 01:23:44,379
Understand it's not your fault
you're forgetting

827
01:23:44,456 --> 01:23:46,084
who you are and running from us.

828
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:47,716
The drug has side effects.

829
01:23:47,793 --> 01:23:49,919
We have no way
of knowing the severity.

830
01:23:50,762 --> 01:23:53,994
I want you to know that
I blame myself for that, Agent Hollis.

831
01:24:02,574 --> 01:24:04,269
This isn't real.

832
01:24:13,985 --> 01:24:16,180
You volunteered, Kira.

833
01:24:16,855 --> 01:24:18,550
I was against it.

834
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:22,919
You were certain you'd be
the one to survive the drug.

835
01:24:23,161 --> 01:24:26,927
I had to support you.
After all, we were partners.

836
01:24:29,234 --> 01:24:31,099
Then you panicked.

837
01:24:34,405 --> 01:24:35,872
Did you think you made it
all the way here...

838
01:24:35,974 --> 01:24:38,909
and eluded us for so long
without any training?

839
01:24:40,445 --> 01:24:42,470
That's the Division in you. Kira.

840
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:45,877
Now let me help you remember.

841
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,814
Let me help you remember.

842
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,426
I keep trying to draw
something different, but I can't.

843
01:25:07,805 --> 01:25:09,534
It's something to do with how I die.

844
01:25:09,674 --> 01:25:10,698
It's a tiger.

845
01:25:10,974 --> 01:25:12,875
I'm serious.

846
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:16,773
I don't know how I know,
but I just know.

847
01:25:18,683 --> 01:25:21,845
I know I act like
I don't care sometimes,

848
01:25:22,787 --> 01:25:24,879
- but I don't want to die.
- Cassie...

849
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,323
It's not gonna happen, okay?

850
01:25:32,196 --> 01:25:34,664
Just tell me that I'm a crappy artist
and that I'm wrong.

851
01:25:34,799 --> 01:25:38,359
You are a crappy artist
and you are wrong.

852
01:25:38,436 --> 01:25:39,562
Listen to me.

853
01:25:40,805 --> 01:25:42,897
You've already done
more than enough for everyone.

854
01:25:43,574 --> 01:25:45,337
The only thing
you've got to worry about right now

855
01:25:45,442 --> 01:25:48,036
- is keeping yourself safe.
- But how?

856
01:25:49,413 --> 01:25:50,539
Just start walking.

857
01:25:50,681 --> 01:25:51,739
Don't even think about
where you're going.

858
01:25:51,815 --> 01:25:54,943
Just keep moving. And don't make any
decisions any watcher can track.

859
01:25:55,953 --> 01:25:57,818
And when you come across
someplace safe,

860
01:25:58,522 --> 01:26:01,355
you hide. Simple as that.

861
01:26:01,959 --> 01:26:04,154
I don't know how,
but I know this is gonna work out.

862
01:26:04,361 --> 01:26:07,387
I promise.
No need to be scared. Trust me.

863
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,067
That's more like it.

864
01:26:31,121 --> 01:26:32,348
What are you gonna do?

865
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:36,552
I can't tell you.

866
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,400
" Wan Chi Market "

867
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,200
<i>One cup of English tea, no sugar.</i>

868
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,600
<i>- 2 Wonton noodles.
- Very cheap. On sale!</i>

869
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:14,800
<i>- Wonton noodles.
- It tastes pretty good. I'm so happy.</i>

870
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,900
<i>Food delivery.</i>

871
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,400
" Registrated "

872
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:34,667
You make me look like a fool
in front of my family!

873
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:42,440
Don't worry.

874
01:29:50,452 --> 01:29:52,180
You won't remember a thing.

875
01:29:55,589 --> 01:29:57,454
Your mother's very proud.

876
01:30:09,037 --> 01:30:12,494
I want to make a deal.
The drug for the girl.

877
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,509
Okay.

878
01:30:17,911 --> 01:30:20,311
Dock 4, Man Yuen Street.

879
01:30:36,196 --> 01:30:37,754
Where is the case, Nick?

880
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:39,058
Kira!

881
01:30:44,838 --> 01:30:46,135
Go ahead.

882
01:30:48,908 --> 01:30:51,309
Remember that night
under the roller coaster?

883
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,378
We parked in the rain and
got those little bottles of Jack.

884
01:31:03,957 --> 01:31:06,357
That was the first time
you told me you loved me.

885
01:31:09,929 --> 01:31:11,157
He remembers.

886
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:15,559
I want to hear it from him.

887
01:31:17,937 --> 01:31:19,303
I remember.

888
01:31:22,508 --> 01:31:23,942
It never happened.

889
01:31:26,979 --> 01:31:29,141
We met for the first time yesterday.

890
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:32,815
You've never been to Coney Island.

891
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,811
Nobody's been to Coney Island.

892
01:31:39,992 --> 01:31:41,721
I used you, Nick.

893
01:31:43,729 --> 01:31:46,790
And the quicker we find that case,
the quicker I'll let you forget it.

894
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:53,133
You might as well.

895
01:31:57,543 --> 01:32:01,309
My card says you have to take
the drug. Give me Carver.

896
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:02,712
It's for you.

897
01:32:10,356 --> 01:32:12,449
- Hello!
- You want the case,

898
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:13,989
you let them live.

899
01:32:14,193 --> 01:32:16,388
I'll tell you exactly where it is.

900
01:32:21,733 --> 01:32:23,793
- Another?
- Sure.

901
01:32:27,974 --> 01:32:29,532
One for the road.

902
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,386
Don't feel too bad.

903
01:33:23,094 --> 01:33:26,063
That push of Kira's
has worked on better men.

904
01:34:41,972 --> 01:34:43,462
Kill him.

905
01:34:45,776 --> 01:34:47,368
If that's alright with you?

906
01:34:48,747 --> 01:34:50,214
The case...

907
01:34:58,389 --> 01:34:59,720
Agent Carver.

908
01:35:09,366 --> 01:35:11,334
The contents of this case
are the property

909
01:35:11,468 --> 01:35:13,095
of the United States government.

910
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:15,832
Government?
We are the only government here.

911
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:19,375
Be reasonable. There is
no need for anyone to die.

912
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:24,372
We're not much
for diplomacy these days.

913
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:37,354
Victor! Make me a way out of here!

914
01:35:52,008 --> 01:35:53,340
Kira!

915
01:37:29,271 --> 01:37:30,329
Kira!

916
01:37:51,059 --> 01:37:52,185
Kira...

917
01:40:31,585 --> 01:40:34,713
Whoa! I'm impressed.

918
01:40:34,788 --> 01:40:37,950
The engineers are always conservative
with their projections...

919
01:40:38,024 --> 01:40:38,991
but this is something else.

920
01:40:39,092 --> 01:40:42,062
Hey! We are on the same side.
Remember?

921
01:40:42,262 --> 01:40:43,660
Now why don't you march the men

922
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:46,392
who tried to kill us off this roof,
and we'll call it a day.

923
01:40:47,567 --> 01:40:50,764
Wait! Kira! Don't do this!

924
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:53,938
It's a push.
What Carver told you is a lie.

925
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:55,701
I'm sure they make a card for this.

926
01:41:00,747 --> 01:41:02,112
Where were we?

927
01:41:02,982 --> 01:41:04,746
Where were we?

928
01:41:26,472 --> 01:41:28,030
You don't want to do that.

929
01:41:28,674 --> 01:41:29,663
Watch me.

930
01:41:29,842 --> 01:41:32,003
You'd be doing me a favor if you did.

931
01:41:32,178 --> 01:41:33,701
What's in that needle will kill you.

932
01:41:33,813 --> 01:41:36,281
I went through hundreds
of potentials to find her.

933
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:38,549
She's our survival.

934
01:41:42,488 --> 01:41:43,613
Look at me.

935
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:49,989
You know me.

936
01:41:52,697 --> 01:41:54,062
I know you.

937
01:41:59,872 --> 01:42:01,237
Look at me...

938
01:42:02,974 --> 01:42:04,202
Look at me.

939
01:42:11,183 --> 01:42:12,548
Let him do it.

940
01:43:02,299 --> 01:43:03,960
What a waste.

941
01:43:42,606 --> 01:43:44,540
I told you to bring an umbrella.

942
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,177
Thought you said it was gonna rain.

943
01:43:51,749 --> 01:43:53,944
I also told you
I get things wrong sometimes.

944
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:02,184
Maybe it will wash the crap
out of your hair.

945
01:44:08,332 --> 01:44:10,061
So where's the real case?

946
01:44:23,881 --> 01:44:25,212
There it is.

947
01:44:27,151 --> 01:44:31,349
How long do you think your mother
has been planning this?

948
01:44:33,123 --> 01:44:34,750
Since before I was born.

949
01:44:38,027 --> 01:44:39,120
This is the key, Nick.

950
01:44:39,263 --> 01:44:40,628
Division will do anything to keep

951
01:44:40,731 --> 01:44:42,528
this from getting into
the wrong hands.

952
01:44:43,399 --> 01:44:45,129
So we trade your mom for the drug?

953
01:44:46,537 --> 01:44:48,231
I'm still working on that one.

954
01:44:52,508 --> 01:44:54,943
Hey, what was it that
I injected myself with?

955
01:44:55,411 --> 01:44:57,004
Nine Dragon Soy Sauce.

956
01:44:58,615 --> 01:44:59,979
That's gross.

957
01:45:01,385 --> 01:45:02,373
What about Kira?

958
01:45:02,486 --> 01:45:04,750
You're the watcher. You tell me.

959
01:45:05,589 --> 01:45:08,217
Don't worry. We'll see
Miss Trouble soon enough.

960
01:45:41,324 --> 01:45:42,882
When do I open it?

961
01:45:42,992 --> 01:45:44,926
When you start to doubt the truth.

962
01:46:24,567 --> 01:46:27,034
Put your gun in your mouth.

963
01:46:29,072 --> 01:46:30,539
Pull the trigger.

964
01:47:13,040 --> 01:51:23,940
