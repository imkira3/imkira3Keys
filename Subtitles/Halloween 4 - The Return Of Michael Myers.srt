3
00:01:56,798 --> 00:01:58,549
Ok, go on through.

4
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:20,364
All metal objects into the tray.

5
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:23,783
Purpose of visit?

6
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,538
A patient pick up and transfer to Smith's Grove.

7
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,665
You're late.
- Yeah.

8
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:31,708
Should be on the road.
- Yeah.

9
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:33,795
Hell of a night, huh?
- Real charmer.

10
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,421
Yeah. I'll take you down there.
- All right.

11
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,173
Let them in.
- Ok.

12
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:46,226
First time here, huh?
- Hope it's the last time.

13
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,895
You never get used to the faces. Never.

14
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,025
Jesus!

15
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:59,197
Jesus ain't got nothing to do with this place.

16
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:01,199
Come on.

17
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:14,380
Yeah, this is where the society
dumps its worst nightmares.

18
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,345
Yeah the one you're picking up ...

19
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:22,805
Just thinking about him
gives me the willies.

20
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,349
A decade ago, Halloween night ...

21
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:28,436
He murdered 16 people ...
maybe more.

22
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:29,895
Trying to get to his sister.

23
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:32,188
Nearly got her too.

24
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:34,610
But his doctor ... of all people,

25
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:36,863
shot him ... six times.

26
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:38,782
Then he set him on fire.

27
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,991
Both of them nearly burned to death.

28
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:45,205
Yeah, I'll be glad to see this one gone.
Yes, indeedy!

29
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,252
Welcome to Hell.

30
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,342
Doctor?
- Yes?

31
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:58,510
The transfer personnel are here.

32
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,516
Smith's Grove?
- Yes.

33
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:07,395
I'm Dr. Hoffman, medical administrator.

34
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,773
Has he been prepped?
- Ready to go.

35
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:11,440
Who signs for him?

36
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:12,609
I do.

37
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,236
Outside.

38
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:15,655
Check him out.

39
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,693
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.

40
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:55,363
Michael Myers is still his patient.

41
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:57,866
Well, if Loomis read memos, he'd be here.

42
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,579
Fortunately his position is more ceremonial than medical.

43
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,330
And with Myers gone ...

44
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:06,583
My hope is that he'll either transfer ...

45
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,335
retire...

46
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:11,963
or die.

47
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:18,347
All right, let's move him.

48
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:30,650
Watch it.

49
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:31,860
I got this end.

50
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:37,700
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
- Yeah. I guess you're happy to see him go.

51
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:42,080
Locked and loaded.
- Let's roll.

52
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,206
Night, doc.

53
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:45,875
Drive carefully.

54
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,286
Did Hoffman say anything about living relatives?
- Yeah.

55
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,538
A niece living in his hometown.

56
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,542
And?

57
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,837
"And?" She's too young to be his legal ward.

58
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:31,132
So the state owns him?
Great.

59
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:34,594
You know, I still don't understand.

60
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:45,147
No!

61
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:05,253
Kido ...

62
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:08,214
It's 4:00 in the morning.

63
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:10,091
I can't sleep.

64
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,385
What is this?
Four nights in a row?

65
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:16,890
You going for a record here?
The seven-year-old insomniac's hall of fame?

66
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:18,934
Do you love me, Rachel?

67
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:23,814
Serious questions tonight.
Of course I love you.

68
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,399
Like a sister?

69
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:28,861
Jamie, sometimes it's ...
- Like a real sister?

70
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,657
We're not really sisters, Jamie.

71
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:36,159
But that doesn't mean that I love you any less.

72
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,666
Sure it does.

73
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,629
I know you miss your parents. It hasn't been that long.
- It's been 11 months.

74
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:53,012
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.
I'll bet you didn't know that.

75
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:56,556
You're lucky.
I wish she could do the same for me.

76
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,063
Come on, Jamie.
Let's go back to bed.

77
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:02,522
Come on, Sunday.

78
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:15,410
Sleep tight.
We'll have French toast for breakfast, ok?

79
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,661
Nighty-night.

80
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:17,956
Come on, Sunday.

81
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,832
Nighty-night.

82
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:37,291
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

83
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:41,628
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul will take.

84
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,257
God bless
Mr. and Mrs. Corruthers.

85
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:48,177
God bless Rachel, God bless Sunday, God bless me.

86
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:52,056
And God bless mommy and daddy in heaven. Amen.

87
00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:02,423
Help me please!
Somebody help me!

88
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,676
Help me!

89
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,598
Jamie!

90
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:21,653
Oh, dear God!
It's all right, sweetheart.

91
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,658
A bad dream. That's all.
Just a nasty old dream.

92
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:29,911
I've got you.
You're safe now, see?

93
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,414
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

94
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,459
It's okay. Shh.

95
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,546
You're gonna be just fine.
It's okay, baby. You're gonna be fine.

96
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,492
Damn it!
Darlene!

97
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:11,289
There's a clean one in the laundry
room next to your blue slacks. Hello?

98
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,251
Honey, this tie's got a spot on it.
I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.

99
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:18,712
Hang on, Mrs. Pierce.
Not that tie. On the other side.

100
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,757
That's not the only thing
you're eating, Rachel!

101
00:12:20,882 --> 00:12:24,637
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
- Found it.

102
00:12:24,763 --> 00:12:25,637
Sorry.

103
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:28,600
Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches?

104
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:33,063
Stupid question.
Tell her I hope she feels better.

105
00:12:34,814 --> 00:12:37,026
Susan's mother.
She can't baby-sit tonight.

106
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,901
Why not?

107
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,570
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink.

108
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,201
Rachel?
- Mom, please.

109
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:47,995
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.

110
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,206
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady.
You know how important that is.

111
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,835
Well. Tonight is very important for your father and me.

112
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,797
Can't you find somebody else?
- It's too late.

113
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:58,549
What am I supposed to tell Brady?

114
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:02,345
"Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister.
Go and have fun by yourself."

115
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,139
It's not exactly the end of the world for goodness' sake.
- Oh, sure it is.

116
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:08,684
I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.

117
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,144
But now, my future relationship
my engagement ...

118
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:16,567
my marriage, my children and your grandchildren
have all been wiped out, because I have to baby-sit.

119
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:21,489
I'm sorry I ruined everything.
If I wasn't here, you could go out.

120
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:25,494
Good job, Rachel.

121
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:28,623
That little girl needs all the love
we can give her right now.

122
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,209
And all you can do is think about yourself?

123
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:40,091
Jamie?

124
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:48,728
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

125
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:52,064
I can go out with Brady tomorrow night.
It's no big deal.

126
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:55,442
But you wanted to go out tonight.
It's my fault you can't.

127
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:59,154
Well, tonight we're going to do something better.
We're going to go trick-or-treating.

128
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,697
I don't want to.

129
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:05,745
It's Halloween! I mean: don't you want to get dressed up
in a really scary costume and get some candy?

130
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:13,795
How 'bout this afternoon I pick you up
from school and we go get ice cream?

131
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,922
Double scoops?

132
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:19,427
Double scoops.
Now let's get some breakfast.

133
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,226
Dr. Quinn, call 7402.

134
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:41,116
Why wasn't I notified?

135
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:44,412
About what?
- You know damn well about what.

136
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:47,123
You let them take it out of here.

137
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:51,461
For Christ's sake, spare me the speech.
I've listened to it for a decade.

138
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:57,468
The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient and
a federal prisoner. Therefore he's subject to federal law.

139
00:14:57,593 --> 00:15:04,934
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner, Hoffman.
We are talking about an evil on two legs.

140
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:07,562
I can see this is useless.

141
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,190
Do you know what today is?

142
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:12,650
Do you know the date?

143
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:16,654
Every day I look at myself in the mirror and ...

144
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:18,699
And every day I remember.

145
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,993
Look at me ... Hoffman!

146
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:23,869
Take a good look!

147
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:30,421
I don't want anyone to have to live
through that night again.

148
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:36,260
I've said this before.
I think you're the one who needs mental help.

149
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,935
Yes? Dr. Hoffman.

150
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:49,941
I see.

151
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,652
I see. Thank you.

152
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:59,869
Apparently there was an accident
just south of Mill Creek near the bri ... Loomis?

153
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:01,537
Loomis!

154
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:26,105
Is that it?

155
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,065
Yes.
- When did this happen?

156
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,320
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road
in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.

157
00:16:32,444 --> 00:16:34,822
An accident?
- Yes, sir.
- Do you believe that?

158
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:36,114
Why shouldn't I?

159
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,075
How many people in the bus?

160
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,119
Four ... plus Myers.

161
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:47,836
How many bodies did you find?
- It's hard to tell, they're all chewed up.

162
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:52,675
Loomis?

163
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,051
It's over. Leave it alone.

164
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:22,957
He's gone.

165
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,876
He was here ...

166
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,295
... but he's gone.

167
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,088
Did you find any other bodies?

168
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,341
Not yet. There's a lot of ground to cover.
- You won't find him.

169
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,843
He's done all this.

170
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,055
Now he's escaped.
- You don't know that.

171
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,433
Michael could've been thrown from the bus.

172
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,353
I've seen bodies thrown 50 - 60 feet from a crash site.

173
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,023
Even if by some miracle Michael's conscious ...

174
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:51,613
his ... his muscles would be totally useless.
Give the troopers a chance to search.

175
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,865
You're talking about him as if he were a human being.

176
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,620
That part of him died years ago.

177
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,042
Now where are you going?

178
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,627
Haddonfield.

179
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,668
It's a four hour drive.

180
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,131
You can reach me through the local police.

181
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:11,133
If you don't find him in four hours ...

182
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:13,178
I'm sure I will.

183
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,943
Hey Gar. How 'bout a 9/16 socket over here?

184
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,940
Hey! Hey there!

185
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,107
Hello!

186
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,405
Hello?

187
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,617
Hello?

188
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,286
Is anybody here?

189
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,207
Hello?

190
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:04,588
Hello!

191
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,031
Is anybody here?

192
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,258
God in heaven.

193
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:07,864
Michael?

194
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:15,164
Why now?

195
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:21,087
You waited ten years.

196
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,966
I knew this day would come.

197
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:27,301
Don't go to Haddonfield.

198
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,224
If you want another victim, take me.

199
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,896
But leave those people in peace.

200
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,317
Please ...

201
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,611
Michael.

202
00:21:45,155 --> 00:21:46,698
Goddamn you.

203
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,058
Michael!

204
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,103
Hey Jamie!
Where's your costume?

205
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:57,566
Where's your mask? Or are you wearing it?
- I don't need to wear a stupid costume!

206
00:22:57,691 --> 00:23:02,738
That's because every day is Halloween at Jamie's house.
Right, Jamie? - 'Cause your uncle's the boogeyman.

207
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:07,160
Boogeyman! Boogeyman!
Jamie's uncle's the boogeyman!

208
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:12,290
How come your mommy
didn't make you a costume, Jamie?
- How could she? Her mommy's dead.

209
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:14,626
Jamie's mommy's ... a mummy!

210
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,713
Stop it! Okay?
Stop it!

211
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:23,302
Jamie's an orphan! Jamie's an orphan!
- Stop it! Please, stop it!

212
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:27,681
Jamie's an orphan! Jamie's an orphan!

213
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:32,062
Jamie's uncle's the boogeyman!
Jamie's an orphan!

214
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:33,980
Every day is Halloween at Jamie's house.

215
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:38,111
Boogeyman! Boogeyman! Boogeyman!

216
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:42,115
... didn't make you ...?
- How could she? Her mommy's dead.

217
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:50,872
You're okay, you're okay.

218
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,630
Jamie!

219
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,049
Jamie, are you okay?

220
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:10,561
You remember Lindsey, don't you?

221
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:12,355
Hi Jamie.
- Yeah, hi.

222
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,274
You ready for some ice cream?

223
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,154
I wanna go trick-or-treating ...
like the other kids.

224
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,865
But I thought you didn't wanna go trick-or-treating.

225
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:26,829
You know Rach, discount mart's
having a sale on Halloween costumes.

226
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:30,082
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
- I know.

227
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:31,167
Don't you wanna talk to him?

228
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,878
I don't wanna look pushy.
- You won't look pushy.

229
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:35,463
Well, I don't wanna come on too strong.

230
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:39,258
A guy hates a girl that comes on too strong.
Fragile egos, and all of that.

231
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:41,134
You won't come on too strong.

232
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,805
Well, I don't wanna seem desperate or anything.

233
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,183
Face it Rach, you are desperate.

234
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:51,021
You're just gonna go in and buy a costume for Jamie.
Perfectly legit.

235
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:52,564
I don't know.

236
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,150
Well ...

237
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:56,944
Do I drop you at the discount mart or the Dairy Queen?

238
00:24:57,612 --> 00:24:59,029
Jamie?

239
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:03,076
Discount mart.
Can we get an ice cream after?

240
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,287
You bet.

241
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:32,314
Hey, Wade. Why don't you go ahead
and make your move?

242
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:33,902
Don't rush me, Brady.

243
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:35,737
Timing's gotta be premo.

244
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:38,908
Yeah well, money talks and bullshit walks.
You know what I mean?

245
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:41,283
Double or nothing, you don't ask Kelly out.

246
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:44,370
All right. Ten bucks.
Let's see it.

247
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:47,123
He's not gonna do it.

248
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:50,543
Chicken. - Don't forget, man.
She's Sheriff Meeker's daughter.

249
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,298
Her daddy don't scare me.

250
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:04,434
Fuck off, Wade.

251
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,357
Hey, maybe you can come over right now.

252
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:12,985
Oh, cool!

253
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,918
Call me.
- Okay. Bye.

254
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:32,546
Rachel?

255
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,884
What are you doing here?
I thought I was supposed to pick you up.

256
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:37,260
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
- You do?

257
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:40,555
Okay. Go down to aisle A.
We've got the best costumes in the whole town.

258
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:42,766
Come on, Rachel.
- In a second.

259
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:44,852
We need to talk.

260
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,103
Okay, sure. What about?

261
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:48,647
About tonight.

262
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,069
Rachel! I found the perfect costume.
Come see.

263
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:40,161
What?

264
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:44,082
My parents' baby-sitter's cancelled.
- So?

265
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,626
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.

266
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:50,131
When did you find this out?

267
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,507
This morning.
- You found this morning?

268
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:55,552
Why didn't you tell me before?
I mean it's 5 o'clock now, Rachel ... shit.

269
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:59,515
Don't get angry.
- I'm not angry. It's just ...

270
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:05,354
Can I come over after Jamie goes to sleep?

271
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:07,816
My parents are gonna come home early tonight.

272
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:08,943
So?

273
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,071
I don't know, Brady.

274
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:14,907
Okay.

275
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:16,826
I guess, I'll call you later.

276
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,488
Jamie, what happened?

277
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:55,698
It was the nightmare man.

278
00:28:55,823 --> 00:28:56,576
What?

279
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,414
He's come to get me, Rachel.
- You're okay.

280
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,833
You probably saw a mask and it scared you.

281
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,793
At least you're not cut.

282
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,212
Come on. Let's go home.

283
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:07,629
You gonna be okay?

284
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:09,007
She'll be fine

285
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:48,298
Come on, old man.
Let's go!

286
00:29:48,423 --> 00:29:53,097
Come on! Come on!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

287
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:08,321
Get it in here, old man.

288
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:12,950
I ain't got till Judgment Day!

289
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,042
Thank you.

290
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,463
Anything for a fellow pilgrim.

291
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:27,841
We're all on a quest.
Sometimes we need help getting where we wanna be.

292
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:33,389
Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumont county.

293
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:35,306
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

294
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:37,266
How far you're going, Mr. Sayer?

295
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:39,896
God's country, Promised Land.

296
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:42,357
Where you heading, Mr. ... ah

297
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:43,943
Loomis.

298
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,902
Haddonfield.

299
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:47,486
Car trouble?

300
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:49,990
Sort of.

301
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:55,078
You're hunting it, ain't ya?

302
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:57,580
Yeah, you're hunting it, all right.

303
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,000
Just like me.

304
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:01,586
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?

305
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:05,380
Apocalypse, end of the world. Armageddon.

306
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:07,926
It's always got a face and a name.

307
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,142
I've been hunting the bastard for 30 years, give or take.

308
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:16,184
Come close a time or two.

309
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:18,520
Too damn close!

310
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,152
You can't kill damnation, mister.

311
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:27,488
It don't die like a man dies.

312
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:30,492
I know that, Mr. Sayer.

313
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:34,413
Oh, you're a pilgrim, all right!

314
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:37,123
I saw it on your face
back there in the dust.

315
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:41,837
I saw it clear as breasts and blue suede shoes.
Would you like a drink?

316
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:49,387
* Yes, we'll gather at the river *

317
00:31:49,512 --> 00:31:54,476
* The beautiful, beautiful river *

318
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:58,980
* Gather with the saints at the river *

319
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,587
Okay Jamie, we're leaving.

320
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:22,382
Where's Rach?
- I don't know.

321
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,551
Here I am.

322
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:24,676
Come on, hon.

323
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:26,594
How do we look?

324
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,929
You guys always look great.

325
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:30,223
We'll be at the Fallbrooks.

326
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:36,103
The number's next to the phone. I know, and next to that
is Police, hospital, fire and probably the National Guard.

327
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:39,232
I want you two to have fun tonight.
Make sure Jamie's in bed by 9:30.

328
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,359
You're gonna be late.
You don't wanna blow your promotion.

329
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:45,281
Don't make fun. Tonight is the difference
between vacations in Bermuda ...

330
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:48,492
... or spending another two weeks
with your grandmother in Cleveland. So hurry up.

331
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:49,200
Bye.

332
00:32:49,326 --> 00:32:51,161
See ya.
- Good luck, dad.

333
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,418
Rachel?... Can I get my costume on?
- Yeah. Hurry up.

334
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:57,418
Okay.

335
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:16,064
Is Brady there?

336
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:18,482
He's not back from work yet?

337
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:20,359
Okay.

338
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:24,532
Well, when he comes in, could you tell him
to drop by about eight? I should be home by then.

339
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,242
This is Rachel.

340
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:27,367
Okay.

341
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,534
Bye.

342
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:34,166
Come on, Jamie.
You're gonna miss all the good candy.

343
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,172
Come on, Jamie!

344
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:51,017
Come on, Rachel!

345
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:52,102
Coming.

346
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:54,646
I thought you said you were ready.
- I'm ready! I'm ready!

347
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,398
Okay, let's go.

348
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:41,780
Ah, I need to speak with Sheriff Brackett.

349
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:46,911
Then you'll have to travel
about 3,000 miles south of here.

350
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:47,786
What?

351
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:50,038
Brackett retired. Back in '81.

352
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:51,999
He moved to St. Petersburg.

353
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:55,212
Oh, Well, who's the new Sheriff?
- I am.

354
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:56,922
Ben Meeker.

355
00:34:57,131 --> 00:35:00,884
Oh, Sheriff Meeker ...
my name is Dr. ...
- Loomis.

356
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:03,763
Folks around here aren't
likely to forget your face.

357
00:35:04,222 --> 00:35:05,765
At least not cops.

358
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,725
So, what brings you back here after ten years?

359
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:12,439
Michael Myers ... has escaped from Ridgemont.
He's here in Haddonfield.

360
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:17,777
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
- He's here, Sheriff.

361
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:19,570
Why?

362
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:21,281
Ten years ago ...

363
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:24,035
He tried to kill Laurie Strode.

364
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,663
Now he wants her daughter.

365
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,248
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
- Wherever she is, that little child is in mortal danger.

366
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:39,633
Myers has been locked up since before she was born.
He's never laid eyes on her.

367
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:44,306
Six bodies ... Sheriff! That's what I've seen
between here and Ridgemont.

368
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:46,810
A filling station in flames!

369
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:50,312
I tell you, Michael Myers is here in this town!

370
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:54,359
He's here to kill that little girl
and anybody who gets in his way.

371
00:35:57,236 --> 00:36:00,281
All right, Pierce, call the troopers and check his story out.

372
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:05,704
And assuming what you say is true.
- It's true, Sheriff! - All right, all right. It's true.

373
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:08,833
What the hell can we do
to avoid a repeat of ten years ago?

374
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:10,042
Find this little girl.

375
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,045
Get her someplace safe.
Call the local TV station.

376
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,381
Tell them to get people off the streets
and behind locked doors.

377
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,259
Can't get long distance, Sheriff.

378
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,220
Operator says the lines are down.

379
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,392
All right, let's go.

380
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,186
When he makes that call ...

381
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,270
All right, Pierce, do it.

382
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,480
Let's check on this little girl.

383
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,318
Thanks.

384
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:39,741
Jamie, wait for me.
- This is great, Rachel. Come on!

385
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:54,297
Trick-or-treat.
- Oh, my, what a scary little clown.

386
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,549
Let's see what I have for you.
There you are, sweetheart.

387
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:59,053
Thank you.
- You're welcome, honey.

388
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:04,518
Had enough? - No way. Halloween's great.
Can we stay out all night?

389
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:06,644
Forget it, kiddo.
We're home by eight o'clock.

390
00:37:16,572 --> 00:37:19,366
That clown costume is really cool!
- Really?

391
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:20,325
Yeah.

392
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,827
Hey, you wanna go with us?

393
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:25,539
Go ahead.

394
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:26,333
Come on.

395
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,044
Come on, come on. Let's go up there.

396
00:37:28,169 --> 00:37:30,253
Come on. Let's go!

397
00:37:36,176 --> 00:37:38,970
Trick-or-treat!

398
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:40,514
Hi Rachel.

399
00:37:41,098 --> 00:37:41,932
Hi.

400
00:37:43,183 --> 00:37:45,187
Here you go, you little monster.

401
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,856
Thank you.
- You little clown. - Thank you.

402
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:51,358
There you go.
- Thank you. Trick-or-treat.

403
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:53,445
Bye.

404
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,737
Rachel!

405
00:37:58,952 --> 00:38:01,287
Rachel! - Brady!
- Just a second.

406
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:06,250
Rachel ... I got an expla ... Rachel I ...

407
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:10,296
I got an explanation.
- You don't owe me anything, Brady. No explanation.

408
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,089
Will you just hold on a second?

409
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:14,758
Just leave me alone and let's forget it.

410
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:16,511
No, you don't understand.

411
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,974
I mean you blew off our date at the last minute.
- So you hop onto the next best thing?

412
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,521
I thought you were different from other guys.
- I'm different. It's just that ...

413
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:30,360
I just got pissed off ... that's all.
- Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back
to little Ms. Hot Panties.

414
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:32,237
Rachel!
- Jamie?

415
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:36,032
Brady?

416
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:39,868
Are you coming in or what?

417
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:51,883
Jamie!

418
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:55,636
Jamie!

419
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,809
Great, Rachel ... just great.

420
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:06,898
By order of the Sheriff's Office, all citizens of Haddonfield
are asked to clear the streets.

421
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:09,528
I made that payment nine days ago
and still have nothing ...
- You were right.

422
00:39:10,403 --> 00:39:12,447
Everybody, shut up a Goddamn minute!

423
00:39:12,696 --> 00:39:13,781
Shut up!
All businesses are asked to close as soon as possible.

424
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:19,495
What's that shit about, Earl?
Stay tuned to the station for updates.

425
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,997
Not like ol' Ben Meeker do something like that.

426
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:23,290
Sure ain't.

427
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:27,796
Martians could land on Ben's doorstep
and all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shotgun.

428
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,424
Who are you calling?
- Police station.

429
00:39:30,548 --> 00:39:33,008
Ain't closing down without a good Goddamn reason.

430
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:36,638
Well?

431
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,435
Just rings.

432
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:51,321
Well, come on!

433
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:56,619
Jackie, watch the register for me, hon.
- You got it, Earl.

434
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:57,827
What's going down?

435
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,747
Where are we going, Earl?
- We're going to Ben's.

436
00:39:59,873 --> 00:40:04,334
The phone never just rings at a Police station,
no way, no how.
- Wake up the Sheriff.

437
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:07,714
Load it up. Come on, come on.

438
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:56,558
Something?

439
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:59,060
He's been here.
- How do you know?

440
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:06,026
This is starting to spook me, doc.

441
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:07,987
At least I'm not alone.

442
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,162
Logan ... I want you to stay here
in case the family gets back. - Right here, Ben.

443
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:19,290
You look sharp. You understand?
- No problem, Sheriff.

444
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:40,354
Hey, you!

445
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:41,732
This is city property.

446
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,735
No trespassing.

447
00:41:46,194 --> 00:41:47,653
What are you, deaf?

448
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,492
Don't try that Halloween shit with me.

449
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:57,248
All right, I'm on the telephone to the Police right now.

450
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:00,167
Don't you even think about leaving.

451
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:49,094
Yeah! That was a fun!

452
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:57,354
Come on, kids, we're going in the car right now.

453
00:43:00,523 --> 00:43:02,568
Come on. I said move in, get in there.

454
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:06,196
Jamie!

455
00:43:24,174 --> 00:43:25,468
Jamie!

456
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,376
Rachel, is that you?

457
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:58,837
Is that you?

458
00:44:07,303 --> 00:44:08,428
Jamie?

459
00:44:10,432 --> 00:44:11,642
Jamie?

460
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:21,402
Jamie?

461
00:44:27,993 --> 00:44:29,035
Jamie?

462
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:57,983
Oh, God!

463
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:09,328
Jamie.

464
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,598
Whoever you are ...

465
00:45:27,723 --> 00:45:30,476
I have a big dog with me and he bites!

466
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,359
Jamie!

467
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:39,904
Where have you been?

468
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:43,490
Don't ever go off on your own at night again.
Okay? Not ever.

469
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:57,257
Rachel, Jamie, thank God!
- What's going on? - Get in the car.

470
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:58,799
Come on, quick.

471
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,773
Is that him?

472
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:14,567
Is that him!?

473
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:15,901
Yes.

474
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:19,445
Loomis.

475
00:46:25,995 --> 00:46:27,455
Oh, Christ. Doc.

476
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:31,709
Dear God.

477
00:46:37,382 --> 00:46:38,716
Hey, don't shoot!

478
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,929
Oh, that was great!
You thought it was me, didn't you?

479
00:46:43,054 --> 00:46:46,142
Sheriff!
- Get home, damn it!

480
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:47,476
There's a curfew!

481
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:50,146
I catch your ass, it'll be a weekend in jail!

482
00:46:51,313 --> 00:46:52,772
You all right, doc?

483
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:56,653
Come on. We'll get to the station.
We'll get these kids safe.

484
00:46:58,488 --> 00:46:59,406
It's okay.

485
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:04,285
Station, this is 132.
come in, pierce.

486
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:05,705
Come in, Pierce.

487
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:08,248
Come in, Pierce.

488
00:47:18,552 --> 00:47:20,345
Oh, Christ!

489
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:25,559
Wouldn't have given up without a fight.

490
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:28,645
They didn't know, what they were fighting.

491
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:54,716
How can a man do this, Loomis?
Tell me.

492
00:47:55,132 --> 00:47:56,675
It isn't a man.

493
00:47:58,052 --> 00:47:59,512
What is he?

494
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:01,263
Tell me!

495
00:48:01,388 --> 00:48:03,348
What the hell are we dealing with?

496
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:04,559
Evil.

497
00:48:23,287 --> 00:48:24,872
What the Sam Hill is going on?

498
00:48:24,997 --> 00:48:29,002
Go on home, Earl. This is Police business.
- What the hell did this?

499
00:48:29,419 --> 00:48:31,671
Looks like to me you're out of business.
Now I want some answers.

500
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:35,843
I haven't got the time or the patience to argue with you.
Now go home to your families where you belong.

501
00:48:38,554 --> 00:48:43,016
It was Michael Myers.
He's come home to kill.

502
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:45,395
Let it be, Earl.

503
00:48:45,644 --> 00:48:47,521
Let the Police handle it.

504
00:48:48,022 --> 00:48:49,649
Like the last time?

505
00:48:50,024 --> 00:48:52,442
How many people killed back then?
How many kids?

506
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:54,987
Al here, lost his boy ten years back.

507
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:58,451
Well not this time, Ben.
I'll handle this my own way.

508
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,328
We're gonna fry his ass.

509
00:49:03,664 --> 00:49:09,128
You son of a bitch! You just created a lynch mob.
- You haven't got a Police force!

510
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,505
These men may be the only defense you've got.

511
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:15,427
Ok, let's move it up.
- Come on guys, let's go.

512
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,848
Let's hunt this bastard!
- God help us.

513
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:35,614
132, 132, this is 134, over.

514
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,620
This is 132, over.
- Ben - uh ...

515
00:49:39,953 --> 00:49:41,912
I just heard about the station.

516
00:49:42,288 --> 00:49:47,002
Now you go over to my house
and we'll call the state boys from there.
- I'll be there in five minutes.

517
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:10,778
Honey, I don't think they're home.
- How do you know they are not home?

518
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:12,321
'Cause the lights are all out.

519
00:50:12,445 --> 00:50:15,407
I told them to be here by 9:30. It's not 9:30 yet.
- Come on, let's call the Carters.

520
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:17,159
Come on, come on.
- You call the Carters.

521
00:50:17,285 --> 00:50:19,412
Kids?
Rachel? Jamie?

522
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:29,840
There he is!

523
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:36,681
I've seen his face.

524
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:38,433
Right there, Al

525
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:41,144
Right there in the bushes.

526
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,139
Come on.

527
00:51:25,399 --> 00:51:26,943
Shit, Earl!

528
00:51:27,068 --> 00:51:28,820
It's Ted Hollister.

529
00:51:31,448 --> 00:51:33,574
You dumb son of a bitch.

530
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:35,993
You said, you saw Myers.

531
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:52,053
Let's go upstairs.
- Huh?

532
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,055
No.

533
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:55,473
I think we're doing just fine right here.

534
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:07,820
Oh, I think I'm in heaven!

535
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:37,225
Oh, Brady. Oh, Brady.

536
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:44,902
Oh, shit.

537
00:52:45,569 --> 00:52:48,405
Oh, it's my dad!
- Your dad? Your dad!

538
00:52:57,081 --> 00:52:59,418
God, if he catches us like this ...

539
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,669
... he's gonna skin you alive ...

540
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:03,004
What? - ... for starters.

541
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:04,298
Oh, no.

542
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,676
Come on!
- I'm going. I'm going.

543
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:11,139
Where's that deputy?
- He'll be here in a minute.

544
00:53:25,528 --> 00:53:28,447
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.

545
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,617
Dad, what's going on?

546
00:53:30,742 --> 00:53:34,706
Kelly, I want you to close
and lock all the downstairs windows.
- Why? - Just do it!

547
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:39,209
Where's the radio?
- Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.

548
00:53:40,628 --> 00:53:42,045
Brady, you know how to use a gun?

549
00:53:42,171 --> 00:53:43,589
Yes, sir.

550
00:53:47,218 --> 00:53:49,930
Think you can handle that?
- Um, yeah. You wanna tell me what's happening?

551
00:53:50,055 --> 00:53:53,766
Yeah, when I have time. You got your riot gun?
- In the trunk of my squad. - Go get it.

552
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:57,354
Take these.

553
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:03,904
Okay, you got a hammer ... and roofing nails.
And I want you up in the attic securing it,
so nobody can get in.

554
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:08,408
You know, if something's happening,
I should just go call my parents.
- Just get up in the attic.

555
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:09,909
Oh yeah.

556
00:54:10,034 --> 00:54:11,786
I catch you groping my daughter ...

557
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:13,830
I'll use that shotgun on you.

558
00:54:13,956 --> 00:54:15,415
You understand?

559
00:54:42,987 --> 00:54:45,239
Now get the outside shutters.
- What are we doing?

560
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:47,658
Making sure that no one can get in here.

561
00:54:48,492 --> 00:54:50,285
Isn't all this a little paranoid?

562
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,041
If you'd seen that Police station,
you wouldn't even ask.

563
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,840
You two okay?

564
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,759
We've been better.

565
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,054
What's going on?

566
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,847
Michael Myers.

567
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,140
Who's that?

568
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:11,892
Ten years ago ...

569
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,351
Halloween.

570
00:55:14,438 --> 00:55:16,273
He's Jamie's uncle.

571
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:19,484
The kids at school were right.

572
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,782
I'm gonna be outside ...
upstairs in the attic.

573
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:26,473
That's all the windows, dad.

574
00:56:26,598 --> 00:56:30,060
All right. Good, good.
Logan, I want you right here by the front door, ok?

575
00:56:30,185 --> 00:56:32,062
This is the dead bolt key.

576
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,776
All right,

577
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:38,109
We're secure.

578
00:56:38,652 --> 00:56:42,657
I now padlocked the back door.
This is the only way in and out of this house.

579
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:45,618
You got that?
- You got it, Ben.

580
00:56:45,911 --> 00:56:48,955
I want you to go make us some coffee.
- All right.

581
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:54,002
Ah, shit!

582
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:09,311
Hello?

583
00:57:14,524 --> 00:57:15,483
Who's there?

584
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:31,000
Can we go home soon, Rachel?

585
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,795
Real soon, Jamie.

586
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,838
Now, shh.

587
00:57:37,465 --> 00:57:38,342
How's it powered?

588
00:57:38,675 --> 00:57:43,138
Batteries. I'd planned a generator
for the house next week. I wish I hadn't waited.

589
00:57:44,473 --> 00:57:51,146
This is squawk 79-o-zero Haddonfield broadcasting
on a State Police emergency frequency.
Can anyone hear me?

590
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,775
Can anyone hear me?

591
00:57:55,485 --> 00:57:56,402
Damn it!

592
00:59:20,242 --> 00:59:21,534
Everything all right?

593
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,244
Jamie's sleeping.

594
00:59:24,038 --> 00:59:25,499
When can we go home?

595
00:59:25,623 --> 00:59:27,584
State Police will be here soon.

596
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:29,378
Not long after that.

597
00:59:30,422 --> 00:59:31,463
Don't worry.

598
00:59:32,422 --> 00:59:33,924
I'm trying.

599
00:59:35,925 --> 00:59:37,427
It won't be long.

600
00:59:47,938 --> 00:59:48,941
I hear someone.

601
00:59:49,066 --> 00:59:52,734
Hello, this is Frank Bute over in Tuckerville.
You got some kind of emergency? Over.

602
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,072
Thank Christ. This is Ben Meeker,
Sheriff over in Haddonfield.

603
00:59:56,197 --> 01:00:00,161
Our phone and power lines are down
and we have a killer running loose in the street.

604
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:03,872
Michael Myers.
- Is this some kind of Halloween prank?

605
01:00:04,623 --> 01:00:05,833
This is no joke.

606
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:08,044
We need those troopers and we need 'em now.

607
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:10,672
All right, I'll get the troopers right away.

608
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,260
Hang on. I'll need some information.
- We're not going anywhere, Mr. Bute.

609
01:00:24,895 --> 01:00:25,855
Rachel ...

610
01:00:26,605 --> 01:00:28,190
... is your sister all right?

611
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,151
She's fine.

612
01:00:31,569 --> 01:00:32,695
Good.

613
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:38,118
Sheriff's radioed for help. They'll be here soon.

614
01:00:38,326 --> 01:00:39,828
Hell of a night.

615
01:00:40,286 --> 01:00:41,538
It's not over yet.

616
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,832
Where you going?

617
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:46,794
The Corruthers' house.

618
01:00:46,918 --> 01:00:49,715
That's where Jamie lives. That's where he'll go.

619
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:51,508
Leave Myers for the State boys.

620
01:00:51,634 --> 01:00:54,176
The State Police won't know how to stop him.

621
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:55,260
Do you?

622
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:58,848
It might be nobody knows how to stop him.

623
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,142
But I've got to try.

624
01:01:14,197 --> 01:01:15,949
Are you looking for this?

625
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:26,419
I didn't know you and Brady had anything, okay?

626
01:01:26,544 --> 01:01:27,671
You knew.

627
01:01:28,714 --> 01:01:30,382
You just didn't care!

628
01:01:30,758 --> 01:01:32,591
He's not married.

629
01:01:33,509 --> 01:01:36,180
Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.

630
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:38,725
Don't you mean, what you do best?

631
01:01:43,563 --> 01:01:46,064
Wise up to what men want, Rachel.

632
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,569
Or Brady won't be the last man
you lose to another woman.

633
01:01:54,782 --> 01:01:56,326
Have some coffee.

634
01:01:56,994 --> 01:01:59,956
Over Alan Gateway shot Ted Hallister by mistake.

635
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:02,877
Well, is he dead?
- Yeah, he's dead.

636
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:06,921
Oh, Christ. 04 out there?
This is Ben Meeker.

637
01:02:07,673 --> 01:02:09,466
Answer me, damn it.

638
01:02:09,675 --> 01:02:11,969
Sheriff, what is going on out there?

639
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:15,723
Yeah, I'll swing by with you get my brother John
maybe with couple of buddies over there.

640
01:02:15,848 --> 01:02:17,934
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio.

641
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:20,394
The State boys will send word once they're in route.

642
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:21,728
When that word comes ...

643
01:02:21,853 --> 01:02:23,813
... you go tell deputy Logan.
- Okay.

644
01:02:23,939 --> 01:02:26,150
Now, you understand?
- Uh huh.

645
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:29,655
... pick me up in ten minutes.
We'll find out what's happening.

646
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,577
You know where the hell Earl's at?

647
01:02:35,036 --> 01:02:37,120
No, I haven't heard from him in a while.

648
01:02:37,245 --> 01:02:41,709
I'll get Alan Gateway.
I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
- Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.

649
01:02:41,834 --> 01:02:44,919
Hey, I got a town full of beer bellies
running around in the dark with shotguns.

650
01:02:45,044 --> 01:02:46,630
Who's gonna be next!?

651
01:02:47,172 --> 01:02:48,925
Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?

652
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:52,930
I can't stand by for that.

653
01:03:10,073 --> 01:03:11,199
Rachel?

654
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:53,453
I thought you might like some coffee.

655
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:01,753
It's pretty boring out here.

656
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:08,134
I wish they'd fix the power.

657
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:13,433
At least we'd have some ...
MTV while we wait for the cavalry.

658
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:47,718
Haddonfield, we should have cars
dispatched in five minutes.

659
01:04:47,843 --> 01:04:50,597
ETA 35 minutes. Over.

660
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,311
Uh ... okay.

661
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,394
Great. We'll be waiting.

662
01:04:57,605 --> 01:04:59,482
Ah ten-four. Over.

663
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,861
Uh ... over and out.

664
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:23,508
Deputy Logan.

665
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:29,180
Deputy?

666
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:49,368
Jamie!

667
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:52,623
Oh, God.

668
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:58,004
Oh, God.

669
01:06:03,717 --> 01:06:04,969
What's going on?

670
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:08,305
I've gotta find Jamie.
- No, no. What we've gotta do is get out of here ...

671
01:06:08,429 --> 01:06:10,933
... right now.
- Not without Jamie! - Look!

672
01:06:12,143 --> 01:06:15,272
Do you think she stands a chance?
- She's not dead! - No.

673
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:22,112
Is there another key?
- I don't know!

674
01:06:22,237 --> 01:06:23,905
Get out of the way, get out of the way.

675
01:06:27,242 --> 01:06:29,036
It's metal! Goddammit, it's metal!

676
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,745
What does that mean?

677
01:06:31,707 --> 01:06:33,166
We're trapped in this house.

678
01:06:38,337 --> 01:06:41,340
Jamie!
- Oh, Rachel!

679
01:06:43,009 --> 01:06:43,845
Rachel ...

680
01:06:46,764 --> 01:06:47,848
Brady!

681
01:06:47,973 --> 01:06:48,891
Get back!

682
01:06:50,643 --> 01:06:52,478
Brady!
- No.

683
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:57,024
Son of a bitch!
Shit!

684
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,526
Brady, come with us!
- Go!

685
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:01,237
Brady!

686
01:07:01,738 --> 01:07:03,657
Get up there, Rachel!

687
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:05,535
Shit!

688
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:07,119
Brady!

689
01:07:07,245 --> 01:07:08,578
Get up there, Rachel!

690
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:11,122
Brady, come with us!
- Go! - No, Brady!

691
01:07:16,046 --> 01:07:17,213
Go!

692
01:07:19,048 --> 01:07:19,840
Shit.

693
01:07:24,804 --> 01:07:27,973
Rachel, come on! Come on!
- No! I wanna help!

694
01:07:40,947 --> 01:07:42,365
Brady!
- Rachel, come on!

695
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:11,228
Leave us alone!
God, leave us alone!

696
01:08:15,234 --> 01:08:16,276
Jamie!

697
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:34,796
Go! Go!

698
01:08:43,723 --> 01:08:44,848
Rachel!

699
01:08:52,814 --> 01:08:54,277
Jamie, get down.

700
01:08:54,735 --> 01:08:55,903
Get down!

701
01:09:01,491 --> 01:09:02,867
Get on my back, Jamie!
Hold on.

702
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:03,910
Get on.

703
01:09:04,078 --> 01:09:04,912
Hold on.

704
01:09:19,511 --> 01:09:20,428
Hold on ...

705
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,794
Grab on, Jamie.

706
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:53,630
Grab on.

707
01:10:28,252 --> 01:10:32,172
I want you to get down to the chimney, Jamie.
- I can't! - Well, try. Damn it!

708
01:10:34,591 --> 01:10:35,760
Rachel!

709
01:10:50,483 --> 01:10:52,317
I'm gonna lower you down, Jamie.

710
01:10:52,443 --> 01:10:53,444
Okay?

711
01:10:53,569 --> 01:10:55,740
Rachel?
- I've got you. Come on.

712
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,033
Go down now.

713
01:10:57,324 --> 01:10:59,328
Rachel.
- I've got you, Jamie.

714
01:11:04,748 --> 01:11:06,500
I've got you, I've got you!

715
01:11:38,244 --> 01:11:43,707
Oh, come alive, Rachel! Please, come alive!
Don't be dead! You can't be dead!

716
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,627
Come alive, Rachel!

717
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,398
Help!

718
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:08,693
Somebody help me!

719
01:12:08,818 --> 01:12:10,736
Please!

720
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:12,570
Help me!

721
01:12:12,863 --> 01:12:14,322
Please!

722
01:12:14,447 --> 01:12:15,908
Help me!

723
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:19,120
Please!
Somebody help me!

724
01:12:48,109 --> 01:12:53,322
What are you doing out here alone?
- Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home!
- No. No, you can't.

725
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:56,535
I've just been there.
That's the first place he'll look for you.

726
01:12:56,951 --> 01:12:58,997
Where's the schoolhouse?

727
01:12:59,498 --> 01:13:01,041
The schoolhouse.

728
01:13:01,499 --> 01:13:05,211
Where's the schoolhouse?
- It's over there. - Come on.

729
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:09,382
Come.
We'll be safe there.

730
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:29,070
Here.

731
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,587
We'll hear some sirens soon.

732
01:13:45,795 --> 01:13:48,759
Then we'll be safe?
- Yes.

733
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,386
You don't believe that, do you?

734
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,138
No.

735
01:14:05,026 --> 01:14:05,984
No.

736
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:10,407
No!
Oh, please!

737
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,118
Somebody help me!

738
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,118
No!

739
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:39,167
In the school!
Pull over, Earl.

740
01:15:48,178 --> 01:15:50,681
What's going on here? We heard the alarm.
- He's inside!

741
01:15:50,805 --> 01:15:53,016
Jesus. Where?
- In the school!

742
01:15:58,021 --> 01:15:59,606
Let's get this bastard!

743
01:15:59,732 --> 01:16:00,901
No!

744
01:16:01,066 --> 01:16:02,444
He'll kill you too.

745
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:05,488
We have to get out of Haddonfield
the State Police are on their way. Let them handle it.

746
01:16:05,613 --> 01:16:08,951
I don't know about you Earl, but that makes sense to me.
Let's get the hell out!

747
01:16:09,076 --> 01:16:12,829
He's not our patient. Let the troopers have it.
That's what they get paid for.

748
01:16:13,163 --> 01:16:16,040
Screw it. Let's get out of here.
Al.

749
01:16:48,575 --> 01:16:50,036
Okay, everybody, listen up.

750
01:16:50,161 --> 01:16:52,832
I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck.

751
01:16:52,957 --> 01:16:54,124
I'm taking them out of town ...

752
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:57,502
... route 410. State Police are on the way.

753
01:16:58,169 --> 01:17:00,131
You got that?
- Got it, Earl.
- Okay, out.

754
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,189
There's the cavalry.

755
01:17:32,999 --> 01:17:37,044
Coming out of Haddonfield?
- Yeah. Myers is in the elementary school.
We're taking these kids to safety.

756
01:17:37,169 --> 01:17:40,298
Okay, there's a highway patrol substation
about four miles down the highway.

757
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:41,801
You'll see the turnoff signs.

758
01:17:41,926 --> 01:17:44,721
There we've got officers on duty.
They'll take care of you.

759
01:17:44,846 --> 01:17:45,680
Thanks.

760
01:17:55,148 --> 01:17:56,231
It's gonna be okay.

761
01:19:48,103 --> 01:19:49,062
Jamie!

762
01:20:26,852 --> 01:20:27,645
Die ...

763
01:20:27,937 --> 01:20:31,231
you ... son of a bitch!

764
01:21:07,605 --> 01:21:10,233
Jamie, I want you to stay right here in the truck!

765
01:21:21,827 --> 01:21:25,249
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
- Calm down, calm down. Are you all right?

766
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:28,085
Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. - Where's Jamie?

767
01:21:34,549 --> 01:21:35,509
Jamie!

768
01:21:35,926 --> 01:21:38,387
Get away!
- Don't touch him, Jamie!

769
01:21:45,854 --> 01:21:47,147
Get down!

770
01:22:37,492 --> 01:22:38,619
Oh, babies!

771
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:49,673
It's over.
- Yes.

772
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,967
Michael Myers is in hell ...

773
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:54,218
buried ...

774
01:22:54,343 --> 01:22:55,803
Where he belongs.

775
01:22:57,638 --> 01:22:59,891
These kids aren't likely to forget.

776
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:02,226
They've survived this ordeal,

777
01:23:03,143 --> 01:23:05,314
they'll survive it's memory.

778
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,025
I'm going to take Jamie upstairs.

779
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,612
Stay with Rachel.

780
01:23:10,738 --> 01:23:11,821
Come on, honey.

781
01:24:14,179 --> 01:24:16,056
No.

782
01:24:16,557 --> 01:24:18,017
No!

783
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:20,103
No!

784
01:24:20,853 --> 01:24:30,949
No! No! No! No!
No! No!

785
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,540
No.

786
