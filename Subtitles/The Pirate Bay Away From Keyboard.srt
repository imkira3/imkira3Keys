3
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,400
Three Swedes were arrested today
suspected of running-

4
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,400
-one of the world's biggest websites
for illegal downloading...

5
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,040
Good evening. The US government
threatened with trade sanctions-

6
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,560
-unless file sharing sites, like
the Pirate Bay, are shut down.

7
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,800
Illegal downloading has upset
big organizations in Hollywood...

8
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,160
The motion picture studios lost

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,080
The White House forced the
Swedish government to intervene.

10
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,239
We applaud the Swedish authorities.
It was an important site to stop.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
The police website was attacked
on Friday-

12
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,200
-and last night
the government website.

13
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,640
The trial against the founders of
the Pirate Bay begins tomorrow.

14
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,280
Today they met the press.

15
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,640
What will happen to the Pirate Bay
if you're found guilty?

16
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,280
Nothing.

17
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,360
What are they going to do about it?
They've failed shutting it down once.

18
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,680
They're welcome
to come and fail again.

19
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,040
It's not the Pirate Bay
that's going to court tomorrow.

20
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,840
It is about getting us
who are connected to the Pirate Bay-

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,840
-into a political trial.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,959
The trial tomorrow is not
about the law, it's about politics.

23
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,879
Half of all BitTorrent traffic
is coordinated by the Pirate Bay.

24
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,080
It's extreme amounts of traffic.

25
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,680
There are 22-25 million users
at this very moment.

26
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,200
A user is defined
as one ongoing upload or download.

27
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
Any questions? Please.

28
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,320
Where is Fredrik?

29
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,320
Where is Fredrik?

30
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,760
We don't know.

31
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,320
He was supposed to be here
but he's probably hungover.

32
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,520
The first question: Where is Fredrik?

33
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,879
I said that Fredrik likes to party.

34
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,800
I didn't want to lie and tell them
I knew where he was.

35
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,720
I tried to get hold of Fredrik
all day yesterday.

36
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:39,879
I called him a couple of times
and finally he answered.

37
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,040
He says: "Do you know where I am?"

38
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,920
I go: "No."
"I'm at Arlanda Airport."

39
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,280
"Why is that?"
"I'm leaving."

40
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,879
What?

41
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,439
He said that he had bought a ticket-

42
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,600
-to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. What
a great name for an escape plan.

43
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:12,239
So his plan was to head home
to his girlfriend in Laos.

44
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,520
Live with her and not give a shit
about anything.

45
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,000
Then suddenly he texted me:

46
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,600
"I think it's the Security Service.
The plane is broken."

47
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,320
"So where are you now?"
"On my way back to the hotel."

48
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,720
Phew!

49
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,080
The interest for the file-sharing
trial in Stockholm is massive.

50
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,600
You can't seriously think
that you can stop our world-

51
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,000
-our everyday, our reality.

52
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,600
This is so gay.

53
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,640
Monique Wadsted.

54
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,720
I also represent
the gaming industry. But not music.

55
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,160
We have the biggest damage claim.

56
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,920
I represent some of the
big film studios in Hollywood.

57
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,000
Warner Bros., Columbia,
20th Century Fox and MGM.

58
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,040
We're demanding compensations
of $13 million.

59
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,200
It might seem insanely high.

60
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,479
That should be seen as an indicator
of how big this business is.

61
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,280
Because this is about
5 movies during 6 months.

62
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,920
"The Pink Panther", "Syriana",
one "Harry Potter"-

63
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,320
-"Prison Break" and "Walk The Line".

64
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,119
There is no doubt about
what they have done.

65
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,879
They have run a commercial
business and making a profit.

66
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,239
The penalty for this type
of activity is prison.

67
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,520
Not fines.

68
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,239
Fredrik would like to tell his
version before the prosecutor starts.

69
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,160
Is that accepted by the prosecutor?
You may begin, Fredrik Neij.

70
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:49,280
I want to start by saying that I have
a great interest in computers and IT.

71
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,400
And especially for internet
and networks.

72
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,600
And that I... Well...

73
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,160
...I've lost my train of thought.

74
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,200
You forgot what you were saying.
You had a long interest in IT.

75
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,520
I got involved in the Pirate Bay
because of my interest in IT.

76
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,800
I think it's great fun
to work with technology.

77
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,680
For me, the Pirate Bay
is a technical challenge.

78
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,000
To run such a large website
and such a large tracker technically.

79
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:41,680
Play with computers that I could
never afford to play with on my own.

80
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,040
First I want to ask you...

81
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,000
The media often describes you
as a computer genius.

82
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,920
How would you describe
your competence yourself?

83
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,760
I do have a certain
technical competence, yes.

84
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,680
What does "a certain" mean,
compared to others?

85
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:11,280
I'm not sure this is the right time,
place or medium to post my CV.

86
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:15,800
But I am asking you.
Please answer politely.

87
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,200
I decline to answer that question.
It's too much of an estimation.

88
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,239
-It's what?
-Too hard to estimate.

89
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,560
-Too hard to estimate?
- It's a very difficult question.

90
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
How did you meet
Fredrik and Gottfrid?

91
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,360
I don't remember, but I assume
it was in a chat room on the internet.

92
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,840
When was the first time
you met IRL?

93
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,520
We don't use the expression IRL.
We say AFK. But that's another issue.

94
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,360
I don't remember that either.

95
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,600
Got to know each other IRL?
What is that?

96
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,680
In Real Life.

97
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,520
We don't like that expression.
We say AFK - Away From Keyboard.

98
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,119
We think that the internet
is for real.

99
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,119
This is what our office looks like.

100
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,600
Is this inside the Pirate Bay?

101
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,680
Yes. Here are some of
the people working on it.

102
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,439
-Are they working on it now?
-Yes.

103
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,280
Where are they based? In Sweden?

104
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:37,920
Let's see. USA, USA,
USA or England, England.

105
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,680
Finland, I think.

106
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,720
The Pirate Bay.

107
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,200
This is the web server.
Data base and search function.

108
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,239
The trackers are over there.

109
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,760
This little piece is the tracker.
It's the world's biggest tracker.

110
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,720
It coordinates 50%
of the world's BitTorrent traffic.

111
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,160
Not so many computers,
but powerful and well-configured.

112
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,479
Half the day has gone.
How did it feel in court?

113
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,680
So far it's been boring.

114
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,080
The prosecutors' strategy is to lie
as much as possible in the most boring possible way -

115
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:02,200
-so you fall asleep in court and become
physically undable to defend yourself.

116
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,640
Some say that you've made a lot of
money by spreading illegal material.

117
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,520
We've probably made a lot of money,
but the site costs a lot, too.

118
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,239
Hi. Okay, we're coming down. Bye.

119
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,239
-Let's eat.
-Okay. Nothing vegetarian.

120
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,040
Aren't you working on the site
we're on trial for while in court?

121
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,080
The pirated Depeche Mode CD
I have in my laptop is even funnier.

122
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,959
He'll open in 5 minutes.

123
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:49,160
How the hell can prosecutor Roswall
mix up megabit and megabyte?

124
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,600
Generally speaking, for storage you use byte and
when you measure speed you use bit.

125
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,200
It all started with Gottfrid's site
"America's Dumbest Soldiers".

126
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,520
It was a site
where you could rate from 1 to 10.

127
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,239
It was American soldiers
who died in the first Iraq war.

128
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,360
Then you could rate
how stupid they were-

129
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,879
-depending on
how silly their deaths were.

130
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,320
Neither the American government nor
anybody else appreciated the site.

131
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:42,840
I had a spare line
which I let him use for the site.

132
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,479
It was from British Telecom.

133
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,280
Someone at the US State Department
called the head of British Telecom.

134
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:57,280
He called the head of the operator
in Sweden where I worked.

135
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:01,640
So the US government ordered us
to remove the site.

136
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,840
We fought them for a long time
before we removed it.

137
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,239
We argued that it was
freedom of speech and parody.

138
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,400
After a while we closed it down,
when it became too much of a fuss.

139
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,600
Two months later Gottfrid needed
more bandwidth for the Pirate Bay.

140
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,920
I still had that line available.
We used it for the Pirate Bay.

141
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,479
Hearing with the defendant Peter
Sunde. The prosecution may begin.

142
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,439
Is it true that among
the Pirate Bay computers-

143
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,800
-you stored one that you owned?

144
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,560
I bought a computer
that I gave to the Pirate Bureau.

145
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,520
What is the Pirate Bureau?

146
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,479
It's an organization
that discusses the internet.

147
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,239
Is copyright and file sharing
discussed on their website?

148
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,760
Probably.

149
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,040
And they are critical to
the way copyright works today?

150
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,680
I'm not sure about that.
People have different views.

151
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,760
What's your opinion?

152
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,160
It's hard to say.

153
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,119
I think it's problematic.

154
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,320
In what way?

155
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:36,879
The fact that we're here today
shows that there is a problem.

156
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,760
First of all, I don't believe-

157
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,400
-that young people today
believe that copyright is wrong.

158
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,400
I think that's a myth.

159
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,000
This Kopimi Sect-

160
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
-has been really good
at promoting it.

161
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,800
It's so fucking beautiful!

162
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:25,200
We've changed it a bit.

163
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,439
So the question
in the newspaper was:

164
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,119
"If the Pirate Bay gets convicted,
won't they become martyrs?"

165
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,040
Monique said:
"No, they don't have any followers."

166
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,000
"However, they do have a small
Kopimi sect following them".

167
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,520
So sweet. That's us!

168
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,680
The Pirate Bureau came into
existence in the summer of 2003.

169
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,320
It was at the same time-

170
00:16:56,479 --> 00:17:01,479
-as the record industry
sued Napster in the US-

171
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,920
-and the medical industry sued South
Africa for copying HIV-medicine.

172
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,520
The name "the Pirate Bureau"
was an easy choice.

173
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,239
It wasn't about
romanticizing pirate stuff-

174
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,320
-with eye patches and stuff.
We've never liked that.

175
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,640
The Anti-Piracy Bureau
already existed-

176
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,959
-we wanted to state that we're
the active part in this conflict.

177
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,439
The Anti-Piracy Bureau
is the reactive part.

178
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,560
This is Henrik Pontén
from the Anti-Piracy Bureau.

179
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,040
We've been tipped off
that you're selling copies.

180
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,920
Wait, don't close the door.
The police will come with a warrant.

181
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,680
They have a built a business based
on other people committing crimes.

182
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,200
They have created an industry with
banners and porn ads to earn revenue.

183
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,720
It was very profitable.

184
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:03,800
You're making your situation worse.

185
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:08,040
-I must be allowed to close the door.
-Come out, then.

186
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,160
If you look at studies
about file sharing-

187
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,959
-they don't do it for the fellowship
or to support the ideology.

188
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,520
It's because it's simple and free.

189
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,320
Then there is a small group
of people who do this...

190
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:29,280
...for reasons they claim
to be freedom of speech.

191
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:33,439
Our policy has always been
that the site is an empty page-

192
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,720
-that is created by the users.
We don't interfere with the content.

193
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,520
Freedom of speech?

194
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,000
I'd prefer the technological
viewpoint, a contact service.

195
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,479
-For communication?
-Yes.

196
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I don't care about the piracy
ideology, copyright or politics.

197
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:05,400
I do this because it's great fun
to run a large site.

198
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Describe the importance of the Pirate Bay.

199
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,680
It democratizes and creates great
conditions for freedom of speech.

200
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,080
What has that to do
with the copyrighted material?

201
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:22,239
The Pirate Bay makes it possible
for individuals to share material.

202
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,320
Even if it's copyrighted?

203
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:28,280
That's a tricky consequence
that I think we have to discuss.

204
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,479
What are you hoping for?

205
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,800
I hope we don't get a monitored,
restricted internet.

206
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,200
That's the biggest issue right now.

207
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,520
The copyright industry
is digging a grave for the internet.

208
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,280
They don't take into account the
public benefits of a free internet.

209
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,200
The problem is that old people
are running the companies.

210
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,320
They know how you made money
before and they don't want to change.

211
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:05,760
They're like the Amish. They don't want electricity.
They know how to make do without electricity.

212
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,600
Roger Wallis,
please come to Court Room 9.

213
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,280
Do you think people who download
movies will go and buy them as well?

214
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:19,200
-If they would buy the movie?
-Yes, get it legally.

215
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,720
Yes, but it depends on the quality.
If people want better quality.

216
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:28,360
Or if the DVD has special features.

217
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,479
You have to increase the value of
the products in order to sell them.

218
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,280
If you want to adjust your
business model to the new world.

219
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:42,720
Thank you. I called your institute
and asked these questions-

220
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:47,320
-because we were unable to
put together your curriculum vitae.

221
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,239
You've stated in court
that you're a professor-

222
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,080
-but your institute calls you
a temporary guest lecturer.

223
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:59,920
-Do you know how to use Google?
-Yes.

224
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,520
Then it's really simple
to find my CV.

225
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,560
-We've moved on from that question.
-I thought so too.

226
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Let's move on.
Thank you, Your Honor.

227
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:16,479
When you were appointed,
were there any competitors?

228
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,400
I thought we had moved on,
Your Honor?

229
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,600
-I would like an answer.
-Please answer the question.

230
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,800
I have no idea!

231
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:31,360
I was asked to come and I went
through... And we're back on this!

232
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,439
...the standard selection process
at the Royal Institute of Technology.

233
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,720
All my publications were submitted.

234
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:42,800
Three professors
and two international experts-

235
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:46,959
-deemed that I was eligible
for the appointment.

236
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,040
Thank you.
Please just answer the questions.

237
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,720
How low can you sink?

238
00:21:56,879 --> 00:22:00,640
They're so afraid of
the result of your research.

239
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,640
They can't attack you there, so they
attack you on a personal level.

240
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,800
The Royal Institute of Technology.
Professor Roger Wallis.

241
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:17,720
I think it's sick to attack
the academic world like this.

242
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:22,879
It's not the first time. I've heard
about professors in the US-

243
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,400
-who have indicated that file sharing
could be positive for the industry-

244
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,040
-that have been hunted down
with a whip.

245
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,600
It's sad that these American methods
are coming to Sweden.

246
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,439
Would you like any compensation
for participating today?

247
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,520
Please send flowers to my wife
for the sleepless night.

248
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,600
The court's budget
will not allow that.

249
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,040
It's now two or three days
since the court appearance.

250
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,600
I'm starting to look through
all the blogs around the world.

251
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm looking here at "TorrentFreak":

252
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,400
"Pirate Bay witness
overwhelmed with flowers."

253
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,320
And an awful lot
of very kind people who wrote:

254
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,840
"At last somebody from the older
generation"... I'm an old man.

255
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,959
..."seems to understand
the way we think."

256
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,520
I also make the point here
that as a composer...

257
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,720
A song I wrote
bought our first house.

258
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:31,080
I support copyright, but only
if it encourages creativity-

259
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:36,119
-or economic incitement
or is an incentive to create.

260
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,720
Not copyright
as a huge control mechanism-

261
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:44,800
-for people who sit
on large swathes of rights.

262
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,640
A police officer that worked with
the Pirate Bay investigation-

263
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,280
-was employed by a film studio
shortly after the investigation.

264
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:05,520
In an email, Warner Bros. states
that the information in the media-

265
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,720
-about an alleged conflict
of interest is pure speculation.

266
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:15,520
He sold his apartment and bought
a house. Just after he got the job.

267
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,000
I was disappointed
when you didn't investigate him.

268
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,800
You're claiming stuff
I don't have a clue about.

269
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:26,879
You should gather material
and submit it to the police.

270
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,520
I did, but they dropped the case.

271
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,439
Well... In that case
there is nothing I can do.

272
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,680
His income that year
is higher than his police salary.

273
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,119
He has declared
capital gains of $120 000.

274
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,680
This fucking trial just gets
more and more bizarre every day.

275
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,280
I think there's been a power cut
at the Pirate Bay again.

276
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:04,360
-Why do you use automatic fuses?
-They're attached to the cable cover.

277
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,080
When an automatic fuse dies 5 times
you have to replace it.

278
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:15,640
My laptops break all the time so I
don't have time to put stickers on.

279
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,360
I spilled gin and tonic in one.
I spilled beer in another.

280
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,560
And I fell on one
and smashed the screen.

281
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,239
-Do you have WIFI here?
-Yes, it's called "bambuser".

282
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,879
-Doesn't it work?
-Key... Bambuser...

283
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,959
-WTF!
-Stop shouting.

284
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,520
I have abstinence! I haven't
been on the internet all day.

285
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,280
On page 24
you have received an email-

286
00:25:55,439 --> 00:26:00,800
-that you forwarded
to Gottfrid and Peter Sunde.

287
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,600
Why did you forward it?

288
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,479
I didn't. Every mail
that contains DMCA-

289
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,000
-is automatically forwarded
to Gottfrid and Peter.

290
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,520
I have a lot of abbreviations
in my filter.

291
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,640
-Who programmed the abbreviations?
-I did.

292
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,280
-Why?
-Because I got a lot of spam.

293
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:28,200
Why would you consider an email-

294
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,640
-called "Copyright Claim" as spam?

295
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,840
Spam are emails
that I haven't requested.

296
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,400
Fredrik Neij stated
that as soon as he got an email-

297
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,160
-from someone
representing copyright owners-

298
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,000
-it was forwarded to you
from his computer. Is that correct?

299
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Since no one seems capable
to do what we've told them-

300
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,720
-i.e. contact the user
that uploaded the material-

301
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:04,920
-those complaints
have either been ignored-

302
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,360
-or been replied to
in more or less well-phrased ways.

303
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:16,920
Why was it sent to you?

304
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,920
I express myself well in writing,
as opposed to Fredrik.

305
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,760
But such a claim didn't result
in anything but scorn and ridicule?

306
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:33,760
The first 100 times it resulted in us
saying: "Contact the uploader."

307
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,920
-And the following 100 times?
-Then we lost our patience.

308
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,680
The Company PRQ...

309
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,680
-Was it a web hotel?
-Yes, it had just been founded.

310
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:06,040
Is it correct that the prosecution
confiscated 195 servers-

311
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,479
-and that 11
belonged to the Pirate Bay?

312
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,119
11 or 13, I don't remember exactly.

313
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,879
This is outrageous.
This is a true injustice.

314
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,160
They're attacking a company that has
nothing to do with the Pirate Bay.

315
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,439
Simply because the co-founders were
involved with the Pirate Bay for fun.

316
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,200
Thanks to the raid
PRQ got a lot of attention.

317
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,520
Everybody knew that we never
give any information to the police.

318
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,040
Our customer database
was encrypted.

319
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,760
The police seized our servers, but
didn't get any customer information.

320
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,879
When the Pirate Bay
was shut down after the raid-

321
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,800
-you didn't have
any servers left, right?

322
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:58,560
You were back online after three days.
Where did you get the servers?

323
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,840
We leased servers from a company
called NFOrce in Holland.

324
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,040
It's a co-location company.

325
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,280
-How was that received?
-With standing ovations.

326
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,000
It's a pleasure to announce
that the Pirate Bay is back online!

327
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,720
In your face, Hollywood!

328
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,239
-Peter!
-Yes? I'll be there soon!

329
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:36,360
That's how you have treated me. I get
letters from your lawyers saying:

330
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,600
"Swedish law cannot protect you.
US law will get you".

331
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,360
You put private detectives on us.
I've had two outside my house.

332
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,600
-I know nothing about that.
-But it's your responsibility.

333
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
It could have been the film industry.

334
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,280
-No, it was the music industry.
-Ok.

335
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,560
TPB isn't interested
in music and movies.

336
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,520
TPB is a generic medium for
distribution of all types of files.

337
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:07,080
People shouldn't say that TPB only is about
spreading illegal movies and music.

338
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:11,000
Then your world is this small.
It's your loss.

339
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,280
Instead we could say
that file sharing is good.

340
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:19,119
Then we could focus on ways
to let artists make money.

341
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,959
-We think file sharing is good.
-Sure, but you sue everyone.

342
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,000
No. We don't want
to prosecute anyone.

343
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,439
We just want people in Sweden
to start respecting copyright laws.

344
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:59,800
What was the purpose of
the Pirate Bay in your opinion?

345
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:04,239
We never spoke about purposes.

346
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,760
If it was about reforming laws
or if it was about-

347
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:14,720
-hatred against some Americans.
I don't know their purpose.

348
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:20,239
But for Fredrik, and it was
Fredrik I was dealing with-

349
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,640
-the purpose was to make it
a big site. The biggest site in the world.

350
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,840
From my point of view I liked the
idea of the world's biggest site.

351
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,479
-How is the Pirate Bay financed?
-How the website is financed?

352
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,479
We have ads on the site
that generate money.

353
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,479
A guy called Lundström
helped you financially, didn't he?

354
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,280
Yes, we we're sponsored
by a company called Rix Telecom.

355
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:53,720
-What was his purpose?
-Free advertising for his company.

356
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,439
Carl Lundström is an interesting guy.

357
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,600
He's behind
many right-wing organizations.

358
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,959
Carl Lundström
has apparently given money to...

359
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,320
Answer the question!
Did he represent these organizations?

360
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:13,479
It really bugs me-

361
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,720
-that everybody looks at us
as right-wing extremists.

362
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:22,720
It makes me really hurt and angry.
My brother is a convicted anarchist.

363
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:28,920
He's been in court,
defending his opinions.

364
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,119
We've both been on
a neo-Nazi organization's hit list.

365
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,000
It feels strange to be accused of
founding that neo-Nazi organization.

366
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,400
It's really hard.

367
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,239
I can only stand behind
my own politics.

368
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,920
When you have some influence
and people listen to you-

369
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,280
-you should use that position
to do something good.

370
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,600
When did you become
the Pirate Bay's spokesperson?

371
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,200
Well, it's not an official title, but
a function that has been given to me.

372
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,560
Nobody wanted to do that part,
but it was important to communicate-

373
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,280
-that the Pirate Bay
was doing something important.

374
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:19,360
Since nobody else wanted to,
I started doing it.

375
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:26,560
What was Peter Sunde's role
during that time?

376
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,080
He showed up
when we needed a public face.

377
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:37,320
Since neither I nor Fredrik
are suited in furnished rooms.

378
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,959
So he had nothing
to do with running the site.

379
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,080
-Or any design?
-No.

380
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,400
-Funding?
-No.

381
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,680
It's AIM. You told me it was MSN.

382
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,400
What's the fucking difference?

383
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,720
They're two different networks.
It's like IRCnet and EFnet.

384
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:04,320
-Come on!
-It was the Museum of Modern Art...

385
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:07,160
You're so loud!
You give me a headache.

386
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:13,280
-I'm half deaf, of course I shout.
-You're making me deaf.

387
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:16,200
He wants to spread his misery.

388
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,160
-Why can't you hear anything?
-Sex, drugs and industry!

389
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,640
Sex?

390
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,119
I've heard your sex stories.

391
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,400
How much does a banner cost?

392
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,680
You are asking me about
5-year-old figures again.

393
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,160
If you give me a day I can
probably find some examples.

394
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,879
But I can't give you
any exact figures.

395
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,920
Does $500 per week sound
like a reasonable amount?

396
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,280
That sounds about right.
It's within the right range at least.

397
00:34:57,439 --> 00:35:00,119
Within the right range, you say.

398
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:06,040
Was there an agreement about how
the ad revenue was to be divided?

399
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,040
-I have no idea.
-You don't. Fine.

400
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,800
-I'm so fucking tired.
-This will be your life for 5 years.

401
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,920
Are you Kafka or what?

402
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,760
It feels like "The Trial"
all over again.

403
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,040
I might wake up as Gregor Samsa
and can't go to work-

404
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,959
-because I've turned into a beetle.

405
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,160
When do you go back to Cambodia?

406
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,239
-As soon as this shit is over.
-Quiet. It's a secret.

407
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:55,200
What are your thoughts
in general about the case?

408
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:01,239
It will be nice when it's over.
Tomorrow it's just half the day.

409
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,239
And after the closing arguments
we're finished.

410
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,200
How much money
are they looking for?

411
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,400
They want around
20 million Euro in damages.

412
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,479
But good luck finding that money.
I don't have that kind of money.

413
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,200
If they knew that our entire office
is a chat room on IRC-

414
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,400
-they wouldn't believe it.

415
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,119
And they don't because they've been
asking questions about companies.

416
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Yeah, we tried to get organized,
but we failed every single time.

417
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:40,560
I don't think they can grasp the idea
of an organization without a boss.

418
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,680
People have no idea how small we are.
We're just a couple of guys in a chat room.

419
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:12,320
I've argued that the yearly
profit is at least $170,000.

420
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:15,439
And that's the minimum.

421
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:19,640
Gottfrid Svartholm Warg stated-

422
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,239
-that the price for an ad on TPB
was $500 per week.

423
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,479
The report from
the Forensic Laboratory-

424
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,040
-states that
at the time of the raid-

425
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,320
- there were 64 unique ads.

426
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:46,160
A rough estimate...

427
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,520
$500 times 64-

428
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,439
- gives us $34 000 per week.

429
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:02,119
That amount times 52 weeks,
i.e. weeks per year-

430
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,840
-makes a yearly
revenue of $ 1700 000.

431
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,760
Thus The Pirate Bay isn't idealistic.

432
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,879
It's pure commercial business.

433
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,280
Here we go. 4 times 52.

434
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,959
$110 000. That's a massive sum.
We never got that kind of money back then.

435
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:41,840
If you calculate with the right
number of ads - 4 instead of 64-

436
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,160
-you get a much more
realistic figure.

437
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,800
But he has miscalculated
so many things.

438
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:52,560
Did Roswall mean 64 different ads,
or 4 ads times a bunch of pages?

439
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,600
-Yes.
-What the hell! Is he insane?

440
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,720
He's right behind you.

441
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:05,760
We're thinking of doing a
Bambuser press conference.

442
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,560
Hell no!! No! No!
They keep calling us organized.

443
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,680
They don't understand
what a joke that is.

444
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,560
It's disorganized crime.

445
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,600
You mean for all of you? I think
you are going to get convicted.

446
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,640
Take a picture of Monique.
It's her copyright.

447
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,959
-I'm leaving.
-Bye bye.

448
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,720
Do you need a hand?

449
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,000
This is the only help
you'll ever get from me.

450
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,400
-That's so kind.
-I am kind.

451
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,560
And I still have my soul, too.

452
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,680
Here's Fredrik,
let's get out of here.

453
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,600
Let's calculate
how much money we have earned.

454
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,160
Let's start with
an exponential function.

455
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,879
-You can add times 64.
-Right.

456
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,600
And for N we choose
a random number.

457
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,680
Between 10 and 5 200.
Do you write code in Swedish?

458
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,280
Now take the square root
to see what Monique's soul costs.

459
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,560
The answer?

460
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,520
Do it mathematically correct.

461
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,239
Come on, not Pi.

462
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,720
He's mad.
Go check that it's correct.

463
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,080
Okay. I'll give you some cred.

464
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,760
It's in my muscle memory. I can't
remember it writing with a pen.

465
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,119
I have to emulate a keyboard.

466
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,479
So what are you doing
at 11.00 on the 17th of April?

467
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,800
Queuing outside the court?

468
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:09,239
-11 am means 5 pm local time.
-I was thinking the same thing.

469
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,040
Gottfrid, can you sit over here?

470
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,920
I'm not taking part in any fucking
press conference. I'm sick of it!

471
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:23,360
-It's in English.
-I'm so fucking tired of cameras.

472
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,160
-And fucking bullshit!
-Sit here anyway. It's the last time.

473
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,040
Nein.

474
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,640
Hi everybody.

475
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,280
I'm here and together with me
I have some of the guys from TPB.

476
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:43,239
Take your time and ask
some questions to the guys-

477
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,720
-and see what they have to say.

478
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,040
-I didn't know we were that boring.
-You are that boring.

479
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,400
Because you're not part of this.
Film him!

480
00:41:57,439 --> 00:41:58,959
Anakata!

481
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,360
Today the court will decide if
the men behind the Pirate Bay-

482
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,119
-are guilty of
copyright infringement.

483
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,400
Follow the verdict live on svt.se
from 11.00.

484
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:30,600
No, but... Sure, but don't worry.

485
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,640
Because I'm not worried myself.
But I'll talk to you later. Bye.

486
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,600
Dad was more nervous than I am.

487
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:51,800
The verdict is in for the Pirate
Bay trial. It's 11 o'clock.

488
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:56,879
All four defendants are sentenced
to one year in prison.

489
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,879
The offense is called "assisting
copyright infringement".

490
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:07,439
- So one year imprisonment...
-This is so insane!

491
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,879
This must be a joke.

492
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,640
Take it easy, mom.
Nothing will happen.

493
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,360
This is going to take 5 years.
Take it easy.

494
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:35,040
The District Court is ruled by
politicians. We call it the Dice Court.

495
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,479
Just stay calm.

496
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,200
But I can't talk right now. I have
to watch the press conference.

497
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,040
Okay. Take care.

498
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,680
The District Court has announced
the verdict in the Pirate Bay trial.

499
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:05,840
We have estimated the damages
to approximately $4,5 million.

500
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,280
Fuck you. He's going to get
a good job in Hollywood after this.

501
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,439
This is so insane!

502
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,479
The hottest set up ever.

503
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,400
I don't have time right now,
I have to decline.

504
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,320
No, I'm the only one in Sweden. The
others are in the desert or the jungle.

505
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,680
No, they are not going
to send us to jail whatsoever.

506
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,840
The way it works in Sweden
is that they can't...

507
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,920
...do anything about the case
before we can't appeal anymore.

508
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,160
-What are we going to call this?
-LOL?

509
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,720
For the lulz.

510
00:45:00,879 --> 00:45:04,239
If this was a movie
this is where the heroes-

511
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,959
-encounter their first problem.

512
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,879
Karate Kid got bullied in the
beginning and got beaten up.

513
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,959
And we've just been beaten up.

514
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:20,000
Thanks, Hollywood, for teaching
us that the good guys win in the end.

515
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,400
In total they wanted around
100 million Swedish crowns, right?

516
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,520
And they got 30 million.

517
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,000
But they could have gotten 1 billion,
it doesn't matter because...

518
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,800
We can't pay and we wouldn't pay.

519
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:41,800
This verdict makes me upset
to the bone.

520
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:46,560
There is no chance in hell
this verdict will hold in an appeal.

521
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,640
I will cross the creek, the stream
and the Atlantic for a redress.

522
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,840
It means a lot
to have taken a stand.

523
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,160
It's important to re-establish Sweden
as a state governed by law.

524
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,040
The judge in the Pirate Bay trial
is accused of bias.

525
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,600
People are demanding a retrial.

526
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:17,280
Last night I learned about
the news that blew up today.

527
00:46:17,439 --> 00:46:19,800
The judge in the Pirate Bay trial-

528
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:26,000
-is a member of organizations that
are working with copyright issues.

529
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,479
Organizations that the attorneys
from the plaintiff's are part of.

530
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,080
I was horrified and shocked
to learn about this.

531
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,720
-Why didn't you inform the court?
-Good question. I didn't.

532
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:42,600
Yes, I know how he thought.

533
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,560
"My friends will be happy
if I rule in their favor."

534
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,800
It's ridiculous. I didn't think
the legal system was that bad.

535
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:54,840
-Was it a correct decision?
-That's for others to decide.

536
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,320
It's Tomas, the judge.
He's the judge in the District Court.

537
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:23,640
He's a member of the
Swedish Association for Copyright.

538
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,879
That's the whole point.

539
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,800
He sits in the board for the Swedish
Association for Industrial Rights.

540
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:37,720
These two organizations
have a common publication, NIR.

541
00:47:37,879 --> 00:47:42,680
And all the lawyers
that assist the prosecution:

542
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,879
Peter Danowsky, Henrik Pontén
and Monique Wadsted.

543
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,840
They're all members
of the same organization.

544
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,239
So he looks very mixed up
in these people's world.

545
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,600
From a graphical point of view
it's very obvious.

546
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,760
I can't say if he was biased-

547
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,119
-but just the fact that he
withheld this information-

548
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,640
-makes him unsuitable
as a judge in this case.

549
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,720
The verdict is questionable, since he
might be perceived as being biased.

550
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,439
-Here's my pirate copy.
-I have a parasite.

551
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,640
-Is this you? Fredrik?
-Yes.

552
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,800
-What's your job?
- IT. Internet.

553
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:39,560
Because of our tradition
and the regulations of the village-

554
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,080
-you have to pay for the engagement.

555
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:48,360
How much would you like
to pay for the engagement?

556
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:54,000
$6,000?

557
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:04,040
If you leave her you have to pay
the bride dowry times two.

558
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,840
That means $12,000. Agreed?

559
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,600
Please write your name and sign it.

560
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,239
Do you like it? Good.

561
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:32,560
-Yummy! Yummy!
-Hello!

562
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,760
If it didn't cost me $12,000
I would divorce you.

563
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,080
It's always this way with the
Pirate Bay. Chaos and cheating.

564
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:56,320
Last Monday a verdict came
from the Stockholm District court-

565
00:50:56,479 --> 00:50:58,000
-where Judge Norström is chairman.

566
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:05,080
Black Internet, the ISP
for Pirate Bay's ISP must quit-

567
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:08,400
-and if they continue to
give access to the Pirate Bay-

568
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,879
-they will be fined $75 000 per day.

569
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,400
Then all hell broke loose.

570
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,200
So they're trying legal tricks
and we're trying technical tricks.

571
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:29,200
It's like a constant tactical game
with different weapons.

572
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,680
When we realized that
the Pirate Bay was down-

573
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,600
-we looked around,
because we always have backups.

574
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:47,680
Then I realized that the Pirate Party
had registered their own ISP.

575
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,640
The Pirate Party works for reformed
copyright laws, an open internet-

576
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,400
-and free access to culture.

577
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,959
I realized that if we're hosted
by the Pirate Party-

578
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:06,239
-it means that if someone closes them
down, they're closing down the party.

579
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,119
That means closing down a party
that represents Sweden in the EU.

580
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,600
That would be political censorship
on the highest level.

581
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:21,439
If you're hosted by the Pirate Party
you get political protection.

582
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,080
You could say that you get
diplomatic immunity.

583
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,400
After days of speculation "Rapport"
can now reveal that the Pirate Party-

584
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,360
-takes over the responsibility for
the security of WikiLeaks' servers.

585
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,479
WikiLeaks or the Pirate Party copied
what they had done with TPB.

586
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,840
Giving WikiLeaks protection
by a political party-

587
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,920
-by sharing
the same internet connection.

588
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,600
Every leak on WikiLeaks has been released on
TPB since there is no censorship there.

589
00:52:57,959 --> 00:53:01,400
Gottfrid is good at tech stuff
and encryption-

590
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,600
-and he's worked on
many important projects.

591
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,360
Like "Collateral Murder"
that made WikiLeaks famous.

592
00:53:15,479 --> 00:53:16,560
"Look at those dead bastards"

593
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,320
Julian has a lot of respect
for Gottfrid.

594
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:31,959
I remember when Gottfrid said:
"There's a new customer, WikiLeaks."

595
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:35,360
"They need help
because they're under attack."

596
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,439
The first time I got in contact
was when we had to pay a bill.

597
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,560
Because no one, and
that was a constant problem...

598
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,360
No one remembered
the stupid customer number.

599
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,000
And no one wanted to say
anything on the phone.

600
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,760
In 2008 I flew to Sweden
to pay the bill in cash.

601
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,959
Gottfrid always said he didn't
want money from WikiLeaks.

602
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,040
I flew there and paid for
one year and a bit in advance.

603
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,040
Julian was with me.
He flew in as well.

604
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,000
And we arranged this meeting
with Gottfrid to hand over the money.

605
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,920
And it was one of the
weirdest incidents in my life.

606
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,920
He came to the hotel and he had
someone waiting outside in a car.

607
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:30,680
And they had an agreement that
Gottfrid would be near a window.

608
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,959
So he stood there in this lobby.

609
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,920
With his long hair,
looking completely...

610
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,160
-Strange! Fucked up.
-And he behaved really strange.

611
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:50,680
And every 30 seconds he turned to
see if the guy in the car was there.

612
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,000
And Julian and I were standing
there and we basically thought-

613
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,239
-that we would go hang out
or something.

614
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,239
So we asked him if he
wanted to come up to the room.

615
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,760
And he was like: "No, no, I can't."
He was turning around.

616
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,640
Never heard that before.

617
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,959
And then handing over some cash
and the guy jumped in the car-

618
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,119
-and they drove off
and we felt like...

619
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,720
That was meeting PRQ for us.

620
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,840
A warm welcome to Peter Sunde.

621
00:55:30,879 --> 00:55:35,800
First question: Are you a killer
that ruined the whole industry?

622
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:39,800
I would love to take credit for it but I can't.
Sorry. They did it themselves.

623
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:44,080
-There is a law case now with you.
-Just one?

624
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,479
I don't know how many but
some discussions going around.

625
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,720
You had a new idea: Flattr.

626
00:55:50,879 --> 00:55:55,239
It comes from the discussions
we had during the Pirate Bay.

627
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,800
There were two sides. One side said
there is no problem with downloading.

628
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:05,119
The other side said they're not
making any money from the internet.

629
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,360
-And there was nothing happening.
-Can you explain how Flattr works?

630
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,560
You as a user sign up
and you put money into an account.

631
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,239
You decide how much
you want to spend per month.

632
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,680
Then you find Flattr buttons. They
look like the Facebook Like buttons.

633
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,600
If you click it we remember it
until the end of the month.

634
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,360
At the end of the month
we count your clicks-

635
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,879
-and we share your money equally
amongst them.

636
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,720
-Where is the money going?
-It's going to the creators.

637
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:40,600
That's the whole concept.

638
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,680
The trial in the Court of Appeal
against the Pirate Bay began today.

639
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,640
Let's shake hands today again.

640
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,160
-It's a sick team, right?
-I'm soaking wet.

641
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,040
To rent a car costs $400 per week.

642
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,920
I bought that one for $600.
I'll use it for 6 weeks.

643
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,479
-Is it legal?
-Sure. I've even paid the taxes.

644
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:21,640
I don't really care about parking
tickets - I have a $7 million debt.

645
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:29,920
The Court of Appeal, please.

646
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,119
-Is Gottfrid coming?
-I highly doubt that.

647
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,239
-Unless he teleports himself.
-Okay.

648
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:45,000
He wrote this morning that he's hospitalized
with a parasite infection in Cambodia.

649
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,360
So yes, it's highly unlikely
that he'll come.

650
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,600
-Do you have any other trials?
-The civil cases.

651
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,360
-The penalty fine stuff.
-How many are they?

652
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,680
One in Italy, one in Holland...

653
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:11,760
One in Denmark that we're not
summoned to, and one in Norway.

654
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,600
Kuwait, Ireland. Anything else?

655
00:58:27,439 --> 00:58:29,479
What is the most important?

656
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:35,800
I believe it's very important to look
at how our society ought to be.

657
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:39,439
Not just rule so that big companies
can make a bigger profit.

658
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,600
How does this feel? 8 days to go.

659
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,520
It's boring
that we're just watching video.

660
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:51,560
You wanted to speak for yourself
but weren't allowed to, right?

661
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,840
I think the new court system
is really bad.

662
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You can't introduce new material.
We don't even need to be in court.

663
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,439
They could just take the old material
and rule from that.

664
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,400
Hey, thanks for coming!

665
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:11,720
-How are you?
-I'm really sick.

666
00:59:11,879 --> 00:59:16,160
Then why the hell
are you shaking my hand?

667
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:20,959
-He's also sick.
-What's wrong with you?

668
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,920
I have a cold and an eye infection.
I didn't sleep at all last night.

669
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,959
I just got an SMS
from Gottfrid's mother.

670
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:36,720
She wrote that he is still
in Cambodia.

671
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:42,840
She said that he is really ill.

672
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,560
He's had problems before as well.

673
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,320
When you look at him, health
isn't the first thing you think of.

674
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,760
-What are you working with today?
-I run websites.

675
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,920
In Cambodia or Thailand?

676
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:09,239
With the internet you can work anywhere
as long as you have Internet access.

677
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,160
State prosecutor Roswall accused
the defendants of contempt-

678
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:21,320
-since they have continued
to run the site after the verdict.

679
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:25,000
He wants the one year imprisonment
for all four to be affirmed.

680
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,119
The tunnel computer is located in
Pionen with the Pirate Party.

681
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,400
Pionen is a show-off in Apple style.

682
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,760
The tunnel computer is the entrance
from the internet to the Pirate Bay.

683
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,360
Then everything happens
in the background somewhere.

684
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,160
On the real servers,
that are hidden.

685
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,000
Right now we're on our way
to the real mountain.

686
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,200
That's an expensive table.

687
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,200
-6 cores?
-12 cores.

688
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,760
4 CPU's with 12 cores.

689
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,959
Here. The Pirate Bay.
And that's all.

690
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,200
We run an efficient ship.

691
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,520
Where are the people
who run the Pirate Bay based now?

692
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:11,720
I don't know. Ask the Pirate Party,
they are hosting the bandwidth.

693
01:03:11,879 --> 01:03:20,920
But it has changed owners after
we passed it on, too. Once or twice.

694
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:25,400
We miss the support from the
Pirate Party in the District Court.

695
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,080
-With buses and stuff.
-The buses were the Pirate Bureau.

696
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:34,119
Was it the Pirate Bureau?
With trumpets and flags and stuff.

697
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,600
It feels like they
have forgotten about us.

698
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,879
The pirate movement's idea
to fight for free file sharing-

699
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,760
-just isn't accepted anymore.

700
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:55,320
It was just a little fad.
I never thought it would survive.

701
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,320
-I don't want them.
-You don't have to sign them.

702
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:08,239
But by law you have been served.

703
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,439
What does that mean?

704
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,959
-I can't force you to sign.
-No, you can't.

705
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,080
-But you've been served.
-Who are you?

706
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,879
-I'm the subpoena server.
-Can I see your ID?

707
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:36,119
Can I see the last 4 digits, please?

708
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,640
-You should quit smoking.
-Do I smell?

709
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:46,200
This is stressful for me, too.

710
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,879
-Does it feel bad to do this?
-Kind of.

711
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,959
-But they pay you well?
-No.

712
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,840
-Why do you do it?
-It's my job.

713
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,800
Do you have kids? Then I
understand, but get a better job.

714
01:04:56,879 --> 01:04:58,560
I've been thinking about that.

715
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,160
-Is this from Danowsky?
-I don't know what it's about.

716
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,439
-So you don't know where it's from?
-Holland.

717
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,000
-Okay. Good luck.
-Thanks. Likewise.

718
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,200
-He's got a great job.
-I feel sorry for him.

719
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,439
I don't. He's like a meter maid.

720
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,320
Did you see the debate on TV?

721
01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:32,439
A young girl said: "This is not about
young people wanting to commit crimes."

722
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,800
"They just have
a different consumption pattern."

723
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:41,200
"They just want to consume
movies and records that way."

724
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:46,680
"It's horrible to hunt them.
The market must adjust instead."

725
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:11,760
Life is cooler
than the internet.

726
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:18,800
That's probably a really
radical opinion around here.

727
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:23,439
After the cold war
they had to invent enemies-

728
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,600
-that you couldn't even kill.

729
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,320
Terror, piracy and drugs.

730
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:35,080
It's obvious that PRQ
has had customers-

731
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:40,640
-that some say are connected to
terror, piracy and drugs.

732
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,520
That can't be denied.

733
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,879
I guess all three of them at the
same time for one single customer.

734
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,640
You mean Gottfrid Svartholm Warg!

735
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,800
He's a pirate and a junkie.

736
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:59,040
And when you talk to him
you get a little scared.

737
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,439
You could say he's a Taliban.

738
01:07:11,439 --> 01:07:18,760
I'm back from Cambodia.
I've been there for a month.

739
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:23,200
I've been really worried
about Gottfrid's health.

740
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,920
I don't want to talk
too much about...

741
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:32,000
He hasn't been using stuff
constantly.

742
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,280
It's been every now and then.
When he has a deadline.

743
01:07:36,439 --> 01:07:40,840
He gets stressed by his work
when something has to be done.

744
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,479
So then he does
a whole lot of drugs.

745
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,760
I just couldn't stand by and watch.

746
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:53,160
I've seen friends struggle
with drugs before.

747
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:59,720
And it's... What can I say?
It's tough.

748
01:07:59,879 --> 01:08:05,000
It's not something you want
to see a friend go through.

749
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,600
-What are we gonna do?
-Crush racism!

750
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,439
-When?
-Now!

751
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,239
-When, when, when?
-Now, now, now!

752
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,239
-What are we gonna do?
-Crush racism!

753
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:43,080
Brokep/Peter is a fucking
vegetarian leftist bitch ass bastard.

754
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:45,879
But he's got balls because
he's in the Pirate Bay?

755
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,439
-He's giving all the interviews.
-He's still a bitch.

756
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:56,959
He does it because of ideological
pussy-inflicted instincts.

757
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,920
He needs to look himself in the ass
and take his own life in his hands.

758
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:08,119
If he's had a beer or two, he becomes
the most annoying person on earth.

759
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,439
The problem is he takes a
couple of beers at least everyday.

760
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,959
Isn't there some connection
to right-wing parties in Sweden?

761
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:19,840
Carl Lundström,
one of the co-defendants-

762
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,360
-was a right-wing extremist before.

763
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,680
He founded a lot of crap.
But in the end-

764
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:32,280
-he married a Jewish girl.
He has four kids.

765
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:39,439
To call him a right-wing extremist
was correct 10-20 years ago.

766
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,080
Now I wouldn't say that.

767
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:46,680
If Carl Lundström
is xenophobic then so am I.

768
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:52,360
Every time I've been beaten or
robbed, it's been by immigrants.

769
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:56,920
And I don't mean seventh-generation
Finnish immigrants.

770
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,800
I mean these
dirty fucking immigrants.

771
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:04,920
What can I say. He's stupid
when it comes to things like that.

772
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:10,320
He has never thought for himself.
He just says what his parents say.

773
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:14,320
He's an alcoholic racist asshole.

774
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:17,280
-But I still love him.
-And you know what?

775
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:23,040
All the emails in the Pirate Bay
trial comes from Anakata.

776
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:27,160
Anakata the don't-know-how
to-fucking-encrypt-his-computer!

777
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:34,160
Even Peter and I encrypted
our emails. But Gottfrid didn't!

778
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,720
Gottfrid is the stupidest person
in the entire history of IT.

779
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,959
Yeah, the Pirate Bay is really tight!

780
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,760
I have no batteries left.

781
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,720
I'm surprised there are no cameras.

782
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,400
-Yes, today is the last day.
-Finally! I'm going home.

783
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:19,320
-You can throw them away.
-You've been served anyway.

784
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:22,280
Is this gonna come on YouTube?

785
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:25,280
-You can throw them away.
-You do it.

786
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,800
-You can't force me to take them.
-You've been served.

787
01:11:29,959 --> 01:11:33,280
It was you who dropped the papers.

788
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,959
Come on!

789
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:57,280
I want to sleep.

790
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:12,040
Sabaidee!

791
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,280
When I get acquitted tomorrow
I'm going to sue them for millions.

792
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:22,520
Billions! At least!

793
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:29,119
We can't be worse than they are with fantasy
numbers. I landed in Sweden on Saturday.

794
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:35,360
I'm helping out with the new Leaks
project's servers in the server hall.

795
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,280
Everybody has left WikiLeaks
except for Julian and maybe Anakata.

796
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:43,080
Because he's like
in love with Julian.

797
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:47,920
Fuck! Blink if you're gonna
turn, you fucking anus!

798
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,879
Goddamnit!

799
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,000
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

800
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,080
Nice to see you again.
You're good?

801
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:19,800
Do these people know what's
happening in your life today?

802
01:13:19,959 --> 01:13:21,959
-No.
-Not even your wife?

803
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:24,280
Yes.

804
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:46,320
I don't know. For Fredrik it's easy.
He can just avoid going home.

805
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:50,200
What do you mean? I don't have
any plans on going home.

806
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,119
I really don't know.
I don't have a clue.

807
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,959
I'm hesitating. But I won't
accept a conviction.

808
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:02,280
I can serve a prison sentence.
But why do it if I don't have to?

809
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:05,520
There's really no reason
for you to do that.

810
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,439
Look around. Why shouldn't I
stay here for 5 years?

811
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,959
You can't go to jail for something
you haven't done.

812
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,400
Political exile is what it's about.

813
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,800
I don't want to become a martyr.

814
01:14:25,959 --> 01:14:28,760
But I don't think I'll be convicted.

815
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:34,160
Knock on wood... But we'll see.

816
01:14:35,879 --> 01:14:37,760
Cheers!

817
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,439
Beer man!

818
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,879
Are you going to get drunk
from happiness or sadness?

819
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,080
Can I tell you in 12 minutes?

820
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:17,879
Hey! The internet just synched up!
I think it's an omen.

821
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,840
Stop lagging!

822
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,720
"If TPB founders are acquitted, it's
a victory for internet freedom."

823
01:15:24,879 --> 01:15:27,560
Check out my eye infection!

824
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:32,680
"The pirate Gottfrid Svartholm Warg
handed in a medical statement."

825
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,840
Gottfrid Svartholm was "sick".

826
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,320
"...was shortened but the damages
were raised." We're convicted.

827
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:53,479
We're convicted. Domstol.se. It's Spam.

828
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:58,879
Copy the link.
The link underneath!

829
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:08,600
"The Court of Appeal considers the
defendants' contribution proven."

830
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,360
"Fredrik Neij is sentenced
to 10 months, Peter Sunde 8"-

831
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,720
-"and Carl Lundström to 4 months."

832
01:16:14,879 --> 01:16:17,360
-What about Gottfrid?
-He's not in the case.

833
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:18,680
Right.

834
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:25,200
The damages went up
from $4,5 million to $6,6 million.

835
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:31,640
Well... We lost.
Fucking idiots.

836
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,160
I'm calling my mom.

837
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,239
Hi. I just wanted to say that they
gave us a shorter sentence.

838
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,879
But we're appealing.
8 months instead of one year.

839
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:51,760
I just wanted to call and
tell you that. So don't be worried.

840
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,920
I have 59 pages I have to read.

841
01:16:57,239 --> 01:16:59,760
Okay, great. Take care.

842
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,920
Fucking idiots.

843
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:17,520
-The internet just died!
-Goddamnit! Yes, it did.

844
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,680
Fucking Windows crap!

845
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,600
The statute of limitation is 5 years.

846
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,200
They can't issue an international
warrant of arrest.

847
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:30,360
I can sit here and jerk off
for 5 years. And I will.

848
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,879
Are you gonna masturbate
for 5 years? In one go?

849
01:17:32,959 --> 01:17:34,720
I'll do it on and off.

850
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,239
This means that
the internet is criminalized.

851
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,119
They label the internet as a place where
crimes are committed. "Close it down."

852
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:50,360
We're not even on BBC or CNN yet!
That irritates me! Come on!

853
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:56,520
I guess we have to live with the fact
that we're not important anymore.

854
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:07,080
-The Bay!
-When does the internet come back?

855
01:18:07,239 --> 01:18:11,479
Maybe in 2 hours. If we're lucky.

856
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,119
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends.

857
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:22,439
We are meeting today to discuss-

858
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,920
-one of the hot issues right now
in the European Parliament.

859
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:31,720
Thank you very much for having me.
It's very brave to invite me here.

860
01:19:31,879 --> 01:19:36,280
I've been a pain in the ass for the
copyright industry for a long time.

861
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:40,520
I'm one of the spokespersons
for the Pirate Bay.

862
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:45,720
TPB is the largest file
sharing system in the world.

863
01:19:45,879 --> 01:19:51,400
It's ten times larger than Napster
at it's peak, and it's still growing.
