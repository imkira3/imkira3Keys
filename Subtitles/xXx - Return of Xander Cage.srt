he could skate those empty pools

327
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,712
I got my eye on the king.

328
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,918
That's the problem.

329
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,951
You forgot the queen.

330
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,754
MARKE: After your success
taking down Anarchy 99,

331
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,274
Gibbons was handed a blank check.

332
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,798
Which is the long way of saying

333
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,951
he got you a new ride.

334
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,233
World went and got an upgrade
since you died, Cage.

335
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,995
Onboard drones,
anti-air countermeasures,

336
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,877
and fuel tanks big enough

337
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,873
to circumnavigate the globe three times
without ever landing.

338
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,359
You can check your coat.

339
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,556
I promise you,
no one would dare steal it.

340
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,096
I can't guarantee
it won't walk off on its own.

341
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,519
Wheels up in 10, boys!

342
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,756
Which means
you're already seven minutes behind.

343
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,673
Is she always this much fun,
or just on special occasions?

344
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,394
XANDER: Wow.

345
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,357
No wonder our country's
in debt trillions of dollars.

346
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,616
Do you really need all these gadgets
to get the bad guys?

347
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,471
Oh, we don't need any of it.

348
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,816
But it makes the catching
a hell of a lot more fun.

349
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Hmm.

350
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,717
Xander Cage. Holy shit!

351
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,515
Live and in concert, one night only.
This is crazy!

352
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,030
I was at Coachella and
Guns N' Roses got back together,

353
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,395
but this is way cooler.

354
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,914
Well, I wasn't actually there, but I, like,

355
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,433
heard about it, you know?

356
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,278
I'm still talking. Oh, my God.

357
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,072
I'm sorry, it's like a bad habit.

358
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,237
I get started and then I can't stop
and then I can't...

359
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Breathe.

360
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,670
Take your time.

361
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,997
- I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.
- (SCOFFS)

363
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,315
Wow.

364
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Wow!

365
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,036
Are you kidding me with those guns?

366
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,991
You're like the frickin' Terminator!

367
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,856
And I'm not talking
about the first Terminator,

368
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,074
but the second Terminator

369
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,216
that goes back
to kill the first Terminator.

370
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,434
It was the liquidy metal guy.

371
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,670
Agent Clearidge
worked closely with Gibbons.

372
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,876
She'll handle support for the operation.

373
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,468
And I bet a guy like you
needs a lot of support.

374
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,750
What are you? Like 220? 230?

375
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,190
Be honest.
250 is the hard max for my swing.

376
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,799
- Oh, come on.
- I'm kidding.

377
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,296
It's not like I have a safe word,
or anything.

378
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,355
It's "kumquat."

379
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,032
Never really think about it.

380
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,235
Kumquat.

381
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,439
- What about you?
- (CHUCKLES)

382
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,476
No. "Safe" isn't in my vocabulary.

383
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,239
Touché. You are Xander Cage.
(CHUCKLES)

384

Anything you need,
Becky can source it within the hour.

any sort of illegal drugs.

386
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,312

I am not the girl to ask.

390

MARKE: Okay, Cage, follow me.

391
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,916
I'll introduce you to your ground team.

392
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,635
- Thank you, Becky.
- BECKY: Of course.

394

Hey, here comes the Red Bull
freak show.

395
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,350
MARKE: Xander Cage,
I want you to meet Paul...

396
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,555
XANDER: Donovan.

397
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,989
Captain Paul Donovan.

398
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,396
I know you. I saw you on TV!

399
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,720
The President gave him a medal.

400
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,189
That must have been pretty cool, right?

401
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,159
You guys must have
some seriously cool stories to tell.

402
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Must've seen a lot.

403
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,594
I wonder,

404
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,195
how many of you have ever pulled

405
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,396
a freestyle triple backflip

406
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,916
on a BMX bike before? All of you?

407
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,718
No. We don't play on bikes.

408
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,319
XANDER: Oh, you don't play on bikes.

409
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,673

410

00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,072
We were a new T riple-X team
Gibbons created.

816
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,390
We discovered
a high-level intelligence officer

817
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,516
was trying to manipulate satellites.

818
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,752
And even before we could unmask him,

819
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,353
Gibbons was killed.

820
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,636
XANDER: So, you knew they were
Triple-X all along.

821
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,990
I needed you to retain
a sense of objectivity.

822
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,790
I don't understand.
If I destroyed Pandora's Box,

823
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,592
what happened in Moscow?

824
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,591
If I'm right, which I am,

825
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,080
this box only ever had the ability

826
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,270
to control one satellite.

827
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,674
What does that mean?

828
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,360
It means
we've been chasing a prototype.

829
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,256
TENNYSON:
And these guys have the real one?

830
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,280
Yeah.

831
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,831
Serena played us for fools.

832
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,434
Betrayed us.

833
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,718
XIANG: This isn't about Serena.

834
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,313
This is war. And either

835
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,352
we stop it today,
or we watch the world burn tomorrow.

836
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,351
- Can't lose focus on that.
- Yeah.

837
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,114
Where you been?

838
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,998
You stop off for the old rub-and-tug?

839
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,235
Your mom says hi.

840
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,360
(LAUGHS)

841
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,636
Tracker on board? Nobody saw you?

842
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,671
- Nobody ever sees me, boss.
- Good.

843
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,274
XANDER: Now, these suits control
every spy satellite in the sky.

844
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,712
But how often do these seven men
all sit in the same room together?

845
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,429
MARKE: Almost never.

846
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,438
XANDER: And if you needed
retinal scans,

847
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,520
cell phone data dumps,

848
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,672
biometrics of all
the superpowers in the world,

849
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,390
who would you target?

850
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,520
Oh, shit.

851
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,269
XANDER: Who has that kind of power
to actually set that in motion?

852
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,153
Oh, you're pissing up
the wrong tree, Cage.

853
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,151
I came looking for you, remember?

854
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,272
Yo, asshole. We gonna have problems?

855
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,119
Oh, no problem. How was your trip?

856
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,874
- (CHUCKLES)
- I'm just doing the math.

857
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,230
Oh, yeah? What math?

858
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,757
Air velocity divided by distance.

859
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,229
So, when I stuff you down the toilet,

860
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,153
search and rescue will know where

861
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,470
to find you between China
and North Korea.

862
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,073
Keep talking shit, little man.

863
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,316
Hold that thought, G.I.Joe.

864
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,229
Wow.

865
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,079
Roll it back.

866
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,553
A little more.

867
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,640
More.

868
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,315
A little more. Stop.

869
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,113
Okay, when Xiang broke the window,

870
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,272
he's the only one that didn't flinch.

871
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,960
I need the President on the phone...

872
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,736
That's not gonna come off,
you know that, right?

873
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,990
I'll have to replace
the goddamn screen.

874
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,456
I've been saying the director of the CIA

875
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,755
has been trying
to destroy the world for years.

876
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,435
Okay, we have carte blanche to track
this son of a bitch down.

877
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,189
Do any of you know how to do it?

878
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,080
The same way Xiang and I found
Pandora's Box in New York.

879
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,136
Pandora's Box needs to
keep reconnecting itself

880
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,037
because the satellites orbit.

881
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,031
- Excuse me.
- Uh.

882
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,993
All we need to do is
track down the main signal,

883
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,799
and then we can approximate
its location within a 20-mile radius.

884
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,549
ADELE: Of all the places
in the world to lay low,

885
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,871
this fruit loop chooses Detroit?

886
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,720
MALE REPORTER:
These blasts did take place in Moscow,

887
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,910
but they were felt around the world.

888
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,551
Good morning. As feared, the death toll
in the Moscow tragedy is rising.

889
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,159
In addition to the latest deaths...

890
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,674
Let me guess.
Everyone's jumping at the chance

891
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,830
to dismantle their spy programs.

892
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,398
No.

893
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,308
The world's too stupid to realize
that Moscow wasn't a bluff.

894
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:43,950
MARKE: Okay, Triple-X,

895
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,156
you will base out of
an NSA safe house.

896
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,794
Becky will coordinate
earbud communications

897
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,110
and have the signal disruptor
on standby.

898
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,636
Nicks, when I crashed the boat up
on shore and saved your life...

899
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,359
Yeah, whatever, bro.

900
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,115
...do you think that counts
as crash 199 for me?

901
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,952
You know, officially?

ADELE: Cool.

904
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,640
MARKE: We'll set up a triangulated
signal tracking system around the city.

905
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,714
And when
Becky locks in his exact location,

906
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,869
we make our move.

907
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,796
XANDER: What about you?
How did you get roped into all this?

908
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,270
SERENA: I tagged a skyscraper
and got a year in jail for it.

Jail?

910
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,792
- Seems excessive.
- Mmm-hmm.

911
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,470
The tag was 30 stories tall.

912
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,037
Two million hits on YouTube.

913
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,475
And I served only half the sentence.

914

Let me guess. Gibbons to the rescue.

915
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,391
Yup. He said a lion like me

916
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,880
doesn't belong in any kind of cage.

917
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,355
I got mine after I left the NSA.

918

I drank my bodyweight in tequila
to get through it.

931

It's the most important one, actually.

He's on the top floor.

I can jam the signal,
