{\An8} <i>Once, long ago,</i>

3
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:31,716
{\an8}<i>in the deep blue below,</i>

4
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,718
{\an8}<i>there was a kingdom.</i>

5
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:36,929
{\An8}<i>A king, a queen, and six sisters...</i>

6
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,889
{\an8}<i>Princesses of the sea.</i>

7
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,225
{\An8}<i>The ocean realm was theirs</i>

8
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,311
{\an8}<i>and the princesses were free to go</i>
<i>wherever they wished...</i>

9
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:46,438
{\an8}<i>except for one place.</i>

10
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:48,565
{\An8}<i>The surface.</i>

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,197
{\An8}<i>Each princess, on her 15th birthday,</i>
<i>was allowed to venture to the above,</i>

12
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:59,075
{\an8}<i>but only for one day.</i>

13
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:01,786
{\An8}<i>Finally, the time came.</i>

14
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,830
{\An8}<i>The littlest mermaid's 15th birthday.</i>

15
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,667
{\An8}<i>And what she saw above</i>

16
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:11,128
{\an8}<i>would alter her existence forever.</i>

17
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:15,549
{\An8}<i>A prince. A true love.</i>

18
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,887
{\An8}<i>When the prince fell, the little mermaid</i>
<i>found herself so drawn to him.</i>

19
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:24,307
{\An8}<i>Despite stories</i>
<i>she had heard of the dangers above,</i>

20
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,934
{\an8}<i>she had to save him.</i>

21
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,479
{\An8}<i>She lingered over the prince,</i>
<i>gazing at him.</i>

22
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:33,607
{\An8}<i>She wondered what this feeling was.</i>

23
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:36,986
{\An8}<i>What would it be like to be with him?</i>

24
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:39,154
{\An8}<i>To actually have legs?</i>

25
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:42,574
{\An8}<i>She had never felt this way before.</i>

26
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:48,454
{\An8}<i>As another human approached,</i>
<i>she gave the prince one last look</i>

27
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:50,581
{\an8}<i>before descending back into the sea.</i>

28
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:54,794
{\An8}<i>She watched from behind a rock</i>
<i>as the prince awoke.</i>

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,588
{\An8}<i>He opened his eyes,</i>

30
00:01:57,922 --> 00:02:01,509
{\an8}<i>thinking that the one who stood before him</i>
<i>had saved his life.</i>

31
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:05,471
{\An8}<i>The little mermaid was so sad.</i>

32
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:08,098
{\An8}<i>She had left her heart above,</i>

33
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,977
{\an8}<i>and wondered if a mermaid</i>
<i>could ever be with a human.</i>

34
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:17,858
{\An8}<i>She swam into the darkest depths</i>
<i>of the sea</i>

35
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,444
{\an8}<i>where there lived a wizard.</i>

36
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,531
{\An8}<i>And she told the wizard of her love</i>
<i>and her desperation for legs</i>

37
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:26,490
{\an8}<i>like those who lived above.</i>

38
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:29,660
{\An8}<i>The cunning wizard made her an offer.</i>

39
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:33,998
{\An8}<i>He said he would grant her a wish</i>
<i>in exchange for one thing.</i>

40
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,125
{\An8}<i>Her soul.</i>

41
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:40,338
{\An8}<i>But if she were to go above</i>
<i>and not be able to find love,</i>

42
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:44,174
{\an8}<i>her soul would be his</i>
<i>until true love came.</i>

43
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:47,594
{\An8}<i>The little mermaid agreed.</i>

44
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:50,430
{\An8}<i>The promise was forged,</i>

45
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:52,140
{\an8}<i>the bond made.</i>

46
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:58,813
{\An8}<i>But upon finding her prince,</i>
<i>she found his heart still belonged</i>

47
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,440
{\an8}<i>to the woman on the shore.</i>

48
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,317
<i>The little mermaid was visited
by the wizard</i>

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,611
<i>who had come
to collect on their agreement.</i>

50
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,031
<i>She pleaded with the wizard
but it was too late.</i>

51
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:12,951
<i>Above the sea,
the wizard would keep her locked away,</i>

52
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,746
<i>ensuring she would never find true love</i>

53
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,540
<i>and her power would be his...</i>

54
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,249
<i>forever.</i>

55
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,633
If I told you a secret,

56
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,094
would you be able to keep it?

57
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:34,222
- Really, truly, you would keep it?
- Yes.

58
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:37,225
Yes, I would keep my secret.

59
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:41,186
Well, I don't remember the story
exactly like that.

60
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,939
Don't be silly, Grandmother.

61
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:46,775
Everybody knows
there's no such thing as mermaids.

62
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:49,778
You wouldn't say that if you had met one.

63
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,489
You've met a mermaid?

64
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:54,199
Yes.

65
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,200
But you don't believe, so...

66
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:59,286
So why should I tell you the story?

67
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:04,834
You wanna hear it?

68
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:08,587
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!

69
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:09,672
Yes.

70
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:12,091
This begins with a little, little girl.

71
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,053
And she believed in mermaids
and in fairies and in leprechauns

72
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:19,431
and all magical creatures.

73
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:24,144
And her name was Elle.

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,653
<i>Dear Dr. Malcolm,</i>

77
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:39,032
<i>thank you for your preliminary diagnosis
of my niece Elle.</i>

78
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,911
<i>Life has been difficult
following the loss of her parents.</i>

79
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:45,873
<i>Yet somehow, her spirits remain high,</i>

80
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:51,753
<i>mostly due to her imaginative belief
that she is somehow a mermaid</i>

81
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,713
<i>and that being the reason
for her condition.</i>

82
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,924
<i>But no doctor anywhere seems to know</i>

83
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,509
<i>- what truly ails her.</i>
- Quick, get help!

84
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:01,220
<i>Only that her</i>
<i>breathing patterns worsen.</i>

85
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,765
<i>I fear her life may be in danger.</i>

86
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:07,059
<i>I will continue to search,
in hopes that one day,</i>

87
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:10,020
<i>the mystery behind her condition
is revealed</i>

88
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,563
<i>and a cure is found.</i>

89
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,483
- Breathe. Breathe.
<i>- Faithfully yours, Cam.</i>

90
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,403
Cam, hurry, it's Elle.

91
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,951
It's OK.

92
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:27,161
Elle, it's OK. It's OK.

93
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,330
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

94
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,086
It's OK...

95
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,422
It's OK. Look at me.

96
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,386
You can't push yourself that hard.
I've told you.

97
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,679
I know.

98
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:52,018
It's just that everybody else was...

99
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,394
Playing?

100
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,862
We're gonna find a cure.

101
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:06,406
I promise.

102
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,617
But until then,

103
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,537
you'll have to be more careful.

104
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:53,827
Did you see that?

105
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:55,328
What is it?

106
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,293
- Good morning, Mr. Harrison.
- Good morning, Margaret. Any calls for me?

107
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:03,544
They're on your desk.

108
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,516
Morning, young man.

109
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,019
- Morning, sir.
- How's the story going?

110
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:22,353
Great.

111
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:26,649
Yeah. Well, I want it to stop.
Look, this just came in.

112
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,359
I want it to take priority.

113
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,945
It's the cure-all sweeping the region.

114
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,781
A water from Mississippi
said to have healing powers.

115
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,699
Really? Healing water?

116
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:37,284
I mean,
we've followed stories like this before.

117
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,536
Wood witches? Woken mummies?

118
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,579
They never lead anywhere.

119
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:43,665
No, not like this.
Hundreds of people are testifying.

120
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:45,334
- But, I...
- But nothing.

121
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:47,920
All right, maybe it's true,
maybe it's not.

122
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:50,380
But there's definitely a story here,

123
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:53,799
and, uh, possibly a cure for her.

124
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:55,635
Look, Cam, I know it can't be easy.

125
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:58,679
Coming from, how do you say,
across the pond?

126
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,558
It's already settled.
Travel and accommodations.

127
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,936
Don't just sit there. Get going.
Pack your bags.

128
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,688
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me. Thank, uh... him.

They're here, Elle!

132
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,309
What's taking so long?

133
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,066
We'll only be gone for a few weeks.

134
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,957
I know you'll miss him.
But it won't be for long.

135
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,628
Do you promise?

136
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,422
I promise.

<i>A long journey from home.</i>

138
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,986

for our little adventure</i>

139
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:44,821
<i>into joyful excitement.</i>

140
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:48,950
<i>Seeing the smile on her face
only makes me want to believe.</i>

141
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:52,954
<i>But my logical skepticism runs high
of this Dr. Locke</i>

<i>and his magic mermaid water.</i>

Eh!

Well, let me take... take this from you.

Cameron it is, right?

151
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:55,763
Journalistically speaking, yes.
But you can call me Cam.

152

- And who's this little darling?
- I'm Elle.

Oh, aren't you just

- Thank you.
- And polite, too.

00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,855
Come on, now. Let me show you all inside.

156
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,404
- You have a beautiful home, Lorene.
- My family's owned this home for years.

157
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,863
Let me show you around.

158
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,448
Unh!

159
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,492
Over here is the living area.

160
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,994
And straight through, this is the kitchen.

161
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:23,706
Oh...

162
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:27,252
I already baked these for you. Have some.

163
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,878
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

164
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:31,588
Thank you so much. Thank you.

165
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:34,258
Now, come on,
let me show you the rest of the house.

166
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,928
This is the sleeping quarters.

167
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:40,806
Now, it ain't much,
but it's a bed and a roof.

168
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,768
- It's a perfect, Lorene. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

169
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:47,104
Be kind of nice to have some company.

170
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:51,357
I think we're gonna like it here, Elle.

171
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:55,319
Oh, I forgot.
I haven't shown you guys the garden.

172
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:57,446
Even has a tree-house.

173
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,496
Elle!

174
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:08,874
Elle!

175
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,918
Elle, be careful!

176
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:20,510
Wow!

177
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,517
Isn't this kingdom beautiful?

178
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:31,687
It's princess should be more careful.

179
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:47,869
Praise to Jesus.

180
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:49,621
Come on, dear.

181
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:53,791
Peggy Gene.
Cam, I want you to meet Peggy Gene.

182
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,627
Hi.

183
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,379
Peggy Gene is one of my closest friends.

184
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:00,298
It's very nice to meet you, Peggy Gene.

185
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,258
It is very, very nice to meet you too.

186
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,511
Aww. Who's this little nugget?

187
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:08,764
- I'm Elle.
- Elle.

188
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:11,850
Aren't you the sweetest little apricot
in the land?

189
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,978
Look at you.
Those little cheeks are so cute.

190
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,772
You're like a bug in a rug.

191
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:19,316
You'll have to excuse Peggy Gene.

192
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,068
Oh, I'm sorry.
I haven't been around many people lately.

193
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,403
But ever since that healing water
fixed my leg,

194
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,948
I'm just flitting around
like a little social butterfly.

195
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,158
- Healing water?
- Hmm.

196
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,743
I'd love to talk to you about that.

197
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:34,413
Why, sure. Though Lorene knows
where to find me,

198
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:37,333
but I will be at the church all day long

199
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,669
and I will talk, talk, talk to you, boo,
all about that healing water.

200
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,545
And if you like,
I can invite some other people

201
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,965
'cause I understand you're making a story.

202
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:48,009
Hey, Peggy Gene, Peggy Gene.
I'll see you tomorrow at the church.

203
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,179
Yes, yes.
I'll see you tomorrow at the church. OK.

204
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:53,014
See you both. I'll see you tomorrow.

205
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,183
- OK, you take care now. All right.
- OK.

206
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:57,518
Come on, let's get some of this nice food
I told you about.

207
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,479
Well. Hi, Eugene.

208
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:02,564
- Howdy, Lorene.
- All right.

209
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:04,483
Here, sweetie.
You say you like them wrapped...

210
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:06,193
So you really do
know everyone in town, huh?

211
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:08,153
Pretty much.

212
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,198
Well, outside of those that are
coming here about that healing water.

213
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:13,993
<i>I understand that's why you're here too.</i>

214
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:15,994
You ready?

215
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:17,161
Let's go.

216
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:18,246
Come on.

217
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:19,304
Hello.

218
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:21,181
Hi.

219
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:23,975
What's your name?

220
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,019
- I'm Elle.
- Elle?

221
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:28,062
Can you read mine?

222
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,563
Of course, child.

223
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:33,942
You are special in all the world.

224
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,489
There's a powerful magic... in you.

225
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:44,036
A spirit of the ocean.

226
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,292
You should keep these.

227
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:52,877
Thank you.

228
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,510
And what about you? You don't believe
in all this magic, do you?

229
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,805
I'm skeptical.

230
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,098
Come, see.

231
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,268
There is some magic

232
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,229
that is real.

233
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,315
And some...

234
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,443
that is illusion.

235
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,654
Whoa!

236
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,957
Beware of the one who will try
and take your most precious treasure.

237
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,876
You must not let him.

238
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,762
Well, the show is about to start.

239
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:50,056
You don't want to miss this.

240
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,312
Thank you.

241
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:57,939
You're welcome.

242
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:01,984
Bye!

243
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,611
This place is very strange.

244
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:30,428
Step right up. Step right up.

245
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:34,056
Come and witness the magic.
Witness the wonder.

246
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:39,811
Ladies and gentlemen.

247
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:44,399
Come one, come all, to the shop of art.

248
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:47,777
Feast your eyes on that
which you've never seen.

249
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:51,364
It is said that they are pure myth,

250
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,657
pure legend.

251
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:57,495
But my dear friends, let me introduce you

252
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,914
to your dreams.

253
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,874
Alive,

254
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,251
breathing

255
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,337
and swimming.

256
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:09,423
The little mermaid of the Mississippi.

257
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,058
Elle. Elle.

258
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,227
Elle.

259
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:18,697
She was real.

260
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,534
It's just, uh, cheap tricks, Elle.

261
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,704
There are no cheap parlor tricks here.

262
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,393
Fairy Floss!

263
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:54,564
One please.

264
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:01,778
Thank you.

265
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:06,116
The fairies worked really hard
to make this.

266
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,534
I'm sure they did.

267
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:26,260
What?

268
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:28,262
Sorry to bother you, I...

269
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:30,890
I was just wondering if I could buy...

270
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:33,517
Can you read? "Sold out."

271
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:40,315
What?

272
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,567
It's just, um, sold out till when?

273
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:44,361
Till further notice.

274
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,908
Well, he was polite.

275
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,623
Can I ride? Please?

276
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,500
I don't think you're big enough.

277
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:01,835
Am so!

278
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:35,617
Man, I'm ten times stronger
than the Strong Man.

279
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:38,036
Have you seen these? Bam! Bam!

280
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:40,247
Well, well, look at this.

281
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,874
I've never seen a freak so pretty.

282
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,751
She isn't a freak.

283
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:46,712
She's a fake.

284
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:51,799
Whatever she is, she sure is sweet.

285
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,094
Hey, leave her alone.

286
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:56,512
What you gonna do about it?

287
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:57,972
Better take a step back.

288
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:01,142
Pretty scary, foreigner.

289
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:19,534
We'll take it from here.

290
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,720
Did you see me?

291
00:22:40,012 --> 00:22:41,346
How high I got?

292
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:43,390
You're such a big girl now.

293
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:46,684
Come on. Let's go.

294
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:52,231
So Elle believed the mermaid was real?

295
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:54,108
She knew it was real.

296
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:56,068
I know too.

297
00:22:58,404 --> 00:22:59,906
And what about Cam?

298
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:04,868
Cam, like most grownups,
needed more proof of the impossible.

299
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:07,537
And that's the thing
about what you believe.

300
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:10,040
There's a whole other world
out there to see.

301
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:13,043
And Cam just had to figure that out.

302
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:17,255
I still can't believe
I saw an actual mermaid.

303
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:21,967
She was so beautiful
and I know she was real.

304
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:25,012
Can we see her again tomorrow?

305
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:26,889
Can I meet her?

306
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,017
Elle, we talked about that.

307
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:33,145
What you saw was just a trick.

308
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:40,443
You believe what you want
and I'll believe what I want.

309
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,863
And I believe she was real.

310
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:46,324
All right. Good night.

311
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:48,034
Sleep well.

312
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:50,119
- Cam?
- Yes?

313
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:53,248
I wish Mom and Dad could have seen her.

314
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:54,624
Me too.

315
00:23:57,918 --> 00:23:58,919
But, wait.

316
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:02,464
How can the mermaid live
if she's not in the sea?

317
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,841
Have you ever heard of a sea lamprey?

318
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:09,930
Well, it's a fish that can live
in both river and sea.

319
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:12,057
Lets you know that nothing is impossible,

320
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,434
especially here in Mississippi.

321
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:17,270
It has that certain magic about it.

322
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:22,108
That's a good one.

323
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:25,236
You both will enjoy that one.

324
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:42,836
So what happened
after you drank the water?

325
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:45,463
Well, I'm not crazy anymore.

326
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:51,595
I was deaf as can be
before I drank the water.

327
00:24:51,678 --> 00:24:53,721
And you haven't been experiencing
any side effects?

328
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,015
I can do this.

329
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:07,109
What happened after you drank the water?

330
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:10,612
Well, I was having migraines.
Now I just get headaches.

331
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:13,156
It's real magic, I think.

332
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,492
Magic.

333
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,786
M- M-M-Magic.

334
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,038
Magic, huh?

335
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:26,169
Believe it or not, I was darn near bald
before I took the water.

336
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:30,213
I never thought I'd fall in love again.

337
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:32,174
Now I seem to love everyone.

338
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:36,136
What do you think about the magician?

339
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:38,805
Oh, I think he's wonderful.

340
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:42,059
So dark and mysterious and handsome too.

341
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:43,810
I prefer the mermaid.

342
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:46,771
Sorry, what was the question?

343
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:51,609
<i>Probability... Hoax.</i>

344
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,625
Hello.

345
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:11,711
Cam Harrison.

346
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,551
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

347
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:25,766
Please.

348
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:27,851
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

349
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:36,402
So, Mr. Locke, is it?

350
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:43,866
Firstly, I wanted to ask you
about the healing water.

351
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:45,910
Can you tell me what it does for people?

352
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:48,871
By now, you must have asked my customers.

353
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:51,082
What did they tell you?

354
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,751
They had some unusual stories, yes, but...

355
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:56,421
You do not believe.

356
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,215
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

357
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:02,426
Where is it from? How do you make it?

358
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:07,472
The first rule of magic,
is to never reveal the how or the why.

359
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:09,558
But it's not magic, is it?

360
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:13,812
Surely, if it works,
there must be some medical formula.

361
00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:16,690
If you do not believe,
then why are you here?

362
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:21,193
Apologies if I've offended you.

363
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,404
I'm just writing for my readers.

364
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:26,824
Let's try some other questions.

365
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,454
Can you tell me about...

366
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:36,499
the mermaid?

367
00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:41,921
It appears your time is up, Cam Harrison.

368
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:43,047
Please...

369
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,790
The blue fairy makes the blue flower.

370
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,210
The pink fairy makes the pink flower.

371
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:25,630
The white fairy makes the white flower.

372
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:28,633
And the yellow fairy
makes the yellow flower.

373
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:30,759
Yes. I know. I know.

374
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,682
We really shouldn't be out here
much longer, Elle.

375
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,267
I don't think it's a good idea.

376
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,895
Lorene's gonna be looking for us
and I don't want to get stuck out

377
00:28:41,978 --> 00:28:43,688
in the middle of the woods.

378
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:49,235
- Wait, Elle.
- Hey! Hey, you!

379
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:54,448
You're...

380
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,703
You're the mermaid.

381
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:01,539
I am.

382
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:03,749
But...

383
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,627
How do you have legs?

384
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:10,588
Well, mermaids get their legs
every low tide.

385
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:12,924
But... shh!

386
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:14,342
It's a secret.

387
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:16,886
I won't tell.

388
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:21,850
You know, where I come from,
we have a fairy tale.

389
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:25,310
About a little girl born on land,

390
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:28,897
blessed with the heart of a mermaid.

391
00:29:30,732 --> 00:29:31,817
Right, uh...

392
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:37,239
So what were you doing in the woods?

393
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,742
Am I not allowed
to go for a walk in the woods?

394
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:43,828
- So...
- What's your name?

395
00:29:44,412 --> 00:29:45,913
Elizabeth.

396
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:47,290
I'm Elle.

397
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:50,626
This is Cam. He's my uncle.

398
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:03,346
I'm sorry, I have to go.

399
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:07,976
See?

400
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,978
I told you she was real.

401
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,114
I told you. You do what I say.

402
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,494
- Stop!
- Stay out of this!

403
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:29,997
Strike me then.

404
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,583
As you wish, darling.

405
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:34,793
Enough!

406
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,131
That is enough for today.

407
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,224
But I cannot promise
what tomorrow may bring.

408
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,562
As for you,

409
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,273
do not meddle in my affairs.

410
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:37,117
It's OK, girl.

411
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:42,664
Why are you so afraid?

412
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,841
It's OK.

413
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:11,649
I don't know what she is
but she is special.

414
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:14,194
Good girl.

415
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:21,742
What did you see?

416
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:26,080
Something I haven't seen
in a very long time.

417
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:29,375
She may be the one we're searching for.

418
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,545
What are we gonna do about it?

419
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:36,215
We wait.

420
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:37,758
Now, leave me.

You?

461
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:28,392
What are you doing here?

462
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:30,185
Sorry, I...

463
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:33,439
The place was closed and I...

464
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:36,191
You shouldn't be here.

465
00:37:37,317 --> 00:37:39,027
He knows everything.

466
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,194
Who knows?

467
00:37:40,486 --> 00:37:42,030
What are you talking about?

468
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:51,789
Cam Harrison.

469
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,250
I just had some further questions
about the show,

470
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:57,294
about the healing water.

471
00:37:57,836 --> 00:38:00,339
I wish I could help you. Truly, I do.

472
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:02,049
But we are closed.

473
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:03,800
Now if you do not mind...

474
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:14,268
I really hope not to find you
trespassing again.

475
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:34,913
Stay away from her.

476
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:37,165
Who is he? And who is she?

477
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,000
It doesn't matter.

478
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,377
- I don't...
- You shouldn't be here.

479
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,420
Look, I know something strange
is happening. Whatever secrets...

480
00:38:42,504 --> 00:38:43,963
Just go.

481
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:46,216
Go.

482
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:56,141
All aboard!

483
00:38:57,643 --> 00:38:59,895
Now, this here's
the pride of the Mississippi.

484
00:38:59,978 --> 00:39:02,898
Well, you heard what the man said.
All aboard.

485
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,698
I wonder if we'll see a mermaid
in the river.

486
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:13,282
Keep your eyes posted.

487
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:15,159
You got it, Captain.

488
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:18,079
Well, while you two are mermaid watching,

489
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:20,581
I'll be in the study
doing some actual work.

490
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:22,750
Whatever you say, first mate.

491
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:23,835
OK.

492
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:30,966
Mermaids...

493
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:35,137
do not...

494
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,932
exist.

495
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:26,059
What are you working on?

496
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:27,436
Nothing.

497
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:32,399
It's just... It's just some story I...

498
00:40:32,483 --> 00:40:33,984
I like stories.

499
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:36,695
I... I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

500
00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:39,363
It says you don't believe in mermaids.

501
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:41,073
It's a work in progress.

502
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:43,159
I wasn't really expecting someone to be...

503
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,703
to be rummaging through my things.

504
00:40:45,787 --> 00:40:47,955
Well, you're the one
who's always following me.

505
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,961
You know, I'm...

506
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,088
I'm... I'm surprised
you're on this boat at all.

507
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,674
Then again,
you must get tired of the water,

508
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,344
being an actual mermaid and all.

509
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:07,390
Water is a part of me, I guess.

510
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:09,434
Part of us all.

511
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,062
When I was little,

512
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:14,648
my mother would swim with me.

513
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:18,234
Deep into the ocean,
further than most would go.

514
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,697
I remember looking through the water,

515
00:41:25,574 --> 00:41:28,244
wondering what it must be like
on the other side.

516
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:29,912
Yeah.

517
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:33,082
When I was born,

518
00:41:33,706 --> 00:41:36,000
our family would go
to the beach every summer.

519
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:39,629
I remember wishing we'd get caught
in a whirlpool,

520
00:41:40,004 --> 00:41:41,923
stuck in a time warp and...

521
00:41:43,091 --> 00:41:45,677
somehow just... just last forever.

522
00:41:47,095 --> 00:41:48,721
It's my favorite memory of us.

523
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:52,057
Before Elle got sick...

524
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:57,563
and the accident happened.

525
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:02,442
Now, I...

526
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:06,822
I just want to keep her safe.

527
00:42:07,197 --> 00:42:08,782
My father was the same.

528
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:12,660
She's special.

529
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:15,663
She's strong.

530
00:42:16,205 --> 00:42:17,582
I'll try and remember that.

531
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,543
She's all I have left.

532
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:24,547
The reason I'm here.

533
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:29,676
The healing water, is it...

534
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:33,847
Is it real?

535
00:42:34,472 --> 00:42:36,808
I believe there's magic
in a lot of things,

536
00:42:38,393 --> 00:42:39,769
water being one of them.

537
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:43,398
But not his.

538
00:42:44,774 --> 00:42:45,941
Not Locke's.

539
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:51,947
The dance is starting!

540
00:42:53,157 --> 00:42:54,491
Elizabeth?

541
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,452
Come dance with me.

542
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,972
Hold on.

543
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:19,223
All together.

544
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,032
Peggy Gene, are you OK?

545
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:38,867
Listen.

546
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,826
It fades.

547
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,412
- What does?
- The magic.

548
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,456
It doesn't last.

549
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,459
You be careful with that man,
do you understand me?

550
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,212
Don't you let him near the apricot.

551
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,880
She will rot.

552
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,883
Don't you let that apricot rot,
do you understand me?

553
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,968
I won't.

554
00:44:11,731 --> 00:44:13,024
- No.
- Come here.

555
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:17,569
Here, let Cam show you.

556
00:44:18,946 --> 00:44:21,198
I'm afraid I'm not a very good dancer.

557
00:44:34,878 --> 00:44:36,170
Sorry. I'm sorry.

558
00:44:43,302 --> 00:44:45,471
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

559
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:49,308
The moon. Come.

560
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:26,260
Why are you always
staring at me like that?

561
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:28,095
Because I want to see you.

562
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:30,930
Don't you want me to see you?

563
00:45:31,014 --> 00:45:32,766
It's not that, it's just, um...

564
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:37,061
A little, you know...

565
00:45:37,979 --> 00:45:39,272
intense.

566
00:45:42,776 --> 00:45:45,111
Well, if you don't look,
then how do you see?

567
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,614
How do you really see a person?

568
00:45:50,574 --> 00:45:52,493
We should be free
to open our eyes and look.

569
00:45:52,576 --> 00:45:54,536
You can't take that away from us.

570
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,789
Who can't? Locke, you mean?

571
00:45:58,582 --> 00:46:01,168
I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

572
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:04,046
You know, you don't have
to apologize all the time.

573
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:07,131
You're right. I'm sorry, I mean...

574
00:46:13,513 --> 00:46:14,680
Look.

575
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:17,475
- Isn't it...
- Beautiful.

576
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:45,918
Looks like the wheel is stuck.
We'll have to wait for high tide.

577
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:48,254
- High tide?
- Yeah.

578
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:52,091
Sorry, I have to go.

579
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:53,968
Elizabeth.

580
00:46:58,514 --> 00:46:59,765
Elizabeth!

581
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,768
You're afraid.

582
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,728
They always are.

583
00:48:35,563 --> 00:48:36,731
You're...

584
00:48:39,692 --> 00:48:42,487
- How can this be?
- You won't understand.

585
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:43,655
I...

586
00:48:45,073 --> 00:48:46,282
I want to.

587
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:48,826
It happened a long time ago.

588
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:52,204
I was free.

589
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:56,041
I lived with my family in the sea.

590
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:57,793
I was tricked.

591
00:49:00,045 --> 00:49:02,589
He took a part of me and he has it still.

592
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:06,551
So wherever he goes, I must.

593
00:49:07,427 --> 00:49:08,719
We're bonded.

594
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:10,346
Locke?

595
00:49:12,932 --> 00:49:15,267
For years,
he's taken me from town to town.

596
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:19,063
Selling the water I swim in
as healing water.

597
00:49:19,313 --> 00:49:21,774
So that's where he gets it. You.

598
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:23,609
Yes, but you shouldn't get involved.

599
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:25,820
Well, I think it's too late for that.

600
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:29,197
Why can't you just run away? Escape him?

601
00:49:29,698 --> 00:49:31,116
We're connected.

602
00:49:32,575 --> 00:49:35,870
As long as he has part of me with him,
there's no escape.

603
00:49:35,954 --> 00:49:37,455
There has to be something...

604
00:49:38,415 --> 00:49:39,791
a way, somehow.

605
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,501
There is.

606
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:58,058
What's wrong?

607
00:49:58,517 --> 00:49:59,768
It's Locke.

608
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,104
He knows I'm here. He's summoning me.

609
00:50:02,604 --> 00:50:04,230
No, no. You can't go back to him.

610
00:50:04,814 --> 00:50:07,483
You don't understand, I have to. I'm his.

611
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:08,860
No, Elizabeth.

612
00:50:09,277 --> 00:50:10,486
I'm sorry, Cam.

613
00:50:17,744 --> 00:50:19,912
<i>So Cam believed now, right?</i>

614
00:50:20,413 --> 00:50:24,583
He did.
He had to believe what his eyes saw.

615
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:27,544
Despite every logical bone in his body,

616
00:50:27,627 --> 00:50:29,421
he couldn't deny the truth,

617
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:34,051
and that kiss was still in his mind.

618
00:50:35,343 --> 00:50:37,679
But there was much
that he did not understand,

619
00:50:37,763 --> 00:50:40,097
especially when it came to Locke.

620
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,774
Thank God.
I've had half the town looking for you.

621
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:52,568
- Why? What happened?
- Well...

622
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:55,112
- I-
- I was wondering what happened to you

623
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:57,864
- and I left Elle in the room playing.
- What happened?

624
00:50:57,989 --> 00:50:59,532
- And then... And then when I went back...
- Lorene, what happened?

625
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,493
- And then when I went back she...
- What happened, Lorene?

626
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:03,453
She was gone and the window was open!

627
00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:15,672
Where is she?

628
00:51:15,714 --> 00:51:17,925
I don't know. I don't know, Cam.

629
00:51:50,623 --> 00:51:52,415
Why does he have you trapped in here?

630
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:55,001
Did you do something wrong?

631
00:51:55,669 --> 00:51:56,837
No.

632
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:00,090
He said I had the heart of a mermaid

633
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,884
and that was a powerful kind of magic.

634
00:52:02,968 --> 00:52:05,804
You do. I see it too.

635
00:52:07,848 --> 00:52:09,224
But be careful.

636
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:12,893
He's not like you and I. He's a bad man.

637
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:14,603
Do you understand?

638
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:19,817
When I was young, I was just like you.

639
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:23,571
When I'm older,
I want to be just like you.

640
00:52:25,156 --> 00:52:26,365
Oh, he's coming.

641
00:52:27,032 --> 00:52:29,075
You'll be OK, just remember what I said.

642
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:30,243
OK.

643
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:52,097
Let her go.

644
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:53,432
I cannot.

645
00:52:54,266 --> 00:52:56,768
You see, she's the one
I've been searching for.

646
00:52:57,102 --> 00:52:59,188
You don't need her, you have me.

647
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:00,397
You?

648
00:53:01,064 --> 00:53:03,108
I plan to rid you from this earth...

649
00:53:03,734 --> 00:53:05,526
and take your powers...

650
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:08,237
once and for all.

651
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:42,394
Go, go, go, go. Go find Elle.

652
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:06,376
Elizabeth tells me you wish
to be like her.

653
00:54:06,918 --> 00:54:08,169
Is this true?

654
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:13,174
What if I could make it so?

655
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:44,287
What if I could grant you any wish
you so desire...

656
00:54:48,082 --> 00:54:51,294
in exchange for a simple thing?

657
00:54:54,754 --> 00:54:55,839
Anything?

658
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:00,593
Anything you can dream of.

659
00:55:04,973 --> 00:55:06,474
You won't trick me.

660
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,269
You're not like us.

661
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:12,063
You just wanna control everyone.

662
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,485
In time, you will find
that I can be most persuasive.

663
00:55:43,676 --> 00:55:45,094
I know where she is.

664
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:49,890
It's all right, come with me.

665
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,902
They said you would come for me.

666
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,030
I'm gonna get you out of here.

667
00:56:06,656 --> 00:56:09,909
- Where'd they put the keys?
- The guard has them.

668
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:11,869
Over there.

669
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,749
It's all right.
We're gonna get you out of here. OK?

670
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,764
It's sold out.

671
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,899
Sold...

672
00:56:54,993 --> 00:56:56,161
Let's go, let's go.

673
00:56:56,912 --> 00:57:00,916
Locke knows Elizabeth told you.
He won't stop coming. Not now.

674
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:02,625
We have to save her.

675
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,752
- We have to save Elizabeth.
- We will, Elle.

676
00:57:05,128 --> 00:57:08,714
She can't leave without her soul.
If she does, she dies.

677
00:57:09,173 --> 00:57:11,342
Locke keeps it hidden somewhere safe.

678
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:13,094
I don't know where it is.

679
00:57:14,095 --> 00:57:15,930
I think I know where that might be.

680
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:17,014
Come on.

681
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:56,468
That's it.

682
00:58:05,727 --> 00:58:06,978
Easy.

683
00:58:07,812 --> 00:58:08,980
He's with us.

684
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:12,108
It's time.

685
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:14,860
We can trust him.

686
00:58:22,785 --> 00:58:26,622
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you

687
00:58:28,665 --> 00:58:30,501
to your dreams...

688
00:58:42,595 --> 00:58:44,680
We have to hurry,
I can't hold it for very long.

689
00:59:24,593 --> 00:59:25,886
Wow!

690
00:59:35,937 --> 00:59:37,063
We have to hurry.

691
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:39,023
But I can't.

692
00:59:52,077 --> 00:59:53,871
How is that possible?

693
00:59:55,622 --> 00:59:56,832
It won't last long.

694
00:59:56,915 --> 00:59:58,458
It'll be high tide soon.

695
01:00:16,058 --> 01:00:17,977
- You must go.
- Wait.

696
01:00:19,312 --> 01:00:20,897
There's something we have to do.

697
01:00:22,188 --> 01:00:23,398
Come on.

698
01:00:41,081 --> 01:00:42,249
She's free.

699
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:43,542
Let's go.

700
01:01:13,196 --> 01:01:14,739
- You OK?
- So what now?

701
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:16,782
We have to get you to the ocean.

702
01:01:17,032 --> 01:01:19,076
How long do we have
before time begins again?

703
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:20,827
With Locke, it's uncertain.

704
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:22,579
Then we need to move.

705
01:01:23,664 --> 01:01:26,333
The train! Should be a straight shot
from the station.

706
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:29,044
Harbor trains run toward the ocean. Hurry.

707
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,588
Cam, wait.

708
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:34,882
Cam.

709
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:38,427
I'm too old to be jumping on trains.

710
01:01:38,844 --> 01:01:39,971
I'll just hold you back.

711
01:01:40,054 --> 01:01:41,347
You're one of a kind, Lorene.

712
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:42,848
Thank you.

713
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:46,686
- Bye.
- Bye.

714
01:01:47,061 --> 01:01:48,104
Good luck, Cam.

715
01:01:48,187 --> 01:01:49,981
- Take good care of her.
- The train is picking up pace...

716
01:01:50,064 --> 01:01:51,565
- Let's go.
- ...we have to hurry.

717
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,042
We can make it.

718
01:02:34,313 --> 01:02:35,690
It's OK. Here.

719
01:02:45,324 --> 01:02:46,325
Here.

720
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,551
I think this belongs to you.

721
01:03:34,037 --> 01:03:35,413
Thank you.

722
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,836
Thank you all.

723
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:44,046
We had to do something.

724
01:03:45,881 --> 01:03:47,466
Seventeen years.

725
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:50,844
He found me when I was young.

726
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:53,347
Promised he could help me.

727
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:55,766
Help me not be so...

728
01:03:57,226 --> 01:03:58,268
different.

729
01:03:58,811 --> 01:04:00,145
He promised me the same.

730
01:04:01,229 --> 01:04:03,481
Found me trying to block out
all the world's thoughts

731
01:04:03,564 --> 01:04:04,899
and said that he could fix it...

732
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:07,777
if I just listened to him.

733
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,405
There is nothing wrong with who you are.

734
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:19,621
You must really miss your families.

735
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,958
I'm glad you have this one.

736
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:34,010
Come one, come all.

737
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:35,971
Let me introduce you

738
01:04:36,304 --> 01:04:38,139
to your dreams.

739
01:04:38,514 --> 01:04:39,515
Alive,

740
01:04:40,141 --> 01:04:41,142
breathing,

741
01:04:42,017 --> 01:04:42,935
swimming.

742
01:04:43,477 --> 01:04:46,063
The little mermaid of the Mississippi.

743
01:04:58,074 --> 01:04:59,284
Elizabeth!

744
01:05:14,965 --> 01:05:16,091
They have it!

745
01:05:16,842 --> 01:05:17,926
The soul!

746
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,138
They're on a train headed for the ocean.
Boys are going after them right now.

747
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:22,389
Stop them.

748
01:05:23,015 --> 01:05:25,225
And this time, once and for all.

749
01:05:26,143 --> 01:05:27,352
You got it, boss.

750
01:05:36,402 --> 01:05:37,612
They're here.

751
01:05:44,493 --> 01:05:45,620
Stay back!

752
01:06:20,236 --> 01:06:21,528
Elizabeth, look out.

753
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,080
It's OK.

754
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:45,175
We have to go.

755
01:06:46,134 --> 01:06:47,135
Now.

756
01:06:51,848 --> 01:06:53,433
There's a truck close by.

757
01:07:11,993 --> 01:07:14,328
- There are no keys.
- We don't need keys.

758
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:20,042
Stay with Elizabeth.

759
01:07:56,452 --> 01:08:00,121
Elle? Elle, it's OK, it's OK.
It's OK, I've got the medication.

760
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:02,623
It's not here.

761
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:05,293
Stop! We left the medicine on the train.

762
01:08:07,795 --> 01:08:09,172
- I'm not leaving.
- Come on. Let's go.

763
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:10,715
- Elle, we're going. Let's go.
- No!

764
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:12,759
I'm staying! I'm staying.

765
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:14,927
Come on, Elle, come on! Let's go. Come on!

766
01:08:15,011 --> 01:08:17,346
I'm staying. Elizabeth...

767
01:08:18,305 --> 01:08:19,473
She's my friend.

768
01:08:24,478 --> 01:08:26,688
Stop treating me like a little girl.

769
01:08:27,022 --> 01:08:28,357
I can make it further.

770
01:08:32,736 --> 01:08:33,819
Just trust me.

771
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:37,740
This once.

772
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:40,451
All right, Elle.

773
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:42,912
I trust you.

774
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:45,623
We have to go.

775
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,166
Go.

776
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:53,963
He's close.

777
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,719
Keep moving. I'll take care of him.

778
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:01,429
No, you can't.

779
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,391
You don't have a choice. Now go.

780
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:07,769
Go!

781
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,912
I've been waiting a long time for this.

782
01:09:28,413 --> 01:09:31,290
Man against monster.

783
01:09:35,711 --> 01:09:37,088
You wish.

784
01:09:49,558 --> 01:09:51,560
There's nobody here to save you now.

785
01:09:51,643 --> 01:09:52,811
You neither.

786
01:10:32,474 --> 01:10:33,641
It's starting.

787
01:10:35,685 --> 01:10:37,395
We have to hurry, she's changing.

788
01:10:58,749 --> 01:11:00,416
We have to get her to the ocean.

789
01:11:06,672 --> 01:11:07,673
How much further?

790
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,217
Just past the trees.

791
01:11:09,592 --> 01:11:10,885
You have to hurry.

792
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:32,697
We're stuck.

793
01:11:37,409 --> 01:11:38,661
Can you carry her?

794
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:40,162
Yeah.

795
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:43,082
Here we go.

796
01:11:53,716 --> 01:11:54,842
You need to get to the ocean.

797
01:11:55,343 --> 01:11:56,719
What about you?

798
01:11:56,803 --> 01:11:58,513
I can take care of our old friend here.

799
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:00,181
Buy you some time.

800
01:12:19,116 --> 01:12:21,118
I had such great hopes for you.

801
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:24,621
Such a disappointment.

802
01:12:24,705 --> 01:12:28,041
You hoped that I would be cruel like you.

803
01:12:29,793 --> 01:12:33,963
You know better than anyone,
no two souls are the same.

804
01:12:34,297 --> 01:12:35,923
Indeed they aren't.

805
01:12:36,674 --> 01:12:39,510
One is always darker.

806
01:12:40,678 --> 01:12:42,138
You won't win this time.

807
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,850
Let it be light versus night.

808
01:12:57,569 --> 01:13:01,239
There is no power
greater than mine.

809
01:13:16,003 --> 01:13:17,004
Oh, no.

810
01:13:23,594 --> 01:13:24,802
No.

811
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:29,390
She's free. She doesn't belong to you.

812
01:13:29,474 --> 01:13:32,393
Nothing in this world is free,
Cam Harrison.

813
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:36,397
It's all right. It's all right.

814
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:38,107
I won't let them take you.

815
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:42,570
She's good! She's not like you!

816
01:13:42,654 --> 01:13:44,488
I won't let you have her!

817
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:07,593
Take it.

818
01:14:08,469 --> 01:14:09,637
No, no.

819
01:14:11,138 --> 01:14:12,807
Locke's powers grow with it.

820
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:15,101
So can yours.

821
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:17,478
No, no. You're too weak.

822
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:21,106
It's the only way.

823
01:14:53,262 --> 01:14:55,097
Her soul is mine.

824
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:00,351
Pity they must now die.

825
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:05,523
My powers are forever!

826
01:15:06,357 --> 01:15:10,486
Not you or anyone else on this earth
can defeat me.

827
01:15:17,868 --> 01:15:19,244
I believe.

828
01:15:40,347 --> 01:15:41,849
What have they done to me?

829
01:15:43,726 --> 01:15:45,060
Magic.

830
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:09,500
Now, he is imprisoned.

831
01:16:12,961 --> 01:16:14,213
Elizabeth.

832
01:16:17,382 --> 01:16:18,675
She needs water!

833
01:16:22,554 --> 01:16:24,681
Give her to me. It's all right.

834
01:16:25,599 --> 01:16:26,682
It's all right.

835
01:16:54,584 --> 01:16:55,669
The vial.

836
01:17:00,715 --> 01:17:02,967
Elizabeth, please...

837
01:17:05,511 --> 01:17:06,846
Come on.

838
01:17:39,751 --> 01:17:40,752
Elle?

839
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:44,256
Elle? Elle? It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

840
01:17:44,339 --> 01:17:46,049
Take a breath. Breathe.

841
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,640
Shh. Shh.

842
01:17:55,475 --> 01:17:56,602
You're OK.

843
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:57,935
Let me take her.

844
01:17:58,603 --> 01:17:59,979
The water can heal her.

845
01:18:00,062 --> 01:18:01,606
- You're OK.
- Shh... shh... shh.

846
01:18:02,773 --> 01:18:04,400
You're OK.

847
01:18:04,775 --> 01:18:06,068
It's OK.

848
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:46,815
Thank you.

849
01:18:57,325 --> 01:18:58,993
Deep water is magic,

850
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:01,621
just like her love.

851
01:19:03,498 --> 01:19:04,999
Whenever she can't breathe,

852
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,752
all she need do is swim.

853
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:20,931
I'll miss you.

854
01:20:53,393 --> 01:20:55,479
I see you found your story.

855
01:20:55,562 --> 01:20:58,065
{\An8}
Think anyone will believe it?

856
01:20:59,024 --> 01:21:01,984
All that matters is that you do.

857
01:21:04,904 --> 01:21:06,322
Come outside and play.

858
01:21:06,405 --> 01:21:08,449
All the fairies are out today.

859
01:21:09,116 --> 01:21:12,203
And they love mermaids.

860
01:21:17,249 --> 01:21:18,833
Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

861
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:20,293
No!

862
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:21,461
Come on.

863
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,264
All that matters is that you do.

864
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:39,770
<i>And she gave him</i>
<i>the biggest gift</i>

865
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:41,939
<i>a person could ever give another...</i>

866
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,273
Love.

867
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,276
So from that time on,

868
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,237
no matter where he went,

869
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:50,614
she was with him. Mm-hmm.

870
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,117
Now that's another story. OK.

871
01:21:58,412 --> 01:22:00,123
What happened to Elle?

872
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:04,710
Are you OK, grandmother?

873
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,379
Just time for a swim.

874
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:12,467
How'd the story end?

875
01:22:14,177 --> 01:22:16,179
Let's go... I don't know.

876
01:22:17,055 --> 01:22:18,056
Come on.

877
01:22:18,598 --> 01:22:19,724
We'll go see.

878
01:22:23,186 --> 01:22:24,646
Let's go. Come on.

879
01:22:40,911 --> 01:22:42,329
Grandmother?
