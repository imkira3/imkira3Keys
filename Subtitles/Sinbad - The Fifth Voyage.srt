00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,600
<i>Having sailed the trick
of this journey and back,</i>

3
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>I once again enjoyed the quiet life.</i>

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,200
<i>But soon I became tired then weary,</i>

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,220
<i>and longed for
the oceans and adventures.</i>

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,300
<i>My story begins with...</i>

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,850
<i>my Fifth Voyage.</i>

8
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,400
.

9
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,580
.

10
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,730
<i>A very familiar scent of darkness and evil filled the air.</i>

11
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,690
Why don't you think hear I can't?

12
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,780
It's...
the black magic, Captain Sinbad.

13
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,620
If we land, we'll all die.

14
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,600
Captain, let's sail away from this place.

15
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
We should really leave.

16
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,300
We don't know that yet.

17
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,790
I visit the palace.

18
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,500
- Zohreh!
- Captain Sinbad!
- What happened here?

19
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,340
Come with me. Bring your men.
I will tell you inside.

20
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,000
.

21
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,770
<i>The Sultan was like a father to me,
and the princess was my life.</i>

22
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,500
<i>For the pleasure of his Maleks majesty the Sultan, and his court,</i>

23
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,200
<i>may I present...
a Sultan's feature.</i>

24
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,700
Your beloved guests...

25
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,660
and magnificent of Majesty,

26
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,120
I am honored
to be stood to the Court of Maleks.

27
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Tonight, I will deliver
such a performance...

28
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,790
that will bring true joy
and delight to our Princess.

29
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,520
This small crate contains nothing
more than some sand from my home.

30
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,440
But be more
and reality shall shape time.

31
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,020
That was truly astounded!

32
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,310
Tell me, Hassan. How did you
perform such wizardry?

33
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,900
And, that crate. What is it?

34
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,530
Your Majesty, on my promise...

35
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,280
that crate contains nothing
more than some sand from my home,

36
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,700
I confess.

37
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,450
But you must allow this humble
magician to keep this one in secret.

38
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,250
Humble?
You set yourself short!

39
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,800
My advisers had told me that you were a man of fantastical power.

40
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,300
And they did not exaggerate.

41
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:25,600
My friend, I promise
you will be amply rewarded
by the end of this glorious evening.

42
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,470
On that I have absolutely no doubt,
Your Majesty.

43
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,600
And now with your indulgence,

44
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,230
I will perform ashman magic,
to the princess,

45
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,980
in honor of her upcoming wedding
with Captain Sinbad.

46
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,600
I can't help what to wonder...

47
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,450
how come he can miss
the beautiful festive moment?

48
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,410
<i>We traveled for many days and nights...</i>

49
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,840
<i>until we finally came to
a great, uninhabited island...</i>

50
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,260
<i>or so we thought.</i>

51
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't leave
without the amulet, Goddess.

52
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,180
It's a little too personal!

53
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,780
Sinbad, we have plenty of gold and jewels.
What is so special about the amulet?

54
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,500
It's going to be my wedding gift
to the princess.

55
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,100
She has won her dream about it.

56
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,000
And now you're making
her dream come true.

57
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,000
Of course!

58
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,920
Men give flowers.
I give magic amulets.

59
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,420
I wish that you wouldn't waste
the power of invisibility on a wedding gift.
I could make much better than you.

60
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,260
Ugh!
You spoke like a true thief, Firoozeh.

61
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,930
We're taking this home.

62
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,200
And now with your indulgent,
I will have my performance
ashman magic to the Princess,

63
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,030
in the honor of her upcoming wedding
 with Captain Sinbad.

64
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,500
I can't help what I wonder...

65
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,670
how come he can miss
the beautiful festive moment?

66
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,380
- By all means.
- Princess.

67
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,300
I can only bring one thing
that's worthy, the beautiful princess.

68
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,860
Like heaven.

69
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,820
For you, butterfly.

70
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,790
Oh, how I wish I could free
this wonderful moment forever!

71
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,400
Your Majesty,
the thought just be!

72
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,800
Come I'll do it in here.

73
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,760
I let you.

74
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,150
Parisa!

75
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,200
Parisa!

76
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,580
Parisa!

77
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,350
Come with me, bring your men.
I will tell you inside.

78
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,500
Zohreh, what happened here?

79
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,150
The amulet to find, do you have it?

80
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,940
Give us the amulet.

81
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,240
But Parisa said
it give the power of invisibility.

82
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,350
Her dream is not easily decipherable
 straight forward.

83
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,790
There is a reason it's called the amulet of life,
 and not the amulet of invisibility.

84
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,900
Treachery!

85
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,640
Your Highness. Zohreh told us everything.
I should have been here.

86
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,980
I fear he's taken her for the Death.

87
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,610
He is not interested in Parisas body.

88
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:40,450
It is her soul he tracks.
He is ​​called the White Deeve.

89
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,800
He is a dark wizard,

90
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,210
who drinks souls of the innocent and
thrive on their energy.

91
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,630
If he steals the princess's soul,

92
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,880
it would be better
if she had never been born.

93
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,000
Where does this White Deev dwell?

94
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,500
He dwells at the center of a great
 island called Macedonia.

95
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,020
It is a dark place.

96
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,480
<i>The old witch explained that
I was the only chance the Sultan has...</i>

97
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:18,400
<i>and that I must travel to
the great black desert in not less than
40 days and 40 nights.</i>

98
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,200
<i>As we sailed into the unknown,</i>

99
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,100
<i>thoughts of the princess was all
I have to keep in me.</i>

100
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,900
- Sinbad, the ship is almost ready.
- Is it?

101
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,500
You can never be together.

102
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,830
The sooner you  accept it,
the better off she'll be.

103
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No princess of Malek can ever love
a common man. It is the law.

104
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,100
There he is again!

105
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,300
Every day in the same spot,
staring like a hungry jack!

106
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,310
I rather like the way
he looks at me.

107
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,220
Guards, lower me!

108
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,940
Don't worry, Zohreh.
The guards will protect me in city sight.

109
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,650
The guards are men.

110
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,700
None of them will care to protect
your virtue like I do, princess.

111
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:36,410
First thing now, remember,
you are a princess.

112
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,350
Well, I suppose if you are determined to see
 your head separated from your neck.

113
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,850
Who is calling me?

114
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:02,560
My eyes are two that see the sea,
but one is off one eye has he.

115
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,690
Only with heart that one is free.

116
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,860
<i>"My eyes are two that see the sea."</i>

117
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,390
<i>My ship sank to the depth of the sea.</i>

118
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,860
Binoculars.

119
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,740
Is there anything on this island
that is gigantic?

120
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,800
You fools, you don't know
what you are doing.

121
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,850
Hey, Captain. We are starving, please.

122
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,460
Hungry men don't ask.
Take it, now!

123
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,210
Stand out now.
That's an order.

124
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
Bird!

125
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,690
Abdul, listen to me. We are told
she's only protecting her eggs.

126
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,400
Stand still.

127
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,660
You'll be okay.
Don't slam it.

128
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,960
Help!
Ah!

129
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,130
Don't! Stand back!
Stand back!

130
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,300
Lets go back to camp.

131
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,140
Zohreh said
this land is prehistoric.

132
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,500
She was right.

133
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,650
We must be
very very weary from now on.

134
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,100
Why didn't you let us
kill the bird?

135
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,320
It wasn't necessary, Mujeed.

136
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,370
Not necessary?
It almost killed Abdul.

137
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,200
Abdul's alive.

138
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:46,550
That kind of thinking makes us
the true monsters, not them.

139
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,840
Yes, Captain.

140
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,650
<i>Parisa, where are you now?</i>

141
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,600
<i>Have a dream of
your beloved Sinbad?</i>

142
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,420
Princess.

143
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,710
Sinbad will be coming for me.
I've foreseen it.

144
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,180
His ship is now
at the bottom of the sea.

145
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,400
And he's swimming...
to the shore of my island.

146
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,820
Ain't...
 suicide?

147
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,530
- What do you want?
- It's not what I want...

148
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,450
but what will be.

149
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,500
I will show you...

150
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,460
what that means.

151
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
You're on it?

152
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,100
No.

153
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,000
Captain.

154
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:25,030
- God be praised, something to drink!
- It looks to be like honey!

155
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,890
I thought you're in fume,
but I'm all out of water.

156
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,750
This is an island.
Sure we'll find water soon.

157
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,700
What island has a desert?

158
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,650
That's a straight of league upon league.

159
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,700
- Where are the other shore?
- Yes, Captain, where is the other shores?

160
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,150
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

161
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,110
Would you like your tongues
to drive those to come?

162
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,530
This is an island.
We will find water. Save it for the desert.

163
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,120
Then I shall slake my thirst
with this honey.

164
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,880
Jamal, you don't know
if it's poison or not.

165
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,800
Begging you pardon, Captain,
but I--

166
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,360
No one moves!
Not one move!

167
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,600
Ugh!

168
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,900
- Aah!
- Virnee, no!

169
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,000
- Move out!
- Ah! No, no, no!

170
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Here! Here!

171
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,980
Aah! Ah!
No!

172
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,140
I wonder if how many weavers
worked on this?

173
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,000
It took years to make, and now
look at it - completely ruined.

174
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,000
Yes.

175
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,310
Why don't we stop to this, belle?

176
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Parisa, I'm not used to navigating
the sea of a woman's heart,

177
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,030
always tasking the ocean.

178
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:44,410
Women aren't that hard to understand, you know.
We want simple things.

179
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,620
Even a princess's style is
precious more than jewels.

180
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:54,600
Just a smile, a poem,
a thing that praises her now and then.

181
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Mm.

182
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,220
The bright moon reflects
your radiant face.

183
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,060
Your snow-capped cheekbones
supply water and grace.

184
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,770
My heavy heart desires
an audience with your face.

185
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,980
I come forward,
I must return.

186
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,070
Your command,
I will embrace.

187
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,850
I am Sinbad.

188
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,100
I know who you are.
I also know why you're here.

189
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,610
Come inside.

190
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,500
Firooz?

191
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,320
Sinbad, my brother's going, right?

192
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,250
Captain, what took you so long?

193
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,100
I thought the creatures are getting you all,

194
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,270
but I see that the villagers here
have treated you well.

195
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,770
Yes, and they are feeding us
very well, too.

196
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,690
- Captain, let's drink... to life.
- To life.

197
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,330
Sinbad,
Your Majesty.

198
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:51,380
My spies have told me that you had
a meeting with my daughter in secret.

199
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,140
Your Majesty, I happily confess...

200
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:04,100
that I love Princess Parisa
and I will do anything to marry her.

201
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,100
You have her to name it,
and it shall be done.
Say what it takes, because I'm...
You have her to name it

202
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,070
- But my name is--
- Sinbad! Your name proceeds you!

203
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,450
My daughter has told me that
you have always treated her as a gentlement,

204
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,660
and that her love is also equal to yours.

205
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,620
It can not be!

206
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:32,630
For though you are a famous man,
you are also a common one.

207
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,840
Father, I don't care.

208
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,000
Imagine, how much your people
would love you...

209
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,060
if you gave your only daughter
to one of them.

210
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,730
What an absolutely threatful idea!

211
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,600
You say that you love this man
today going so,

212
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,900
but how do you think you will feel...

213
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,700
after you have stay a lifetime
in proverty?

214
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,690
Because I will contribute
nothing.

215
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,620
- I would love him till, Father!
- Sinbad,

216
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,000
I will offer you five times the coins
I would have given for your capture,

217
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,840
and a fine ship too,
if you will swear to me...

218
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,090
that you will sail away today and
never see my daughter again.

219
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,000
With all due respect, I think
you know what my answer would be.

220
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,640
Hear me out, Sinbad,
because I am a fair man.

221
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:34,150
I also offer you the chance
to have your wish come true.

222
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,800
You can marry my daughter today,

223
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,030
But one minute after you have been
 pronounced man and wife,

224
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,040
- you will be beheaded.
- Father!

225
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,450
You've never been this barbaric!
 You're lowest from the low.

226
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,400
How could you be so to your
own daughter and the man she loves?!

227
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,340
Because I am Sultan!

228
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,140
This man desires not only you, Parisa.

229
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,930
He is also seeking the fate
of my entire kingdom.

230
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,770
For you are no ordinary girl.

231
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,690
Your future would be entwined forever.

232
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:24,660
And if I lose you,
I lose any chance for a heir of royal blood.

233
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,660
So, choose now, Sinbad!

234
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:41,300
- Is something wrong with the food?
- No, it's a beautiful sky.

235
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,170
Is there something wrong with me?

236
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:50,510
It is written that a man from the sea
distinguish all evil in this unhappy land.

237
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,190
Most men think
altogether is irresistible.

238
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,730
But you have,
you have another posses?

239
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,400
Sinbad. Sinbad.

240
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,720
- Sinbad.
- Firooz, you're alive!

241
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,000
I think I am.

242
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,500
We figure something else.
Lets go! You're coming with me.

243
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,600
Oh, no.
Sinbad, I got an idea. Look.

244
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:30,110
- All I ask is that you wait with me.
- No! You're coming with me. Get up!

245
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,620
No, Sinbad.
This is the only way.

246
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,010
How poor Firooz!

247
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:39,800
So it would seems...
to entertain you...

248
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,520
with another magic trick.

249
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,690
As you know, I'm quite
capable of manipulating time.

250
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,070
Here's your child,

251
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,870
yours and Sinbad.

252
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:12,040
- Why do I know this thing real?
- Because...

253
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:17,630
the power of the human emotions
generates time,

254
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:23,750
in the time and space.

255
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:34,600
I am not powerful enough
to change them.

256
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,270
But...

257
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:45,200
...to catch these pikes and use
them to travel there in time.

258
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,830
I am not powerful enough
but soon there to change.

259
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,550
But my Sinbad still live.

260
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,430
I would need to achieve that way
if they want to,

261
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,180
after we looked at your own fate.

262
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,900
It's too bad.

263
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,650
I see you have none.

264
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:32,450
- Sinbad?
- Firooz, you're alive?

265
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:39,200
- An escaped soul?
- I know who you are.

266
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,330
They know I know what to fight to.
Get in line!

267
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,800
Oh!

268
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,700
You're till alive?

269
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,180
Never mind.
Get up! Get aside!

270
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:04,500
Wait. These are good men, brave and true.
Why are they not in paradise?

271
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,020
They haven't yet to be judged.

272
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:11,690
What have they done to death?
They certainly don't deserve this.

273
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:18,070
There is a curse to all
these creatures. Yours are creatures.

274
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,600
We are destined to walk the sand dunes
in the desert, for all eternity.

275
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:28,460
Move this guy!

276
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,460
Wait!

277
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:37,760
- Are you a bettor?
- Man, I've never had a need.

278
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:44,100
Soon enough you'll belong to me.
You all eventually do.

279
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,000
But you have things to do,
places to go.

280
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,700
If you stuck to a thing,
watch out all these souls off.

281
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,900
So true, Sinbad.

282
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:03,580
Killing is a natural part
of the grand sand...

283
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,290
of life...
and time.

284
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,920
Curse is also part of this world.

285
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,920
But to take a life in an
unnatural manner and curse as well...

286
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,010
is...
called a mighty flip.

287
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,510
Then suppose
I wait tell you this.

288
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:32,100
If I find that White Deev
and kill him,

289
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:39,110
you set these souls free, and
none of them must be done one thing.

290
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:45,250
And if you loose?

291
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:51,120
If I loose, I would take your place
and watch these men throughout eternity.

292
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,830
You most definitely loose.

293
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,800
Have the lee away, I win.

294
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,840
But be warned, Sinbad,

295
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:08,760
to be me is
to suffer most of all.

296
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:15,810
I have carried the weight of all the loss and
we are mastered walk-ins.

297
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,360
And you will do so
without end,

298
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,820
if you loose.

299
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,900
Are you still now put a wage in?

300
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,170
Yes.

301
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,500
Yes.

302
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,270
Go now!

303
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,800
Who are you?

304
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,500
While you think
this picture paints a thousand words,

305
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,500
- you won't need that either.
- You look like the Sultan.

306
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,630
You see what you wish to see.
Only what your might want to see.

307
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,840
Spirit becomes a part of you,
once you need it.

308
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,930
- A real genie?
- Yeah, ask you a servant.

309
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,560
Is it true genie grant
three wishes upon the release?

310
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:48,860
That what they say, but...
five hundred years ago,

311
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:56,200
a treacherous and evil man
sicced me to go inside that lamp...

312
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,120
after the beget, then...

313
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:05,250
as that wasn't bad enough,
he used his final wish...

314
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:09,550
to turn my power into a trap...

315
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,720
for the next unfortunate soul
that releases me.

316
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,350
He said that you next to release me could also could also have the three wishes,

317
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:24,400
but then he added a terrible condition:

318
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:31,200
That man must die before the first sunrise
 on the day of my release.

319
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:36,200
So what do have to say now, Sinbad?

320
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,420
Then I shall not ask
the grant wishes, Great Genie.

321
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,750
I can not let you go without your
three wishes, Sinbad. You know that.

322
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,590
One of those wishes can not be
for me to spare your life.

323
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,200
I'm not looking forward to this.

324
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,600
To meet this day begin,
you're in my pledge.

325
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,810
Just to be absolutely clear,

326
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:11,520
not one wish can be used
to spare me from this deadly despair?

327
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:16,280
Correct!
A wish can not be used to save you.
I'm truly sorry.

328
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,000
But there is a caller a genie must to pay.

329
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,000
So, wish now, Sinbad.

330
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:31,500
My first wish... shall be for you
to spare me from this deadly despair.

331
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,170
I thought I fully explained
this detail, Sinbad.

332
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,000
One of your wishes
can not be used to save you.
I previously stated!

333
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,600
What a waste!

334
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,800
Now only two wishes remained.

335
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:57,100
My second wish shall be
to be near Parisa.

336
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,800
See all!
You wish that. The power.

337
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,920
See all!
You have reached the power.

338
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,350
- And Parisa?
- Yes, beyond these doors.

339
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:32,190
I can only take you
as far as this entrance to the Deev there.

340
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,400
But what is the difference?

341
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,980
It's almost time for you
to say goodbye, anyway.

342
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:44,530
Yes, of course.
My third and final wish is...

343
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,830
that you spare me
from deadly despair.

344
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:54,960
Sinbad, you will now go to
the consequences of your... uh--

345
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:02,260
Excuse me for a moment.
It's a bit confusing.

346
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:07,220
Just one second, please, Sinbad.
Thank you.

347
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,390
Three wishes for the five hundred years.
Minus one, minus one...

348
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,800
Maybe, maybe not the whole twist.
Maybe, maybe--

349
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,400
Just one second more, please, Sinbad.
Thank you.

350
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,000
You need me to confused,
Great Genie.

351
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,100
You said one of my wishes can not be used
to spare me from deadly despair.

352
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,600
Go on!

353
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:32,000
You've never said that multiple wishes can not be used to save me from certain doom.

354
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,880
May Titan clashes
if you're not right!

355
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,920
Your wish is my command.

356
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:54,310
Thank you, Sinbad, for you have released
me from another prison.

357
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,400
My time is almost up here,

358
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,000
but before I give you farewell,
did you not wish for this?

359
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,150
No.

360
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:13,330
But there is no book
that said giving a gift is bad.

361
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,920
Worthes for life.

362
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,260
<i>The White Deev,
a powerful force.</i>

363
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,350
<i>Armies has not returned
from its clutches.</i>

364
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,340
I'll kill you all over again.

365
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:34,500
Well, well, well,
Sinbad.

366
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:40,920
It that be as you have
more wild than a cat.

367
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,000
Where is Parisa?

368
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:10,000
Before your sight, Sinbad.
To look there's aside.

369
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,870
I can make this beast change the be
with a single wave of my hand.

370
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:26,800
- Sinbad, is it really you?
- Everything is going to be all right.

371
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:30,200
Release her!

372
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,300
You're nonsense...
to demand.

373
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,800
What do you want?

374
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:42,770
It's not what I want,
but what to be.

375
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:51,300
Long ago, I asked a genie to grant
me my wish of unlimited power.

376
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,300
The genie tricked me.

377
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:01,330
And more, my power is limited to this island.

378
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:06,580
But there is a power to change.

379
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:13,650
<i>In your day will dawn,
bring in with it a storm,
the spans of long.</i>

380
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:20,100
A powerful soul as your will fire
the claymore to generates the other beloved,

381
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:26,650
but has the catalyst of my magic,
making it a thousand times more powerful!

382
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,900
You see, Sinbad?

383
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,800
You are the magic ingredient...
to this potion.

384
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,450
So Parisa was the bait
you use to get me here?

385
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:44,330
You threatened the life of
the woman I love.
My entire crew is gone.

386
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,920
Firooz who is like a sister to me, death.

387
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,590
Well, I know you think of
me as a bogeyman of evil.

388
01:00:55,670 --> 01:01:02,220
Or maybe... I am a part of
the balance of nature, intended.

389
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:06,730
- It's not too late to stop this madness.
- Silence!

390
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:10,900
You have off chance now,
and one off chance only.

391
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,900
Surrender your soul to me;
otherwise, I will release the beast,

392
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:20,950
and your foe
and your life are here.

393
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,130
- I accept.
- No!

394
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,800
What will happen to him?

395
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,180
He even joins me...

396
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:54,500
or become my humble...
 servant.

397
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,440
It's his choice.

398
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:08,870
I have two conditions.
One, Parisa go free, now.

399
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:14,420
Two, the city of Malek
must be left alone.

400
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,300
And only then,
would I pay my soul to you,

401
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,300
and maybe even join you.

402
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,300
You have my word.

403
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:28,700
Let's get it over with.

404
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,650
Take this...
 and wear it around your neck.

405
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:43,200
And lay down your sword.

406
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,610
Why are you hesitating?
Choose now.

407
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:26,240
Richness, a fine ship, and your life.

408
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,300
Or...

409
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,750
A prey magic die wish.

410
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:45,950
- The choice is easy, your Majesty.
- The power!

411
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:52,850
I rather be trully dead
than live a long, long empty life without her.

412
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,700
The power is mine!

413
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,800
No!

414
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,700
Aah!

415
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,600
Oh! No!

416
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,900
Oh!

417
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,000
No!

418
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,900
No!

419
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,200
Sinbad!

420
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:56,000
There was another woman in your life
that you loved:

421
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,250
Your mother!

422
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,810
That's great!
That balloon, lets go!

423
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,800
<i>Once again, the peril of evil
was unable to point out...</i>

424
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:29,280
<i>what is and always will be
the true ultimate power.</i>

425
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,990
<i>The power of the motivated heart.</i>

426
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,350
Aaah!

427
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,400
Aah! Ah!

428
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,100
Aah!

429
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,320
No!

430
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,600
No!

431
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:08,000
No-o-o-! Aah!

432
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
