00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,670
It's like we were doomed
to destroy our planet.

3
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:07,553
Some say it was
because of the increasing pollution.

4
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:10,876
I just call it human nature.

5
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,585
A few scientists predicted
what would happen.

6
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:19,671
They started working on a power station
that could be sent into space

7
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:22,665
to harvest geothermal energy
from other planets.

8
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:26,711
But it was too late.

9
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,505
People would start dying in their sleep...

10
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:33,511
suffocating in the streets,

11
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:35,588
the blood in their veins turning black.

12
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:41,051
"An unexpected change
in atmosphere composition," they said.

13
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:47,086
To me it was just our planet desperately
trying to survive by kicking us out.

14
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,130
So one day, a hundred ships
flew off into the sky.

15
00:01:58,588 --> 00:02:00,258
It was the Exodus mission.

16
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,341
They turned the power station
into a colony,

17
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:08,088
like a lifeboat floating above
Jupiter's volcanic moon,

18
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,260
also known as…

19
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:48,416
What do we have here?

20
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,958
Audio memorandum initiated.

21
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:01,835
Begin audio log entry 46809.

22
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:04,708
Researcher ID Sam Walden.

23
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,756
I'm looking at what appears to be
rafts of mosquito

24
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:11,128
or midge fly spawn. Period.

25
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:13,303
Something resembling
blooms of black algae

26
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,840
identifiable in subsurface ponded water

27
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:19,261
despite minimal opportunity
for chemosynthesis. Period.

28
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,133
That's what I thought.

29
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:31,545
Level of toxicity in ambient atmosphere:
severe.

30
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:38,005
Sample 181A. Water-striding insects.

31
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:42,545
Found in a zone apparently in the presence
of a strong concentration of ammonia.

32
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,085
Sample 181B.

33
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:48,961
Drawn from sediment strata,
should confirm or disconfirm

34
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:53,506
the presence of bacterium able to use
ammonium as a main oxygen source.

35
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:28,508
"A shudder in the loin engenders there,

36
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,510
the broken wall,
the burning roof and tower...

37
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:36,876
and Agamemnon dead."

38
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,961
Plants are changing colors.

39
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:14,213
Elon.

40
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:16,665
I keep having this dream.

41
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,633
I'm on a beach.

42
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:22,421
I can feel the wind blowing in my hair,

43
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:26,008
hear the sound of the waves
crashing on the shore.

44
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:28,343
I can breathe.

45
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:55,958
You won't believe
what I discovered this morning.

46
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:59,506
Anaerobic reproduction
in a water-striding insect colony.

47
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:02,125
Yet another new species.

48
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:03,755
Surviving.

49
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,130
Imagine if the bees could adapt
like those insects.

50
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,173
It would prove that my dad is right.

51
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,591
Earth is not dying, it's being reborn.

52
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,460
I know things aren't easy
on the IO Colony, but...

53
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,340
please write back soon.

54
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:21,375
I love you, Elon.

55
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:24,168
From Earth until the end of the universe.

56
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Sam.

57
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:45,415
I'm sorry.

58
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:39,088
Dear Sam,

59
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:42,626
your scientific discoveries
never cease to astound me.

60
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:46,878
Unearthing the last bits of life
hanging onto that dying world...

61
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,670
that's amazing.

62
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:53,505
Imagine what you could find
in a whole new galaxy.

63
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:58,755
Just a week from now, we'll have harvested
enough of IO's volcanic energy

64
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,668
to power the entire
New World Expedition fleet.

65
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:05,921
Life is in the stars, Sam.

66
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:09,295
Your father can't hold you back
any longer.

67
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:13,381
Very soon, the last pocket of air on Earth
will be gone.

68
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:18,546
You both need to be
on the next Exodus shuttle and come here.

69
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,046
I love you.

70
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,670
From IO until the end of the universe,

71
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:25,796
Elon.

72
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,960
This is Doctor Harry Walden,

73
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:02,876
transmitting on frequency 90-43,

74
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:06,673
listening on frequency
95-60 kilohertz daily.

75
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:11,883
The world we once called home
appears to have turned against us.

76
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:17,918
However bleak the situation may seem,
death is only a part of the process.

77
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,876
The fundamental principle of nature
is survival.

78
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:27,173
More than in our DNA,
it is in our mind, in our soul,

79
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,375
to seek life no matter what.

80
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,666
Plant life has already evolved
to resist ammonia toxicity.

81
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:39,298
Once bees and other pollinators adapt,

82
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,380
our model predicts vegetation growth

83
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:44,673
will decontaminate the air
in less than 20 years.

84
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:50,086
We take to the stars
in search of our salvation,

85
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:51,961
but we fail to recognize

86
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:55,706
that we are already on the most
significantly equipped spaceship.

87
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,670
People can, and inevitably will,

88
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:03,005
adapt and flourish again
on our beautiful planet.

89
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:07,798
Don't lose yourself
looking into the darkness of space.

90
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,710
Your home is shining blue
just in front of your eyes.

91
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:19,171
Safe travels and hope
to welcome you here among us soon.

92
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,710
Generally, the queen bee
is marked so she's easy to find.

93
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:01,666
But sometimes she's replaced
during a season.

94
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,171
In thousands of bees,
she blends in pretty well,

95
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:09,801
but if you look closely, you'll notice
her thorax, her middle segment, is...

96
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,840
is not like the worker bees...

97
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:16,963
There's amazing news here, Sam.

98
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:21,301
The council officially announced
the first New World Expedition.

99
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,260
They chose Proxima Centauri.

100
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:28,415
The exoplanet Proxima B
really is a near-identical Earth twin.

101
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,295
It takes ten years to get there.

102
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:34,131
All my friends are applying
for the mission. They need engineers.

103
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:38,051
But it has grave implications
for the Exodus program.

104
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,130
Damn it.

105
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,835
The Council's decision
changes everything.

106
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:41,131
Effective immediately,
all spacecraft personnel,

107
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:42,633
energy, everything

108
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:45,133
has been redirected
to the New World Expeditions.

109
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:48,341
The Exodus shuttles
that are on Earth right now

110
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,131
will launch in four days

111
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,133
and will be the last ever sent to IO.

112
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,713
You have to leave with your father, Sam.

113
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:58,956
The universe is calling for us.

114
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:00,713
Can't you hear it?

115
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:26,708
A giant storm
hit our camp yesterday.

116
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:31,835
My father's entire bee colony is gone.

117
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:35,093
All the progress we'd made,

118
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,760
dozens of new genetic strains,

119
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,380
all lost.

120
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,593
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

121
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:49,626
Even if I accept that you might be right
about going to IO,

122
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:53,546
we can't carry enough oxygen
with the ATVs.

123
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:57,705
I don't think we could ever make it
to the launch site.

124
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,455
I'm here for Dr. Harry Walden.

125
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:01,168
I heard the radio transmission.

126
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,510
Can I have some water?

127
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:51,206
It's only cloudy like that
because of the charcoal.

128
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:55,798
We filter our drinking water through sand
and charcoal. It's all it needs.

129
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,630
Is he in there?

130
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,918
I'm Dr. Walden's research assistant.

131
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,600
I'm sure I can answer
any of your questions.

132
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,420
I'm here to see Dr. Walden.

133
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:19,548
Not you.

134
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,960
Not anybody else.

135
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:47,671
We haven't had anyone make the pilgrimage
to see Dr. Walden in a long time.

136
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:50,921
Pilgrimage?

137
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,668
Why you're here, isn't it?

138
00:27:58,421 --> 00:27:59,631
To meet Dr. Walden.

139
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,210
Where did you say he was again?

140
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:05,956
He's off in the mountain right now,

141
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:08,088
gathering specimens for our work.

142
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:09,761
I need you to take me to him.

143
00:28:10,296 --> 00:28:13,206
I can't. I don't know his exact location.

144
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:18,711
Where's everyone else?

145
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:23,921
There is no one else.

146
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:38,713
I'll wait.

147
00:28:42,838 --> 00:28:44,008
You're going to Exodus.

148
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:47,505
What?

149
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:49,046
Your balloon.

150
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:53,378
You're going
to the final Exodus launch to IO?

151
00:28:55,838 --> 00:28:56,838
That's right.

152
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,880
It sure took you long enough
to decide to leave Earth.

153
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:07,706
I'll fix you some food.

154
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:09,671
No.

155
00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:12,505
I'm not gonna take any of your food.

156
00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:13,588
We have plenty.

157
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:22,168
You have fresh vegetables?

158
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:25,548
Yeah. I have an entire greenhouse.

159
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:40,545
It's better with that.

160
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:56,513
Huh.

161
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:06,421
Do you know
if there's any animals left in the sea?

162
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,125
I've always really wanted
to go to the ocean.

163
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:12,713
No.

164
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:14,005
There's nothing.

165
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:16,588
There's nothing anywhere.

166
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,295
Even the birds all died.

167
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:28,628
You'd think they could
live up high like us.

168
00:30:28,713 --> 00:30:31,093
Yeah. Birds gotta land too, you know.

169
00:30:34,588 --> 00:30:35,918
Have you ever seen a swan?

170
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:41,796
Yeah.

171
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,710
Yeah, when I was a kid..

172
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:46,838
Right.

173
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,210
You're from before.

174
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:52,338
Yeah.

175
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:55,918
You've seen other cities?

176
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:57,585
Just from the sky.

177
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:01,461
Is it the same everywhere?

178
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,460
Yeah, it's the same everywhere.

179
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:12,689
I don't believe you.
No way you could've seen everywhere.

180
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:14,633
When is Dr. Walden getting back?

181
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:19,298
Sometimes he's gone for days.

182
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:40,961
You have
a lot of electronic equipment in here.

183
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:47,588
We scavenge
and salvage what we can from the zone.

184
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,460
What are you doing?

185
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:53,256
We're trying to establish
a variant breed of honeybees

186
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:55,548
that can adapt to the toxic atmosphere.

187
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,590
Immunogenics is
pretty fascinating actually.

188
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:00,961
No, right now.
What are you doing right now?

189
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:02,923
Oh, um...

190
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,133
I'm writing a letter.

191
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:08,958
What are you talking about? To who?

192
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:10,416
Someone on the Colony.

193
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:15,378
You have contact with IO?

194
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:18,298
My friend Elon is an engineer

195
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,050
working on the solar cell mission
to Alpha Centauri.

196
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,090
He can access the main transmission link
between Earth and IO.

197
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:28,668
You're gonna have to sleep
in here tonight.

198
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:33,338
Dr. Walden's work is very important
and I can't have you interfering.

199
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:37,796
Is that his room there?

200
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,090
It's his office and living quarters.

201
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,418
This is Dr. Harry Walden,

202
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:50,375
transmitting on frequency 90-43,

203
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:54,133
listening on frequency
95-60 kilohertz daily.

204
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:57,336
That's 31 meters band frequency,

205
00:32:57,421 --> 00:32:59,711
- 95-60 kilohertz.
- Is that what I heard?

206
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
A recording?

207
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:03,421
It's protocol.

208
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:06,505
When he's not here, I play the tape.

209
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:08,758
So he's been gone more than two days?

210
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,668
Uh... I guess that's right.

211
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,260
He'll be back tomorrow probably.

212
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:20,416
What's your name?

213
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:23,046
Micah.

214
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,005
I'm Sam.

215
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:31,506
It's nice to meet you, Sam.

216
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,295
Wanna make yourself useful?

217
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,093
I have to repair a broken solar panel too.

218
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:58,593
Should be able to seal it, but it'll never
put out as many amps as it used to.

219
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:01,551
You do a lot of work around here.

220
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:05,338
You have a rope?

221
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,915
Looks pretty good, right?

222
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:38,671
So, you know my friend Elon
I mentioned before?

223
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,800
He's not really my friend.

224
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,050
Well, he is, but he's,
you know, more than that.

225
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,170
Is that right?

226
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:50,378
How does that work?

227
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:52,173
A lot of letters,

228
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:53,711
a lot of, uh...

229
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:55,963
loneliness.

230
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:59,013
What about you? Do you have a wife?

231
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:00,588
No.

232
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:05,296
I guess you must think it's stupid.

233
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:09,045
What?

234
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,130
Me and Elon.

235
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:12,921
I mean...

236
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:18,706
Do you think it's absurd to love someone
that's millions of miles away?

237
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:21,796
Not at all.

238
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,878
So ancient is the desire for one another
which is implanted in us.

239
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:31,633
Reuniting our original nature,

240
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:33,843
seeking to make one of two

241
00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:36,376
and healing the state of man.

242
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:40,713
What's that?

243
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,130
Plato.

244
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:45,338
Symposium.

245
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:53,088
What does it mean?

246
00:36:58,005 --> 00:36:59,045
He says...

247
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,510
humans originally had two faces.

248
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:06,463
Four arms, four legs.

249
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:09,588
And they were happy like that.

250
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,088
Complete.

251
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:16,258
Then they defied the gods,

252
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:20,168
so the gods split us in two as punishment.

253
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:23,918
Tore us away from our other halves.

254
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:30,126
He said each of us, when separated,

255
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:33,093
is always looking for our other half.

256
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:36,838
It's our nature.

257
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:41,381
But when one is met
with this other half...

258
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:46,705
the pair are lost in an amazement of love,

259
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:48,585
friendship,

260
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:50,713
intimacy.

261
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:56,263
And one will not be seen
out of the other's sight.

262
00:37:58,421 --> 00:37:59,841
See, the reason is...

263
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:06,260
human nature was once originally one.

264
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:09,963
And we were whole.

265
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:14,213
And the desire
and the pursuit of the whole...

266
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,713
is called love.

267
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:22,505
Wow.

268
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,801
You know a lot about this stuff.

269
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:32,665
I was gonna be a teacher...

270
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,130
once.

271
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:39,671
I wasn't gonna tell you this...

272
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:45,673
Harry Walden is my father.

273
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:48,546
No.

274
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:50,255
Really?

275
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:03,461
Come with me.

276
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,923
Bees used to do
almost all the pollinating, but...

277
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:12,843
now I have to do it all by hand.

278
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,340
- The three sisters.
- Yeah.

279
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,671
Corn provides the structure
for the beans to climb,

280
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:22,255
squash spreads out over the soil
like mulch,

281
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:24,168
and that keeps the moisture in.

282
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:26,755
And then the beans
provide the nitrogen in return.

283
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:29,128
Everybody wins.

284
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:32,591
What are those tattoos?

285
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:36,213
E to the i pi plus one equals zero.

286
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,005
It's Euler's equation.

287
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,666
But this one's my absolute favorite.
It's, uh...

288
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:45,053
Nowak's Evolvability Equation.

289
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:49,085
Symbols on the left represent
all possible strings of molecules

290
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:52,841
and symbols on the right represent
selection pressures and fitness ratings.

291
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:58,628
Basically that just means, um...
all that's necessary for life to emerge

292
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:02,383
are molecules subject to forces
of selection and mutation.

293
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:05,876
If those conditions are met,
self-replication emerges.

294
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:12,171
People can change.

295
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
Don't you see how important that is?
I mean...

296
00:40:19,463 --> 00:40:21,713
What about the markings on your rib cage?

297
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:27,045
Uh... It's nothing. It's just something
we do as part of our research.

298
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:30,631
We do it to build up our immunity.

299
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:33,963
Does it hurt?

300
00:40:36,046 --> 00:40:37,046
Not that bad.

301
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:54,838
That's Lucy.

302
00:40:57,463 --> 00:40:58,633
How is that possible?

303
00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:00,463
It's complicated.

304
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:04,923
You see, for my Dad...

305
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:08,461
IO was just a last resort.

306
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:12,421
A lifeboat.

307
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:17,836
- What happened to Lucy?
- She died...

308
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,130
eventually.

309
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:26,295
She gave us hope.

310
00:41:35,171 --> 00:41:36,171
Wait.

311
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:38,803
I wanna see this.

312
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:44,128
Planet Earth
is a miracle in the universe.

313
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:47,133
We are its caretakers,
and it is our duty to stay...

314
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:51,091
stay and fight for our world.

315
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:54,545
Humans may have nearly destroyed our home,

316
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,260
but we can make it habitable again

317
00:41:57,338 --> 00:42:00,168
and we will breathe the air again.

318
00:42:02,046 --> 00:42:04,416
The strong, brave souls that will stay,

319
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:06,705
if any do choose to stay,

320
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,840
will become a new civilization
of its own design.

321
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:15,301
A special thanks to Dr. Walden.

322
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:17,301
A note to our viewers

323
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:20,085
that this will be our final program

324
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:24,131
due to the shut down of all broadcast
television from midnight tonight.

325
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:26,456
There is too much to say,

326
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:30,803
and I will end the program as I have
every day for the last eight years.

327
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,960
From all of us, to all of you...

328
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:34,803
See you tomorrow.

329
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Thank you.

330
00:43:23,963 --> 00:43:27,213
For a long time, you must've
thought it was the right thing to do.

331
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,008
Staying on Earth.

332
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:32,005
Right?

333
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:33,878
For a long time.

334
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:37,958
I was foolish.

335
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:43,708
I think you were really brave.

336
00:43:46,046 --> 00:43:47,706
My dad would have thought so too.

337
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:29,341
So I see you found
my parents' old bedroom.

338
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,671
Your mother's name
was June, right?

339
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,130
Yeah, that's right.

340
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:38,713
How'd you know that?

341
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,510
What did he do to her?

342
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,380
What do you mean?

343
00:44:47,005 --> 00:44:49,505
What did Dr. Walden do
to cause your mother's death?

344
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:52,376
My mom got sick.

345
00:44:54,255 --> 00:44:55,255
That's it.

346
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:57,883
But he kept her here, right?

347
00:44:57,963 --> 00:44:59,593
- He kept all of you here.
- No.

348
00:45:00,338 --> 00:45:01,668
What do you mean "no"?

349
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:05,763
Sam, she died because he kept her here.

350
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:12,665
You're wasting my time.

351
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,133
I have a lot of work to be doing.

352
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:24,671
Micah!

353
00:45:26,046 --> 00:45:27,086
Open the door.

354
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:03,796
Samantha, listen to me.

355
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:07,335
It's not worth it,
you continuing my experiments.

356
00:46:07,421 --> 00:46:09,131
Dad, what are you doing in here?

357
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:11,133
It's my lab, isn't it?

358
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:13,673
You shouldn't be in here,
not without your oxygen.

359
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,170
Sam, it's fine.

360
00:46:16,213 --> 00:46:18,423
You don't need to take care of me anymore.
I'm fine.

361
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:19,875
No, you're not fine.

362
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
Where have you been?

363
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:26,213
Walking.

364
00:46:27,213 --> 00:46:28,303
Sam, it's...

365
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:33,335
If there was a discovery, a miracle
discovery, I would've found it.

366
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,710
What about Lucy?

367
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:44,416
How are things with Elon?

368
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,048
I'm not talking to you about that.

369
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:51,630
Sam...

370
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:55,958
Don't underestimate
the power of human connection.

371
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,803
That's all there is.

372
00:46:59,421 --> 00:47:00,801
There is no bigger meaning.

373
00:47:01,546 --> 00:47:03,666
Just human connection.

374
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:05,665
You used to say that about science.

375
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,130
Sam, we have to leave this place.

376
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:14,755
Sooner or later you'll have to.

377
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,423
You're all alone here.

378
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:27,630
I'm not alone.

379
00:47:28,755 --> 00:47:30,295
I don't count.

380
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:33,171
Why not?

381
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,380
I'm dead.

382
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:50,125
My dad buried my mom here.

383
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:54,423
I buried him here beside her.

384
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,258
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

385
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:07,706
I have to tell you something, Sam,
and you're not gonna like it.

386
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:12,511
I've decided I'm taking you to Exodus.

387
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:15,705
And I can get you there in the balloon.

388
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:19,211
You won't understand it now,
but it's not up for debate.

389
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:22,165
You've got your entire life ahead of you.

390
00:48:23,796 --> 00:48:25,956
And I'm not gonna leave you here alone.

391
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,920
Do you understand what I'm saying?

392
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:34,713
I'm taking you away from here.

393
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:39,166
You're going to IO
and you're never coming back.

394
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:42,588
Okay.

395
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:50,588
Okay.

396
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,130
Good.

397
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,920
When do we leave?

398
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:10,838
Soon.

399
00:49:13,005 --> 00:49:16,125
We'll have to plot our course
and wait for favorable wind conditions,

400
00:49:16,213 --> 00:49:17,423
but it has to be soon.

401
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,585
We've a long way to travel
and we're running out of days.

402
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,130
Elon.

403
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:21,088
I have good news.

404
00:50:23,005 --> 00:50:26,835
A traveler arrived at the Enclave today
in a helium balloon.

405
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:29,263
I thought I was dreaming.

406
00:50:30,713 --> 00:50:31,923
His name is Micah.

407
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:39,051
I'm not even sure where he's from
or how he's survived this long on Earth.

408
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,801
He's offered to take me to Exodus.

409
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:47,263
And I've agreed.

410
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,590
My life on Earth is over.

411
00:50:53,505 --> 00:50:55,295
It's been over for a long time.

412
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,090
We'll finally be together on IO,
just like you've always wanted.

413
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:05,631
Are there oceans on Centauri B?

414
00:51:10,088 --> 00:51:11,378
Write back soon, okay?

415
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,960
I really need to hear from you.

416
00:51:55,588 --> 00:51:59,758
We're gonna have to wait for the wind
to change direction before we can leave.

417
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:00,838
It will.

418
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:08,091
What were you gonna do
if I hadn't shown up here, Sam?

419
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,060
You know, people aren't meant to be alone.

420
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,133
You think I don't know that?

421
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,300
I'll go and get the rest of them.

422
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:51,671
Fuck.

423
00:52:56,921 --> 00:52:58,261
Oh, fuck.

424
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:04,551
You're never gonna believe this.

425
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:08,093
Come on.

426
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,338
That's how I found them.

427
00:53:16,088 --> 00:53:18,008
I think it's trapped under that grate.

428
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:20,921
She.

429
00:53:22,505 --> 00:53:23,335
What?

430
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:24,461
She's trapped.

431
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:29,171
The holes are big enough
to let the workers and drones through,

432
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:31,005
but they're too small for her.

433
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:37,125
She must have just hatched,
which means she's a virgin queen.

434
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:46,591
How is that possible?

435
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:51,338
I don't know.

436
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:56,301
So what does it mean?

437
00:54:05,213 --> 00:54:06,343
It doesn't mean anything.

438
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:50,921
Sam...

439
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:54,958
thank God you made the decision
to travel to the Exodus launch.

440
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:58,416
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to write sooner,

441
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:00,455
but there's been a change here as well.

442
00:55:03,213 --> 00:55:05,383
Yesterday my commanding officer
asked me to join

443
00:55:05,463 --> 00:55:08,173
the first New World Expedition shuttle.

444
00:55:09,963 --> 00:55:11,383
This morning I accepted.

445
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:15,418
I hope you of all people
will understand that I had no choice.

446
00:55:18,963 --> 00:55:20,213
This is my destiny,

447
00:55:21,296 --> 00:55:22,296
my purpose.

448
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,671
We can still be together,

449
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,170
but it won't be for many, many years.

450
00:55:32,171 --> 00:55:33,921
Please write back before you leave.

451
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:37,772
All transmission links with Earth
will be cut after the final Exodus launch

452
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:41,256
and I am desperate to receive
one last letter from you before I leave.

453
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:47,626
All my love,

454
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,300
from IO until the end of the universe,

455
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:53,838
Elon.

456
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,210
You ever have squash spaghetti?

457
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:50,011
What was it like?

458
00:56:52,505 --> 00:56:53,505
Before.

459
00:56:57,338 --> 00:56:59,668
I'm sure your father told you
what it was like.

460
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:04,375
I want to know what it was like for you.

461
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:09,171
Where are you from?

462
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,590
I grew up in the suburbs.

463
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,380
In a neighborhood.

464
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:24,131
By the time I was old enough,
I was in the city every chance I got.

465
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,760
We weren't ready for this.

466
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:37,588
No matter what warning we got
from people like your father.

467
00:57:39,338 --> 00:57:41,008
What we saw with our own eyes.

468
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,798
The future we got was unthinkable.

469
00:57:53,796 --> 00:57:54,796
For everybody.

470
00:58:00,755 --> 00:58:02,915
Unexpected things can be good too.

471
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,380
Damn it!

472
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:37,915
We'll never be able to get off the ground
if the wind doesn't change.

473
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:00,838
Trust me.

474
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:06,511
It'll change.

475
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:12,168
That song.

476
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,380
I remember that song.

477
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:12,088
I'm sorry.

478
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:21,005
It's okay.

479
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:54,171
I can't.

480
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:04,838
We have to.

481
01:03:31,338 --> 01:03:34,338
Do you see the glimmer?
To the left of Jupiter?

482
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:38,461
Is that the Colony?

483
01:03:40,546 --> 01:03:41,546
It's the Colony.

484
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:46,168
It's actually orbiting IO,

485
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:50,295
but the Colony's so much brighter
in the sky that IO becomes obscured.

486
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,760
I never thought I'd see it.

487
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:07,755
There's this...

488
01:04:09,921 --> 01:04:12,761
art exhibit I really wanted to see.

489
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,130
An art exhibit?

490
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:20,758
The Museum of Art.

491
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,010
It's one of the last exhibits from before.

492
01:04:28,546 --> 01:04:29,626
"Modern Myths."

493
01:04:32,796 --> 01:04:35,166
Would you have taught
your students about myths?

494
01:04:37,505 --> 01:04:38,505
Yeah.

495
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:41,256
I think I would have.

496
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,210
4.36 light years away.

497
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:56,338
Is that the same as saying forever?

498
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:05,876
The space between us will become more vast
until it's too far to cross.

499
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,045
I've lied to you, Elon.

500
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,050
My father's dead.

501
01:05:16,963 --> 01:05:19,013
He's been dead for a long time now.

502
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:23,045
It was my decision, all along,

503
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,300
to stay on Earth.

504
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:32,005
I think we're both looking
for worlds to call our own...

505
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:35,923
but different ones.

506
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:41,050
I hope you find yours.

507
01:06:37,005 --> 01:06:39,045
Attention. Urgent notice.

508
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,880
Due to catastrophic weather event,

509
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:45,673
Exodus shuttle number 127
is unable to launch.

510
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:50,045
Your departure
has been changed to Exodus 134

511
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:54,840
at 49.5466 degrees

512
01:06:54,921 --> 01:06:59,801
by 16.4059 degrees.

513
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:06,170
Exodus shuttles will begin embarkation
in 26 hours and 12 minutes.

514
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:13,048
They moved the launch site.

515
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,760
What are you talking about?
Is that a problem?

516
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:18,298
We don't have enough helium
to fly that far!

517
01:07:18,713 --> 01:07:20,053
We're stuck here!

518
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:25,671
It's never gonna end.

519
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:29,013
I must be cursed.

520
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:31,836
What do you mean?

521
01:07:33,171 --> 01:07:35,091
You wanna know why I really came here?

522
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:38,671
Huh?

523
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:41,711
Your father told us to stay on Earth.

524
01:07:43,463 --> 01:07:46,633
I saw dozens of people starve to death
because of him.

525
01:07:48,171 --> 01:07:49,671
Because he gave us hope.

526
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,920
My wife was sick.

527
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:04,671
Food would have kept her alive
for a few more days, but...

528
01:08:05,963 --> 01:08:06,963
that was all.

529
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,463
Then the food would have been gone.

530
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:21,378
I hid rations so I could survive.

531
01:08:26,088 --> 01:08:27,878
I watched my wife die...

532
01:08:31,463 --> 01:08:33,053
so I could be the survivor.

533
01:08:35,921 --> 01:08:37,421
I couldn't live with that.

534
01:08:41,255 --> 01:08:42,875
So I came here to find him.

535
01:08:48,463 --> 01:08:50,593
And all I found was you instead.

536
01:09:00,588 --> 01:09:05,298
I won't make the same mistake twice
and let you die too.

537
01:09:19,505 --> 01:09:20,505
Thank you.

538
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:27,923
Thank you for telling me, Micah.

539
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:42,260
I know where we can get helium.

540
01:09:46,213 --> 01:09:47,213
It's in the zone.

541
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:50,878
It's really far.

542
01:09:52,838 --> 01:09:54,508
It's farther than I've ever gone.

543
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,050
We'd have to stay longer
than I've ever stayed before.

544
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:06,298
We'd need to stay the night there.

545
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,050
It's not possible, Sam.

546
01:10:09,213 --> 01:10:10,213
It's possible.

547
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:13,796
I think.

548
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:17,011
Adapt or die.

549
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:19,421
Isn't that what they say?

550
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:51,050
This is Sam Walden.

551
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,090
Transmitting on a frequency
90.43 kilohertz daily.

552
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:02,671
If anyone's still listening
to these broadcasts...

553
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:05,256
...Doctor Harry Walden,

554
01:11:05,671 --> 01:11:09,801
my father, mentor, and best friend,

555
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,880
has died.

556
01:11:12,338 --> 01:11:16,628
On October 13th of last year,
I buried him next to my mother.

557
01:11:29,921 --> 01:11:31,011
What about here?

558
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:33,455
You ever been to this part before?

559
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,380
Yeah.

560
01:11:39,588 --> 01:11:41,588
Should work. It's just a big open field.

561
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:44,841
We'll drop the balloon there.
Then we'll go get the helium.

562
01:11:50,046 --> 01:11:51,256
Museum of Art.

563
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:57,921
What?

564
01:11:57,963 --> 01:11:58,843
Nothing.

565
01:11:58,921 --> 01:11:59,921
What?

566
01:12:01,213 --> 01:12:02,763
I just need you to focus.

567
01:12:03,796 --> 01:12:05,546
We mess up and we die.

568
01:12:07,088 --> 01:12:08,258
I am focused.

569
01:12:11,046 --> 01:12:13,546
This afternoon,
I'll be leaving our enclave

570
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,800
to travel to the Exodus launch site.

571
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:21,668
If anyone's receiving this broadcast,
I implore you to do the same.

572
01:12:23,713 --> 01:12:27,303
We thought we could find a way
for humans to survive on Earth.

573
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:30,713
We were wrong.

574
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:34,423
This is Sam Walden, over and out.

575
01:13:39,755 --> 01:13:40,875
Why are we stopped?

576
01:13:41,546 --> 01:13:43,006
It's incredible, right?

577
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,713
It's a graveyard, Sam.

578
01:13:48,296 --> 01:13:49,796
All I see are ghosts.

579
01:13:59,171 --> 01:14:00,921
We're near the launch spot.

580
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:05,261
Let's drop the balloon and get moving.
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

581
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,256
Sam!

582
01:15:10,796 --> 01:15:12,666
- What?
- There's a lot of helium in here.

583
01:15:13,296 --> 01:15:14,296
I know.

584
01:15:17,296 --> 01:15:20,256
But that's a good thing, right?
It's why we came.

585
01:15:20,755 --> 01:15:22,125
- Right?
- Yeah.

586
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:23,463
So, come on.

587
01:15:24,088 --> 01:15:25,088
Give me a hand.

588
01:15:28,296 --> 01:15:31,876
All right. We get a few more,
and then we camp here for the night.

589
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:34,710
It's getting too dark to travel.

590
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:44,505
So you know
how life started on this planet?

591
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:47,208
Was it a bacteria?

592
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,960
Yeah.

593
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:52,046
They came out of the ocean,
and here we are...

594
01:15:52,588 --> 01:15:54,418
at the very end of this cycle.

595
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,800
Do you realize that you might be
the last woman to live on Earth?

596
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,010
I'm sure
there are other people alive.

597
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,260
Yeah, on the Colony,

598
01:16:03,796 --> 01:16:05,506
working hard to find our new home,

599
01:16:06,546 --> 01:16:09,296
where you won't need a gas mask
to take me to a restaurant.

600
01:16:16,296 --> 01:16:18,256
Now, how does this work?

601
01:16:19,213 --> 01:16:21,213
Once we switch to fresh tanks,

602
01:16:21,296 --> 01:16:23,506
we turn the air valve down 50%.

603
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:25,706
We try to relax.

604
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:28,130
We should be okay.

605
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:30,421
You set your alarm?

606
01:16:30,505 --> 01:16:31,505
Yes.

607
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,171
Let's do this.

608
01:16:50,588 --> 01:16:52,298
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

609
01:17:48,088 --> 01:17:49,338
I'll be right back.

610
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:52,046
Sam.

611
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,380
Sam.

612
01:17:59,505 --> 01:18:00,795
We leave in one hour.

613
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:03,591
Yeah.

614
01:18:03,671 --> 01:18:04,711
I know.

615
01:21:43,796 --> 01:21:45,256
We have to go, Sam.

616
01:21:49,046 --> 01:21:51,876
"A shudder in the loins engenders there.

617
01:21:53,338 --> 01:21:54,798
The broken wall,

618
01:21:55,755 --> 01:21:57,545
the burning roof and tower.

619
01:22:00,005 --> 01:22:01,755
And Agamemnon dead.

620
01:22:03,796 --> 01:22:06,666
So mastered by the brute blood of the air.

621
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:11,963
Did she put on his knowledge
with his power

622
01:22:13,546 --> 01:22:16,296
before the indifferent beak
could let her drop?"

623
01:22:21,463 --> 01:22:22,463
Sam.

624
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,050
Tell me what it means.

625
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:33,010
Leda gave birth to Helen.

626
01:22:35,171 --> 01:22:36,261
Helen of Troy.

627
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,921
A face that launched a thousand ships.

628
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:49,511
She was considered
the most beautiful woman in the world.

629
01:22:53,005 --> 01:22:54,835
Her abduction by Paris,

630
01:22:55,713 --> 01:22:56,843
the Prince of Troy...

631
01:22:58,838 --> 01:23:00,458
brought upon the Trojan War.

632
01:23:02,963 --> 01:23:04,213
The broken wall,

633
01:23:05,338 --> 01:23:07,048
the burning roof and tower,

634
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,420
and Agamemnon dead.

635
01:23:13,796 --> 01:23:16,126
Leda was related to the gods.

636
01:23:19,921 --> 01:23:21,381
And the swan is Zeus.

637
01:23:25,463 --> 01:23:26,463
Zeus in disguise.

638
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,133
Leda gave birth to God's children.

639
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,260
You did everything you could.

640
01:23:57,046 --> 01:23:58,756
Your father would be proud of you.

641
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:09,130
Let's go.

642
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,005
Okay?

643
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,340
I'm not going with you.

644
01:24:32,005 --> 01:24:33,835
You're gonna have to go on your own.

645
01:25:01,921 --> 01:25:03,211
Change your tank.

646
01:25:07,838 --> 01:25:10,128
We can talk about it at the launch site.

647
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:31,336
I keep having this dream...

648
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,130
where I'm in the zone...

649
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:36,713
and...

650
01:25:36,796 --> 01:25:38,666
I'm not wearing a mask.

651
01:25:47,671 --> 01:25:49,801
I strike my lighter and...

652
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,300
it's dark purple.

653
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:00,755
But I'm fine.

654
01:26:04,213 --> 01:26:06,303
Everyone sees so much death here...

655
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:11,460
but I see life.

656
01:26:20,671 --> 01:26:23,961
Why are you doing this, Sam?
Change your tank.

657
01:26:28,713 --> 01:26:29,803
Promise me something.

658
01:26:32,046 --> 01:26:34,796
If I survive, tell everyone on IO
that there's a future on Earth.

659
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,590
Sam! Sam!

660
01:26:37,463 --> 01:26:38,463
Sam!

661
01:26:41,005 --> 01:26:42,005
I'm okay.

662
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,130
It's okay.

663
01:26:47,963 --> 01:26:48,963
It's okay.

664
01:27:41,463 --> 01:27:42,513
Dear Micah,

665
01:27:44,838 --> 01:27:47,088
my father loved the T.S Eliot quote,

666
01:27:48,505 --> 01:27:50,835
"We shall not cease from exploration,

667
01:27:51,713 --> 01:27:54,133
and the end of all of our exploring

668
01:27:54,838 --> 01:27:56,958
will be to arrive where we started

669
01:27:57,463 --> 01:27:59,423
and know the place for the first time."

670
01:28:03,088 --> 01:28:04,918
We have learned to fear our planet

671
01:28:05,796 --> 01:28:08,256
and fled to the stars
in search of a new one.

672
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:13,705
But the fascination for other worlds

673
01:28:13,796 --> 01:28:17,416
could not turn my eyes away
from the beauty of our home.

674
01:28:23,338 --> 01:28:25,258
The waves are crashing on the shore...

675
01:28:29,255 --> 01:28:31,125
and the wind is blowing in my hair.

676
01:28:35,671 --> 01:28:37,131
Tell them it feels good.

677
01:28:40,296 --> 01:28:43,506
Tell them the dark clouds have given way
to the ocean mist.

678
01:28:47,838 --> 01:28:49,838
Tell them a new world awaits us.

679
01:28:55,005 --> 01:28:56,625
Tell them we're waiting for you.

680
01:29:00,671 --> 01:29:02,341
Waiting for you to come back.

681
01:29:03,305 --> 01:30:03,356
