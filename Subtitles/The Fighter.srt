1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:47,144
<i>- You bringing Micky in?</i>
<i>- Yeah, he's gonna come.</i>

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,009
<i>He should be here as well.</i>

4
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,980
<i>You think he'll answer questions?</i>

5
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,108
<i>They said it was</i>
<i>gonna be both of us here.</i>

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,188
- Am I looking right in the camera here?
- Just look at me, right here.

7
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,885
All right. You don't want me to look
in the camera with the...

8
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,791
- Right over here.
...interviews?

9
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,666
<i>I started boxing</i>
<i>when I was 12 years old,</i>

10
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,168
<i>and I'd lie and say I was 18,</i>
<i>or whatever it was.</i>

11
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,272
<i>You know, I had a different</i>
<i>name and everything.</i>

12
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>I mean, I don't know how many fights...</i>

13
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,142
<i>I'd done a hundred, more than that,</i>
<i>before I turned professional.</i>

14
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,179
- Go ahead and sit right there.
- Why we doing this?

15
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,441
- I don't wanna do this.
- You want to start again?

16
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,280
<i>This is my younger brother.</i>
<i>I taught him everything he knows.</i>

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,320
I'm still his trainer.
You know, we got different styles.

18
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:33,483
I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.
I'm like... I'm not even there.

19
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,093
You know, that's what Sugar Ray said.

20
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,628
I was the most tricky fighter
he'd ever come across.

21
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,057
<i>In '78, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard.</i>

22
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,465
<i>I went toe-to-toe with him.</i>
<i>He couldn't get to me.</i>

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,400
<i>He couldn't get to me.</i>

24
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,200
<i>They called me the pride...</i>
<i>the pride of Lowell.</i>

25
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,969
<i>Everybody still talks about it,</i>
<i>especially my brother.</i>

26
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,942
<i>His whole life he wanted</i>
<i>to do what I did, you know?</i>

27
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,912
<i>But we're very different fighters.</i>

28
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,778
Micky's, you know,
he's a heavy hitter.

29
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,181
He's got... a thunderous,

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,346
I'm telling you,
thunderous left punch.

31
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,822
Micky, he gets you
and he takes a punishment,

32
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,325
I don't know why he does it,
till you're right fuckin' in there.

33
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,520
He likes getting on the inside,
I stay on the outside.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,491
Come on.

35
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,393
Dicky.

36
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,599
Would you come on?

37
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,571
Will you stop...?
You gotta help me finish this.

38
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,410
Come on!

39
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,410
- And predictable as ever.
- All right.

40
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,741
- You don't need to be Columbo
- Here you go.

41
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,145
To see where this fight is headed.

42
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:08,311
Bam! Over right hand
puts Micky Ward down!

43
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,787
HBO's making a movie
on me and my comeback!

44
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:17,557
And my brother is gonna beat
Saoul Mamby in Atlantic City next week!

45
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,463
The pride of Lowell is back!

46
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,401
Quacka!
Who wants some?!

47
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,631
Who wants some?!

48
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,229
Hey! I want a cut.

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,234
Are you good?
You guys having a good day?

50
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,200
How are ya?

51
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,907
Come on! What you got?
What you got going on?

52
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,877
Lou! Hey, Lou!

53
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,209
- How are you guys?
- Dicky.

54
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,885
Making my comeback.

55
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,984
Hey, naughty, naughty.
What's going on here?

56
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,628
Hey, Dicky, Micky!
Take my picture.

57
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,027
- Take a picture?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,039
- Hey!
- Hey, Louie!

59
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,236
HBO's making a movie on me!

60
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,780
What's going on? Hey, beautiful.

61
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,751
Did you tap that?

62
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,484
I can't remember. I got CRS:
I Can't Remember Shit!

63
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,528
Hey, Jerry Garcia!

64
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,859
Are you nuts?

65
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,729
How'd you get here?
You drive around?

66
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,168
Hey, Ray. Ray. I love you, Ray.

67
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,035
You're doing well.

68
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,712
You're walking. Get on it.

69
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,633
- We make a mistake?
- Nah, I mean, he'll be here.

70
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,202
You know, like I said,
sometimes he goes on his own schedule

71
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,898
but when he gets here, we work hard.
You know, nobody pushes me harder.

72
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,237
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

73
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,107
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters? They'll talk your ear off.

74
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,338
You gotta pay them to shut up.

75
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,574
He can tell you
how Dicky was helping him.

76
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,947
Yeah, come on, Micky.

77
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:57,489
- O'Keefe!
- Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

78
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,614
You know where he is.

79
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,410
What's that Keystone Kop
doing in there? Where's Dicky? Girls?

80
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,514
- I don't know.
- Did you see him, your brother?

81
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,639
- Not this morning?
- Look at Ma!

82
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,844
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

83
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,512
- Wow!
- Get outta the ring, O'Keefe.

84
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,556
My Dicky should be doing that, huh?

85
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,956
Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.

86
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,892
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

87
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,726
Don't. Just forget about him.

88
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,267
He's number two man.
He's not part of this, all right?

89
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,166
- He's not being handled right.
- You get me coming in all right?

90
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,532
You want me to do that again?

91
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,197
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
Dicky's the trainer.

92
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,334
- I'm doing a favor, Alice.
- I will show you over here

93
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,777
these scrapbooks
I've been collecting for years.

94
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,611
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

95
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,309
Taught ya everything, didn't he, honey?

96
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,787
In '78, we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

97
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,983
Oh, my God, it was...
Have you seen that video?

98
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,287
Oh, you're from HBO.
You gotta see it again. Come on.

99
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,862
Art, Art, where's the video at?

100
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,871
<i>Tonight, my son is gonna surprise</i>
<i>everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.</i>

101
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,202
<i>Believe me, I know it.</i>

102
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,235
<i>Sugar Ray might have</i>
<i>some trouble tonight.</i>

103
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,679
<i>That's a good possibility.</i>
<i>He comes in here against a good boxer,</i>

104
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,082
<i>a young man who can punch,</i>
<i>and I would like to say at this time</i>

105
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,484
<i>that physically</i>
<i>they're just about equal.</i>

106
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,271
<i>Leonard is down.</i>
<i>Let's see if that's a knockdown.</i>

107
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,376
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

108
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,613
<i>Eklund just walked over him!</i>

109
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,743
<i>Nobody seems</i>
<i>to know what's happening!</i>

110
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,793
Dicky did it.
Yeah. Tricky Dicky did it.

111
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,563
- Dicky did it.
- Weren't you supposed to be

112
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,726
training Micky right now?

113
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,397
- No, it ain't till 9:00.
- Dicky, it's fucking 11:45!

114
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,065
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?!

115
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,734
Where'd you fuckin'
park the car, Boo Boo?!

116
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,904
I didn't park it. You did.
I didn't park it.

117
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,446
Check your fuckin' pockets
for the keys.

118
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,982
- You got the keys, yeah?
- I didn't park it, man.

119
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,882
- Down there? I don't know.
- Check your pockets, all right?

120
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,818
- You're fuckin' mental.
- Fuck it!

121
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,049
I'll run. I need the fuckin' roadwork.

122
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:51,255
- Roadwork? Are you crazy?
- He's a great runner.

123
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,490
Hey.

124
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,682
Hey!

125
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,619
Quacka!

126
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,357
- Hey, Dicky.
- Better late than never.

127
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,491
Oh, look! Detective's on the scene.

128
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,068
Gonna get to the bottom of this.

129
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:39,303
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Dick, you're an asshole.

130
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,935
Hold it, hold it.
Let me get this straight.

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,516
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

132
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,483
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner,
and this is what goes on.

133
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,917
OK.

134
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,852
Don't you have
a job to go to or something?

135
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,686
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

136
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,987
Yeah, Sergeant
O'Keefe's working overtime here.

137
00:09:56,128 --> 00:10:00,531
So we got Saoul Mamby,
Jewish, black, former world champ.

138
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,531
I think we got all the bases covered.

139
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:07,105
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

140
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,070
You know, he can't get used
to losing. It's a mental thing.

141
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,472
But we're gonna break
that with Mamby, right?

142
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,976
Yeah, I hope, if we can train...

143
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,740
We can train, right. Enough of you
wasting time, Mick. You know?

144
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,314
- Wasting time?
- Half the fuckin' day's gone!

145
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,441
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, half the day's gone,

146
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,143
- and I been waiting here for you.
- You wanna win?

147
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,625
Jab, two, three, four.
Left, right, punch right. Jab...

148
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,031
And again! One, two, three, four...

149
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,195
One, two, three, four, five...
Jab, jab...

150
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,406
There you go! There you go!

151
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,782
Come on, move!
Might as well drop the weight,

152
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,511
we're gonna out-box Mamby.

153
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,814
- Take it out on the mitts.
- Head, body, head.

154
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,391
That's your fuckin' combo.
Head, body, head.

155
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,960
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

156
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,791
You know,
Sugar Ray's gonna be there,

157
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,559
calling the fight for ESPN.

158
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,966
I ain't seen him
since I knocked him down.

159
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,163
Like 14 years ago or somethin'. Right?

160
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,597
Hook!

161
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,835
Let's get
a real sparring going on here.

162
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,445
Don't wanna embarrass yourself.

163
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,706
Don't wanna embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?

164
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,578
- You got him...
- Come on. Head, body, head!

165
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,844
Fuck.

166
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,621
- Fuckin' yeah. That's your punch, Mick.
- Oh, my God.

167
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,383
That's your punch.

168
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,221
That's your liver punch.
It shuts the whole fuckin' body down.

169
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,728
George's fingers are so fuckin' fat,
he can't even dial the phone!

170
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,865
Hey, right there, Tar!

171
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,435
That's not helping, George!

172
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,731
- Hold on. Wait a minute. I'm confused.
- What?

173
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,737
- Yeah, I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

174
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,342
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

175
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:56,244
- Dick Eklund Sr. Is Dicky's...
- Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis's father.

176
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,610
- Is Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

177
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,550
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so is Cindy and Cathy,

178
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,747
- George is really their...
- And Micky...

179
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,881
- No. Micky and I are...
- Sherri Ward.

180
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,254
- We're Wards.
- The Wards.

181
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,490
It's not the way it sounds. Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

182
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,964
And then there was George,
just George. George is my man.

183
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:20,368
- Georgie's our poppa.
- After Dick, it was just George.

184
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,335
Charlene! Charlene!

185
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,770
Hey, Charlene!

186
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,711
- We're doing shots with Charlene!
- Yeah, you get over here.

187
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,013
- Come on! Come over here.
- Come on, drink yours.

188
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,812
On the count of three... Three!

189
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,723
Good job, fellas.
Oh, hey, one more time.

190
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,299
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

191
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,674
I told her all about you.

192
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,175
I don't wanna ask her
if she's gonna say no.

193
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,306
Can't beat that ass, can ya?

194
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,180
Get out of the booth.
Come on. Come on.

195
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,219
Are you just gonna stand there
and stare at my ass?

196
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,389
Your father stares at my ass,
but he talks to me.

197
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,626
Thinks you're the greatest.

198
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,202
- He didn't tell me you were mute.
- Keep the change, doll.

199
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,668
He told me you're
Kenny Fleming's sister.

200
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,501
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip.

201
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,233
You know what the bell
says about this tip?

202
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,038
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

203
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,976
Comes in here every day,
gives me shitty tips.

204
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,674
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck you, too.

205
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,184
- Forget it, boys...
- You pave streets, right?

206
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,481
- Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.
- Oh, yeah,

207
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,112
I heard you were a stepping-stone.

208
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:50,559
- No, I'm no stepping-stone.
- You're the guy they use,

209
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,926
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

210
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,090
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

211
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,634
The next fight's gonna show who I am.

212
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,863
Yeah, and he's
gonna lose that one, too.

213
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,633
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

214
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,710
So move that sugar ass
and get my...

215
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,779
You be nice. OK?

216
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,574
Be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

217
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,411
Hey, don't hurt your hands.
We got a fight next week.

218
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,019
Besides, you wipe
your ass with that one.

219
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,088
Don't lean up, or I'm gonna hit you
in the cocksucker.

220
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,249
- He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!
- Yeah, he's gonna beat him!

221
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,486
Right? Right? Hey!

222
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,790
- Right.
- That's right!

223
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,489
I'm gonna take your drink, as well.
I'm taking his drink.

224
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,466
Hey, this guy's gonna be champion.
He's a great guy.

225
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,731
He's a great fighter. You can't
go wrong. Thanks for the drink.

226
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,341
Those cameras are makin'
a movie about him.

227
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,807
He knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,

228
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,605
that's why they're following him
around with the camera.

229
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,475
And now they're making
a movie about his comeback.

230
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,243
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fightin'

231
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,080
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

232
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,280
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

233
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,516
Where did they find a guy like that?

234
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,490
He's no joke. Former world champ.

235
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,960
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

236
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,031
- I match up good with him though.
- Yeah?

237
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,860
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

238
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,936
Well, I got lighter, you know?
I have a reputation for brawlin'

239
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,698
but I'm not gonna brawl with him.
I'm gonna try and out-box him.

240
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,467
- And there's a difference?
- Yeah, you know.

241
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,803
Brawlin' you slug it out.
I hit you, you hit me.

242
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,243
Boxing's a chess game, you know?
I pick my punches to take him down.

243
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,906
And go head, body, head, body.

244
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,945
- What is "head, body, head, body"?
- Well, I hit him in the head,

245
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,419
and then his hand's gonna go up
to protect himself,

246
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,490
so it opens up his body,
and then when I hit him in the body,

247
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,923
the hand goes back down,
I go back up to the head,

248
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,029
hand goes back up, hit him in the body.

249
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,654
People who don't know fighting
think you can do a lot of damage

250
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,633
hitting somebody in the head,
but you do more hitting 'em in the body.

251
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,364
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

252
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,637
Are you married?

253
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,642
No. Would I ask you out
if I was married?

254
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,906
- What kind of guy do you think I am?
- Happens all the time. Trust me.

255
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,709
I'm not like that.

256
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,818
I'm not married. I got a daughter.
I see her every other weekend.

257
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,319
Her name's Kasie. But that's it.

258
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,650
Come on. Let me take you out.

259
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,188
When?

260
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,660
Saturday night.
I get back from Atlantic City.

261
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,608
- Is this the real number?
- You have to call it and see.

262
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,151
I will. Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

263
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,504
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Micky, hey. How's it going?

264
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,805
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

265
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,815
What's he doin' here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

266
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,112
Look, I just want to say hi to Kasie.

267
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,811
It's not your day. Good-bye.

268
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,889
Yeah, but I'm not
around next weekend.

269
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,290
- You ditchin' the days you do have?
- No, I have a fight. I told you that.

270
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,091
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

271
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,361
I can't talk to her, OK?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

272
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,733
I want to talk to my daughter. Now.

273
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,306
- Talk to your father.
- Goddamn it, Jimmy.

274
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,341
Daddy's gonna fight Saoul Mamby.

275
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,341
That's right. I want
to tell you that after I win,

276
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,447
I'm gonna start making good money,
and I'll move into a bigger apartment

277
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,811
like we talked about
so you can live with me more days, OK?

278
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,850
- Yeah, bigger apartment!
- Wish me luck, all right?

279
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,422
Don't hold your breath, Kasie.
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

280
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,023
Good luck, Daddy.

281
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,457
Thanks, Kasie.
I love you, honey. Bye, baby.

282
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,152
Where is he?

283
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,266
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.

284
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,602
- Quit worrying, for crying out loud.
- Blow that shit in my face.

285
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:03,005
You know, it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

286
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,015
and they have a saying,
"Let Go and Let God."

287
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,449
- You gotta let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

288
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,317
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

289
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,890
You're already doing it without him.

290
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,516
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

291
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,653
Look, you know where he is.
Why don't you just go get him?

292
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,891
- Can you get him?
- I'm not fuckin' going to get him.

293
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,902
Are we all gonna go over there in
the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

294
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,046
Dicky.

295
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,744
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

296
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,817
Dicky, your mother's outside!
She's down there!

297
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,689
I'm not here.

298
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,588
- Oh, no.
- What?

299
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,257
- I gotta go check...
- Dicky, no!

300
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,301
Don't, Dicky! Dicky!

301
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,665
- He's goin'...
- Dicky...

302
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,432
...better get out of here.
- Dicky, no!

303
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,736
Quacka, what the fuck are you doing?

304
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,072
You know we gotta go to the airport
now. We got a flight to catch.

305
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,737
You know how important
this fight is to me.

306
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,941
Hey, don't tell Ma I'm here,
all right?

307
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,142
- She knows!
- No, no, no.

308
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,219
- Pick me up back at the house.
- Are you fucking...

309
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,413
- I'll go through the yards.
- She's in the driveway right now.

310
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,490
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fuckin' driveway.

311
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,320
- We got a flight to catch.
- You son of a bitch.

312
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,894
You do this on the day your
brother's traveling?!

313
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,622
What are you doing?

314
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,494
- Why'd you make me do that?
- What the fuck you hit him for?

315
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,931
Why'd you make me do that to you?

316
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,330
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky.

317
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,994
I was on my way! Ma...

318
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,335
- What are you doing in this place?
- There you go. There you go.

319
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,171
Why can't we just go to the fuckin'
airport for once, please?

320
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,075
- We got a plane to catch.
- Hey, Alice, what about your husband?

321
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,682
He's laying on the fuckin' ground.
You wanna help your husband?

322
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,546
What are you doing running in here
like a silverback fuckin' gorilla?

323
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,177
- We had to get him, for Chrissakes.
- Yeah, you got him all right.

324
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,755
You got him, pal.

325
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,206
You see Mamby?
You see how Mamby's arm comes up?

326
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,746
Leaves his side open, you just
light him up like a pinball machine.

327
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,318
He's gonna be pissin' blood.
No way you lose, Mick. No way.

328
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,976
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky boy.

329
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,487
Hey, listen, what? ESPN can't
get us better rooms than this?

330
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,319
I wouldn't worry about
the rooms right now, Dicky.

331
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,757
- We got bigger headaches.
- Like what?

332
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,695
- Doctor won't let Mamby fight.
- Why not?

333
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,959
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

334
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,193
Yeah.

335
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,667
Micky, we can still have a fight.

336
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,602
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

337
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,934
Mike who, Mungin?
Who's that?

338
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,940
Guy from Philly?
Isn't he in prison?

339
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,875
He's been out a few months. I've
called everybody, checked everywhere.

340
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,140
He's the only guy I could find.

341
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,944
My last few fights were rough, Lou.
This one's supposed to be easier.

342
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,212
I mean, we've been fuckin'
preparing for Mamby.

343
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,049
Yeah, but this guy
just came off the couch.

344
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,454
He's been sittin' on his ass.
Could be an easy win for Mick.

345
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,785
Joey Ferrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

346
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,453
Micky knocked out Joey Ferrell.

347
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,724
Exactly.
And Mungin just got off the couch.

348
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,800
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

349
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,029
- How over?
- Maybe 162, 165.

350
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,301
One-sixty-five?
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.

351
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,003
Lou, we prepared for Mamby. All right?
We prepared for Mamby.

352
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,138
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

353
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,582
Roadwork, everything else.
This other guy, he hasn't done dick.

354
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,314
Don't forget, you don't fight,
nobody gets paid.

355
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,261
OK.

356
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,858
So, Lou... Come on, please.

357
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,970
Mick...
Joey Ferrell knocked him out.

358
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,537
Gonna be a hell of a fight, huh?

359
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,575
- I'm not doing this. 165 is big.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

360
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,702
- So what? He's a middleweight.
- He just got off the couch.

361
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,337
He's got 20 pounds on me, Dicky.

362
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,246
Joey Ferrell knocked him out,
you knocked out Joey Ferrell.

363
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,979
- You just said that.
- Yeah, right. You can't be scared.

364
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,281
- Scared?
- Yeah.

365
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,721
- Why don't you go fuckin' fight him?
- I'll go fuckin' fight him. He's fat.

366
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,951
Good. Snap out the teeth.
This is your big comeback, right?

367
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,495
- That's what Alice wants.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

368
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,862
All right. I knocked out Joey Ferrell,
OK? But the guy is a middleweight.

369
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,061
I'm a welterweight. They didn't have
a fuckin' heavyweight to throw in there?

370
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,764
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

371
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,137
Oh, yeah, Alice. No problem.

372
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,608
You watch from the outside, pal.

373
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:32,012
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!</i>

374
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,010
Holy shit.

375
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,452
Hey, hey, look.
That's Sugar Ray Leonard.

376
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,285
Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray.

377
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,053
- Hey, Ray! Sugar Ray! Over here!
- Dicky.

378
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,992
Come on, look at the size of that guy.

379
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,430
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

380
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,159
That guy's no welterweight.

381
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,065
All right, Mick. We'll have to run
the first few rounds, tire him out.

382
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,605
He did not just get off
the fuckin' couch.

383
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,641
If he did,
I'm gonna buy a couch like that.

384
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,006
I don't care who that guy is...

385
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,443
Look at me.
You're Micky Ward.

386
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,776
You're Micky Ward.

387
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,953
Micky Ward, fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia.

388
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,523
Ward, thrown around
by a much bigger man!

389
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,627
- Punches, smashing Ward back!
- Jab!

390
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,561
Now it's big Mike...

391
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,962
Ward goes down! Ward goes down!

392
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,035
- Come on! Come on!
...four, five...

393
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,601
...six...

394
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,139
Micky Ward's a fuckin' bum!
Get rid of this dude!

395
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,435
- Shut up!
- Motherfucker!

396
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,340
Mungin didn't even
know he'd be fighting today.

397
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,277
Hey, you, back off!

398
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:41,975
Come on! No, no, no, Mick!

399
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,913
Ward, a respected fighter.

400
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,321
You hope this mismatch
doesn't hurt his confidence.

401
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,453
- You're a loser!
- You're a loser!

402
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,512
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

403
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,315
<i>before we get started,</i>
<i>a lot of people have been asking</i>

404
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,220
<i>about the big night</i>
<i>of boxing on November 4.</i>

405
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,656
<i>Three world championship bouts...</i>

406
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,729
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

407
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,565
- Hey!
- Dicky. How you doin' man?

408
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,932
- How are ya?
- All right, man.

409
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,632
He's 165 pounds.
ESPN screwed us. You know?

410
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,972
- The guy was huge.
- Hey. You know, I...

411
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,102
I knocked Ray down.

412
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,908
I look like shit,
but I knocked Ray down.

413
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,449
Hey, let me buy
you guys a drink. All right?

414
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,576
- Want a cold one?
- No, no, no.

415
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,086
I got to leave. I got a plane to catch.
Next time, right?

416
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,124
Hey, Ray, wait, wait. HBO's makin'
a movie on me. You know?

417
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,783
Can I call ya?

418
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:00,625
I'm gonna get a fight, and I just like
ya to be there for old time's sakes.

419
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,427
- You commentate or something.
- What's the movie about?

420
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,798
My comeback. Right?

421
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,770
- Call me. Love you, brother.
- I'll call ya.

422
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,397
You don't be a stranger!

423
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,439
He's funny,
"What's the movie about?"

424
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,567
What's that?

425
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,204
You can do better. You're too
good a boxer, I've watched you.

426
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,374
- Are you going to the hospital?
- What is that?

427
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,318
- They said I need to get stitches.
- Mick, nobody's got heart like you.

428
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,390
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

429
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,891
- It's killing your chances.
- What's he talking to Mike Toma for?

430
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,552
- I don't know, Dick.
- I want to give you a real shot.

431
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,257
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

432
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,765
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

433
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,133
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

434
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,830
What about my brother?

435
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,441
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

436
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,704
You owe it to yourself
to come to Vegas.

437
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,371
Come on, Mick,
what has Dicky done for you?

438
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,279
He got you into fights, he lets
you get beat, like you did tonight.

439
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,081
You shouldn't have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds, think of it that way.

440
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,689
You should've given it up.

441
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,318
Sit down in the car there.
Come on, you.

442
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,328
- Sit the hell down.
- A little more Scotch for Mama.

443
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,955
There you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back.

444
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,001
- Will ya, ya old broad ya?
- Oh, my God.

445
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,402
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray,
he's a beautiful man, isn't he?

446
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,905
He didn't recognize me
straight away.

447
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,873
You seen the way
he was looking at me?

448
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,111
He's a good guy.
I like him, I like him.

449
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,276
I seen him on ringside, he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

450
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,353
He's all about family, that guy.
Loves to see a family stick together.

451
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:33,184
Mick, what'd Mike Toma
want with you last night?

452
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,555
- He wants to train me in Vegas.
- What?

453
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,889
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

454
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:42,591
You don't know him. He say anything
about me? Did he say I could come?

455
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,565
He didn't mention you.

456
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,202
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without your brother?

457
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,639
That guy just wants to use you
like a piece of toilet paper.

458
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,176
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

459
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,076
- I know, that's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

460
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,013
Yeah, I told him. I said that I needed
to be with my family in Lowell.

461
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,415
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

462
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,385
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're gonna call him, baby.

463
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,511
That's right.

464
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,716
You guys can spar a little, right?

465
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,918
Where are they?

466
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,892
- There's my champ!
- Daddy's home!

467
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,796
- Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
- Give him a big hug.

468
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:16,992
I love you!

469
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,063
Thank you.

470
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,229
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

471
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,571
No? 'Cause it's killing me.
Come on.

472
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,938
Did Uncle Micky win the fight?

473
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,706
No, Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

474
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,375
Hey, Mick, you take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

475
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,884
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

476
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,148
I don't know, Ma. I don't
think I wanna do this no more.

477
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,688
What don't you wanna do no more?

478
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,314
Just, I don't wanna do it anymore.

479
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,725
- What are you...?
- Hey, Mick, ESPN screwed us.

480
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:50,267
All right? They owe us. We'll get
another fight. You'll heal up.

481
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,802
- It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

482
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,905
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

483
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,769
Maybe they'll even
do Dicky's comeback fight.

484
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,432
What do you think?

485
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,004
Oh, come on, cheer up. You take
a little soak when you get home,

486
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,342
have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight.

487
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,177
A much better fight.
I'm gonna talk to them.

488
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,751
- For Chrissakes, Alice.
- What?

489
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,479
He's been through the ringer.
Leave him alone, will ya?

490
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,611
What are you talking about?

491
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,587
Let him get some time to himself.
He just got finished.

492
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,590
- What's your fuckin' problem?
- Come on.

493
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,854
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not gonna come in?

494
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,760
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

495
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,429
Come on, let's go inside.

496
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,866
No. He's gonna go rest.
He's all grumpy.

497
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,472
He's beat up,
he's a little embarrassed, I think.

498
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,369
Look at him.
Have you even seen him?

499
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,060
Who is it?

500
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,254
I saw the shade move.

501
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,154
Micky, the shade is still moving.

502
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,524
I saw you come to the window,
I know you're in there.

503
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,530
Least you can do is open up
this door and tell me to my face

504
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,861
why you didn't call me yesterday.

505
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,105
Why'd you stand me up last night?

506
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,508
I started to call. I was gonna call,
but... I just couldn't.

507
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,171
'Cause you lost the fight?

508
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,909
Maybe, yeah.
'Cause I lost the fight.

509
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,848
How'd you know my house, anyway?

510
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,783
I asked my brother.

511
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,756
Your thing's coming off.

512
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,791
I mean your other thing.

513
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,556
You got any tape?

514
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,502
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

515
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,042
I didn't get to fight
the black Jewish guy.

516
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,875
You didn't get to go
head, body, head?

517
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,917
Saoul Mamby got the flu. Guy who
took his place had 20 pounds on me.

518
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,749
I never should've fought him.

519
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:02,553
- Why did you?
- Nobody would've got paid.

520
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,458
Everybody said I could've beat him.

521
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,963
Who's everybody?

522
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,897
My mother, my brother.

523
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,598
So are you gonna take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

524
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,565
- Hey.
- Hey.

525
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,064
- You look great.
- Thank you.

526
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,040
Got a nice house, too.

527
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,236
It's an apartment building.
There's five of 'em in there.

528
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,075
One of my old roommates lives in one.

529
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,614
Roommate?
What, were you in the Army?

530
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,877
- College.
- College. Wow.

531
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,647
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

532
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,689
Well, you seem to enjoy it.
You're very popular down there.

533
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,384
Yeah, popular.
I gotta get out of there.

534
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:12,087
If I don't drink while I'm working,
I'll fuckin' kill myself.

535
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,324
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

536
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,626
Full boat's a scholarship, right?

537
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,929
- Yeah.
- For what?

538
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,403
- I was a high jumper.
- High jumper? You gotta be kidding me.

539
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,839
Fuck you. I was good. I was
New England champ. I cleared 5' 8".

540
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,912
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

541
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,207
You?

542
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,593
What are we doing
in Richie Rich Lexington?

543
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,063
You come to this theater a lot?

544
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,168
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They got good movies here.

545
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,328
- Yeah, like what?
<i>- Belli Epi-que.</i>

546
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,203
I think it's <i>Belle Epic.</i>
It's "epic." <i>Belle Epic.</i>

547
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,471
<i>Belle Epoque.</i>
<i>The New York Times</i> loved it.

548
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,477
Well, I never heard of it.

549
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,707
Where'd you hear about it?
<i>The New York Times?</i>

550
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,114
No, a guy from work.

551
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,083
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

552
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,518
Oh, cool.

553
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,603
Thank you.

554
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,714
That's the movie you wanted to see?

555
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,151
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

556
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,689
Had to read the whole fuckin' movie.
Fuckin' subtitled.

557
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,059
And some guy from a road crew
recommended it to you?

558
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,026
A fuckin' subtitled movie?

559
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,266
What's going on?

560
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,495
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

561
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,162
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

562
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,103
I... I like you.

563
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,040
I came here 'cause I don't
wanna show my face in Lowell.

564
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,613
I told everybody I was gonna win
that fight and get back on track.

565
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:13,342
I told my daughter I was gonna get
a bigger apartment so she can move in.

566
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,281
You don't think I wanted to call you?

567
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,722
I was embarrassed. I mean... I'm sick
of being a fuckin' disappointment. I...

568
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,963
You really think
your family's looking out for you?

569
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,165
Don't say that about my family.

570
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:37,240
What else can I say
after what you told me?

571
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,400
I mean, look at your face.

572
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,209
Look at you.

573
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,998
Bullshit, Lou. I'm not gonna
stop callin' till you make this right

574
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,507
and give us a fight that's fair.

575
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,407
My boy could've got killed last time.

576
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,142
Yeah, like what?

577
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,353
Just don't tell me he just
got off the fuckin' couch.

578
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,461
He's coming off a loss?

579
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,359
Sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

580
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,659
We got a great opportunity here.

581
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,133
We gotta go find Micky.

582
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,067
Nobody's seen him
for like three weeks.

583
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,368
Jesus.

584
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,000
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find,
now it's both of them?

585
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,204
Ma, I think he's
with that girl from the bar.

586
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,339
- What girl?
- It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.

587
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,451
That's who he's with.
That girl from the bar.

588
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,713
George was all fuckin' eager
for them to get together.

589
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,048
I heard she's into three-ways.

590
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,024
- Yeah, with other girls.
- Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

591
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,924
MTV...
What are you talking about?

592
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,290
Wild.

593
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,490
She acts all fuckin' superior
'cause she went to college.

594
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,329
You girls just go
find your brother, Micky.

595
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,962
Tell him we've got important
business to discuss.

596
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,976
I've gotta go find Dicky.

597
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,546
Dicky!

598
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,328
Hey, Ma, there's nothing
in there. I just...

599
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,838
It was just some friends I was seeing,
you know?

600
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,636
Don't worry about it, Ma.

601
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,416
I was just helping 'em out, you know?

602
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,954
Hey, Alice...

603
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,056
Alice...

604
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,959
<i>I started a joke</i>

605
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:51,034
<i>Which started the whole world cryin'</i>

606
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:55,332
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

607
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:59,204
<i>That the joke was on me</i>

608
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:03,040
<i>I started to cry</i>

609
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,516
<i>Which started</i>
<i>the whole world laughin'</i>

610
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,453
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

611
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,923
<i>That the joke was on me</i>

612
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,757
<i>I looked at the skies</i>

613
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:25,767
<i>Runnin'my hands over my eyes</i>

614
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:31,569
<i>And I fell out of bed</i>

615
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,109
<i>Hurting my head...</i>

616
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,655
So you're Beaver
and you're Red Bear.

617
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:57,757
- Red Beard.
- She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

618
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,370
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.

619
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,064
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

620
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,072
Be nice.

621
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,870
Don't use the nicknames.

622
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,677
I don't think
I'll fuckin' call 'em anything.

623
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,411
Speaking of family...

624
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,058
Hello.

625
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,729
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

626
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,761
I've heard a lot about you.

627
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,873
Really? I've heard
a lot about you, too.

628
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,941
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

629
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,135
Can we just sit down
and talk about business?

630
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:46,380
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

631
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,342
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.

632
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:55,016
Just like I told you. Joe Belinc.
Six weeks. The Foxwoods.

633
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,595
Kid's like, you know,
ten and eight, he's nothin'.

634
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,026
You know? And they're
gonna pay us 20 grand.

635
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,826
- Seventeen-five, Dick.
- Seventeen-five.

636
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,959
Which is still... good money, Mick.

637
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,764
Yeah.

638
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,536
Yeah, that's good, Dick. I'm just,

639
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,200
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for me.

640
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,105
Like what?

641
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,785
What's best for you, sweetheart?

642
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,050
Come on, Mick, I thought
you'd be more excited.

643
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,558
Why ain't you more excited?
It's a good fight, good money.

644
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,993
I got tough with Lou Gold.
Told him he owes us.

645
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,167
Yeah, I know, Ma. I don't want things
going the way they've been going.

646
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:43,205
Mick, that last fight,
it was unfair. That was unfair.

647
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,673
- And we ain't gonna repeat that. Right?
- No, not on your life.

648
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,242
No, but...
It's just you in the ring.

649
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,939
Yeah, I know it's me in the ring.

650
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,209
But I don't like the way things
have been going here.

651
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,649
- Where?
- Here. This. Us. Lowell.

652
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,652
The whole routine.

653
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,019
- George, stay out of it.
- You're doing all the talking.

654
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,557
Let him talk. Listen.

655
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,526
- I'm askin' him.
- You're tellin' him.

656
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,062
- Listen.
- Stay out of it.

657
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,995
Don't tell me to stay out of it.

658
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,391
Mick, what's the problem?

659
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,269
- The problems.
- What problems?

660
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,671
- Problems...
- Like what?

661
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,939
Like, maybe you not
showing up on time to train.

662
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,311
Like maybe him having to come
find you in a crack house

663
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,112
when you're supposed
to be at the airport.

664
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:35,114
I'm sorry. I don't know who
you are, or why you're talking.

665
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,820
I'm Charlene. We just met.

666
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,898
We're together. Do we need
to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.

667
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,466
Hi, I'm Charlene.

668
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:45,924
Hi, I'm Charlene.

669
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,766
Hey, we're together!

670
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,903
What are you gonna do, Mick? Listen
to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

671
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,909
What's she know about boxing?

672
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:01,040
I know that going to Vegas
and gettin' paid to train year-round

673
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,676
sounds a hell of a lot better
than what you got him doing here.

674
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,450
You gonna let her talk
like that to your mother?

675
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,060
Come on, Micky.

676
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,756
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

677
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:21,097
I have done everything...
everything I could for you, Micky.

678
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:24,696
- This MTV girl comes along...
- Stop calling me an MTV girl,

679
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,139
whatever the fuck that means.

680
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,676
- Skank.
- It's wild.

681
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,347
I've been doing this over 15 years.
She comes in, disrespects me.

682
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,147
She don't mean no disrespect, OK?

683
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:41,520
I had a chance to get paid to train
year-round, year-round, OK?

684
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:42,921
That's all she's talking about.

685
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,028
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

686
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,258
I know what you're talking about.
All right? I could've had that.

687
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,997
You know? I had... I had opportunities,
like maybe you're gonna have.

688
00:42:55,139 --> 00:43:00,634
Now... You want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

689
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,643
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

690
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,771
- You? How?
- Yeah, I'll do it. Trust me.

691
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,681
Hey, trust me. All right? Done.

692
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:14,715
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?

693
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,724
<i>So, you put in $200, right?</i>

694
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,562
Then you get ten other people
to put in 200...

695
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,999
...and you got your 2,000.

696
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,380
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody, just ten of you.

697
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,073
Ten lucky ones.

698
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:44,676
You rip us off.

699
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,414
No, no, I'm giving you an opportunity.

700
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,650
You give me $200.

701
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,785
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

702
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,558
Right? You understand? No?

703
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,038
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

704
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:08,337
I love Cambodian people.
I mean, look at Karen.

705
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,545
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

706
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,378
You know, and Brian.
We work on a road crew together.

707
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:18,045
- Well, not so much lately.
- We work on a road crew together.

708
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,520
You haven't been showing up,
that's all I'm saying.

709
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,354
This ain't an anti-Cambodian thing.

710
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,462
White people do this
to other white people.

711
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,497
- It's what makes the world go round.
- Boo Boo, I don't think that's helping.

712
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:32,329
I mean, this is...
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

713
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,269
I mean, they didn't understand.

714
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,537
You know, I mean,
they're practically my gang.

715
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,080
Usually, they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand

716
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,513
the opportunity, you know,
I was offering them.

717
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:50,085
- What were we talking about?
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.

718
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,155
Right, right, right. I mean,
Sugar Ray was too much too soon.

719
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,782
You know, I needed to build up slow.
You know, right?

720
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:58,986
What's this movie about, again?

721
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,689
I told you,
it's about crack addiction.

722
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:05,700
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

723
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,933
Fuck.

724
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,234
We gotta get Mick's money.

725
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,117
Yes! That was awesome!

726
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,176
Go. Right now.

727
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,117
Go, go, go...

728
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,272
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

729
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,068
Get out of the car, now!
Move!

730
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,609
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof!

731
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,337
- That's it! Empty your pockets!
- Are you a cop?

732
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,507
Go to the fuckin' sidewalk. Move!
Fuckin' move! Don't turn around!

733
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,347
Don't turn around!
Gonna have to take your vehicle.

734
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,978
- How am I gonna get home?
- That's your problem!

735
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,392
Get us some rocks.
How much we got here? Count it.

736
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,324
What the fuck?!

737
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,161
That's the guy! He did it to me
and he's doing it again!

738
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,032
- Dicky, get on the ground, right now!
- Get that fucking...!

739
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,101
Ta-da! What do you think?

740
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:26,975
Open the door!
Trying to get off the fuckin' street!

741
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,069
What the fuck! I'm trying
to get off the fuckin' street!

742
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,274
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

743
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,212
Did you hear me?!

744
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:45,258
You gotta see this!
They're fuckin' up Dicky Eklund!

745
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,861
It's Dicky! It's Dicky Eklund.
The cops are all over him.

746
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,596
They're fuckin' punching him,
they're beatin' him. He needs help!

747
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,570
Stay here! Don't get up. Stay here!

748
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,575
- Listen to him. You stay right here.
- I gotta go.

749
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,079
You better get back here.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

750
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,620
Hey, what the fuck? Come on,
just put him in the car!

751
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,318
You don't need to do that!
Just put him in the car!

752
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,691
- Come on, just let him go!
- You wanna get involved?

753
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,128
Now you're involved!

754
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:25,702
You're fuckin' up my brother!
I'll kill you!

755
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,827
He's a fighter! Break his fuckin' hands!

756
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,098
- Don't!
- I didn't do nothing!

757
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,575
- I didn't do nothing!
- Shut the fuck up.

758
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,442
Move 'em out!

759
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,554
Micky, your hand. Your hand.

760
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:47,750
Don't tell me to come on.

761
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,688
Back up yourself, for Chrissake.

762
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,226
Hey, separate cars, separate cells.

763
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,422
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

764
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,726
Come on, folks,
time to go home. Let's go.

765
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,030
- No blankets.
- Dicky!

766
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,331
What the fuck, man!

767
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,270
- Micky!
- Jesus Christ.

768
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,309
Don't get involved.
You shouldn't get involved, sir.

769
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,877
Look at his hands.

770
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,206
Shit.

771
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:16,645
Go home, folks. Good night!

772
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,068

779
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:15,341
- Come on.
- Judy, can I have the file three-57?

780
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,573
I need a copy
of the discovery reports as well.

781
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,386
Mick, you're gonna say it
was self-defense, right?

782
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,681
- You did it to yourself, Dicky.
- What?

783
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,084
You're gonna say it was
self-defense, right?

784
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,988
You came outside, you seen them
beatin' on me, I didn't do nothin'.

785
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,028
Right? I was just waitin' outside like
anybody? Mick, I was doing it for you!

786
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,630
You did it for me? What, this?

787
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,359
Do me a favor, don't do fuckin'
nothing for me no more, OK?

788
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,264
I'm fuckin' done lyin' for you.

789
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,496
What are you
gonna do without me?

790
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,006
This isn't how it was meant to go down!

791
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,042
They should've just put me in the car!

792
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,742
Oh, Mick, come on! Mick!

793
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:07,292
Dicky!
Hey, what's up, Dicky?!

794
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,932
Hey, Eklund!

795
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,660
Dicky!

796
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,632
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

797
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,673
Dicky, Dicky, Dicky...

798
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,018
Who is it?

799
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,552
<i>I don't want to see you, Micky.</i>

800
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,062
- Charlene...
- <i>I can't take it.</i>

801
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:18,133
<i>I'm not gonna let you</i>
<i>or your family drag me down.</i>

802
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,828
I'm quitting, Charlene, OK?
I'm done fightin'.

803
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,962
I don't need it anymore.

804
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,906
- That's fuckin' stupid.
- <i>What? Why?</i>

805
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,409
Because it's sad that you
let them take it away from you

806
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,446
with their stupid bullshit.

807
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,745
<i>What else can I do, Charlene?</i>

808
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,444
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

809
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,350
There's this guy that
your dad wants you to meet.

810
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,287
You just don't think you
can do it without Dicky.

811
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,791
Charlene...

812
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,293
<i>Don't call.</i>

813
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,454
Come on.

814
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,225
<i>Don't call me, OK?</i>

815
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,909
Hey, Dicky, you hurtin' man?

816
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,571
Poor fucker!

817
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,310
Hang in there, man!

818
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,182
Go, Dicky!

819
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,489
Hey, Dicky!

820
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,830
Hey, keep it quiet!

821
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,517
Hey, Micky!
Bring another bucket, huh?

822
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,850
Good.

823
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,232
<i>And this Friday,</i>
<i>an HBO original documentary.</i>

824

<i>Right here in Lowell, Mass,</i>
<i>the story of Dick Eklund,</i>

825
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,565
<i>a once-promising boxer</i>
<i>who turned criminal...</i>

826
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,880
Oh, look who it is.

827
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,926
That's him.
That's Dicky's brother.

828
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,324
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

829
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,330
Hey.

830
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,761
- Hey, what's up, Mick?
- Look who's here.

831
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,073
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

832
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,337
How you feeling? How's the hand?

833
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,845
- It's gettin' there.
- Looks better.

834
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:49,645
Why don't you come down to the gym?
And work out. If you want.

835
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,983
- Hey, you fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

836
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,182
Been roofin' with my father,
spending time with Kasie.

837
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,190
Now I gotta worry about
this movie on HBO tonight.

838
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,817
What are yous looking at?

839
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:02,791
Movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

840
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,661
I gotta go.

841
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,463
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick!

842
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,630
Don't go watch
that crazy shit on TV, don't!

843
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,908
Hollywood!

844
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,247
Get a look! Get a look, all right!

845
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,954
Going to Hollywood!
Going to Hollywood, yeah!

846
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,559
All right!

847
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,463
All right, get this started!

848
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,747
<i>Lowell was the birthplace of</i>
<i>the Industrial Revolution in America.</i>

849
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:03,518
Industrial Revolution... Lowell.

850
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,853
<i>I used to live over there.</i>
<i>This town got good memories, right?</i>

851
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,965
<i>- Check it out.</i>
<i>- Fuck, yeah.</i>

852
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,830
<i>- This house here, this white house?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

853
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,529
<i>White, big fat guy.</i>
<i>First time I got my crack, over here.</i>

854
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,799
<i>Did you ever know that?</i>
<i>They smoke crack at the White House?</i>

855
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,266
<i>White, black, Puerto Rican, everything.</i>

856
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,936
<i>The first time I did crack, or whatever,</i>
<i>I was about 23</i>

857
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,809
<i>and a friend of mine gave me</i>
<i>a gram, or whatever.</i>

858
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,917
<i>Fuck, I wish that'd never happened.</i>

859
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,543
<i>Before that, I'd been doing</i>
<i>the Silver Mittens and stuff.</i>

860
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:35,249
<i>I was the only kid.</i>
<i>I'd be 12... I was shit-faced.</i>

861
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,950
<i>I'll tell ya how crack works.</i>

862
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:43,122
<i>When it enters your lungs...</i>
<i>When it enters your lungs...</i>

863
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:46,997
- I wanna watch, Daddy.
- Oh, my God. No, sweetie.

864
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,300
- You go back upstairs.
- But I wanna watch Daddy on TV.

865
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,500
I know, baby. You can't watch
Daddy right now, all right?

866
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,168
You go back upstairs
and go to bed, OK?

867
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,439
<i>OK, yeah, there's my boys</i>
<i>right there. Check 'em out.</i>

868
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,142
<i>- What kind of snake's that? Python?</i>
<i>- Yeah, check it out, man.</i>

869
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,583
<i>- It's not gonna bite me or something?</i>
<i>- He's cool.</i>

870
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,723
<i>It's been a while.</i>
<i>I'll take anything right now.</i>

871
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,959
I never thought
I'd kiss a fuckin' snake.

872
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,461
I always dreamed about it...

873
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,234
Do a lot of shit
when you're high, right?

874
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,305
<i>Dicky... put Lowell on the map.</i>

875
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,001
<i>He knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down.</i>

876
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:31,978
<i>Yeah, he knocked him down,</i>
<i>but I don't think it was a knockdown.</i>

877
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,811
<i>- I think he slipped.</i>
<i>- He knocked him down.</i>

878
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,317
<i>- He didn't slip.</i>
<i>- He slipped.</i>

879
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,718
<i>- Oh... and you're from Lowell.</i>
<i>- Yeah, come on.</i>

880
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:43,314
- That's a fuckin' lie!
<i>- They said he's in trouble with drugs.</i>

881
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,224
<i>What is this? Are you talking</i>
<i>shit about the family?</i>

882
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:49,559
<i>- Oh, no, no, no...</i>
<i>- I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."</i>

883
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,758
<i>We're not like that.</i>
<i>This is not what Lowell is all about.</i>

884
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,300
<i>I thought he could make a comeback</i>

885
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,269
<i>- and make us proud, but he didn't.</i>
<i>- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.</i>

886
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,533
<i>Very disappointing,</i>
<i>very disgusting.</i>

887
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,906
<i>You brought the city of</i>
<i>Lowell back 30 years. We're not happy.</i>

888
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,842
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Jimmy?

889
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,608
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

890
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,343
Actually, we're watching it right now,
Mick, but don't worry about it.

891
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,181
I got it...

892
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,449
I want her to see it.
Let her see who her uncle is.

893
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:15,990
- What?
- <i>Who you are.</i>

894
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,252
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

895
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:21,659
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- <i>Laurie, turn it off, please.</i>

896
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,198
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it.

897
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,733
She's a kid.

898
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,796
<i>When you smoke crack, you know...</i>

899
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,134
<i>... you feel so much lighter.</i>

900
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,506
<i>You know, you feel young, like when</i>
<i>everything was in front of you,</i>

901
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,977
<i>everything was just...</i>

902
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,181
<i>... everything was... just...</i>

903
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,183
<i>... it was in front of you, you know?</i>

904
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,988
<i>And then...</i>

905
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,786
<i>... it fades and you</i>
<i>gotta get high again.</i>

906
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,796
<i>Your part in the movie</i>
<i>is gonna end with you going to jail.</i>

907
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:05,701
<i>What about little Dicky?</i>
<i>Who's gonna take care of him, huh?</i>

908
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:11,446
<i>You guys can't talk to 'em?</i>

909
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,549
<i>Oh, man...</i>

910
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,244
Turn this shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

911
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,378
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?

912
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,013
If you don't...
I'm turning it fuckin' off.

913
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:26,990
Hey, hey, that is my life.

914
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,722
- My movie night!
- That's my fuckin' life out there.

915
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,732
- I wanna watch this. I don't care.
- I will fuck you up!

916
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,462
You fuckin' want some?
Don't fuckin' try me.

917
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:37,198
I still fuckin' got it, OK?

918
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,103
You fuckin' want some?!

919
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,904
That's my son there,
and you're laughin' at him?!

920
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:48,347
That's my son. He's crying. He needs me.
And I'm fuckin' stuck in here?

921
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:51,510
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>Dicky was a street kid.</i>

922
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:55,852
Micky, you watching this?
What are they doing to us?

923
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,927
Ma, I don't know what to tell you.

924
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,998
You're pretending like you
don't know what's going on.

925
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,066
He's been doing this for years.

926
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,328
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Ma, but...

927
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,368
- What do you think?
- <i>You think they set him up?</i>

928
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,605
What do you think he was doing?

929
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:22,149
<i>You know, gave him money,</i>
<i>gave him drugs for the movie. Right?</i>

930
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:29,117
<i>Micky... Micky?</i>

931
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,687
<i>Shit. Micky...</i>

932
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,656
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

933
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,029
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

934
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:54,864
- What happened to the peanut?
- I don't know.

935
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,330
It's like a beach ball.

936
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,524
- Mick. Sal Lonano.
- Hey, Mick, how you doing?

937
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:30,222
You own a cab company,
you're a good businessman, right?

938
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,301
- Yeah, he's very organized.
- How's the hand?

939
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:36,462
It's good. You know,
it's getting better. Stronger.

940
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:40,372
Yeah, you know, I made a few calls
already. I talked to Buddy Tags.

941
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:44,240
Said he can set up something local,
something to start back with.

942
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,314
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it.

943
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,314
You gotta get your confidence back.
That's all.

944
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:55,019
Your dad wants Sal to manage ya,
and he wants me to train ya.

945
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,625
But I'll only do it on one condition.

946
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:03,690
- No crazy-time nonsense.
- It's how it's gotta be.

947
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,098
- No Dicky. No Alice.
- No Dicky. No Alice.

948
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,898
I get it, I get it.
I'm good, I understand.

949
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,337
- Look, I appreciate the opportunity.
- I can't take the bullshit, Mick.

950
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:15,342
- No offense, Georgie.
- None taken.

951
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,743
I'm gonna be the one who gets
his balls cut off, anyway.

952
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,510
- Yeah. You laugh.
- <i>You...</i>

953
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,849
...fuckin' traitor!
- What are you doing?

954
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:30,926
What the hell's the matter with you?!
Come on! The pans hurt!

955
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,391
Do they hurt?! I hope it hurts!

956
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,860
- Sal Lonano is a good man!
- A good man?!

957
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,261
He's a legitimate businessman,
for Chrissakes!

958
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,527
- Legitimate businessman?
- Yes. What?

959
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,296
Oh, my God,
you know what that sounds like?

960
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:44,099
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxi cab company!

961
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,606
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God. He's a cab driver.

962
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,209
He knows everything
about boxing, right?

963
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:52,508
I don't think so! He's gonna steal
your son's money and rob him blind!

964
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,173
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

965
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,878
- Why can't you trust anybody with...?
- I know people.

966
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,648
I know, George, you think I don't
know anything, but I know people.

967
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,758
- I know you know people.
- And that Sal Lonano

968
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:06,555
banana fucking thing,
we don't need that in our lives!

969
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,561
We haven't made one dollar
with these kids!

970
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:11,292
- You betrayed me!
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

971
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,595
- You always react the same way.
- He's a fuckin' crook!

972
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:16,432
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail!

973
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:19,370
We're not talking about his trainer,
sweetheart!

974
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,671
We're talking about his manager,
that's me!

975
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,007
But, Mom, maybe Micky
should try something different!

976
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,138
What are you doing opening
your mouth in my kitchen?

977
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:31,083
- You owe me $200.
- I said I was gonna pay you next week.

978
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,881
I don't want
another word outta you.

979
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,614
That was last month
you told me two weeks.

980
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:38,022
You take sides against me in
my own house, you owe me money?

981
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,787
And Ma's been great
to Micky, Sherri.

982
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,898
Really, I mean, who's gonna look out
for Micky better than his own mother?

983
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:45,830
It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.
We gotta get rid of her.

984
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:48,903
Ma, we gotta get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She gotta go.

985
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:50,437
<i>You're gonna get Charlene involved?</i>

986
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:54,134
<i>- Is that what you're telling me?</i>
<i>- I know where she lives.</i>

987
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,743
<i>What are you pickin' on her for?</i>

988
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,779
<i>She lives in that</i>
<i>yellow house on Stevens Street.</i>

989
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:01,405
<i>I'm gonna go talk to Micky,</i>
<i>sort this out for myself.</i>

990
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:06,647
<i>Yeah, sure. You go handle it</i>
<i>with your vigilantes. All of yous now.</i>

991
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:07,881
<i>This is wrong, Alice!</i>

992
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,762
I got it!

993
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:18,696
Get outta my way! Get in the car!

994
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,200
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

995
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,802
Get in the car.

996
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,429
- Yeah, they're in there!
- Up there on the second floor.

997
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,055
Micky!

998
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:55,767
Where the hell are you?
You up there? Come on down!

999
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,429
Where are you?

1000
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,443
Holy shit, Micky, your mother
and your sisters are here.

1001
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,603
No, don't.
Do not go out there. Please.

1002
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,342
No, I'm not hiding from
your crazy fuckin' family.

1003
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,123
Hi.

1004
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,992
Well, well, well.
Look at this.

1005
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,258
Look at what?

1006
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:28,465
- Why you hiding from us, Micky?
- He's not hiding.

1007
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,129
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

1008
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,706
What are you doing, Mickster?

1009
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,242
I'm right here.
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

1010
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:39,040
You're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend Lonano.

1011
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,581
What are you gonna do,
turn your back on Dicky next?

1012
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,981
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

1013
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,682
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

1014
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,224
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank.

1015
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,955
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that nasty
hair right out of your fuckin' head.

1016
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:57,497
I'm his mother. And his manager.

1017
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,931
You're not my manager anymore.
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, OK?

1018
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,866
I'm not gettin' any younger.

1019
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,938
Who's gonna look after you, sweetheart?

1020
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:07,565
I mean, come on. I know you don't
understand it, but I had nine kids

1021
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,111
- and I love every one of you the same.
- You got a funny way of showing it,

1022
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,112
letting him get beat up,
letting him get his hand broken.

1023
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:16,013
- You're crazy.
- You fuckin' bar skank!

1024
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,677
- What did I just say to you?
- Don't put your hands on her...

1025
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,927
- Get off of me!
- Stop it!

1026
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,362
Let her go!
Let her go!

1027
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,461
- Fuck you, Charlene!
- Fuck you!

1028
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:38,437
- Get the fuck outta here! Now!
- Fuck you, Charlene!

1029
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:40,474
- Skank!
- Micky...

1030
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,246
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Oh, my God! Gail!

1031
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,475
What'd she do to your nose?

1032
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,320
What is happenin'
What is happenin' to everybody?

1033
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,758
I don't understand, sweetheart.

1034
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:49,709
Why... Why do you think
I spell my name with an E?

1035
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,312
'Cause I don't.

1036
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:53,745
- No-E Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push the button.

1037
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:58,111
- Where we going? What's with the ring?
- Ring's across the street.

1038
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,279
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

1039
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,982
Yeah, smaller venue.
They got no dressin' rooms over there.

1040
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:07,118
- Yeah, but...
- Micky, It's just a start. Don't worry.

1041
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:12,558
Hey. Good luck.

1042
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,845
That's it!

1043
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,843
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1044
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,234
<i>Visit for Dick Eklund.</i>

1045
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,604
Dicky!

1046
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,110
Eklund, you got a visitor!

1047
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:09,410
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

1048
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,451
I know you know what I been doing.

1049
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:14,317
I'm sure Alice
and everybody else told you.

1050
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,084
I just wanted to tell you
to your face myself.

1051
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,662
I got new management.
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

1052
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,787
It's all good.

1053
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:26,230
Yeah. They got you fightin'
Alfonso Sanchez.

1054
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:27,960
- On HBO.
- And you're proud of that?

1055
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:32,062
- Fuckin' right.
- HBO is invested in the Mexican.

1056
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,141
I didn't think they were gonna be
invested in me?

1057
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,642
- I got a shot. I'm gonna take it.
- Wake up.

1058
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,873
They don't care if he kills you.

1059
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:44,543
Mike Toma did it. He's using you,
like a stepping-stone for Sanchez.

1060
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:49,386
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

1061
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:53,052
How could I stand a chance without the
great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

1062
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:55,493
You didn't give a fuck
if I got killed by Mungin.

1063
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:59,362
Now all of a sudden you're worried
Sanchez is gonna hurt me? Why?

1064
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,470
'Cause you're stuck in here and can't
be the center of attention no more?

1065
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,401
- You need it that bad?
- I've seen this Mexican fight.

1066
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,338
He fights, hits,
like a fuckin' mule, all right?

1067
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:09,774
Fifteen knockouts, undefeated.
You crazy?

1068
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:12,403
And that taxi cab idiot,
Lonano, he went right for it.

1069
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:15,176
He's a paper gangster,
he's using you to steal money.

1070
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:18,684
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

1071
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:22,086
I spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

1072
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:23,953
I finally got a good thing going for me

1073
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,822
and you can't be fuckin'
happy for me? Why?

1074
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:30,093
What's your plan?
How you gonna fight Sanchez?

1075
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:33,827
- I ain't here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1076
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,529
- I am not here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1077
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,663
Yes, you are.

1078
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,866
You watch the fight
and you'll see the plan.

1079
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:44,240
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fuckin' violent. I mean...

1080
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:45,812
Two minutes, Dicky.

1081
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:48,314
They'll let us watch a stupid
documentary about crack,

1082
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:52,216
but I can't watch my own
brother fighting, you know?

1083
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:56,154
Hey... Mick, what is it?

1084
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,623
You scared? You embarrassed
because you don't even have a plan?

1085
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,785
I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1086
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,556
Are you gonna shit on it
no matter what I say?

1087
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,563
I'm not gonna shit on it. Just tell me.

1088
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,796
Go toe-to-toe.
Overhand right in the middle rounds.

1089
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,031
He's weak against the overhand right.

1090
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,574
Who came up with that?
Fatty fuck O'Keefe?

1091
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:16,735
Fuck you, Dicky.

1092
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:20,041
You gotta run against this guy.
Let him punch himself out.

1093
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,241
Take him to the body, right? Get inside.

1094
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:25,148
Switch stances like you're gonna
work his right, hit him on the left.

1095
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,221
You ain't me. All right?
You can't be me.

1096
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,983
- Careful. Switch outside...
- You had a hard enough time

1097
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:30,819
being you when you had
your fuckin' chance,

1098
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,417
and that's why you're in here.
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1099
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:37,123
I'm talking about the way
you fight, you moron!

1100
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,367
Yeah, you know I'm right!
He knows I'm right. All right.

1101
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,273
He knows I'm right.

1102
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:55,249
<i>Ward's record: 29 wins,</i>
<i>seven losses so far, 20 KOs.</i>

1103
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,717
<i>He's been a little better since</i>
<i>he refocused himself on the sport,</i>

1104
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,378
<i>as JB pointed out.</i>

1105
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:10,422
Now, here's Ward's opponent,
Alfonso Sanchez, out of Tijuana, Mexico.

1106
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:15,697
<i>You see the record: 16 wins,</i>
<i>15 KOs, eight first-round KOs.</i>

1107
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,600
<i>There's Mike Toma,</i>
<i>the promoter of the fight,</i>

1108
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,366
<i>who has a lot invested in Sanchez.</i>

1109
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,135
And he says that Sanchez is

1110
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:25,576
one of the most talented young
prospects in the sport of boxing.

1111
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:39,784
This is really one of
the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

1112
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,624
- Get out of the corner!
- Micky Ward is 31 years old,

1113
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:45,790
he's here because he needs the money,
he's taking a beating...

1114
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,198
And my point is
that he doesn't really have to sit here

1115
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,999
and take this beating.
He can do something about it.

1116
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,232
Which is what?
Have his corner throw in the towel?

1117
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,400
- Or fight back.
- Get back.

1118
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:58,768
You can see his power.

1119
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,973
Every time he hits Ward,
he backs him up.

1120
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,050
How about taking points away from him?

1121
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,019
<i>Larry, unless</i>
<i>the referee does, you can't.</i>

1122
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:07,678
<i>The referee should just go</i>
<i>ahead and stop this fight.</i>

1123
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:11,350
<i>He knows that Micky doesn't want</i>
<i>to be here. I wouldn't even make...</i>

1124
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,586
He's fightin' scared, Dick.

1125
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:15,822
Runnin' away, not hittin' back.

1126
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,593
<i>Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.</i>

1127
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,726
<i>Doing that same old shit.</i>

1128
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,202
<i>They never seen such</i>
<i>an embarrassing performance.</i>

1129
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:26,432
He's doing what I told him, Ma.
He's doing what I told him.

1130
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,270
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1131
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,277
Micky Ward, showing nothing
but respect.

1132
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,005
What are you runnin' around for?
Stop running around!

1133
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,208
Shut the fuck up, Sal!
Shut the fuck up!

1134
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,717
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
Want to fuckin' tell me?

1135
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,082
'Cause I don't know what you're doing.

1136
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,747
We have lost all five rounds,
is that what you want?

1137
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:45,223
Dreadful.
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1138
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,988
You gotta show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.

1139
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,256
Now they're gonna stop the fight, Micky.

1140
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,332
He's gotta go inside, Ma.

1141
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,627
He's gotta take it to the body.
He's gotta.

1142
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:54,997
Come on, get your punches up...

1143
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,367
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're gonna stop this fight.

1144
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,701
Then you gotta do something, baby.

1145
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,502
That's not what we talked about, Micky.

1146
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:04,703
We had a plan and you're
not doing it. Now, let's go.

1147
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,904
All right, Micky.

1148
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:09,984
You've lost the first five rounds.
What's the next strategy gonna be?

1149
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:13,884
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1150
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:17,014
A couple of the left hooks landed
flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1151
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,457
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1152
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,425
Very curious performance
by Micky Ward.

1153
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:22,894
Come on, Micky, come on!

1154
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:25,864
Ward seems...
trying to land one big shot

1155
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,265
to change Sanchez's mind...

1156
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,098
And he's beginning to open up.

1157
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:32,798
Taking advantage of more and more
opportunities to get close to Ward

1158
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:34,408
and throw against a fighter...

1159
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,567
Time!

1160
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,043
...who's not defending himself
by punching.

1161
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:41,146
Sanchez is gonna try
to end this fight.

1162
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,588
- What are you doing? Come on!
- That's it.

1163
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,990
Good boy!

1164
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:54,623
He's down on an uppercut!

1165
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:02,326
- Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.
...three, four, five...

1166
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:05,736
And right after Ward threw
a pretty good right hand.

1167
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:08,843
Mick, you all right?
Come to me. Come to me.

1168
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:10,877
This is a fight
that should be stopped.

1169
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,771
Come on, head, body, head.

1170
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,108
This is not professional.

1171
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,016
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1172
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:23,181
- Punch him! You gotta punch!
- Someone should pay me to watch this.

1173
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:26,317
Come on, man! Head, body, head!

1174
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,360
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1175
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,989
That was good.
Maybe it'll turn him around.

1176
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:34,295
Maybe. I'm talking about if I...

1177
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:38,538
Sanchez drops
like he's shot! Oh, my God!

1178
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:42,769
The most unlikely
knockout you have ever seen.

1179
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:45,812
That was a kidney shot,
the kind of kidney shot...

1180
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,847
...nine, ten!

1181
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,750
I still don't believe
what I just saw.

1182
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,886
Oh, Micky won!

1183
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,829
Now, did Micky Ward
just make idiots of us all

1184
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,992
with a spectacular piece of strategy?
Take another look. Amazing.

1185
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,764
<i>A brilliant win in the career</i>
<i>of Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.</i>

1186
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:14,205
<i>Unbelievable defeat</i>
<i>at the hands of Micky Ward,</i>

1187
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:18,779
<i>who had all but given away the first</i>
<i>half-dozen rounds of the bout.</i>

1188
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:21,041
I think what Micky did was he recognized

1189
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:22,980
that he'd hurt the guy
with the body shot.

1190
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:25,916
Micky's a better fighter than that to
not be runnin' from that guy like that.

1191
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:28,045
Theater of the unexpected.

1192
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,556
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1193
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,159
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

1194
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,753
You can't make it up, folks.

1195
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:36,386
You hear what he said?

1196
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,226
He said, " You can't give up
in this game."

1197
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:41,301
Well, maybe Micky Ward
heard me say you should stop this fight

1198
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,165
and he went out and stopped it.

1199
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,501
- Right there. Right there.
- Yeah! I can't believe it.

1200
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:49,508
I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'
to myself like they were thinkin'

1201
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:50,872
This thing is over.

1202
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,946
But I tell you what, if you
looked at the commentators,

1203
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:55,709
they started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

1204
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,216
They just wanted to get out of there.

1205
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,048
Mick, Mick.
I just spoke to Mike Toma.

1206
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,554
- He told me something very interesting.
- Holy shit, what?

1207
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,056
He just told me,

1208
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,752
had Sanchez won tonight,
he would've gotten the title shot.

1209
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,989
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1210
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:14,727
- A title shot. Mick gets the shot.
- Micky gets the shot!

1211
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,271
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you sure about that?

1212
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,637
I just spoke to the guy. Mike!
Come here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.

1213
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,573
- Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1214
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,806
You're not a stepping stone anymore.
I always knew you had the talent.

1215
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:29,781
That was a hell of a strategy, wearing
him down and taking it to the body.

1216
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,887
Thirty years in the business,
I'd never seen a knockout like that.

1217
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,511
Larry Merchant was writing
your obituary,

1218
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:35,953
and Sanchez drops
like he's shot with a gun.

1219
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:37,854
Where'd you get that?

1220
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:39,358
That's the first thing
my brother taught me.

1221
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:40,927
Tap 'em to the head,
ding 'em to the body.

1222
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,087
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1223
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,291
- You ready for a title shot?
- I ain't gettin' no younger.

1224
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,267
Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.

1225
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,304
He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?

1226
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,902
Shea Neary in London
for the title.

1227
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:56,977
Are you kidding,
we got some celebrating to do.

1228
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,511
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

1229
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:01,138
- Gonna have a great champ in my boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Toma.

1230
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:05,709
It's what your brother
would've always wanted.

1231
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,583
He's not even gonna be there.

1232
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:36,708
- Hey!
- Daddy!

1233
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,876
- Come here, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1234
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,149
Good to see you!

1235
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:47,857
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Yeah!

1236
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:50,328
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Ma.

1237
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:55,027
Oh, you look so good. Oh, my God.

1238
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,275
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1239
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,015
I got new teeth. Everything.

1240
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,480
How you think I look?

1241
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:11,744
- Good.
- Yeah?

1242
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,726
Cake and more cake.

1243
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:29,462
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream and cake.

1244
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,198
Ice cream and cake and cake. Right?

1245
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,503
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake...

1246
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,201
Quacka!

1247
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:43,874
Ma.

1248
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:59,857
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

1249
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,604
Hey, Georgie. What, they let
you outta the house now?

1250
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:09,266
- Yeah.
- Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?

1251
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,436
Hey, look, I want you
to meet Sal Lonano.

1252
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:20,254
How you doing, Dicky?

1253
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:23,757
Let's spar.

1254
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:33,433
Hey, Charlene.

1255
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,321
Welcome back!

1256
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:03,124
It's supposed to be a surprise.
You're late.

1257
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:06,462
- Hey.
- Hey.

1258
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:10,093
Mick, I can't even tell you, being in
this smelly-ass locker room. You know?

1259
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,900
Being back with you,
this is what got me through.

1260
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:17,410
- You look good. Your eyes are clear.
- Yeah. You know...

1261
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,343
...Alice says prison might've
been the best thing for me.

1262
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:24,884
Got me clean. Got me clear. Up here.

1263
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,955
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1264
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:33,525
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- Yeah.

1265
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:37,153
Look at this locker.
The old locker.

1266
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,925
I love it. Fuckin' love it.

1267
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,427
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1268
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:58,013
I had to. After everything
that happened, I'm sorry.

1269
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:05,323
You stickin' to that?

1270
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:11,357
I'm glad you're back. You look good.

1271
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,730
I don't know what else to say.

1272
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:24,007
- Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1273
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:31,752
- Oh, hey, Mick.
- Come on, come on!

1274
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:35,982
You gotta... Ma. You gotta
do this at home. Please?

1275
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:37,819
What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter?

1276
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:40,018
Mom, please?

1277
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:42,493
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1278
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,063
I know. We'll see him at home.

1279
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,753
- What the hell...?
- Would you please pack it up?

1280
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,289
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

1281
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,892
If that's what Micky wants,
we're gonna put it away.

1282
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:16,258
- There's your brother.
- Dicky...

1283
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:19,594
- How ya doing?
- Micky?

1284
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:26,763
That's nice. That's nice.

1285
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,375
We've been working on it
for two weeks.

1286
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:30,443
Sherri, come on, stop it.

1287
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:32,045
All right, girls,
come on, let's go home.

1288
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,546
It's not the time to do this,
obviously. Come on.

1289
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:38,948
You stay here.
What the hell's going on?

1290
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,578
- What's going on?
- We ain't gonna work together.

1291
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,387
He don't want me to work with him.

1292
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:46,618
What're you talking about?

1293
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,820
That's not right.

1294
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:52,455
Micky never would've won
Sanchez without Dicky.

1295
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,830
That's fuckin' bullshit! Take it back!

1296
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:57,335
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fuckin'
talk to my mother that way.

1297
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:58,461
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1298
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:00,198
Take 'em home.

1299
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:03,676
Why don't you ask Micky?

1300
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,876
If we're gonna train, they gotta go.

1301
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:08,949
They gotta go, Mick, come on.

1302
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,648
Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've
won Sanchez without his brother?

1303
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,449
Hey, take him outside, all right?

1304
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:19,991
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1305
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,323
How can you say that to O'Keefe?

1306
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,953
Because it's true.

1307
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,562
I went with that game plan,
it wasn't working.

1308
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:28,726
So I went back to what
I learned with Dicky.

1309
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,771
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, OK?

1310
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:35,474
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

1311
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:38,101
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1312
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:41,477
and from Sal and
your father and from me.

1313
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:45,246
- Dicky's a junk bag.
- Hey.

1314
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:46,546
He's a junk bag!

1315
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:48,280
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Fuck you.

1316
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:49,856
- I'm eight months sober.
- Oh, yeah,

1317
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,788
and I'm sure you're gonna need
something now that you're out.

1318
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:53,723
"Oh, my back. Oh, my back."

1319
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:56,193
- Fuck you always picking on me for?
- No, fuck you!

1320
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,094
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1321
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,860
One day at a fucking time, right,
O'Keefe? You know what I mean?

1322
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,401
What, it's all right
for him to be here?

1323
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:04,903
Why am I the fuckin' problem?
I'm his blood, I'm his family!

1324
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,064
- You are the problem!
- I'm the one fighting, OK?

1325
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:09,676
Not you, not you, and not you.

1326
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:13,046
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

1327
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,705
I want Dicky back.

1328
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,215
And I want you, Charlene.
And I want O'Keefe.

1329
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,753
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1330
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:24,648
It's not the deal we made, baby.

1331
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:26,282
She's right, Micky.
That's not the deal.

1332
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:30,386
It wasn't the deal.
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1333
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,192
- You sound like them now.
- I sound like them now?

1334
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:33,960
- Yeah, you sound like them.
- You sound like them.

1335
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:35,569
How could I do this to you?
"You can't do that to us.

1336
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:39,332
He can't do that to us."
You sound like them.

1337
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:41,101
You should fuckin' listen to yourself.

1338
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:43,802
You sound like them and maybe
this is where you belong.

1339
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:45,412
That's the way you love him?

1340
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,571
- Charlene!
- Come on!

1341
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,980
- You wanted your brother? Good luck.
- O'Keefe, come on.

1342
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,815
- Mickey.
- Mickey.

1343
01:29:56,924 --> 01:29:59,415
Come on, everything
happens for a reason.

1344
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:05,426
You know? Maybe it's for the best.
God has a plan.

1345
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:09,666
Wanna spar with your brother?

1346
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,471
Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!

1347
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,507
Watching that for years, huh?

1348
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:25,577
Micky, Micky!

1349
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,245
Whoa, hey!
What the hell are you doing?

1350
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:29,651
Micky!

1351
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,691
- Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
- For crying out loud!

1352
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:33,384
Take that baby out of here.

1353
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:35,120
I told you take him away
ten minutes ago!

1354
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,396
Sweetheart, you all right?
You OK? Your back?

1355
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:42,833
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1356
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:46,701
Can this be my fight, Alice?
Just once?

1357
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:50,402
Maybe just this one time
not for Dicky?

1358
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:52,604
I know you think he's coming back.

1359
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:54,647
He's 40 years old and doesn't
have a tooth in his head

1360
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,478
- that's his fuckin' own.
- I'll go fuckin' ten rounds.

1361
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,745
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1362
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:01,684
- What are you sayin' sweetheart?
- I'm Shea Neary...

1363
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:04,883
Shut up before I bust your
fuckin' head open, Dicky.

1364
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,961
- Hey, hey...
- What're you gonna do? I'm Shea Neary.

1365
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,460
You want me to bust
your fuckin' head open?

1366
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:10,996
Come on, come on! George, please!

1367
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,259
- Dicky!
- Please! What are you saying?

1368
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:16,859
- Tell me what you're saying.
- This is supposed to be my fight.

1369
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:19,564
This is my shot at a title.
I won't get another one after this.

1370
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:21,197
- Am I being selfish?
- No.

1371
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:24,140
Am I saying, "Micky, Micky, Micky?"
You know what? If I am, I'm sorry.

1372
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:25,745
I thought I was fightin'
for the championship.

1373
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,905
And I thought you
were my mother, too.

1374
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,275
I am your mother.

1375
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,711
Yeah, Ma.

1376
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:40,254
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

1377
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,555
If I made mistakes,
I'm gonna be better.

1378
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:48,100
I don't wanna hurt you.
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

1379
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:55,205
Dicky!

1380
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,708
Stay with him.

1381
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:01,444
Dicky... Dicky!

1382
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:08,979
- Dicky!
- Gotta do something.

1383
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:11,648
Dicky, wait, come on!

1384
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:15,922
- Micky wants you! I want you!
- I gotta do something.

1385
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:18,327
I know what that means.
Don't do this!

1386
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:48,353
Hey, Chan.

1387
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,558
- What's going on?
- Hey, Dicky.

1388
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:58,938
Hey, Dicky's back!

1389
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,665
Hey!

1390
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:03,940
Look at you!

1391
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:07,206
What's up, my boy?
How you doing? Good to see you, man.

1392
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:10,875
- You look good. Welcome back.
- Yeah, you're looking good.

1393
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:12,679
- Great.
- Good to see ya.

1394
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:15,345
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

1395
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:19,490
What's up, man?
You're looking good.

1396
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:21,959
- Wanna head upstairs?
- Dicky's back.

1397
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,462
- Hi, Dicky. We're gonna party.
- Go upstairs, man?

1398
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,303
- Go upstairs, take a while?
- We missed you!

1399
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,670
- Let's go, buddy.
- Come on, Dicky.

1400
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:42,138
- Make for a little party for you...
- Hey, come back.

1401
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:45,418
- What the fuck's that all about?
- What the hell was that?

1402
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:04,031
Charlene? It's Dicky.

1403
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:08,036
<i>Get off my porch,</i>
<i>you piece of shit.</i>

1404
01:34:10,411 --> 01:34:12,038
<i>How fuckin' dare you...</i>

1405
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,675
<i>... cocksucker...</i>

1406
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,609
<i>... fuckin'...</i>

1407
01:34:20,054 --> 01:34:21,385
You're a fuckin' asshole, Dicky.

1408
01:34:21,522 --> 01:34:23,422
I want you off my fuckin' porch!

1409
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:26,617
Why don't you just fuckin'
come down here and talk to me?

1410
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:29,093
Such an asshole, coming to my
fucking house. You piece of shit!

1411
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,788
- Standing on my porch...
- Charlene...

1412
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:34,560
It's not fuckin' lady-like to be
shoutin' in the street like this.

1413
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:36,431
You're such a fuckin' cocksucker
coming over here.

1414
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,401
- Please?
- Oh, yeah, you think I fuckin' care?

1415
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:41,770
- Come on, just fuckin'...
- Get off my fuckin' porch, Dicky!

1416
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:45,811
Would you just fuckin'
come down here... and talk to me?

1417
01:34:55,389 --> 01:34:58,119
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a Cocker Spaniel?

1418
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:05,459
All right, I know you
can't fuckin' stand me.

1419
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:06,759
Really, what makes you say that?

1420
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:10,393
I ain't got no use for you, either.
All right? But my brother loves ya.

1421
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,699
And you can't just
run away because of me.

1422
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,808
He don't deserve that. All right?

1423
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:17,433
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1424
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:20,411
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

1425
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,516
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

1426
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:24,277
But I want you to think about something.

1427
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:27,444
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did.

1428
01:35:27,588 --> 01:35:29,146
That in my time, I never had.

1429
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:32,350
"Oh, yeah, my big chance
was with Sugar Ray Leonard.

1430
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:34,427
I'm so great.
I'm the pride of fuckin' Lowell.

1431
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:36,553
Oh, yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."
I've heard it.

1432
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:37,925
I came here to make things right.

1433
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:39,464
- OK, let's make things right.
- Yeah.

1434
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,866
Number one: You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1435
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:48,134
I was in the ring. Don't you think
I know what really happened that day?

1436
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:51,608
All right? What have you
ever done with your life?

1437
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,771
- I like my life.
- Yeah, what you ever done with it?

1438
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:56,644
- I like my life now, Dicky.
- What have you done with your life?

1439
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:58,183
You're a college dropout, Charlene.

1440
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:01,117
You're just a little bar girl.
Your life sucks.

1441
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,650
All right. I drank too much.

1442
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:07,852
I worked in a lot of bars.

1443
01:36:07,995 --> 01:36:10,987
And I ruined a lot of opportunities, but
I'm trying to do something better here.

1444
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:13,498
- And so is Micky.
- And so am I.

1445
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:20,137
And he needs me. You heard him.
And I know he needs you.

1446
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:25,337
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1447
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:28,174
It's icing.

1448
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:35,719
OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1449
01:36:35,856 --> 01:36:37,790
- It's a deal.
- All right? It's a deal.

1450
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:52,601
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1451
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:57,836
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1452
01:36:58,879 --> 01:37:00,642
I will.

1453
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,978
Hey, Mick...

1454
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,848
You think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

1455
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,759
Went ten rounds. One of the best
ever and he couldn't hurt you.

1456
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:18,831
You were my hero.

1457
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:21,263
I was.

1458
01:37:22,803 --> 01:37:24,327
I was.

1459
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,535
I'm sorry.

1460
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,237
You are?

1461
01:38:51,158 --> 01:38:53,251
There's a press conference downstairs.

1462
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:55,686
Come on, let's go.

1463
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:57,322
Spot of tea, mate!

1464
01:38:57,464 --> 01:39:01,594
Neary: Ten stone... six pound.

1465
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:12,303
Ward: Ten stone... six pound.

1466
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:16,211
Hey, Micky, Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

1467
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:21,421
- How you been training?
- I train, I train hard.

1468
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:23,819
Shea's 22 and 0.
He's never been knocked down.

1469
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,290
- That's gonna change tomorrow.
- In fact, we expected

1470
01:39:26,427 --> 01:39:27,655
a much better fighter.

1471
01:39:28,562 --> 01:39:30,462
I'm just grateful to be here
and have the opportunity.

1472
01:39:30,597 --> 01:39:32,064
Thank you guys for the shot.

1473
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:36,295
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?
And who would you like to fight next?

1474
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,870
I plan on moving right
through Micky Ward tomorrow.

1475
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:42,100
Moving on to other great fighters,
like Gatti.

1476
01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:44,506
Yeah, I believe Gatti and I
would make a great match.

1477
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:46,135
Are you scared, Mr. Ward?

1478
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:02,524
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing

1479
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:08,295
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1480
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:13,398
I can't see!

1481
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:18,276
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

1482
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:23,508
<i>Goin' down the only road</i>
<i>I've ever known</i>

1483
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:29,451
<i>Like a drifter</i>
<i>I was born to walk alone</i>

1484
01:40:30,824 --> 01:40:34,351
- Hey, fellas, let's go.
<i>- I made up my mind</i>

1485
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:39,797
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

1486
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:45,604
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

1487
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:50,470
<i>Going down the only road</i>
<i>I've ever known</i>

1488
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:55,708
<i>Like a drifter I was born</i>
<i>to walk alone</i>

1489
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:57,783
Don't listen to 'em, Mick.

1490
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,279
<i>I made up my mind</i>

1491
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:06,988
<i>I ain't wasting no more time...</i>

1492
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:13,228
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts,

1493
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:16,768
entering the ring. It's his
first fight outside the United States.

1494
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:22,900
<i>Micky Ward: 30 wins, seven losses.</i>
<i>He's gotten better recently, 20 KOs.</i>

1495
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:27,805
<i>And now Ward awaits his</i>
<i>opponent, Shea Neary.</i>

1496
01:41:27,948 --> 01:41:32,749
Neary regards himself
as the European Arturo Gatti.

1497
01:41:32,886 --> 01:41:35,514
Meaning that he is a head-on,
high-contact fighter

1498
01:41:35,656 --> 01:41:38,489
who throws 70 punches per round.

1499
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:41,721
Neary's from Liverpool
and should have

1500
01:41:41,862 --> 01:41:43,796
a huge following here tonight.

1501
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:50,226
Accompanied
by <i>Paint the Town Red</i> by The Mahones.

1502
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:53,806
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1503
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:57,570
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated.

1504
01:41:57,711 --> 01:42:01,545
Lives a Spartan existence.
And according to his promoters,

1505
01:42:01,682 --> 01:42:06,085
does nothing but eat,
drink, think, fantasize...

1506
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:08,620
...dream of fighting.

1507
01:42:08,755 --> 01:42:12,418
Shea Neary has had 22
professional fights and won them all.

1508
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:14,550
Seventeen KOs.

1509
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:28,467
Come out when you hear the bell.
Don't piss about. Shake hands.

1510
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:32,636
Both of ya... shake hands!

1511
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:36,613
As close as we just saw
them in the middle of the ring,

1512
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:39,082
- forehead to forehead,
- Did you see that?

1513
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:44,851
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

1514
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,926
Ward is a long ways from home.

1515
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,789
Don't coast in a foreign country.

1516
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:50,658
Well, the big challenge for Ward

1517
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:53,789
is to get off to a faster start
than is customary for him.

1518
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:57,495
Micky Ward, a notoriously
slow starter in big fights,

1519
01:42:57,638 --> 01:43:00,072
Shea Neary, an ultra-fast starter.

1520
01:43:00,207 --> 01:43:02,437
And that's the question
that hovers over round one.

1521
01:43:02,576 --> 01:43:04,100
Will Ward be ready for the fight?

1522
01:43:04,244 --> 01:43:07,680
Already, Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes!

1523
01:43:07,814 --> 01:43:10,942
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1524
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:14,447
Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1525
01:43:14,588 --> 01:43:16,453
And a big uppercut by Neary.

1526
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:18,820
Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1527
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:20,893
- Come on, Micky!
- Keeps Ward off balance,

1528
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:22,393
jabbing here and there.

1529
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:28,595
There's a good left hook
by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.

1530
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:33,638
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

1531
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:35,765
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1532
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:38,434
And a left hook
lands up top from Micky Ward.

1533
01:43:39,613 --> 01:43:41,478
Neary digging his
own right hand to the body.

1534
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:43,583
They trade shots at close range.

1535
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:47,318
Ward, he's trying
to match Neary blow for blow

1536
01:43:47,454 --> 01:43:52,790
and now Neary starts to come on and
take the last 30 seconds of the round...

1537
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:54,120
How about that?

1538
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:55,489
Break!

1539
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:59,597
Tremendous barrage in
the first minute. Just look at this.

1540
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:03,294
- Unbelievable.
- What a great round one!

1541
01:44:03,437 --> 01:44:07,237
Ward is gonna have
to pick up the tempo

1542
01:44:07,374 --> 01:44:09,467
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1543
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:12,704
<i>No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.</i>

1544
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:20,017
Four hard right hands...
Neary has belted in the last minute.

1545
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:23,520
Quicker than Ward,
more assertive than Ward,

1546
01:44:23,657 --> 01:44:25,318
surer of what he wants to do.

1547
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:28,121
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

1548
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:30,162
Ward's gonna have
to step it up a little bit more

1549
01:44:30,297 --> 01:44:31,423
than he is right now.

1550
01:44:31,565 --> 01:44:33,362
Micky Ward's corner
taking a real deep look

1551
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,797
at what's going on now.

1552
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:38,598
And his family at ringside well aware
he's stepping up in class.

1553
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:41,674
Ward has fallen to the pedal.
He's gotta be more aggressive.

1554
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:44,003
He can't just try to wait
until everything is perfect.

1555
01:44:44,144 --> 01:44:47,136
His dominance over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

1556
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:51,650
because his technical plan
was the right one and he's executing it.

1557
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:55,482
Punches like these make it seem...

1558
01:44:56,323 --> 01:44:58,985
...that it's now Neary's fight.

1559
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:02,428
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war

1560
01:45:02,562 --> 01:45:04,996
with this strong of fighter as Neary.

1561
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:10,659
They are trying
to hurt each other with every punch.

1562
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:15,298
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

1563
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:18,707
And Ward wobbled there
by a right cross from Neary!

1564
01:45:18,845 --> 01:45:21,405
Ward hurting now. His legs are gone.

1565
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:25,109
Neary goes to the body
as he tries to finish Micky.

1566
01:45:26,353 --> 01:45:28,412
Vicious body shots from Neary.

1567
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:32,082
And Ward still doesn't
even try to move off the ropes!

1568
01:45:32,225 --> 01:45:34,420
I don't know if he can, Jim.

1569
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:36,620
He's waiting for Neary
to punch himself out.

1570
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:39,493
Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.

1571
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:40,895
That ain't fuckin' it!

1572
01:45:41,034 --> 01:45:44,367
- One... two...
- Come on! That's it!

1573
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:49,197
- That's my boy!
- Forward! Forward! Come on!

1574
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:53,172
Ward is out on his feet.

1575
01:45:53,313 --> 01:45:56,282
Loser! Go back to America!

1576
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:59,817
- This could be it for Micky Ward.
- Dicky, give him the fuckin' stool.

1577
01:45:59,953 --> 01:46:01,978
Charlene, will you get
the fuck outta here.

1578
01:46:02,122 --> 01:46:04,147
He needs to fuckin' sit down!

1579
01:46:04,825 --> 01:46:07,385
His brother's got
Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

1580
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:13,255
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

1581
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,459
It's Micky Ward
against the aggressiveness

1582
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:17,570
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1583
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:22,004
If you don't have your defense up,
you can really get hurt.

1584
01:46:22,142 --> 01:46:24,269
He's making it very
difficult for Micky Ward.

1585
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:27,039
I don't think he's gonna
get into it at this rate.

1586
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:29,375
This is a survival mode...

1587
01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:33,316
Are you like me? Was just
good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1588
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:35,011
Never had to win, did I?

1589
01:46:35,155 --> 01:46:38,318
You gotta do more in there.
You gotta win a title.

1590
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:41,450
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1591
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:44,393
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

1592
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:46,465
I had my time and I blew it.
You don't have to.

1593
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,397
All right?
You fuckin' get out there,

1594
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:50,560
and use all the shit
that you've been through,

1595
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:52,604
all the shit we've gone through
over the fuckin' years

1596
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,765
and you put it in that ring right now.
This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.

1597
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:58,878
OK. Fuckin' head, body, head, body.

1598
01:46:59,012 --> 01:47:00,604
Say it back to me.
Fuckin' say it back to me.

1599
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:02,305
- Head, body, head, body.
- Head, body, head, body.

1600
01:47:02,449 --> 01:47:05,111
Get in your mind this is
fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.

1601
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:07,049
Stay off the fuckin' ropes.

1602
01:47:11,992 --> 01:47:14,187
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1603
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:17,091
I thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

1604
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:19,790
he'll just get totally wiped out.

1605
01:47:21,501 --> 01:47:23,594
Off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

1606
01:47:24,971 --> 01:47:27,701
Once again, Ward against
the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

1607
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:30,435
What are you doing? Come on, Mick!

1608
01:47:31,178 --> 01:47:34,079
Sometimes if you wanna win,
you gotta be something that you're not.

1609
01:47:34,214 --> 01:47:35,841
Come on!

1610
01:47:36,883 --> 01:47:39,147
Off the fuckin' ropes, Mick,
that ain't it!

1611
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,151
Neary continues to pound away.

1612
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:49,393
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time Micky! It's up to you!

1613
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:52,760
- Two big misses by Neary!
- That's it! That's it!

1614
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:56,198
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

1615
01:47:56,336 --> 01:47:58,395
He backs Neary off.

1616
01:47:58,538 --> 01:48:00,335
- Ward trades his way back.
- That's it!

1617
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,942
Ward nods as if to say,
"Come on!"

1618
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:05,068
"Come on, let's fight!"

1619
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:07,009
Just imagine if you bought a ticket.

1620
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:09,445
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1621
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:12,279
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1622
01:48:12,419 --> 01:48:14,387
And a left hook to the body
and an uppercut lands

1623
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:16,853
- and now he backs Neary off.
- Head, body, head fuckin' body!

1624
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:20,588
Ward hurt Neary with a body shot.

1625
01:48:20,727 --> 01:48:23,389
Ward hurts him again
with that left to the body.

1626
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:27,227
Oh, and that one plants
Neary on his butt.

1627
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:29,927
First time in 23 professional fights

1628
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:33,198
- that Shea Neary has been down.
- This is it! This is it!

1629
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,900
This is it, Micky!

1630
01:48:36,042 --> 01:48:39,102
Keep going! Don't look at me for it!
Take it to him!

1631
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:45,984
- Come on, Micky, get in there!
- Ward lands a huge left hook!

1632
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:48,883
As Micky Ward pounds away!

1633
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:52,719
Goes to the body with the left hook!
Lands the uppercut again!

1634
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:54,827
Neary down for the second time.

1635
01:48:54,961 --> 01:48:56,986
Mickey Vann's gonna stop it there.

1636
01:48:57,130 --> 01:49:01,533
"Irish" Micky Ward
with a big eighth-round TKO!

1637
01:49:02,302 --> 01:49:03,564
He's done it again.

1638
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:06,566
He's done it again.

1639
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:11,666
The grinding, gutty Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory!

1640
01:49:24,524 --> 01:49:27,891
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fuckin' champ of the world!

1641
01:49:28,995 --> 01:49:30,690
You fuckin' did it!

1642
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:41,407
Oh, you're the best!

1643
01:49:41,541 --> 01:49:46,137
- Oh, I love you!
- My boy's the champion of the world!

1644
01:49:47,047 --> 01:49:48,537
I love you!

1645
01:50:19,045 --> 01:50:22,412
This town always said,
you're a fuckin' boxer, right?

1646
01:50:22,549 --> 01:50:26,485
He thought he was a piece of shit. He
put Lowell back on the map, you know?

1647
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,882
- We.
- I tell ya...

1648
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:30,285
- We.
- No, but hold on.

1649
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:32,357
Who used to be the pride of Lowell?

1650
01:50:32,492 --> 01:50:34,926
Right here.
Who's the pride of Lowell now?

1651
01:50:35,061 --> 01:50:37,962
Right there.
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

1652
01:50:38,098 --> 01:50:39,929
Handin' it down to him.

1653
01:50:40,066 --> 01:50:43,558
Nothin' better than that.
Nothin' better than that.

1654
01:50:43,703 --> 01:50:47,264
He did it. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

1655
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:19,233
Oh, look at cabbage head. Boo Boo!
Quacka!

1656
01:51:22,142 --> 01:51:24,702
- What's up buddy?
- Boo, where's your teeth?

1657
01:51:24,844 --> 01:51:28,007
Oh, I'm under arrest!
Let's go, move it out!

1658
01:51:30,216 --> 01:51:31,615
It's been real, ain't it?

1659
01:51:31,751 --> 01:51:35,187
It's been real, it's been unreal.
It's been a great experience.

1660
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:37,255
Just glad it's done, finally,

1661
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:40,450
and thanks to everyone so much,
from the bottom of my heart.

1662
01:51:40,593 --> 01:51:42,959
Thanks so much,
all you Hollywood people.

1663
01:51:43,096 --> 01:51:45,997
Now you know what I mean
when I say I can't get a word in.

1664
01:51:46,132 --> 01:51:48,760
I'm telling ya.
He'll never get a word in.

1665
01:51:48,902 --> 01:51:50,494
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

1666
01:51:50,637 --> 01:51:52,605
Peace, everybody.

1667
01:51:53,305 --> 01:52:53,753
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
