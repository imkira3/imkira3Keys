2
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,105
On a rescue mission...
ALL ALONE.

3
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,983
This gringo is not going to talk.

4
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,609
Then kill him.

5
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,696
C'mon, the General's expecting us.

6
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,576
You can't use your gun...

7
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,871
...Shoot
him with his.

8
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,341
It's not working.

9
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,311
This asshole's gun has
no firing pin.

10
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,230
Leave him.

11
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,194
The dogs haven't had to
kill for their food in a while.

12
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,907
Next time, amigo,

13
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,160
plan ahead.

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,999
Oh, I'm such a bad Catholic.

15
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,251
No, you're just sick in the head.

16
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,546
Don't forget the General's money.

17
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,674
That gringo bribed the wrong cop...

18
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:19,597
...and brought a gun
with no firing pin.

19
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,094
Catch me if you can
I'm in 'em old school Barkley's.

20
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,638
Back to the fence
puffin' on that Bob Marley.

21
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,390
Flow like oregano.

22
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,560
You already know my competition's
stiffer than Ronald Regan.

23
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,853
Let it go.

24
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,646
For you be a mother...

25
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,066
You scrap it's too animated
like The Incredibles.

26
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,902
Let this beef go around like the twenty six's

27
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,070
it's young Game of flame

28
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,448
welcome to the House of Pain.

29
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,078
Where's my girl, fool?

30
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,539
She cool, man. She in there.
She's still fine as hell.

31
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,374
So that's it?
Bada-bing, you out of the game?

32
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,001
Done with the whole trade?

33
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,336
-Yeah.
-Well, that's the problem, Bosco.

34
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,712
You either keep doing that,

35
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,589
or you do a 15-year bid
in a Mexican prison

36
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,633
with Cheeto's cousin in there.

37
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,969
Same old shit. You choose
how to flush the toilet, brother.

38
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,763
That's right. Easy way or the hard way.

39
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,829
Come on!

40
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,670
Okay, street soldier. Shit.

41
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,215
But watch yourself, B.A., now,
you gonna lose your oldest friend here.

42
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,057
What's up, girl? You miss me?

43
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,395
Because I missed you. Yes, I did.
It's been too long, baby.

44
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,313
Way too long.

45
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,988
Heck of a place.

46
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,907
Just a heck of a beautiful place.

47
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,743
Is this a time-share?
I'd love to get in on this.

48
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,038
I like this whole Santa Fe motif
you got going here, Tuco.

49
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,583
It's very Arizona, very Tex-Mex.
It's good. it's good.

50
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,127
Maybe we can get the guy at my six

51
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,462
to whip up a couple of quesadiches,
you know?

52
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,761
I want the flames to be seen
by the Martians.

53
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,348
Americano, gringo.

54
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,809
-Army intelligence.
-Who's that?

55
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,352
-You, man.
-No.

56
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,730
You're not so intelligent
because you're stuck in some tires.

57
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,273
I'm happy. I'm happy.

58
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,109
Doesn't get any better than this, right?

59
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,777
-I'm living the dream.
-You are!

60
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,406
You're gonna come here...

61
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,577
...to throw me in a bag across the border...

62
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,787
...but instead you have sex with my wife.

63
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,748
Well, first of all, she's so hot,

64
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,876
and we both hate you.
So that's just sort of how it...

65
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,130
Good morning!
Good morning, man!

66
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,923
Now it's a party!

67
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,427
-Is that your best shot?
-Now it's a party, man!

68
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,118
A-ha, okay, what's up?
Shut up.

69
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,837
Whoa!

70
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,258
Okay, what's up? Shut up

71
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,347
I got a pocket full of B's
Cocoa weed and ain't got no place to go...

72
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,517
Oh, hell, no.

73
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,644
Slide over slowly.

74
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,604
You jacking me?

75
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,731
What is this, opposite day?

76
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,860
I'm not a thief. But if I don't reach
my friend in time, then he dies.

77
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,656
If you ain't a thief,
I guarantee you ain't a killer.

78
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,869
Take your left hand off the wheel
and your right hand off the shifter now.

79
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,372
You ain't gonna
shoot me in the head, pops.

80
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,083
You know that ain't happening.

81
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,045
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

82
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,505
You shoot a total stranger?

83
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,507
I don't even know you, fool. Damn.

84
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,300
It'll heal, I promise.

85
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,469
-Here, wrap it in this.
-I know how to make a tourniquet, fool.

86
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,179
I know it hurts,
but I had to make a point with you.

87
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,722
That ain't what's pissing me off.

88
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,683
You shooting my van
is what's pissing me off, man.

89
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,351
What's wrong with you?

90
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,190
You Army Ranger, son?

91
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,861
Be real careful
of what you say next, pops.

92
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,655
And be ready to empty that burner
if you start shit-talking my battalion.

93
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,576
Never shall I fail my comrades.

94
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,955
Gallantly will I show the world
that I am a specially selected soldier.

95
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,959
Energetically will I meet
the enemies of my country.

96
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,380
I shall defeat them on the field of battle

97
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,923
for I am better trained.

98
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:32,386
And I will fight with all my might.

99
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,229
Colonel Hannibal Smith.
75th Ranger Regiment.

100
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,024
4th Battalion. Fort Benning, Georgia.

101
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,485
I know who you are, sir.
Corporal B.A. Baracus.

102
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,864
I mean, it was till I was dishonorably
discharged for some bullshit.

103
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,203
I don't subscribe to coincidence, Corporal.

104
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,206
I believe that, no matter how random
things might appear,

105
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,415
there's still a plan.

106
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,879
We fed him to the dogs.

107
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,257
That here in the middle
of the Mexican desert,

108
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,092
when I needed him most,

109
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,969
I'd find a fellow Ranger.

110
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,973
Boy.

111
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,975
Now, I need your help to save another.

112
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,270
Bad news for you today!

113
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,941
This rescue that's coming,
we fed him to the Rottweilers

114
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,108
-about an hour ago.
-You know what's funny?

115
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,903
Is that you actually believe
that you got me.

116
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,821
You actually think
you're gonna kill me.

117
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,156
Can you drive?

118
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,492
Better than anybody you've ever seen, sir.

119
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,580
Nobody knew where you were hiding...

120
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,708
There was no Intel...until now, asshole.

121
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,628
In a few minutes
I'm gonna be having a cold beer,

122
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,507
and you are gonna be on fire.
Take care, my friend.

123
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,886
Alpha, Mike...
No!

124
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,639
...Foxtrot.

125
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,601
Think about it.

126
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,400
Adiós, mother...

127
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,000
Hannibal!

128
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,795
What are you doing?

129
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,219
Get in!

130
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,722
B.A., move.

131
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,404
This is bullshit!

132
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,908
Ahora, muerto!

133
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,412
Stop it! Please stop!

134
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,206
Please stop! Stop it! Stop! Please stop!

135
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,088
How's your day going?

136
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,841
This is not going to taste good.

137
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,770
Baby, I just threw up.

138
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,397
Let me get some gum.
Let me just get some gum.

139
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,775
Did you see that?
Did you see Tuco's face?

140
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,943
When you came over,
that was unbelievable!

141
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,528
-How many times did I say it?
-The timing was perfect.

142
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,198
-How many times did I say it, Face?
-it was so beautiful.

143
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,575
-l told you not to take down Tuco alone.
-What?

144
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,160
Well, you...

145
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,787
You know what? I'm sorry.

146
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,874
I'm sorry I didn't have
the Hannibal Smith How-to Manual.

147
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,877
-Okay? I had to move.
-And that move snowballs, Face.

148
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,837
You almost got yourself killed.

149
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,173
Which almost got me killed
and almost got him killed.

150
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,634
Five-year-old.

151
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,721
You look like you got a real bad attitude.

152
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,223
What?

153
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,974
Did I shoot up your van?

154
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,061
Am I wearing your favorite shirt?

155
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,187
This is your favorite shirt?

156
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,815
Yeah, pretty boy, that's my favorite shirt.

157
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,192
Did you get shot for me, too?

158
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,736
-And carjacked.
-By me.

159
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,574
Wait,
and he still got you to drive?

160
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,292
Thank you. Peck.

161
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,670
Baracus. it's all good.

162
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,714
See, Face, this is what happens
when we forget about plans

163
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,216
and just fire blind.

164
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,345
I'm so sorry that
l have feelings for a human being,

166
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,264
-that I fell in love.
-Love?

167
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,976
Wait a minute. What about Miss Croatia
three weeks ago?

168
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,522
Rescue sex.

169
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,733
I was just trying to save her.

170
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,943
-Save her?
-Yeah.

171
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,111
Save her? How?

172
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,489
Please, do share with us
your plan, Face.

173
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,701
Okay, I hadn't thought about that yet.

174
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,494
Exactly. I had to.

175
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,122
Her plane ticket.

176
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,875
Her work visa and her new passport.

177
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,294
And don't bullshit me
that this was about her, Face.

178
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,462
This was all about Tuco.

179
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,381
Do you have a mag?

180
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,078
-Mike.
-Boss man. How the hell are you?

181
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,039
-Still chewing the same dirt?
-l am, unfortunately.

182
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,832
-And out here in lovely Mexico.
-Good.

183
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,294
-So what have you got for me?
-l got a fast bird doing pizza runs.

184
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,630
-The call sign is "Hatchet."
-Hatchet. Okay.

185
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,673
And that is whatever you want it to be.

186
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,799
This is yours.

187
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,552
General, may I remind you,
they don't take to the gringos.

188
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,012
I owe you one, okay?

189
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,514
-Let's not wait till Bragg again, huh?
-Three years.

190
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,436
And the kid. Still you and the chicks.
B.A. What?

191
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,064
How am I gonna just leave my girl
like this, after all that?

192
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,482
I had to fight to get her back.

193
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,567
Leave the keys
and we'll come back for her. Come on.

194
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,111
Looking shabby.

195
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,532
-What is the deal, brother?
-Shoot anything that moves, okay?

196
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,660
-This is worse than Colombia.
-l know Tuco, man.

197
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,287
Don't worry about it.
I'll take her to war college in Saint Tropez.

198
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,914
I'll get you all their numbers,
so don't worry about it.

199
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,209
-Face, look after the Corporal.
-Yeah. Okay.

200
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,378
And you're covered in gas,
which I think is interesting.

201
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,559
Find a treatment room, Corporal.

202
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,020
Make it quick. I'm gonna find our pilot.

203
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,443
Hey.

204
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,993
Hey, Doc, you got a second
for a wounded vet?

205
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,872
Highly decorated combat pilot.

206
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,542
You ask him,
he thinks he's the best in the world.

207
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,627
But he's a functioning lunatic.

208
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,129
Last week he tried to escape
by jump-starting an ambulance.

209
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,007
Clear.

210
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
Damn it!

211
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,260
My kind of guy.

212
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,348
It almost hit your tattoo there.

213
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,933
Has anyone seen Mr. Murdock?

214
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,769
The old Ranger tat.
Mr. Murdock?

215
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,481
Would you think I was crazy
if I told you I had one of these?

216
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,525
Something wrong with your eyes, man.

217
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,194
-Mr. Murdock?
-Not while I'm operating, nurse.

218
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,071
-Not now.
-Why are you off the ward?

219
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,449
Is that gas? Is that you?

220
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,617
-l smell gas.
-What do you mean, "ward"?

221
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,036
-What ward?
-This man is a patient here.

222
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,912
Is this you?
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

223
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:00,125
Honestly, I'm a practicing doctor
at Johns Hopkins University.

224
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,753
-Did you ask him to do a lightning bolt?
-l asked for no lightning bolt.

225
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,838
I'm calling security.
What's wrong with this fool?

226
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,381
-Is he crazy?
-it is you.

227
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,091
-You on fire, man.
-What? What's that?

228
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,801
-What the...
-Oh, Jesus!

229
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,179
-You Rangers. I like you!
-Are you crazy?

230
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,646
Hey! Hey, come on!

231
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,484
Corporal, off. Back off!

232
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,069
This is a hospital.

233
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,280
Everybody's met Mr. Murdock.
Met him?

234
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,823
He lit my arm on fire.

235
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,076
He stitched a lightning bolt in mine, man.

236
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,161
Look at me, son.

237
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,748
I'm told you're a hell of a chopper pilot.

238
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,999
The best, sir.

239
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,459
I'm not getting on a chopper
with this nut job.

240
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,586
Yeah, that's a good...
Is he another one of your projects?

241
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,756
I'm a real soldier. I'm a Ranger, baby.

242
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,549
I'm worried!

243
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,927
I'm a Ranger, sir.

244
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,678
That's good enough for me.

245
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,138
You have been released into our care

246
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,182
-and reinstated, Captain.
-I'm not even close to good with that.

247
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,767
Thank you, sir.

248
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,477
Let's get the hell out of here.

249
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,199
You gorgeous old rust bucket, you.

250
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,659
Did you miss your daddy?

251
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,829
Face, what's the most important part
of a well-oiled plan?

252
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,205
To be one step ahead of the enemy,

253
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,125
-not to be running away from him.
-Who says we're running?

254
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,960
What, we're going to go in this dinosaur

255
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,253
-with this freak show?
-Yep.

256
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,881
You spin me right round, baby
Right round

257
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,801
-Rotors are good, sir.
-Who is this guy?

258
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,016
Come on! Let's go!

259
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,476
We've got gringos to kill!

260
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,186
Murdock, get this thing in the air.

261
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,729
Hold on, boys!

262
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,982
I'm gonna try something
l saw in a cartoon once.

263
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,484
What you talking about cartoons for?
Get us the hell out of here!

264
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,194
We got a hot chopper to your six.

265
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,740
I'm blocking bullets.
We're bulletproof.

266
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,492
We're bulletproof, boys!

267
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,161
Oh, heads up.

268
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,838
I see you, gringo!

269
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,716
You pancaked my van!
I'm gonna kill you, fool!

270
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,885
You can't park there.
That's a handicap zone.

271
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,387
-l knew you was crazy! I knew...
-This is a mistake.

272
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,230
Fire! Fire! Fire!

273
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,405
Blow them out of the sky.

274
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,912
I've never tried this before!

275
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,789
Did you see that?

276
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,042
Did you see
how he turned the helicopter?

277
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,131
Whoa! There's nothing like some good
air-to-air combat, eh, boys?

278
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,674
Don't look at me! Look there!

279
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,470
He's only got heat seekers left.

280
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,721
Captain, get us out of here.

281
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,015
Hold on, this could get ugly!

282
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,601
Here we go! Come on, baby, climb!

283
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,319
Fire the missiles.

284
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,781
Whoa! Missiles! Come on, come on.

285
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,951
That's how we deal
with heat seekers, chaps.

286
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:22,994
We go cold.

287
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,542
What the hell?

288
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,001
Face, get him in here!

289
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,088
Holy, shit! Oh, shit!

290
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,965
Got him!

291
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,341
Restart. Restart.

292
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,764
Close the door!

293
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,433
I know you're Airborne Rangers,
but that was ridiculous!

294
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,937
You're gonna be okay.

295
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,900
Boss, the idea is to kill Tuco,
not the other way around!

296
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,778
One step ahead of the game
isn't a plan, kid.

297
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,156
Two to three steps ahead.

298
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,826
Beating an enemy's move
before it's even made.

299
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,661
That's a plan.

300
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,581
Hatchet, Hatchet, lock on my LC.

301
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,292
General Tuco, you are currently engaged

302
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,920
in unauthorized warfare
on United States military personnel.

303
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,464
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You engaged me.

304
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,008
Repeat.

305
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:22,429
You are engaged in unauthorized warfare
on United States military personnel.

306
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,642
Over United States air space.

307
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,229
-What?
-Alpha, Mike...

308
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,149
-Foxtrot!
-...Foxtrot!

309
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,903
-In other words, Adiós, mother...
-Oh, no.

310
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,660
Yeah!

311
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,913
Well done, Captain.

312
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,790
-That was awesome.
-That wasn't awesome.

313
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,460
-You are a genius!
-I'm never flying again in this thing!

314
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,253
I never should have doubted you, boss!

315
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,922
There's a plan in everything, kid.

316
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,551
And I love it when a plan comes together.

317
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,331
Gunpowder cooking.
Nothing like it.

318
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,461
Face, you want it napalmed or nuked?

319
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,962
Nuke it.

320
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,548
-Nuke it!
-Mmm-hmm.

321
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,137
Murdock, burn the hell out of it,

322
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,307
like it was damned.

323
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,476
Burn the whole place down, buddy.

324
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,983
You want secret sauce?
-No, no, no. None of that anti-freeze.

325
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,820
The secret's out. You crazy.
Everybody knows.

326
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,781
No one can do an anti-freeze
marinade like you can, Murdock.

327
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,992
But I got a little Bell's palsy
last time I ate that.

328
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,495
It's only partial paralysis.
Come on, take it like a man.

329
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,288
Yes, sir.
I'm having that conversation right now.

330
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,249
We will enforce that.
I've got it well in hand, sir.

331
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,752
I don't think you want me to be
in the field partially paralyzed, bud.

332
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,338
Visitors.

333
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,346
Yeah.

334
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,687
Wow, I'm a little taken aback.
I'm not gonna lie.

335
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,647
Lieutenant.

336
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,649
Oh, I'm sorry, am I supposed
to call you Lieutenant back?

337
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,276
No, you're supposed to call me Captain.

338
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,236
Captain. Captain?

339
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,779
That's right.

340
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,574
Captain Crunch. Look at you. Wow.

341
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:51,453
So, I guess you said no to the kids,
no to the family.

342
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,329
Just no ladder you can't climb, huh?

343
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,332
No, no, honey, I just said no to you.

344
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,211
Hello. My name's Percy.

345
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,672
Would you like some pork?

346
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,216
If I broke every bone in your hand,
could you still do that?

347
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,136
This is crazy. Three years?

348
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,180
We haven't seen each other
for three years,

349
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,390
this is what we're gonna talk about?

350
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,395
What would you like to discuss?

351
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,192
Did you take my Steely Dan CD?

352
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,027
I'm not even going to respond to that.

353
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,196
We listened to it,
like, nine times in a row.

354
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,491
We were drinking that crappy Cabernet.
You remember that?

355
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,494
We were doing something else.
What were we doing?

356
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,580
Do you remember what it was
we were doing? it was in a bedroom.

357
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,998
You don't remember?

358
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,584
The only thing I remember is leaving.

359
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,546
Which is my fondest memory of you.

360
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,679
You guys are the best.
Stay out of trouble, you hear me?

361
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,266
Take care. Yes. Thank you.

362
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,770
Keep that on.

363
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,907
Colonel, my name is Lynch,
I'm with Central intelligence.

364
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,119
I knew a company man named Lynch
back in the first Desert Storm.

365
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,622
Yeah, I come from a long line of Lynches.

366
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,668
You ever stop to consider that maybe
the reason nobody trusts the CIA

367
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,878
is because nobody knows your real names?

368
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,173
What can I do for you, Mr. Lynch?

369
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,676
I need you to help me to stop
Saddam's former flunkies

370
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,428
from stealing over a billion dollars
in the next 30 hours.

371
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,724
Now, the only mint outside of the U.S.
Capable of printing our money

372
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,226
belonged to the Shah of Iran.

373
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,311
During the Iran-Iraq war, it went missing.

374
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,063
Rumor was, Saddam had stolen it.

375
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,065
And we stole it back during Desert Storm.

376
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,442
Well, you didn't get the engraving plates.

377
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,112
It didn't matter.

378
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,490
They would have had to rebuild a mint
just to print those bills.

379
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,075
Well, sir,

380
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,078
it's happening as we speak.

381
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,127
Fedayeen thugs have seized
what's left of the Iraqi National Mint

382
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,505
to run off billions of dollars
in unbacked American currency.

383
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,133
How are they planning on
moving the plates and a billion dollars

384
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,468
-out of Baghdad?
-Armored convoy,

385
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,096
manned with former Iraqi spec ops.

386
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,433
You know, high speed, shoot-to-kill types.

387
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,810
So how do you plan on stopping them?

388
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,569
Listen, there's some rumors
about some top-secret plates

389
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,196
being smuggled out of the city
by Saddam loyalists.

390
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,282
Do you know anything about this?

391
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,327
Seriously, if you're going to make
a play for these plates,

392
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm waving you off right now.

393
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,664
'Cause it's my responsibility
and it's my ass.

394
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,499
I'm serious.

395
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,376
-Face?
-Mmm-hmm.

396
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,128
I will court-martial you.

397
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,380
-Whoo! Okay.
-Hey.

398
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,924
Get the memo.

399
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:56,346
Tell your beloved Colonel Smith
and stay the hell out of Baghdad.

400
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,930
You know,

401
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,476
you never came back.
I thought you were gonna come back.

402
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,853
Well, this is me, coming back.

403
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,030
You think those clowns
can really pull this off?

404
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,157
Listen, listen, I would never tell him this,

405
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,327
but they are the best clandestine unit
in the four branches,

406
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,496
and they specialize in the ridiculous.

407
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,915
Shadow Peck and the rest of them.

408
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,043
-Do not let them out of your sight.
-Yes, ma'am.

409
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,006
-Doesn't diablo mean "devil"?
-Yeah, man.

410
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,511
God damn it, Hannibal,
what do you want me to do?

411
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,763
If this were my operation
and you wanted it,

412
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,974
-you would have the mission.
-You let Black Forest deploy on this,

413
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,185
and it's an international incident,
l promise you.

414
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,020
They're not soldiers.

415
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,773
They're frat boys with trigger fingers.

416
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,526
-Who's running the ground team?
-Brock Pike.

417
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,071
Pike.

418
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,825
He's a thug. He's a cartoon character.
Come on.

419
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,870
Hannibal, we have been ordered,
ordered, mind you,

420
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,706
to stay out of Baghdad.

421
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,500
Cut, dried, the end.
General,

422
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,795
we should find him
a little wiggle room, don't you think?

423
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:15,049
You know, I knew another Lynch,
a CIA stooge.

424
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,051
Stationed in Laos, '68.

425
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,471
-No relation.
-Are you sure?

426
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,931
'Cause you remind me of him.

427
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,185
I'm due in Kabul in a few hours.

428
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:30,314
I'll be back here in 48.
I'm assuming we're green and go.

429
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,233
Notify me otherwise.

430
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,944
He's wearing body armor in the HQ.

431
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,240
And that should tell you everything
you need to know about the CIA.

432
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,921
Russ, let's do some good
on the way out the door here.

433
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,967
Those plates are gonna do
all kinds of damage.

434
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,510
Let me go get them.

435
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,638
Forget about it, Hannibal.
Steer clear of this one.

436
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,098
Well clear of it.

437
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,977
This is a gauntlet run
right through the heart of Sadr City.

438
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:13,024
Saddam Hussein
was a certifiable madman,

439
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,193
but even he wasn't crazy enough

440
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,446
to go into that place
more than once in 30 years.

441
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,532
We pulled out of there a week ago
and already it's the Wild West.

442
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,659
You actually sound worried.

443
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,497
-And you actually seem offended.
-Yeah.

444
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,665
Well, this isn't about
you losing a step now.

445
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,083
I want you to know that.

446
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,711
-Hey.
-Hey.

447
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,088
I'm 10 times the man I was
when you met me.

448
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,049
-Uh-huh.
-And twice as fast.

449
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,967
Russ,

450
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,638
the boys and I can get this done,
minus the bloodshed.

451
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,182
Those plates can do all kinds of damage.

452
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,642
Don't make me beg.

453
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,560
I'd hate to see you beg, Hannibal.

454
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,066
You've been my friend for a long time.

455
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,652
More importantly,

456
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,613
you and those boys have possibly been

457
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:05,117
the most valuable military asset
l have ever had at my disposal.

458
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,913
Now, you asked me not to make you beg.

459
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,750
Right now, I'm begging you.

460
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,087
Hannibal, please, let this one go.

461
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:21,133
Russ, this is too big an enterprise.
We can't let these bozos do this.

462
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,844
It's way too big.

463
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,430
And you'd do it
with or without my blessing?

464
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,516
No, that I wouldn't.

465
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,518
I need your blessing.

466
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm not so sure that it is a blessing.

467
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,696
Good hunting, my friend.

468
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:44,949
Thank you.

469
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,579
How'd it go with the old man?

470
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:52,206
Same old, same old. What you got there?

471
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,000
Pictures of my new baby.

472
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,752
Oh, look at her.
Who's a proud papa?

473
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,797
These pictures are the closest
Murdock gets to that van.

474
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,508
It's ready for me when I go back to LA.

475
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:06,929
Listen, B.A.,
we're extending our stay a little bit.

476
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,431
We're going back into Baghdad.

477
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,516
I thought we was ordered
to stay out of Baghdad.

478
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,268
That's true, but I'm...
Smith.

479
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,147
-Pike.
-l understand you and your grunts

480
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,441
are now stealing my gigs. I don't like that.

481
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,694
I figured you Black Forest guys
would be busy

482
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,947
installing a dictatorship
or overthrowing a democracy somewhere.

483
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,745
It's still the weekend, yet.
That's nine-to-five stuff, pops.

484
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,164
Look at you clowns.

485
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,707
You're not soldiers.

486
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,084
You're assassins in polo shirts.

487
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,965
We'll make in a week
what you guys make in a year.

488
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,759
Cash don't buy guts, kid,

489
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,470
or brains.

490
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,680
And you're short on both.

491
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,102
This is Morrison's base. Bug out of my op.

492
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,566
They make you wear
the yellow shirt there, B.A.?

493
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,777
What's that stand for, "Barely Able"?

494
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,741
Get out of my way, punk.

495
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,827
Hey, don't sweat them.

496
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,956
They might have just done us a favor.
A big one.

497
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,708
Let me see, we got one medium tank left.

498
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,961
I'm telling you,
there's a reason she came back.

499
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,380
Face, I told you, forget about her.

500
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,881
The levels of ambition on this woman...

501
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,883
I ain't stepping foot
in any type of aircraft, Hannibal.

502
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,095
No gliders, paper planes, ultra-lights.

503
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,097
-You ever gonna let me live that down?
-No.

504
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,225
Mexico was a long time ago,
and I saved your life.

505
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,394
How about thanking me
for not whooping your ass at the hospital?

506
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,979
I was an Airborne Ranger until I met you.

507
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,605
And you chickened out just like...

508
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,108
-263 jumps.
-Just a thank-you would have been nice.

509
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,276
And one helicopter ride with you
screws it up.

510
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,405
Airborne Ranger with a fear of flying.
Like a punk!

511
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,366
B.A., for the last time,
nobody leaves the truck

512
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,536
once we take it over. Okay?

513
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,957
My cousin takes me to this party
where this amazing cover band

514
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,919
does this trash metal version of Hello
by Lionel Richie.

515
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,045
- Yeah.
- Yeah. it goes...

516
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,590
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

517
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,259
Guys, how long have they been in there?

518
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,344
-About three hours.
-Three hours.

519
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,430
Three hours?

520
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,266
They've been in there for three hours?
They haven't come out at all?

521
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,726
No one came out to take a leak, nothing?

522
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,310
- No.
- Nope.

523
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,110
I've been here for three seconds
and that sounds odd to me.

524
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,029
I've been watching that tent like a hawk.

525
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,198
Really? it looks like you're eating
some risotto and sitting on your ass.

526
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,616
I don't know. I wanted the soup.

527
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,953
- I wasn't eating risotto. I had...
- it's not risotto.

528
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,545
Yeah, boys.

529
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,636
Yeah, he wants to fight, doesn't he?

530
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,808
Damn, this is awesome.
They got us a stripper, too.

531
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,728
You got that hot enlisted look. Me likey.

532
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,566
Before I throw you in the stockade,
where are they?

533
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,194
They didn't tell us... Captain.

534
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,156
They just gave us a case of beer
and 50 bucks apiece.

535
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,866
I got a hundred.

536
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,659
Oh, did you get a hundred?

537
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,667
You think we get to keep the hair?

538
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,587
Staging, movement, action plan.

539
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,589
There's a nice read for you.

540
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:33,803
Hell, yeah, Hannibal.
This is it right here.

541
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,889
This is bat-shit insane.

542
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,268
-it's perfect.
-This is beyond nuts, boss.

543
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,567
It gets better.

544
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,696
B.A., you'll need a piece
of contoured metal to make a skid plate.

545
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,823
Let's go, fool.

546
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,450
Murdock,
we'll need a car battery, too.

547
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,162
See if the boys at Black Forest
can help us out.

548
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,872
Press credentials, we need them.

549
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,458
Hit the media tent
and see what's lying around.

550
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,752
Sorry, my friend, I see you've put

551
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,587
the South African microphone
at the bottom.

552
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,798
You can't always put the CNN on top.

553
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,092
Private, there are two mics.
I don't know if there is something...

554
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:18,681
I was a moving man in my younger days.

555
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,058
Murdock, we need a news camera.

556
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,643
See what you can do.

557
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,648
All right, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

558
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,317
Hello. I'm...

559
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,319
I'm in love with you.

560
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,946
Listen, we're doing a preliminary poll of...

561
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,323
What are we talking about?
Of the pull-out.

562
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,327
We're gonna need airbags,
lots of them.

563
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,746
-What bureau are you with, darling?
-Le Monde.

564
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,248
Are you French?

565
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,881
Hello, this is General Parker. I need...

566
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,048
Okay. it's for you.

567
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,801
Hey, fool, you need to call
an air strike on yourself.

568
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,431
-We're good, mate. I'll meet you.
-No, I think we need to get going now.

569
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,684
You need to understand
what I'm telling you right now.

570
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,270
B.A.,
we're gonna need a magnet.

571
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,355
-Yeah!
-A powerful one.

572
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,694
You ever seen Blue Man Group?

573
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,198
I'll pick up the rest.

574
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,043
I'm just gonna go for it.

575
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,298
Ooh, la, la.

576
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,051
What would you give for one chance

577
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,721
to come back here and tell our enemies

578
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,390
that they may take our lives,

579
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:47,561
but they'll never take our freedom!

580
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,570
Ready to go downtown?

581
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,906
Good luck tomorrow.

582
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,325
-Thank you.
-Give 'em hell.

583
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,751
General Morrison,
where the hell is Hannibal Smith?

584
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,841
Captain, you would do well
to revise your tone and readdress me.

585
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,595
General, I have authority under DCIS
that supersedes your command,

586
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,724
so last time, before this becomes
embarrassing for the both of us,

587
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,395
where is Hannibal Smith?

588
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,274
Would you excuse us, General?

589
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:44,368
Captain, in nearly 40 years
of being in this army,

590
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,787
l have learned to control my temper

591
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:51,208
and my voice when in the presence
of a subordinate officer

592
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,295
who, for at least the time being,
seems to have lost her goddamn mind.

593
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,298
Now, it is my understanding

594
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,300
that you have a question for me.
Is that correct?

595
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,885
You are correct, sir.

596
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:06,140
Then when you are prepared to
remember that you are still an officer

597
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,893
in the United States Army,
in spite of your civilian attire,

598
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,897
and are ready to present that question
in a military fashion,

599
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,108
then perhaps we could get somewhere
with this discussion.

600
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,237
If you have sent an Alpha Team into
Baghdad for any reason whatsoever,

601
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,615
that is a direct violation of a DOD order.

602
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,368
Well, and as much as you have
this kind of knowledge,

603
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:30,956
l can't help wondering why it is that
you need to ask anything of me.

604
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,878
I will take that as your confirmation, sir.

605
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,054
They go mobile in three hours.

606
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,932
The plates and over a billion dollars

607
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,686
will be loaded into the back of a semi
at the mint.

608
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:57,316
They're overland for exactly
4.6 miles before they reach the bridge.

609
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,740
That's our window, and it closes fast.

610
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,538
These guys will go weapons hot
at the first whisper of trouble.

611
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,714
Face, your point of entry
is under the hotel.

612
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,052
It'll be packed with foreign press
and private security.

613
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,782
B.A., you're in this alleyway
on a stopwatch.

614
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,368
Make sure the bike has V-twins or better.

615
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,745
I got something
a whole lot better than that.

616
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,249
-Bam!
-What about me, boss man?

617
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,753
I had a little
helicopter here someplace.

618
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,799
You got some barrel rolls?
Some mid-air stalls?

619
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:08,178
I'm looking for my next
near-death experience.

620
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,180
Only air support this time,
Captain,

621
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,683
but I'll get you in on the next one.
I promise.

622
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:17,271
B.A., I need you
to pop that clutch at 0630.

623
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,608
Is that me?

624
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:25,320
Oh, no, I forgot. I'm in an Iraqi sewer.
Thanks, boss!

625
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,286
Timing is everything, Face.

626
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,456
This is all about the bull's-eyes.

627
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,172
Why not?

628
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:50,554
From under the semi, you'll
take out the truck directly behind you.

629
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,356
Huh?

630
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,777
Now, these guys
are gonna be onto you, Face.

631
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,613
B.A., that's your cue for throttle.

632
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,741
Be sure to look both ways
before crossing.

633
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,826
And have a nice full tank of gas.

634
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,840
You'll have
multiple hostiles on board, B.A.

635
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,428
Escort them from the premises.

636
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:53,742
If any stragglers sneak up behind,
don't worry, I got your back.

637
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,673
Gotcha, kid.

638
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:09,925
Attaboy.

639
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,430
That's all fine in theory, but I still
don't see how we get out of Baghdad.

640
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,515
I do.

641
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,558
B.A. ! Hang a right!

642
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,894
All right! Hang on!

643
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,402
Watch out! Watch out!
Heads down!

644
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,822
Oh! Nice one, B.A.!

645
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,159
Face, get the airbags!

646
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,621
Gotta make sure
this thing stays locked for later!

647
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,248
Beautiful!

648
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,084
One, two, three.

649
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,426
Hey, boss, airbags do deploy
on impact, right?

650
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,096
B.A., get in the container.

651
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,641
Contact, rear!

652
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,226
Shit!

653
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,038
See, this is the part of the plan
l don't trust!

654
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,540
Don't worry, Face! The rope will hold!

655
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,626
If I was worried, I'd be nailing myself
to the container right now!

656
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,462
Hang on, boys!

657
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,400
Bam! Come on! I smoked you!

658
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,069
You boys see that down there?

659
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,362
Murdock? What is that fool doing here?

660
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,364
Don't lock me in here.
I ain't playing with y'all!

661
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,658
Hey, boss,
you ever play that game at the fun fair

662
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,952
where you try to pick up
a stuffed animal with the claw?

663
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,497
This is a lot like that.

664
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,540
That's it!

665
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,375
Did you lock this?

666
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,835
You locked it, didn't you?

667
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,670
Hannibal, open this door right now, man!

668
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,964
What the... Are you hooking this thing?

669
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,092
-You hooking this up to a helicopter?
-l got you.

670
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,260
What the hell's going on?
You ain't that crazy!

671
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,471
Tell me we ain't flying!
I'm gonna kill you, fool!

672
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,474
-Boss, is that Bosco?
-Get me out of here!

673
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,476
- That's not good.
- Let me out of here!

674
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,479
That's not good.
He is not happy.

675
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,859
Agent Lynch,
I'm patching surveillance

676
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,319
from the General's tent to you now.

677
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,530
Sir,
l have an inbound V-22 tilt-rotor

678
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,115
on approach from the northwest.

679
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,701
Identified friendly.
Landing under the General's orders.

680
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,746
Alpha Delta Alpha, stand down.
Checked, friendly.

681
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,791
Those are our boys.
D-block perimeter around LZ

682
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,001
for essential cargo touchdown.

683
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,738
Russ, we are in the net.

684
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,950
Copy that. I will be there in five.

685
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,369
I've got a big bottle of Blue Label waiting.

686
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,247
A bottle? Make it a case, Scrooge.

687
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,790
See you in a few.

688
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,959
Who's gonna let him out?

689
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,502
-You!
-You!

690
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:36,131
What you don't realize is,
now I gotta kill all of y'all!

691
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,843
I'll kill all of y'all!
Hannibal first, then Murdock!

692
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,803
Boss man.
I'm gonna save Face for last!

693
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,597
Let me try something.
Go for it.

694
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,099
Is it weird that I'm more scared now
than what we just did?

695
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,393
Bosco, it's Murdock.

696
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,187
Murdock, open this door!

697
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,732
I'll make you some of that
coconut-curry tapenade that you love.

698
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,483
That might work.

699
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,486
With toast points?

700
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,614
Hell, yeah, with toast points.
What, you're gonna have that

701
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,365
-with plain old chips?
-Let's do this.

702
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,452
-Damn! You tricked me.
-There he is.

703
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,162
-There he is!
-l hate that!

704
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,289
-Come on!
-Get away from me, man!

705
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,125
The only reason I don't kick y'all asses
is 'cause you all outrank me.

706
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,044
You should know better!
You know I hate flying!

707
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,296
I'm wet! I stink!
Hoo! Yeah!

708
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,839
And I can't spend none of that money!

709
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,799
- Money can't buy happiness.
- Damn, man!

710
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:23,178
Hey, Murdock, you cooking tonight.
You better get your apron on.

711
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,475
I love it when a plan comes together.

712
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,775
Hannibal, who was that?
General?

713
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,193
-Is that the General?
-Russ.

714
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,737
Get there. Get in there.
General!

715
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,822
-Russ!
-General!

716
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,532
General!

717
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,159
Jesus Christ.

718
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,416
Pike.

719
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,043
Contact rear!

720
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,337
Get in there!

721
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,260
Get there, get there!

722
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,153
After conferring,
we've decided to demote you

723
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,739
to the rank of First Lieutenant.

724
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,616
Lieutenant Sosa, it's nothing personal,

725
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,410
but you lost those plates.

726
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,537
Those were your responsibility.

727
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,331
Consider yourself lucky.

728
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,832
Others are going to prison over this.

729
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,375
Good day, Director McCready.

730
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,336
Lieutenant, you're dismissed.

731
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,881
Colonel Smith,
this court has been unable to recover

732
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:27,260
any direct order from General Morrison
for you to conduct the mission

733
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,346
for which you're being tried.

734
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,807
Your Honor,
this was a covert operation

735
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,226
and no official orders were given.

736
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,938
So the one individual who can verify

737
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,775
the legitimacy of this operation
is deceased. Is that correct, Colonel?

738
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,902
No, Your Honor, not deceased.

739
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,196
General Morrison was murdered.

740
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,782
Colonel, I've been around a long time.

741
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,786
I've seen units like yours.
They're outlaws.

742
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,538
Units like that pose a direct threat

743
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,083
to the fabric and fundamentals
of our military.

744
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:03,338
Your Honors, why hasn't Black Forest
been brought to trial?

745
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,301
Black Forest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction.

746
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,846
Where's the plan, boss? where is it?

747
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,765
Where's the escape hatch?
Because I don't see it.

748
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,351
-This mission isn't over, Lieutenant.
-What mission?

749
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:21,231
I clear our names.
We find Pike and the plates.

750
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,191
No matter what.

751
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:28,363
Your Honors, these men were acting
under my command.

752
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,241
Any judgment should be levied
against me, and me alone.

753
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,492
Absolutely not, sir.

754
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,744
We were all participating
in this operation willingly.

755
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:35,995
I don't wanna be tried separately.

756
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,664
I refuse to be tried separately, sir.

757
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,917
In accordance with
the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

758
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,794
this court is rendering guilty verdicts

759
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,296
for each member of this Alpha Unit,
or A-Team,

760
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:49,008
and mandating incarceration
in separate maximum-security facilities

761
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,178
for a period of up to 10 years.

762
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,807
You're all hereby stripped of formal rank

763
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,184
and dishonorably discharged.

764
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,398
This is bullshit, man.

765
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,192
This session is adjourned.

766
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:12,740
Disgraceful.

767
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,034
-Do not touch me, okay?
-Captain, stand down.

768
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,661
Order! Order!

769
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,955
Absolute disgrace!

770
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,207
You happy? Are you happy, Charissa?

771
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,876
Colonel, control your men!

772
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,879
-Get your hands off me!
-This is a disgrace!

773
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,404
Well, hello, Mr. Lynch.
Long time.

774
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,908
You look very relaxed, Lynch.

775
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,492
A lot of cameras in here.

776
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,286
Yeah, there are.

777
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:02,040
Yeah, well, they seem to be having
some technical issues at the moment.

778
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,667
May not show up till playback.

779
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,920
Hannibal. Can I call you Hannibal?

780
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,340
I can't call you Colonel anymore.

781
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,925
Six months.

782
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,386
Been waiting for you to bust out of here

783
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:18,473
and round up the rest
of the Backstreet Boys

784
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,016
and lead me to those plates.

785
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,019
Six months and not a peep.

786
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,980
Everybody thought you and your team
were working with Pike.

787
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,691
Mmm. Everybody except you.

788
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,990
Pike murdered Morrison. Set me
and my boys up and stole those plates.

789
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,331
And I know where he is.

790
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,168
Nobody knows where he is.

791
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,882
It's a single image of him.

792
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,552
Taken about a month ago,
somewhere in Europe.

793
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,139
We think it's a grab from a CCTV camera.

794
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,102
Frankfurt, Germany.

795
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,439
How did you get that in here?

796
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,316
Time, Lynch.

797
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,610
Give me a minute and I'm good.

798
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,570
If I've got an hour, I'm great.

799
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,824
You give me six months, I'm unbeatable.

800
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,492
I know Pike.

801
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,785
Who's the Arab?

802
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,912
We don't know.

803
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,082
We think he's the deep, dark,
hidden hand in this whole thing.

804
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,002
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

805
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:34,340
Lynch, we have common
enemies and you have limited choices.

806
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,051
My team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back.

807
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,386
I wouldn't be so sure.

808
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,888
Then why did you make
the long drive out here?

809
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,766
You and your boys at Langley
want your own private printing press.

810
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,353
That's about as deep
as your patriotism goes.

811
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,897
So, what would you need from me?

812
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,942
I swore to my team
that I would clear our names.

813
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,862
You of all people must understand
the value of a name.

814
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,533
Now, listen.

815
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:05,747
I want full reinstatement
and clean records

816
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,499
for myself and my team.

817
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,835
I can't get you out of here.

818
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,796
Not legally, at least.

819
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,509
This is something the boys at Langley
do very, very well.

820
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,261
Make sure the dosage is right.

821
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,515
And when I say right, I mean perfect.

822
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:30,355
Don't seem like happiness will come along

823
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,693
Cuban. What a shame.

824
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:41,616
Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed.

825
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,329
Just can't seem to get ahead in life.

826
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:52,919
Ooh, nothing I do ever turn out right

827
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,173
won't somebody help me, please?

828
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:03,262
'Cause I've been lonely for so long.

829
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:07,058
Don't seem like happiness will come along

830
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,895
I've been lonely...

831
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,372
You are not permitted

832
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,792
in my dojo!

833
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,382
So, Satan walks into this bar...

834
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,512
Wait a minute.
What's this, a lap pool?

835
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,972
A dry steam room?

836
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,599
Yeah, it'll go a long way with the boys.

837
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:51,519
How in the hell do you pull this off?

838
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,063
It's not who you know, Bob,
it's how you know them.

839
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,732
Oh! Did your boy get back
from Afghanistan?

840
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,777
Yeah. Thanks for getting him home.
His mother and I are real grateful.

841
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,655
-Captain.
-Hey.

842
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,574
You left something on the bed.

843
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,955
-Could have hid those.
-Why would I want to do that?

844
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,957
I'll see you at 8:00.

845
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:17,211
And now you want to build...
A lap pool and a dry steam.

846
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,641
Overlooking a sundeck.

847
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,435
Hey, LT, thanks for the boots.

848
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,688
Ah! Come on. it's my pleasure, baby!

849
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,945
Beautiful.

850
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,201
Listen, now I know
this is good for the body,

851
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,994
but how do you protect the face?

852
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,624
You don't mess with it, kid.

853
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,210
Gotcha.

854
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,755
-Thanks for the tan.
-You got it.

855
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,426
Smith has escaped, Lieutenant.

856
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,804
Let me go after him.

857
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,641
Smith and his team were working
with Brock Pike and Black Forest.

858
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,976
I can get those plates back for you, sir.

859
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,063
You know I can.

860
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,273
Holla what? Holla who?

861
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,860
Holla me.

862
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,657
Hey.

863
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:31,911
Hey! Let me out! Hey, hey! Hey!

864
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:37,959
I see him standing there,
and I was like, "What?"

865
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:43,339
And then it turned black
and I woke up, and my face was numb,

866
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,882
and I just...

867
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,343
And you mopped up the footprints
that led out,

868
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,679
ignored the fact that your lab coat,

869
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,723
pass card, car keys and car were missing.

870
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,433
Looks like he ate Smith.

871
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,520
Gilbert, you've either deliberately

872
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,273
aided and abetted
a federal fugitive's escape,

873
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:05,278
or you're the single dumbest human being
I've ever come into contact with.

874
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,446
-You smell that?
-Don't talk about it.

875
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,865
Would you like to know
which way I'm leaning?

876
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,911
Forward.

877
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:17,415
I would test this man's urine, on the hour.

878
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,684
I was a week away
from my parole hearing.

879
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,103
You are really tan.

880
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,483
Told you the mission wasn't over.

881
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,780
I'm putting the team back together.

882
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,867
I need you, Face.
I can't do this without you.

883
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:58,998
Warden, how did Smith arrange
a personal visit without your consent

884
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,667
or your signature? How does that happen?

885
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,420
How the hell did this guy do that?

886
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,923
Seal that up, nobody goes in there.

887
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,928
Log-in pages from the day in question
have been removed.

888
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,556
-Why does that not surprise me?
-Torn out.

889
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,601
The cigar was in the spine of that book.

890
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,103
-Subtle. it's a good book.
-Right.

891
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,898
This is surveillance
from all around the prison, right?

892
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,024
Mmm-hmm.

893
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,734
What you're watching is a signal jammer.

894
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,944
Every time he walks through
one of these things,

895
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,822
we get massive interference.
He waltzes in here and waltzes out.

896
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,741
Nobody knows who he is.

897
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,202
God.

898
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:42,500
Yes. The cigar that Colonel Smith
broke out of prison with.

899
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,502
Yeah. Wanna hear the crazy part?
Yes.

900
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:49,924
Lab reports show lethal amounts of,
wait for it, tetrodotoxin.

901
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,134
Tetrodotoxin? What is that?

902
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:55,221
-The near-death drug.
-Yes, that sleeping beauty thing.

903
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,264
Yeah. And you know
who likes to use that, right?

904
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,600
-Who?
-Our friends at Langley.

905
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,726
It's one of their favorites.

906
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:04,772
Come on, do you really think that
the CIA came to the prison to visit Smith?

907
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,733
This sounds kind of crazy,
but I think the CIA broke him out.

908
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,027
Who put us on?

909
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:14,573
The same guy that put us on in Baghdad.
Lynch, CIA.

910
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,452
What are we talking about?
Clean records? Reinstatements?

911
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,204
All of the above.

912
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,209
What about Pike and the plates?

913
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,044
Payback.

914
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,089
What are they exchanging?
What is that?

915
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,590
Is that how he got this in here?

916
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,180
One of these things is not like the other.

917
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,432
I suck at these games.

918
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,644
Where's this plate from?
What is that plate?

919
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,898
It's an "F." Frankfurt, Germany.

920
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,025
Oh, Frankfurt, Germany.

921
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,945
Smith is talking to us.
This is not accidental.

922
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,990
With this guy, there's a plan
and two to back it up.

923
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,160
I take it you didn't get religion inside.

924
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,079
No. I got revenge.

925
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,498
Good.

926
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,878
I know a couple of guys
that'll feel the exact same way.

927
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,838
I'm counting on it.

928
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,200
Emergency exit now.

929
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,660
Hannibal.

930
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,883
Baracus, don't do it!

931
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,762
Where he going?
What's he doing, man?

932
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,681
Baracus! God damn it!

933
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,190
Sosa.

934
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,608
Lieutenant,
Peck's already gone.

935
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,734
What?

936
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,070
Baracus and Murdock are left.
Handle it, Lieutenant.

937
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,321
Right. Okay.

938
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,906
I don't want to be embarrassed
like this again. Do you?

939
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,575
Okay. No, no, no, no.
We're gonna catch and deploy from here.

940
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,660
Peck escaped.

941
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,204
-Oh, hell. You think Smith is involved?
-Definitely.

942
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,040
Get graphics on him and Smith.
Anything that'll ID them instantly.

943
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,125
I know they got Murdock
in a psych ward in Mannheim.

944
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,710
Right. Okay.
Where the hell is B.A. Baracus?

945
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,474
How did you know that once that door
was extracted

946
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,601
-that it would take his weight?
-l just did. He's...

947
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,229
-You know, he's what, 225, 230 pounds?
-230. Yeah.

948
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:52,940
Remember the gag we did in Venezuela
seven years ago?

949
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,234
Venezuela. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,027
But that was a midget.

951
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,530
Yeah, I wouldn't go for that.

952
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,699
-Hey, big guy. There he is.
-Yeah! He's back.

953
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,576
Yeah, it's good to be back.
Come on.

954
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,327
It's good to be back.
My man.

955
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,288
-it's good to see you, bud.
-You, too, bro. You, too.

956
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,748
-Thanks.
-You look well.

957
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,750
It's good to see you guys.

958
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,840
-What?
-Where's the Mohawk?

959
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,593
What, you don't like my new do, man?

960
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,221
Do I like it? Well, we got you the clippers.
I thought...

961
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,098
Yeah, I used them.

962
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:30,436
Hey. What's up, big guy?

963
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,607
Come on, you can speak to us.

964
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,026
Guys...

965
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,447
I can't kill anybody.

966
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,703
-What do you mean?
-I've taken a vow.

967
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,039
-Vow?
-Of non-violence.

968
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,417
I'll still do anything for you guys,
you know that.

969
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,754
But I just can't kill, man.

970
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,298
Old habits may die hard,

971
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,509
but they still gotta die.

972
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,680
When I was a kid,
all you heard in the hood was,

973
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:10,601
"Bosco's a badass, out collecting scalps."

974
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,313
That's where the Mohawk came from.

975
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,316
Was always at war.

976
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,485
And that's what warriors are for.

977
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,488
Hannibal, man. I don't miss that life.

978
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:26,033
I'll help you get Murdock,
and right that wrong,

979
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,578
but I can't kill.
Even Pike?

980
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,122
Even if killing him would clear your name?

981
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,669
My conscience is the only thing
l need clear.

982
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:40,214
Now, where's that crazy-ass fool?

983
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,009
Transference.

984
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,346
Healing feelings.

985
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,349
You can't warehouse these things,
you know?

986
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,852
You have to express to progress.

987
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,273
We gotta empower your emotional tower

988
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:02,319
and send out a wavelength
of self-love and acceptance.

989
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:07,658
Thank you.

990
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,339
Clear.

991
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:28,637
He seems completely impervious to it.
It's impossible to develop a base reading.

992
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,389
Have you increased the voltage?

993
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,099
Every single session, yes.

994
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,809
-Healing feelings, baby.
-And?

995
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,397
Is that all you got? Here we go.

996
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,481
Clear.

997
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,233
Yee-ha!

998
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,405
Yeah, I think
l might have felt something there.

999
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,336
Oh, no, I won't sleep.

1000
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,172
Howard Little.

1001
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,592
You have a package here
from an Annabelle Smith.

1002
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,554
I don't know
any Annabelle Smith.

1003
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,142
Sure you do, Howie.

1004
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,853
Sure you do, baby. Annabelle.

1005
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,523
Remember the nurse from DA Nang?
The redhead, double amputee?

1006
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,318
Professional hang glider? Yes!

1007
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,361
Guys.

1008
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,113
Annabelle.

1009
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,073
Yeah. Yeah.

1010
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:31,200
Annabelle.

1011
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:35,120
Annabelle.
You have outdone yourself. Look at this.

1012
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,372
-it's so real.
-Beauty.

1013
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:38,957
A movie in three dimensions.

1014
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,043
Stand-to, soldier.

1015
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,088
-Jerries advancing on the western front.
-Good heavens.

1016
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:46,632
Got a secret mission for you.

1017
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,135
Take these
and distribute them amongst the men.

1018
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,720
-Yes, sir.
-Don't fail the Queen.

1019
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,138
-No, sir.
-Great.

1020
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,223
Yes, sir.

1021
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,809
Movie, movie, movie...

1022
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,685
I knight you.

1023
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,063
Sir, you have to put your head down.
Stand up and do it again.

1024
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,940
Movie, movie...

1025
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,151
Now let's sing to the Queen.
When I ask you... Not yet.

1026
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:07,778
-Movie, movie...
-Movie, movie...

1027
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,491
You get glasses! You get glasses!

1028
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,867
Ball!

1029
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,953
When you kneel,
you put your head down straightaway.

1030
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,830
Looking me in the eye is disrespectful.
Do you understand?

1031
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,331
Movie, movie...

1032
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,334
You're looking me in the eye now.
That's wrong.

1033
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,920
Movie, movie, movie...

1034
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,964
Aquaman? Hello.

1035
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,423
You get glasses! You get glasses!

1036
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:33,011
Rise, Sir 3D,
and enjoy your motion picture.

1037
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:34,972
-Movie! Movie!
-Movie! Movie!

1038
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,436
Boy, could I use two hours of not this.

1039
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,566
Pass out the sedatives
and order some pizzas for these freaks.

1040
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,069
-Movie, movie...
-Movie, movie...

1041
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,739
Movie...

1042
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,741
Shit.

1043
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,077
Excuse me,
can I help you with something?

1044
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:59,580
Yes. Captain Murdock, where is he?

1045
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,207
Right through there.
Thank you.

1046
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,792
El diablo.

1047
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,920
Okay. Settle down.

1048
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,380
No talking during the movie.

1049
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,092
Down in front!

1050
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,681
Look, it's 3D, man!

1051
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,433
I'm sick of 3D.

1052
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,977
Captain Murdock.

1053
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,855
You remember me from Baghdad?

1054
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,281
Okay, this is pointless.
This guy is fried.

1055
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,657
Yeah, there's a reason
why he's in here.

1056
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,993
And his entire team has escaped,
except him.

1057
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,871
Movie!

1058
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,707
Take a look around anyway.
Let's make sure he's alone.

1059
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,626
Yes, ma'am.

1060
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,865
Oh, Captain, your chariot awaits.

1061
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,242
Sorry, boys, gotta run!
Can't finish the movie.

1062
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:20,661
Do let me know how it ends.

1063
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,829
Charissa, where are you hiding?
Stay beautiful, baby.

1064
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,915
- Punch it, B.A.
- Let's go, fool.

1065
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,169
Get the truck!

1066
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,547
She's actually shooting at us.

1067
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,174
You guys should see these bullets in 3D!

1068
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,718
-Murdock, get in here!
-it's like we're actually being shot at!

1069
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,470
You are getting shot at, you crazy-ass fool!

1070
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,265
-Stop right there!
-Ram it.

1071
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,809
Hey! I said halt!

1072
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,022
Damn! Sorry, dude.

1073
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,775
It looks like they're headed for the tarmac.

1074
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,610
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1075
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,702
-Gentlemen.
-Holy shit, that's Hannibal Smith.

1076
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:05,372
Are any of you armed
and/or wanted federal fugitives?

1077
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:08,458
-No.
-Well, we're both.

1078
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,002
Which means...
This is a bad idea.

1079
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,420
This is a bad idea.

1080
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,505
Stop being a baby.
You're a grown-ass man. Get on the plane.

1081
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,216
-You're taking the plane?
-And that's why I joined the Army.

1082
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,343
We gotta finish the escape.
Man up and get in there.

1083
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:21,680
The best and brightest.
Appreciate it, boys. That'll be all.

1084
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,432
Who's got the keys?
I just need your keys.

1085
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,600
What you talking about keys?
You don't need no keys for no plane.

1086
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,145
- I do need keys.
- For what? This is a bad idea.

1087
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,896
We just broke
this guy out of a psych ward.

1088
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,732
Hannibal, you let the real pilots go.

1089
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,525
-B.A., relax. You're gonna be fine.
-Take one of these.

1090
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:37,195
What is this? Will it knock me out?
It better knock me out,

1091
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,613
'cause if it don't,
I'm gonna knock you out.

1092
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,240
Bosco, the buttons are confusing me.

1093
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,284
Shut up, Murdock.
Come on, Murdock. Let's go.

1094
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,619
You gonna fly this plane?
Forget it. I'll turn myself in.

1095
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,204
What does this do?
Come on.

1096
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,206
-Come on, Murdock.
-l got lucky.

1097
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,459
Hang on, boys.

1098
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,718
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

1099
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,140
Face, your girlfriend is back.

1100
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,726
Reverse now.
Son of a bitch!

1101
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,519
Move your ass now.

1102
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:13,398
-The C-1 30 versus the Mercedes-Benz.
-Lift us off, Murdock.

1103
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,526
- How about faster?
- Faster!

1104
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:17,736
I'm trying. I got it pinned!

1105
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:29,372
Oh, my God!

1106
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:42,636
Get us to flight control.

1107
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,224
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are expecting slight turbulence.

1108
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:50,060
Please remain in your seats
until the captain has turned off

1109
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,270
the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign.

1110
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,607
Don't worry, boys! Turbulence has never
brought down a plane!

1111
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,904
What the hell is that?

1112
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:05,283
But we got inbound subsonic UAVs
with missile lock!

1113
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,702
And they bring down planes all the time!

1114
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,416
Okay, they're coming in.
Launching countermeasures!

1115
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:21,883
Whoa!

1116
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,471
Did you see that? That's my diversion!

1117
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,598
They die on this version.

1118
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,982
Hang on! Hang on! Hold on!
We're going over.

1119
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,777
Murdock,
what the hell are you doing?

1120
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,989
You boys remember Mexico?

1121
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,867
Whoa!

1122
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,743
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the flight deck,

1123
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,204
if you look out of the right-hand side
of the aircraft, you'll notice

1124
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,456
that your right wing is on fire.

1125
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,129
Tango reacquired.
Missile lock pending, sir.

1126
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:03,091
Lieutenant Charissa Sosa, DCIS.
Major, do not shoot that aircraft down.

1127
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,718
Scramble fighters and force them to land.

1128
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,261
There are federal fugitives on that plane.

1129
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,679
They've also stolen property
from the U.S. Army.

1130
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,432
Billy, Billy, I need you to get the nose-cam
view up here on my monitor now.

1131
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,725
It's up, sir. Here it is.

1132
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,647
Missile away, sir.

1133
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:24,696
We have shoot-down. Hercules has been
intercepted and destroyed.

1134
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,115
Sorry, Lieutenant. I'm sorry.

1135
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,129
-l don't believe it.
-We have chute deployment on the Buford.

1136
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:42,339
What?

1137
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,716
I want these drones taken offline
right now!

1138
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,801
-They're 3,000 miles away.
-Whoever is running those drones.

1139
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,470
Get me a direct line
to whoever is running those drones.

1140
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,889
We gotta get these drones to stand down
or I'm gonna be on bitch duty.

1141
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,682
I need to get those men alive!

1142
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,023
Everybody okay?

1143
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,234
What are the chances
they think we're dead?

1144
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:06,988
Not great.

1145
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,824
-Tell me we ain't still on that plane.
-We ain't on that plane.

1146
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:10,992
Hannibal!
Yeah?

1147
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,703
If we're under 20,000 feet,
we can still breathe, right?

1148
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,330
What are you talking about, 20,000 feet?

1149
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,291
-Let's fire up the old weapons system.
-What the hell, man?

1150
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:21,336
Hey, Bosco, a little stuffy.
I'm gonna pop a window!

1151
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,259
Yeah!

1152
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:30,679
What you got, bitches? What you got?

1153
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,766
Yeah!

1154
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,143
Let me have a turn, Face! Come on!

1155
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:40,105
-Why are we in a falling tank?
-Because the plane exploded!

1156
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,940
What... What? When?

1157
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,316
Recently!

1158
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,944
-The Reapers shot it down!
-What Reapers?

1159
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,616
The same ones
that are still trying to kill us!

1160
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,119
-l blame you, Hannibal!
-Technically, we're not flying.

1161
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,579
I know! Because we're falling, fool!

1162
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,546
Oh, Jesus!

1163
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,758
UAV-2 has splashed down.
We just lost one of the drones.

1164
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:11,261
Hannibal, we're in trouble!

1165
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:13,972
Brace yourselves!

1166
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,308
Awesome!

1167
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,728
Face, get on to the main gun!

1168
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:22,063
There's a lake a half-mile away
from this position.

1169
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:25,066
-What the hell am I trying to hit?
-Trust me!

1170
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:27,986
-Rotate the turret 82 degrees.
-Fire in the hole!

1171
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:30,947
-Fire!
-Boom!

1172
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,326
Fire!

1173
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,081
Are they trying to shoot down
that other drone?

1174
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,834
No. They're trying to fly that tank.

1175
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,379
- He's flying the tank!
-You can't fly a tank, fool!

1176
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,548
-Rotate 1 6 degrees!
-Got it!

1177
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,841
Fire!

1178
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,556
Rotate 34 degrees now!

1179
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,600
-Hannibal...
-Wait...

1180
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,101
Fire!

1181
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,523
Control, we have lost...
Is that a confirmed hit?

1182
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,692
Bring turret full-front and wait!

1183
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:12,989
Murdock! Close the hatch!

1184
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,657
Hatch, okay! Did that work?
Did that work?

1185
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,242
-Boss!
-Come on, baby.

1186
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,828
-Come on.
-Hatch control?

1187
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,790
I'm too young to die!

1188
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,167
Boss! I'm aiming at nothing!

1189
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,169
Come on.

1190
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,421
It's been an honor, gentlemen.
Come on, baby.

1191
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:31,049
The greatest ride is the last ride, Colonel!

1192
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,718
-Fire everything!
-Come on, baby!

1193
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:44,145
Get right with God, y'all! This is it!
Come on!

1194
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,188
Yee-ha!

1195
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,615
It's not fair to the fish!

1196
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,118
You're cheating!

1197
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,622
You with your nagging...

1198
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:05,125
...you're chasing them away!

1199
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,021
All right. Busy bees, busy bees.

1200
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,693
Guys, you can take your coats off.
Hot as hell in here.

1201
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,361
I'm sweating like a whore in church.

1202
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:34,571
-Sir.
-Yeah?

1203
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:37,866
Smith and his team were engaged
in a C-1 30 over Mannheim, Germany,

1204
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,742
by two Reaper drones.

1205
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,036
I'm not sure if it's an encryption glitch,

1206
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:45,165
but it says
that they were shot down in a tank.

1207
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:50,211
NORAD's calling it an X-out,
but there is a conflicting report.

1208
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,505
I'm sure there is.

1209
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,091
I've got a German Hausfrau
who says she saw a tank

1210
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:59,012
drive up and out of Lake Wolgastsee
with a guy resembling Murdock...

1211
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,347
Excuse me, which way to Berlin?

1212
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:04,392
- ...asking for directions to Berlin.
- That's impossible.

1213
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,730
Well, this will be the second time
Smith has died this week.

1214
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,440
Is that possible?

1215
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,740
- What have you got for me?
- Look at this.

1216
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:22,994
We just got the unscrambled composite
of Smith's visitor in prison,

1217
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,455
but with no ID on the subject yet.

1218
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,832
Hello, handsome.

1219
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,669
Wait, I've seen this person before.

1220
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:33,379
I know this guy.

1221
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,092
Baghdad.

1222
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,388
Get me a clean patch to Langley.
We're going fishing.

1223
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,015
I barely even heard about it.

1224
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,684
I mean, I heard bits and pieces of it,
but how much of that was us?

1225
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,102
-So, I have a...
-l was talking.

1226
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,604
-it's never us.
-Can you stop?

1227
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,981
I have a DOD hardline
from Lieutenant Sosa.

1228
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,733
She's looking for Agent Lynch.

1229
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,110
He's not available, ever.

1230
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,196
Agent Lynch, from Baghdad?

1231
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,700
General Morrison's tent?

1232
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,453
Out.

1233
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:08,498
Why do we have her?

1234
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,293
She's got a fantastic personality.
That's why.

1235
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,212
With whom am I speaking?

1236
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:19,133
This is Lieutenant Sosa.
Is this Agent Lynch?

1237
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,468
I'm sorry, I don't have a first name.

1238
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:24,055
Neither do l.
So, what can I do you for, Lieutenant?

1239
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,182
I'm looking at an image of you

1240
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:29,269
from the disciplinary barracks
at Fort Carson.

1241
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,271
She's hot.

1242
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:34,232
Did you visit
former Colonel Hannibal Smith in prison?

1243
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:41,739
I don't know what you're talking about,
former Captain.

1244
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:44,575
Agent Lynch,
if you facilitated Smith's escape

1245
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,786
and are currently aiding and abetting him...

1246
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,873
Ooh. Buddy.

1247
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,834
If you can make something like that stick,

1248
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,420
your next promotion
should be in the five-star range.

1249
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,548
And if you're helping to retrieve
those engraving plates,

1250
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:03,386
I'm going to have to go out of my way
to disappoint you.

1251
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,025
I want her phones, her computers,
any support packages she operates.

1252
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,320
I wanna know everything. I want active
intercept taps on everything she's got.

1253
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,238
I want every move monitored
from this moment forward.

1254
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,198
You realize she's DOD.

1255
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:27,952
I don't care if she's G-O-D. Do it.

1256
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,040
Boss, check this out.

1257
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,251
We've tracked this photograph of Pike
to the Königsbank in Frankfurt.

1258
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,046
Our surveillance
has him and an unknown Arab

1259
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,506
making regular trips
from the train station to the bank

1260
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,550
all over the last month.

1261
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,719
-Pike's getting sloppy.
-Yeah, but if we're onto him,

1262
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,388
what are the odds that Smith and his team
are onto Pike and the Arab, too?

1263
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:50,808
No, no, no, this is a direct
pull-down from the Pentagon's database.

1264
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,561
There's absolutely no way Smith
and his team could have this stuff.

1265
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:57,398
I think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times.

1266
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,193
Pike has been moving
the stolen engraving plates

1267
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:03,154
to the Königsbank Tower in Frankfurt
over the past month.

1268
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,823
Tomorrow, the last of the cases
containing these plates

1269
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,242
will be transferred to the Arab.

1270
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,578
This will mark the only time
in the last six months

1271
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,455
that all of the plates
have been in one location.

1272
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,792
It's our best and only shot
at getting them back.

1273
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:19,545
They leave the Königsbank Tower
for the 7:15 train to Zürich.

1274
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:24,675
Gentlemen, we're gonna make sure
they miss that train.

1275
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:26,928
-Face?
-Yeah.

1276
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,138
Time to bring in your former flame.

1277
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:30,598
If she's as good as I think,

1278
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,310
then she'll be on her way to Frankfurt
to intercept those plates.

1279
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:39,315
-Why would you tip her off?
-She's a crusader,

1280
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,359
and we're gonna need her teed up
at some point.

1281
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,902
Keep your eyes and ears open, boys.

1282
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:44,695
Charissa Sosa...

1283
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,657
Charissa Sosa...

1284
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,158
Now the wrinkle.

1285
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,704
If Sosa's onto us,
we can assume that Lynch is onto her.

1286
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,543
And if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates,

1287
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:00,545
he won't hesitate to kill her.

1288
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,672
Face, get to the train station.

1289
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:07,176
This is Sosa.

1290
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,888
If there's a threat from Lynch, deal with it.

1291
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:12,682
Hello?

1292
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,060
Shoot is green.
Say again, shoot is green.

1293
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,479
Hello?

1294
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:26,737
Something's wrong.

1295
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:32,827
We're marked, guys. Pull back.
I don't like this at all.

1296
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,620
See. Don't be seen.

1297
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,334
Hello, beautiful.
You have got some balls.

1298
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,961
-You put a drop phone on me?
-I had to, babe.

1299
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,839
It's the only way I could talk to you.
Lynch has all your comm lines.

1300
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:48,342
-l want you to pull your team now.
-I'm gonna find you, Face.

1301
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,220
But do not engage her
or anyone else directly.

1302
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,680
Not if I find you first.

1303
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,356
Come on, all right... Okay. Okay.

1304
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,695
Ow! Ow! Jesus!

1305
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,990
-What the hell are you doing?
-Trying to save you!

1306
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,496
Charissa.

1307
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:21,042
Come on, you know we're innocent.
You know this.

1308
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,170
You're lying. Like you lied in Baghdad.

1309
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:27,173
I did not know.
I knew nothing about the plates.

1310
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,425
At that... At that time.

1311
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,969
You are completely full of shit!

1312
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,471
Will you stop selling yourself on that

1313
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,181
and avoiding the fact that you lied to me!

1314
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,349
-You're the one that misled me.
-When?

1315
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,518
-Come on. You wanna go there?
-Yeah, let's go there.

1316
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:40,394
You heard I was a player
and you wanted to play.

1317
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:42,647
And then I got serious and you freaked!

1318
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,899
-Oh, I freaked? I did not freak!
-Yes, you did.

1319
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,528
You panicked and you ran.

1320
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,369
Charissa, come on.

1321
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:59,664
I'm a federal fugitive.
You know exactly how wanted I am.

1322
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:03,834
You think I came to Frankfurt
to hash out some old heartbreak? No!

1323
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:07,380
I'm here because we didn't do this.
I'm here because we were set up.

1324
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:11,092
I'm here because, in the end,
the truth is worth the risk.

1325
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,306
And I believe in you,
even if you don't believe in me.

1326
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,480
God, I forgot how beautiful you are.

1327
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,862
Hold on to that phone.

1328
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,376
OH MY GOD!

1329
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,586
HE'S GOT A GUN!

1330
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,087
RIGHT THERE! HE'S GOT A GUN!

1331
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,880
A GUN!

1332
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,340
Sucker.

1333
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,136
-Oh, shit.
-Where's Peck?

1334
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,222
Excellent question. Find him!

1335
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:01,559
Please stay calm
and go to the nearest exit.

1336
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,090
Meet you up on corridor three.

1337
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,430
Three to base. We're all clear at this time.

1338
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:44,310
Give me confirmation
as soon as the package is secure.

1339
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:49,106
We need a video feed.

1340
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,295
Okay, let's dance.

1341
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,881
Coming down. Positions, prepare to move.

1342
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,467
As always, stay close to me, sir.

1343
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:33,150
Closing off the 10th floor.

1344
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:37,780
Tenth floor, we need backup.

1345
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:39,657
Get back! Get back!

1346
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:41,242
I can't see anything.

1347
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:42,660
How we doing there, big man?

1348
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:44,412
Murdock, here comes the Arab.

1349
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,163
And here's a long drive

1350
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,165
hit deep into left center field.

1351
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:52,211
Murdock's back, he's at the wall,
and he makes the catch!

1352
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,505
I can't breathe.

1353
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,674
It's a trap!

1354
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:00,803
Pete, we need backup!

1355
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:18,028
B.A., I lost the case.

1356
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,489
I'm taking fire. I'm out of here.

1357
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,167
B.A., get to those plates.

1358
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,559
Deutsche Federal is responding
to explosions and shots fired

1359
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,770
-at the Königsbank building.
-Get us out of this mess and get us

1360
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,939
-to that building as soon as possible.
-Yes, ma'am.

1361
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,213
You made me work for this one, Baracus.

1362
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,049
I didn't think I was this out of shape.

1363
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,301
I am, unfortunately.

1364
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:06,387
Where's the rest of the team, huh?

1365
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:10,641
Smith. Peck. That idiot pilot, the asshole.
What's his name?

1366
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:20,317
I'm gonna take this one out of your ass,
Baracus. Let's see what you got.

1367
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,699
Come on. What are you doing?
What, are you tired?

1368
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:27,950
I'm not gonna hurt you, man.

1369
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:30,035
No, you're not gonna hurt me,
I'm gonna hurt you.

1370
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,710
-l don't wanna kill you, man.
-You don't wanna kill me?

1371
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,712
You're not gonna kill me.
I'm gonna kill you, Baracus.

1372
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:40,921
I'm not playing with you, Pike.

1373
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:44,049
Here we go, because I got two guns.
I'm a lefty, remember that, right?

1374
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,510
So, as soon as
that hammer goes back, it's on.

1375
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,304
I swear to God, I'll do it.

1376
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,389
You're not a coward, are you?

1377
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,100
Are you?

1378
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,272
Whoopsy.

1379
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,440
Damn!

1380
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,108
-Need a ride, big fella?
-You're a life-saver, man.

1381
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:02,276
I couldn't shoot him.

1382
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,203
Get out of the way! Get down! Get down!

1383
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,065
U.S. Military!
Put them down. Put them down.

1384
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:45,152
This is U.S. Military. We got him.

1385
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,155
Yeah, this is about
the right amount of cops.

1386
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,367
That's cute.
You're lucky there are people around.

1387
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:54,244
No, sweetheart, you're lucky.

1388
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,920
You eat that cold?

1389
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:04,672
Any way I can get it.

1390
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,424
There's a leak in the roof.

1391
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:08,509
There's a lot of them.

1392
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,095
Is that them?
I got it.

1393
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,851
All right. Not a peep out of the Arab.

1394
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:19,770
Sosa was at the train station.

1395
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:22,106
-You saw her?
-Yeah.

1396
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,149
Did you talk to her?

1397
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:26,944
I had no choice, okay?
Just trust me on that.

1398
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:29,863
I trust you
to make historically bad decisions

1399
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:31,365
as far as women are concerned.

1400
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,784
What part of you
is thinking at the moment?

1401
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,120
Lynch's men moved in on her
and I had to react.

1402
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:37,579
That's why you wanted me there
in the first place...

1403
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:39,748
To stop them! Not to engage her!

1404
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,250
I couldn't do one without the other.

1405
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,878
Please. Somehow I doubt that.

1406
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,798
Hey. What are you so pissed about?
We got the plates.

1407
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:50,217
You wanted her teed up. She's teed up.

1408
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:52,636
She knows we didn't steal them.

1409
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,973
She'll be thrilled to find out who did.

1410
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:58,892
What?

1411
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:07,234
You had to know.

1412
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:15,242
You had to know if you left me alive,
that this was coming.

1413
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,125
How could you not?

1414
01:30:28,882 --> 01:30:35,429
You taught me almost everything I know.

1415
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:40,601
Hannibal. You know who this is?

1416
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:53,447
We all do.

1417
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:58,869
Morrison?

1418
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,829
Hell, no.

1419
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,499
Jesus Christ.

1420
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:08,545
Not so sure that it is a blessing,
but good hunting, my friend.

1421
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,382
Thank you.

1422
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:15,052
You son of a bitch.

1423
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,435
Morrison? Holy shit.

1424
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,944
You're not a general.

1425
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,404
How could you do this to him?

1426
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,740
How could you do this to us?

1427
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,827
You know nothing about leading men.

1428
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:44,706
I knew if Lynch helped me escape,
you had to be part of it.

1429
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:50,170
You and Pike were making a play
on those plates with Lynch,

1430
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:51,505
and you turned on him.

1431
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:53,924
The way you turned on us.

1432
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:56,343
Lynch was never gonna cut us in.

1433
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,764
He was gonna use us.

1434
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,268
He brought you on as insurance.

1435
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:08,021
He never thought you'd betray
your oldest living friend.

1436
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:11,775
I just hit first, Hannibal. I'm a fighting man.

1437
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,485
You're a liar and a traitor!

1438
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,863
Then don't draw this out. Kill me.

1439
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:18,490
That's a fantastic idea!

1440
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,117
Whoa! Whoa!

1441
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,119
Bos, let me do this.

1442
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:24,746
Face, I ain't killing nobody.

1443
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:27,958
You're not, Bosco. I am.

1444
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,210
No matter what he says,
do not kill him, okay?

1445
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:32,045
You guys don't wanna watch?
Just turn your heads.

1446
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,882
-I'm not gonna be party to it neither.
-l wanna kill the son of a bitch, too,

1447
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,258
but he's our ticket out.

1448
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,468
He knows what he's talking
about for once. Listen to him.

1449
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:41,430
-Face, he is our only evidence.
-Murdock, Murdock...

1450
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:42,848
Do you understand?
He put us here.

1451
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:45,851
You can blow his head off
after he testifies, okay?

1452
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:46,894
He's ruined it!

1453
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:48,520
Think what you're doing, Face.
All right.

1454
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,314
If you can't handle it...
Boys, enough.

1455
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,693
Enough! That's enough, Face.

1456
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:57,070
Enough! Step down!

1457
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,822
Everybody outside.

1458
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:00,532
I got him.

1459
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,327
- I don't want you to have to do it.
- Face, outside.

1460
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:05,495
Stand down, soldier.

1461
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:08,165
Face. Now!

1462
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,626
- Fucking stupid.
- You okay, man?

1463
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,589
You knew Morrison
was masquerading as the Arab.

1464
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,841
Why not share that?
I wasn't 100% sure.

1465
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:19,426
How about 99%?

1466
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:22,262
Would you think
it was worth mentioning then?

1467
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,306
Lynch, what did you think?

1468
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:26,600
You think I'd just kill him on the spot?

1469
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,102
I was certain of it. I still am.

1470
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:31,104
Do you have the plates?

1471
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:32,856
I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't.

1472
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:38,320
Smith, return the plates, kill Morrison,
and reclaim your lives.

1473
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:41,573
I want signed and authorized
amnesty agreements

1474
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:44,076
for myself and for each of my men.

1475
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,119
From the White House,
the State Department

1476
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:48,246
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1477
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,831
You hear me?

1478
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:53,752
I'm gonna need a little more time.

1479
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:56,338
How much?

1480
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:03,887
Give me five minutes.

1481
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:05,889
I'm waiting.

1482
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:17,693
Don't you get it, Hannibal?

1483
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,405
We fight for them, we bleed for them,
we die for them...

1484
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,198
They don't give a rat's ass.

1485
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,325
Death and destruction,

1486
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,704
they're selling it like it was on
the goddamn commodities exchange.

1487
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:31,665
Don't push this off on them.
This is not about them.

1488
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:35,502
Your war protest was
stealing billions of dollars!

1489
01:34:36,963 --> 01:34:37,963
Who are you?

1490
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:40,590
I am a general. You are a colonel.

1491
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:44,344
I say, "Jump," and you say, "How high?"
End of story.

1492
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:45,429
It is now.

1493
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,601
I saw your tomb at Arlington.

1494
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:55,772
You died a national hero.

1495
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:09,995
Death's too easy.

1496
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:13,206
And the last thing we need now
is another lie.

1497
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:16,334
Don't do this. Hannibal, please.
You owe me that much.

1498
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,003
You owe me!

1499
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:20,589
You're gonna tell them we're innocent.

1500
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:24,134
You owe me.

1501
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:28,055
Hannibal, it's meaningless.

1502
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:31,224
What are you fighting for now,
you and those boys?

1503
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:34,102
Your ranks? Your reputations?

1504
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:35,270
They're shit!

1505
01:35:36,022 --> 01:35:37,647
You're convicts!

1506
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:41,109
Plates, no plates, you are federal fugitives,

1507
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:44,988
and when they're done with you, Hannibal,
they just fucking burn you.

1508
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:50,035
Zulu one, Zulu one, this is Broadsword,
you're clear to engage.

1509
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,454
"Broadsword."
Did you come up with that?

1510
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:54,915
That's awesome. "Broadsword."

1511
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,666
"Broadsword."

1512
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:00,754
Boss, could you do that?

1513
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,008
To us?

1514
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:07,177
What Morrison did?

1515
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,013
No. Not in a million years.

1516
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,558
Yeah, but you didn't see it coming, though.

1517
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,477
How long did you know it was him?

1518
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:16,853
Are you guys crazy?

1519
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:19,606
I know you are, but, Face,
are you accusing him?

1520
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,191
Hey! Hey!

1521
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:26,029
I'd rather face a firing squad
than betray you boys.

1522
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:27,906
Don't let this tear us apart.

1523
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:29,574
Not now.

1524
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:32,786
Not when we need each other
like no other time before.

1525
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,709
Move!

1526
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:54,558
Wow. That's awesome.

1527
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:57,352
That looks exactly like Call of Duty,
doesn't it?

1528
01:36:57,562 --> 01:36:59,604
All right. Here's the deal. No press release.

1529
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,982
Keep local law enforcement
and media off-site.

1530
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,568
Get a three-mile cordon,
ditto the no-fly zone.

1531
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:09,114
Get an agency scrub team out there
and get me the goddamn plates back.

1532
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:15,162
The German police have your entire team
in custody in the Königsbank Tower.

1533
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:20,876
I don't do teams, babe. That's Smith's bag.
I'm strictly a solo act.

1534
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:32,053
I like to travel light.

1535
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:36,600
Stuff like loyalty doesn't fit
in the overhead bins.

1536
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:40,896
I thought you and Smith
were working together.

1537
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:43,106
You thought wrong.

1538
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:46,568
Yes, we have weapons.
No, you may not wand us.

1539
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:50,739
If you want to deal, we can deal.

1540
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:55,785
How about I dedicate my immediate future

1541
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,413
to destroying yours?

1542
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:02,667
How about you get smart and start dealing

1543
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:05,212
before somebody else does?

1544
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:08,632
Former Captain.

1545
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,884
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1546
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,720
Unless you've got a piece of paper
that looks exactly like this one,

1547
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:16,890
then this troubled young loner
belongs to me.

1548
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,266
Let's go.

1549
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:20,810
How the hell
did they get an extradition order?

1550
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:23,688
Sorry, Pike.
At least with me, there are rules.

1551
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:26,691
CIA's got rules.
Our rules are just cooler than yours.

1552
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,152
-Go.
-You know, Lynch,

1553
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:32,822
if I could seal this room with you inside,
I'd be doing the world a big favor.

1554
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,075
That's not nice.

1555
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,202
Lynch? Had to be.

1556
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,747
Stay close to the fires, boys.

1557
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:44,542
If that gunship is still around,
it won't read our body heat.

1558
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:48,838
That idiot Lynch, so quick to kill us,
didn't even bother locating the plates.

1559
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:51,925
Where do we stand
on the non-violence now, B.A.?

1560
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:54,010
You pissed? You should be.

1561
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:57,514
Who gives a shit about the plates?
Morrison was the only way to clear us.

1562
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,183
And without Morrison, we got nothing.

1563
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:04,020
-What do we do, boss?
-l don't know, Murdock.

1564
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,356
-l don't know.
-l do.

1565
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:11,903
This guy Lynch,
l think I got him figured out.

1566
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:14,531
-You got a plan, kid?
-How do we get out of here?

1567
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,325
Give me 20 minutes.

1568
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:25,667
So, Morrison's dead.
Smith and his team are dead.

1569
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:28,795
Another 1 5 minutes or so,
we locate those engraving plates.

1570
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:30,422
What is this? Are you gloating?

1571
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:33,883
No, this is me beating you
after you burned me.

1572
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:36,303
-We had a deal, remember?
-Not you and me.

1573
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,138
-You, me and Morrison.
-Not you and me, directly.

1574
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:40,807
And you two collude and cut me out.

1575
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:44,686
Hey. What are you doing? In the car?

1576
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,271
Are we doing...
Are we gonna do this in the car?

1577
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:48,440
You doing this?
He's gonna do it.

1578
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:51,026
Way to go.
That's brilliant, right there.

1579
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:52,777
What are you doing? What is he doing?

1580
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:54,571
-Jesus.
-How's it going, Kyle?

1581
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,740
-You all right?
-I'm good.

1582
01:39:56,866 --> 01:39:59,617
Brother, you are far from good.
What are you doing?

1583
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:01,661
It's a European silencer.

1584
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:05,081
It's a suppressor. Counter-clockwise.
You're holding a gun like that?

1585
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,000
You've held a gun like that before
and you're still here?

1586
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:08,585
That's amazing.

1587
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,337
-Don't point that thing...
-Jesus. Final request,

1588
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:12,005
don't let this guy shoot me, please.

1589
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,513
So, if Sosa knows we're alive...

1590
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:23,058
She'll believe
Morrison is alive, too.

1591
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:26,102
Let's just hope that Lynch
still has Sosa's comm lines.

1592
01:40:29,607 --> 01:40:31,066
This is Sosa.

1593
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:33,777
General Morrison
is in my possession.

1594
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:37,447
What? I'm sorry.
I can't hear you. Who is this?

1595
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:40,742
Okay, this was not well thought out.
No shit.

1596
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:42,702
I mean, look at this.
Am I to teach you how to kill me?

1597
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:44,496
Hey, do me a favor, all right?
Put the barrel...

1598
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,039
Put the gun flush to my head.

1599
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:47,874
Are you sure?
There you go, right there.

1600
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:51,378
-Is that going to go through?
-Before you hurt somebody besides me.

1601
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:52,754
There you go. We're okay. We're okay.

1602
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,674
Never cuff a man in a seated position
with his hands behind his back.

1603
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:58,593
Makes it impossible to see the hands.

1604
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:00,178
That was cool.

1605
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:02,222
-You like that?
-l like that.

1606
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:03,890
I like that a lot.

1607
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:05,683
Are you all right, you idiot?

1608
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:08,645
-Yeah. it was a good hit.
-Please handcuff him.

1609
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,647
We don't need to use them again.
We don't need the cuffs.

1610
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,898
Who are you talking to?

1611
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:12,941
-Brad, phone or gun.
-Jesus.

1612
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:15,735
Phone or gun. Pick.
Hey, hey.

1613
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,364
-Put the gun down.
-Hey, I didn't burn you. Morrison did.

1614
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:20,740
I really wanna shoot you.

1615
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,826
You gotta hear this, sir.

1616
01:41:22,993 --> 01:41:24,536
Is this Smith?

1617
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,413
From a former colonel
to a former captain,

1618
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:30,542
l know I've got about 30 seconds
before you lock this signal.

1619
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:33,753
-So listen, we can prove our innocence.
-Leave that on the floor like that?

1620
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,256
Okay. All right. Now, go back.

1621
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,925
Did you say you have Morrison?
You have General Morrison?

1622
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:41,136
-Correct.
-You have him alive?

1623
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:44,973
And well, despite Lynch
trying to wipe us out wholesale.

1624
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,352
Too much to explain now
but Morrison's testimony frees us

1625
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,271
and fries Lynch.

1626
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:54,524
Uh-oh.

1627
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,401
Well, not without the plates.

1628
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:58,319
Also in my possession.

1629
01:41:58,571 --> 01:42:02,448
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead,
and I want to keep it that way.

1630
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:03,992
All right. We'll deal.
Give me a pen.

1631
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:05,535
-Where and when?
-Got a pen? Anybody got a pen?

1632
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,912
LA docks, 48 hours, dawn.
You still use a pen?

1633
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:11,958
I deliver Morrison and the plates.

1634
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:16,004
In return, I want a retrial
in front of a civilian court.

1635
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:18,673
All right. We'll deal.

1636
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,509
LA docks, 48 hours from now.

1637
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:25,305
Any bullshit from your end,
and that's it, deal's off.

1638
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:30,476
-Did we get him?
-No.

1639
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:34,439
Pike.

1640
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:37,358
You believe in second chances?

1641
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:38,568
Uh...

1642
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:40,403
I do now.

1643
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:42,488
Too much?

1644
01:42:42,948 --> 01:42:44,866
I thought you were spot-on.

1645
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,411
My turn.

1646
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:00,924
Hold on to that phone.

1647
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:10,808
This is Sosa.

1648
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,268
Hello, beautiful.

1649
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:14,270
Thank you.

1650
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,448
They got the raw end of the deal,
didn't they? Look at B.A.

1651
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:27,659
He looks like a huge banana.

1652
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:30,078
Good morning, my friend.

1653
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:31,162
Good morning.

1654
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:38,211
Rabbi Binky Rabinowitz?

1655
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:42,840
What passport did I give you?

1656
01:43:42,925 --> 01:43:45,385
You're from Tanzania.
My mother is from Tanzania.

1657
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:46,970
-Oh, shit.
-What the hell happened?

1658
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:59,357
...converting Africans to Judaism.
This is station six...

1659
01:43:59,441 --> 01:44:00,483
Stuff like that.

1660
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:03,027
Let's get ready to move.
There's three to my right.

1661
01:44:03,112 --> 01:44:04,821
There's two behind me
and one at the northeast exit.

1662
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:10,743
Wait a sec.

1663
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:15,999
Shalom.

1664
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:22,839
-What's he doing?
-it's Murdock. Telling his life story.

1665
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,427
There is a God.

1666
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:29,929
-You speak Swahili?
-You don't?

1667
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,181
You got enough
to work with, kid?

1668
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:33,266
We will.

1669
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:36,978
You and I have some major favors
moving across the mid-Atlantic right now.

1670
01:44:37,062 --> 01:44:40,106
It's a deep-sea freighter,
shipping strictly black-market merch.

1671
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:41,774
How do we get out to her?

1672
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:43,359
A boat. A plain old boat.

1673
01:44:43,444 --> 01:44:46,195
This is what I'm talking about, Murdock.
Traveling the open seas in style.

1674
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,741
This is the way I like to travel. Classy-like.
The way people used to, safe.

1675
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:50,908
-Yeah...
-We don't need a plane.

1676
01:44:50,993 --> 01:44:54,203
You know, Bosco, hopefully one day
we'll get you over your fear of flying.

1677
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:55,371
What?

1678
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:58,124
Hey, that ain't a boat!

1679
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,711
Just not today.

1680
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:04,547
Murdock, don't you remember what I said?

1681
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:06,299
-l said you have to catch him...
-You have to catch him...

1682
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,468
-...after you inject him.
-...after you inject him.

1683
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:11,804
My bad.

1684
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:41,376
Damn it! My head, man.

1685
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:49,467
-Coconut-curry tapenade, your favorite.
-Give me that, fool.

1686
01:45:49,885 --> 01:45:51,928
You get them toast points?

1687
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:54,514
Voilà. Toast points.

1688
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:59,227
Y'all knocked me out again, huh?

1689
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:03,189
Okay, now, the whole injection,
knocking out,

1690
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:05,691
Hannibal and Face.

1691
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,820
The curry tapenade, Murdock.

1692
01:46:09,113 --> 01:46:11,906
Why do I feel like I fell on my face?

1693
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,117
Huh? Tell me that.

1694
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:17,203
Uh...

1695
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:19,664
Lynch is a paradox.

1696
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:21,624
Murdock, you done with that?

1697
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:26,212
This is a guy who needs anonymity,
but he loves theatricality.

1698
01:46:27,756 --> 01:46:30,216
He's an administrator,
he's not an operator.

1699
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:34,971
Where is it?

1700
01:46:36,807 --> 01:46:38,015
Very nice.

1701
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:41,769
So he stays as far away
from the point of impact as possible,

1702
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:44,188
and never gets his hands dirty
if he can help it.

1703
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:45,815
But we're gonna change all that.

1704
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,567
You can't hustle a hustler, fool.

1705
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:54,073
No sparks, no flames,
not even a flashlight near this stuff.

1706
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:55,658
Easy, easy.

1707
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:59,912
This guy is never
at the flashpoint of anything.

1708
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:05,209
He's safe and sound somewhere,
pulling the strings.

1709
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,379
Mama. Mama.

1710
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,756
Hey, boss. Why so many
of these damn things anyway?

1711
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:13,885
Because overkill is underrated, my friend.

1712
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:19,265
So we're gonna bring this guy
down to ground level.

1713
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:20,725
Mama. Mama.

1714
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:23,102
This way, Lynch. Lynch.

1715
01:47:24,188 --> 01:47:26,731
The last place he'd ever want to be.

1716
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:33,029
Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1717
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:35,531
Any questions?

1718
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,244
What's up, boss man?

1719
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:41,704
Hey, B.A.

1720
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:44,081
It's gonna get heavy, isn't it?

1721
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:48,377
Well, I can't promise you it won't.

1722
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:51,589
Let me read you something real quick.

1723
01:47:51,673 --> 01:47:55,718
"Victory attained by violence
is tantamount to defeat,

1724
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,679
"for it is momentary."

1725
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:01,474
Gandhi.

1726
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:06,312
"it is better to be violent
if there is violence in our hearts,

1727
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,732
"than to put on the cloak of non-violence
to cover impotence."

1728
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:13,819
Who said that?

1729
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:15,446
Same guy.

1730
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,992
Gandhi wasn't afraid to fight
for the things he believed in.

1731
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,246
What is it you believe in, B.A.?

1732
01:48:41,098 --> 01:48:46,352
For life is but an opera

1733
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:51,315
it's off, isn't it?

1734
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:53,442
I think it's higher.

1735
01:48:57,072 --> 01:48:58,072
No, it's good. it's not that, Murdock.

1736
01:48:58,156 --> 01:48:59,615
Face, what's wrong? Come on, man.

1737
01:49:00,284 --> 01:49:02,994
I don't know, man.
I'm just thinking past this.

1738
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:07,248
You know, we've always come back alive,

1739
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:11,043
the four of us, 'cause of the old man.

1740
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:12,461
-l know.
-I'm not him.

1741
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:14,130
Face, I know this.

1742
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,340
Murdock, I'm not Hannibal.

1743
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:20,970
Who has the most to lose on this, Face?

1744
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:22,513
Me.

1745
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:25,474
And I trust you.

1746
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:29,770
Yeah, I know,

1747
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:32,148
but you're crazy.

1748
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:38,487
Not that crazy.

1749
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:58,174
Our eagles may have landed.

1750
01:49:58,258 --> 01:49:59,383
Everybody ready to roll?

1751
01:49:59,468 --> 01:50:00,760
Copy.
Team one on the move.

1752
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,553
Acknowledged.
Team two en route.

1753
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:12,313
All right, guys, everybody ready?

1754
01:50:13,148 --> 01:50:14,857
Curtain's about to come up.

1755
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:18,319
Show time.

1756
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:25,785
That's Smith right there. Watch him.

1757
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:29,664
Ground team is in position?

1758
01:50:29,748 --> 01:50:31,165
Standing by.

1759
01:50:32,668 --> 01:50:33,793
In position.

1760
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:38,047
Shoot Team One. Affirmative.

1761
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:39,882
Spotter One. 10-8.

1762
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:42,259
Let's chatter mark on comms for now.

1763
01:50:42,344 --> 01:50:45,054
Morrison's the primary tango.
Plates are the package.

1764
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,140
Yeah.

1765
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:51,686
Okay, okay, he's talking to Sosa.
I want this call.

1766
01:50:51,853 --> 01:50:53,688
You lied to me, Sosa. We had a deal.

1767
01:50:53,772 --> 01:50:55,856
I want that goddamn call in my...
Thank you.

1768
01:50:55,941 --> 01:50:58,109
We had a deal,
but I'm changing the deal.

1769
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:00,194
Are you kidding me, Sosa?
Are you kidding me?

1770
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:03,280
This is a complicated exchange
and you have no play here.

1771
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:05,491
Listen, or remain at-large fugitives

1772
01:51:05,575 --> 01:51:07,660
-for the foreseeable future.
-Uh-oh. No! No, no.

1773
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:10,079
For God sakes,
I've got Morrison here and the plates.

1774
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:12,581
I'm exposed, Sosa. Exposed!

1775
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:14,333
We're not doing this on the docks.

1776
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:16,043
Now listen to me,
we're not turning ourselves in.

1777
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:18,671
Now you listen to me,
we're not turning ourselves in.

1778
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:21,090
I need you to do it on my terms
or nothing at all.

1779
01:51:21,174 --> 01:51:23,008
To hell with that,
and to hell with you, Sosa!

1780
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:24,218
Ah. She burned him.

1781
01:51:24,302 --> 01:51:27,847
Face, B.A., we're bugging out.
Sosa's jammed us.

1782
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:30,891
Murdock, get the chopper down here in 10.

1783
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:34,353
Okay, he's moving him.

1784
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:35,688
You got him? He's moving him.

1785
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:37,481
For the love of God, relax.

1786
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,775
I am relaxed. He's moving him.

1787
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,735
Don't do this. Hannibal, please.

1788
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,864
-That's Morrison, right there. Take him.
-Wait, does he have the plates?

1789
01:51:44,948 --> 01:51:46,365
Smith has the plates. Go now.

1790
01:51:46,450 --> 01:51:49,160
-Take him, he's right there. Kill him.
-I've got Morrison, taking a shot.

1791
01:51:51,746 --> 01:51:54,248
A little too close for comfort, kid.

1792
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:55,624
What just happened?

1793
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,168
What the hell is he doing?

1794
01:51:57,627 --> 01:51:59,295
Where are they?
Somebody talk to me.

1795
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:01,338
Come on,
did that thing crush them or what?

1796
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:06,051
This was a hell of a lot easier
when it was just three plastic cups.

1797
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:13,184
Everybody just be cool. Pay attention.
No hasty moves.

1798
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:18,314
So, you beat a guy like Lynch
by drawing him in with three things.

1799
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:20,316
What the hell are they doing?

1800
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,525
Distraction.

1801
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,864
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1802
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,075
Diversion.

1803
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:37,124
This is a diversion!
Stay eagle on those containers.

1804
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:40,002
They're breaking for the exits! Open fire!

1805
01:52:40,086 --> 01:52:41,837
Do not engage! Back off!

1806
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,589
Ground teams, engage!

1807
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:48,761
Holy shit!

1808
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:55,851
Ground team, re-engage.

1809
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:57,603
You are being played by Smith.

1810
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:00,564
He's trying to draw your eye line, Lynch.
Come on, be smart.

1811
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:01,857
Take them! Take them!
Take them! Take them!

1812
01:53:04,903 --> 01:53:08,280
Contact! Tower house and bow!
It's Peck and Baracus!

1813
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,163
And division.

1814
01:53:17,999 --> 01:53:20,251
It's a trap! Pull back! Pull back!

1815
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:22,086
-Get the hell out of there!
-No, no, no.

1816
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:30,719
What is happening? What is going on?

1817
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:32,555
Nice one, kid.

1818
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:34,265
It's Peck and Baracus!

1819
01:53:34,349 --> 01:53:35,933
-Shoot them!
-Shut up! I know what I'm doing.

1820
01:53:36,017 --> 01:53:38,727
Okay, paintballers, time to go pro.

1821
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,607
B.A., get to your secondary position.

1822
01:53:45,694 --> 01:53:47,236
Okay. Game-changer.

1823
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,239
Here's what I think of your best-laid plans.

1824
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:53,409
Shit!

1825
01:53:57,372 --> 01:53:58,706
Jesus Christ!

1826
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,458
So much for the grand scheme, Smith.

1827
01:54:01,585 --> 01:54:02,668
What the hell was that?

1828
01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:04,545
Face, what the hell was that?

1829
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:07,673
Pike hit the ship with a SMAW!
He punched a hole in the hull!

1830
01:54:07,757 --> 01:54:09,174
What about the plan?

1831
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:11,719
Pike just blew up the plan!
We are ad-libbing!

1832
01:54:11,803 --> 01:54:13,178
Bosco, get out of there!

1833
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:14,597
I'm going for Hannibal.

1834
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:17,600
-Cover me. I'm going for those plates.
-Yes, sir.

1835
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:24,898
The boat is going over! Get out of there!

1836
01:54:24,983 --> 01:54:26,442
Bos, hang on!

1837
01:56:11,548 --> 01:56:13,173
Oh! Jeez!

1838
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:16,468
Shit.

1839
01:56:16,553 --> 01:56:19,930
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground.
I'm running low on ammo, man.

1840
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:33,569
Shit!

1841
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:35,904
How are you doing, handsome?

1842
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:38,657
Shit, can you cycle that weapon.
Nice work.

1843
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,617
Jeez, close friends and bullets.

1844
01:56:40,702 --> 01:56:42,077
Where are they when you need them?

1845
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:48,125
Don't take this too personally,
but look here,

1846
01:56:48,752 --> 01:56:51,003
smile, wait for the flash.

1847
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:55,674
Baracus.

1848
01:57:06,394 --> 01:57:08,687
Bosco!

1849
01:57:21,284 --> 01:57:22,493
Lynch.

1850
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:27,639
Lynch.

1851
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:35,881
Come on, Lynch.

1852
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:40,886
Lynch.

1853
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:45,974
Come on, Smith! Stop bullshitting.

1854
01:57:46,434 --> 01:57:48,727
Lynch. Come on, Lynch.

1855
01:57:53,233 --> 01:57:54,483
Lynch...

1856
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,527
Where am l?

1857
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:01,240
Come on, Lynch.

1858
01:58:04,077 --> 01:58:05,285
Lynch.

1859
01:58:06,037 --> 01:58:07,955
Where am l, Lynch?

1860
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,124
Come on, Lynch.

1861
01:58:11,209 --> 01:58:14,378
Lynch, Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

1862
01:58:15,922 --> 01:58:17,256
Lynch!

1863
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:36,108
There you are, Hannibal.
Been looking all over for you.

1864
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:39,278
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you.

1865
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:43,448
My muay Thai is pretty good.
My jujitsu is a little better, but...

1866
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:47,411
You had this whole sleight-of-hand thing
going with the containers

1867
01:58:47,495 --> 01:58:50,956
and the cars, and the fireworks.
"Lynch, Lynch, Lynch!"

1868
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:57,129
God, that's annoying.
But you give Pike a rocket.

1869
01:58:58,464 --> 01:59:00,549
There's your monkey wrench.

1870
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,050
Hannibal, don't do this.

1871
01:59:02,135 --> 01:59:06,388
You know, Smith, you could have
the best recipe in the world...

1872
01:59:06,472 --> 01:59:08,348
You owe me that much.
...but you drop a few bullets

1873
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:10,058
-into the batter...
-Hannibal, don't do this.

1874
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:12,311
Lynch, no!
Hannibal, please.

1875
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:13,729
Oh, God.

1876
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:17,608
...and that cake don't bake.

1877
01:59:17,692 --> 01:59:21,403
Uh-oh. Your witness,
your gun, your problem.

1878
01:59:24,616 --> 01:59:27,367
You served your country well. Excuse me.

1879
01:59:33,124 --> 01:59:36,043
Hello, Ben,
where have you been all my life?

1880
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:41,340
Look at us, Hannibal.
Couple of grown men.

1881
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:43,884
I'm bleeding. You're bleeding.

1882
01:59:44,052 --> 01:59:46,720
Don't get up.

1883
01:59:53,102 --> 01:59:54,770
God damn it!

1884
01:59:55,313 --> 01:59:58,148
Your muay Thai is as bad
as your jujitsu, Lynch.

1885
02:00:00,109 --> 02:00:02,069
Better stick with a gun.

1886
02:00:02,153 --> 02:00:05,405
You put a loaded weapon in my hand,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

1887
02:00:21,464 --> 02:00:23,799
I told you I would shoot you.

1888
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:26,969
Kevlar saved your life.

1889
02:00:27,303 --> 02:00:30,138
Thing is, it doesn't do much good
if I pop you in the head.

1890
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:32,349
It does if you melt it down.

1891
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:35,519
Hannibal, don't do this.

1892
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,771
Hannibal, please.
So, you beat a guy like that

1893
02:00:37,855 --> 02:00:39,815
by drawing him in with three things.

1894
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,901
-Distraction.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1895
02:00:42,986 --> 02:00:44,486
Diversion.

1896
02:00:44,988 --> 02:00:46,113
And division.

1897
02:00:49,575 --> 02:00:50,742
Hannibal, don't leave me alive.

1898
02:00:50,827 --> 02:00:53,829
Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1899
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,625
What the...

1900
02:01:13,224 --> 02:01:14,641
That's good.

1901
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:18,270
Surprise.

1902
02:01:19,856 --> 02:01:20,856
Agent Burress.

1903
02:01:22,066 --> 02:01:23,692
What did you call me?

1904
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:26,570
Agent Vance Burress?
Isn't that your name?

1905
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:29,197
At least that's the name I've got
on this warrant here,

1906
02:01:29,282 --> 02:01:33,452
and unless you have a piece of paper
that looks exactly like...

1907
02:01:34,162 --> 02:01:35,579
That's funny. That's what I said.

1908
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,205
She's quoting me.

1909
02:01:37,457 --> 02:01:39,166
Easy, easy.

1910
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:43,253
You're under arrest for attempted murder,

1911
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:45,297
violations of the Civil False Claims Act,

1912
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:48,884
and the theft of top secret
government engraving plates.

1913
02:01:49,218 --> 02:01:50,385
Easy.

1914
02:01:53,181 --> 02:01:55,140
I guess the plan went okay,

1915
02:01:55,224 --> 02:01:58,810
considering Pike did blow up the boat,
which I didn't account for at all.

1916
02:01:58,895 --> 02:02:00,896
Bullets didn't go through.

1917
02:02:01,898 --> 02:02:03,607
Hannibal, don't do this.
Hannibal, please.

1918
02:02:03,691 --> 02:02:05,692
How are you feeling, man?

1919
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:07,402
Not... Not good.

1920
02:02:07,487 --> 02:02:09,529
-What's wrong?
-Not good.

1921
02:02:10,031 --> 02:02:11,782
I feel sane.

1922
02:02:12,075 --> 02:02:14,326
I should have shot you in the head
a long time ago.

1923
02:02:14,535 --> 02:02:17,162
Is it crazy
that I'm feeling your anxiety right now?

1924
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:18,246
Do I look anxious to you?

1925
02:02:19,248 --> 02:02:20,248
You think I'm beaten?

1926
02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:23,585
I'm bleeding, I'm not sweating.

1927
02:02:23,795 --> 02:02:26,713
Let's take him out of here, guys.
Go ahead, princess.

1928
02:02:30,718 --> 02:02:34,471
What's the difference between
a concussion and a contusion?

1929
02:02:35,473 --> 02:02:38,016
It don't matter, bro. You tore up.
Murdock, that was beautiful.

1930
02:02:38,101 --> 02:02:39,684
You were right. The helmet worked.

1931
02:02:39,769 --> 02:02:41,770
Ketchup worked great.

1932
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,689
You did a great job. You okay?

1933
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:45,941
Yeah.
Got your bell rung?

1934
02:02:46,025 --> 02:02:49,694
Just let Hannibal
make the plans next time.

1935
02:02:50,196 --> 02:02:52,322
-Oh. Okay.
-Okay?

1936
02:02:52,657 --> 02:02:54,282
How's the conscience, big guy?

1937
02:02:55,993 --> 02:02:57,285
At peace.

1938
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,089
Keep it turning.

1939
02:03:09,966 --> 02:03:11,341
We already got them on the exits.

1940
02:03:11,425 --> 02:03:14,010
-We got a two-mile no-fly zone here.
-Which one of you is Sosa?

1941
02:03:14,095 --> 02:03:15,679
-l am. I am.
-l need to talk to Sosa.

1942
02:03:15,763 --> 02:03:17,514
As of right now your prisoner
is to be remanded

1943
02:03:17,598 --> 02:03:19,432
-into federal custody.
-l have a warrant for this man.

1944
02:03:19,517 --> 02:03:22,102
As of right now...
I'll tell you what... I'm a doc.

1945
02:03:22,186 --> 02:03:23,687
Let me doctor you up. Let me help you out.

1946
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:26,022
Do you need stitches?
Please tell me you need stitches.

1947
02:03:26,107 --> 02:03:27,524
I can stitch you up really good.

1948
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,485
Gentlemen.

1949
02:03:32,655 --> 02:03:33,989
The Central intelligence Agency

1950
02:03:34,073 --> 02:03:36,408
believes in and evinces
a profound moral ethic,

1951
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:38,743
as well as an unshakeable
professional standard.

1952
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:42,998
As such, we would like to extend
our most sincere apologies

1953
02:03:43,082 --> 02:03:44,499
for what's happened here.

1954
02:03:45,918 --> 02:03:48,795
-Good day and God bless.
-Where are you taking him?

1955
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:52,591
Who?

1956
02:03:57,763 --> 02:03:59,347
I never got your name.

1957
02:04:01,934 --> 02:04:03,602
My name is Lynch.

1958
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:07,063
Of course it is.

1959
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:11,026
Did he just say Lynch?

1960
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:16,781
Let it go.

1961
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:24,497
Hey. Do not touch me.

1962
02:04:25,333 --> 02:04:26,625
Take it easy, guys.

1963
02:04:26,709 --> 02:04:29,377
Everybody, stand down!
Stand down!

1964
02:04:29,462 --> 02:04:32,380
Get those plates.
Everybody, stand down!

1965
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:35,217
That's an order. Hey, you, stand down.
What is wrong with you?

1966
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:36,509
Lieutenant.

1967
02:04:36,594 --> 02:04:37,761
Sir, when did you arrive? I had no idea...

1968
02:04:37,845 --> 02:04:39,721
-Just give me a minute.
-Yes, sir.

1969
02:04:41,224 --> 02:04:43,308
Get your hands off me, tough guy.

1970
02:04:47,021 --> 02:04:50,315
Well, that's one hell of a mess.
But we did get the plates.

1971
02:04:51,734 --> 02:04:54,986
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to charge
you all with escaping lawful custody.

1972
02:04:55,071 --> 02:04:56,780
What? Hannibal,
what is this guy talking about?

1973
02:04:56,864 --> 02:05:00,575
B.A., we were wrongly convicted,
but it's still illegal to break out of jail.

1974
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:01,993
Director McCready, Smith and his team

1975
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:03,536
were instrumental
in recovering those plates.

1976
02:05:03,621 --> 02:05:07,707
They're still level-10 federal fugitives
and I need that off my desk.

1977
02:05:07,792 --> 02:05:09,793
This is chickenshit, sir.

1978
02:05:10,044 --> 02:05:12,295
Yeah, well, you know what?
Perhaps for them, it is chickenshit,

1979
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:15,757
but for you, Captain, we're re-promoting
you to your former rank.

1980
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:17,175
So, look, they're gonna be delivered

1981
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,802
to the U.S. Marshals Service
here in Long Beach.

1982
02:05:18,886 --> 02:05:20,720
-And there should be a C-5 transport...
-l understand, but...

1983
02:05:20,805 --> 02:05:22,097
...on the tarmac in half an hour.

1984
02:05:22,181 --> 02:05:24,599
-This needs to be done.
-This is really unfair, sir.

1985
02:05:24,892 --> 02:05:27,352
-This is bullshit.
-I'm like Harry Houdini.

1986
02:05:27,812 --> 02:05:29,062
I chew through your cuffs.

1987
02:05:29,146 --> 02:05:31,898
- Get up. Step up. Get in there!
- Step up!

1988
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:34,234
Let's go. Get moving.
Stop. Wait, stop.

1989
02:05:34,318 --> 02:05:36,027
Move it.
Wait.

1990
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:38,280
-This is so wrong.
-it got a little aggressive.

1991
02:05:38,364 --> 02:05:39,864
-Don't worry about it.
-This is really, really wrong,

1992
02:05:39,949 --> 02:05:42,450
and I'm going to do everything I can
to fix it.

1993
02:05:42,535 --> 02:05:45,120
-l know you will.
-I'm so sorry, Face.

1994
02:06:21,115 --> 02:06:22,699
Nice plan, Face.

1995
02:06:23,242 --> 02:06:27,037
Yeah. We just traded Lynches,
and we're going back to prison.

1996
02:06:27,163 --> 02:06:29,080
We returned the plates.
We can hold our heads high.

1997
02:06:29,165 --> 02:06:30,373
We did the right thing.

1998
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:33,626
Yeah, and look what they did to us.
This is some bullshit.

1999
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:35,879
They burned us again, Hannibal.

2000
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:38,798
We trusted the system and it turned on us.

2001
02:06:38,883 --> 02:06:42,010
Remember, boys, no matter
how random things might appear,

2002
02:06:42,094 --> 02:06:44,637
there is still a plan. Kid.

2003
02:06:45,514 --> 02:06:49,351
Well, I don't mean
to steal your line, boss, but...

2004
02:06:56,692 --> 02:06:59,611
Yeah.
I love it when a plan comes together.

2005
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:06,743
Still wanted by the government,

2006
02:07:07,286 --> 02:07:09,954
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

2007
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:14,250
If you have a problem,

2008
02:07:15,252 --> 02:07:17,253
if no one else can help,

2009
02:07:18,214 --> 02:07:20,215
and if you can find them,

2010
02:07:20,424 --> 02:07:22,217
maybe you can hire

2011
02:07:24,804 --> 02:07:26,262
the A-Team.

2012
02:12:07,419 --> 02:12:08,711
Yeah!

2015
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,079
