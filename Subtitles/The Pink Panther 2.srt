2
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,044
I now bring to your attention

3
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:45,713
one of the most stunning treasures
in the British Library's entire collection.

4
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,450
The Magna Carta.

5
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:01,098
And now, over here,

6
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:06,502
perhaps the most cherished
ancient artifact in the Western world.

7
00:01:07,244 --> 00:01:09,041
The Shroud of Turin.

8
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,359
The Imperial Sword!

9
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:45,072
Chief Inspector Dreyfus is here to see you.

10
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,013
- Chief Inspector.
- Sir.

11
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:50,014
I'm sure you know why you're here.

12
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:53,544
The British, the Italians and the Japanese
are assembling an elite squad

13
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:55,716
of their finest detectives,

14
00:01:55,792 --> 00:02:00,820
an international Dream Team
to track down this Tornado.

15
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:04,355
- And France will be represented?
- Exactly.

16
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:08,332
I am honored, but not surprised.

17
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:11,602
This is the culmination of my career.

18
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,208
The moment
that I've been waiting for all my life.

19
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:17,508
- No, no, no.
- Well, not all my life, perhaps...

20
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,445
- No, no.
- No. Nevertheless...

21
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:23,680
They want Clouseau, since he is
considered the top detective in the world.

22
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:28,122
We have been asked if Clouseau
is available to lead the Dream Team.

23
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,659
- Clouseau?
- Yes, yes.

24
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:39,197
- Is there something wrong?
- No, no, not at all.

25
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,261
Would you mind if I use your bathroom
just for a moment?

26
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,204
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

27
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:50,576
Clouseau.

28
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,963
I'm afraid, sir,
that Clouseau is currently occupied.

29
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,661
- What?
- I've assigned him to a mission

30
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:13,964
so important for our country

31
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:18,371
that I fear for our national security
if he was taken off it.

32
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:38,089
Clearly a violation.

33
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,387
Parking ticket.

34
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,930
What is this for?

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,437
Thirty-one centimeters from the curb,
nine centimeters too far.

36
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:54,466
Nine centimeters into
the seamy black underbelly of crime.

37
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:12,086
- You must take the ticket. Take it.
- Never!

38
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:14,753
You must take the ticket.

39
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:26,301
You're not wearing your seatbelt.

40
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:29,368
You are going to have to go
to traffic school.

41
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:38,686
Pardon me.

42
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,559
- Stop this car immediately.
- Okay.

43
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,285
Right.

44
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,883
- Are you finished yet?
- Complete and operational.

45
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:08,453
Chief Inspector,
your new system will monitor and record

46
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,022
every word and every movement
in this room.

47
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,159
So, if anyone breaks in, what happens?

48
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:17,866
Your office is linked to the elite
Black Berets. They will be here in seconds.

49
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,875
<i>Sir, Inspector Clouseau is here to see you.</i>

50
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:23,537
Send him in.

51
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:26,980
- Clouseau?
- I have to appoint him to the Dream Team.

52
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,917
- Clouseau?
- Don't ask, don't...

53
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:33,547
Good afternoon, Chief Inspector.
I'm here with my report.

54
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,290
This darn Medal of Honor.

55
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,987
You're so fortunate
you never got one, Chief Inspector.

56
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:44,056
You look so tidy having no honors
or other forms of distinguishing decor.

57
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:47,864
Why don't you wear it under your shirt,
you know, out of sight?

58
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:51,964
Brilliant idea, Chief Inspector.
That way it won't clang around.

59
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,136
Now, the parking ticket situation.

60
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:59,113
Over the last six weeks,
I've given out almost four parking tickets.

61
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:01,173
<i>One at the musée, overtime.</i>

62
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,449
And one, you'll recall, to you,
in violation of the bent-license-plate law.

63
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:09,082
- Yes, I recall.
- It's all there in the report.

64
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:12,025
Fascinating.
Well, I shall waste no time in reading it.

65
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:16,555
And just in case, I've deftly cataloged,
numbered and cross-referenced

66
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:19,465
each offense here in my little black book.

67
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:25,167
Now, Clouseau, you remember when I first
put you on that parking ticket detail...

68
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:28,176
Yes, you explained
it was a top level assignment.

69
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:32,908
And that if anyone ever asked you
if I was the one who had assigned you

70
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:36,679
to this incredibly important mission,
you would deny it.

71
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:42,350
Chief Inspector, I don't even know
what you are talking about.

72
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,026
Good work, Clouseau.

73
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:51,158
Now, to business.
I have been instructed to reassign you...

74
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:55,434
Clouseau?

75
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,106
Clouseau.

76
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,323
We were being recorded.

77
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:23,330
- The Black Berets.
- The password. What is the password?

78
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,663
- I don't know.
- Four, three...

79
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:28,169
- We weren't yet told.
...two, one.

80
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:30,936
Hamburger.

81
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,339
Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.

82
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:41,480
- The password was "hamburger"?
- No, "hamburger."

83
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:44,987
- I said "hamburger".
- No, you said "hamburger."

84
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:47,045
- Hamburger?
- Hamburger.

85
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:50,988
How did you know
that we were being recorded?

86
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,721
Easy, Inspector.

87
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:56,856
This pen emits a small beeping noise
whenever it detects microwaves.

88
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:59,527
- RadioShack. $12.
- What?

89
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:04,767
- How did you know the password?
- This little LED chip decodes passwords.

90
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:08,299
I had it attached to the back
of my Medal of Honor.

91
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:12,370
- RadioShack?
- EBay. I got this there, too.

92
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,719
- What do you think this is?
- A tape recorder?

93
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:23,355
No. It only looks like a tape-recorder.
It's actually a pen.

94
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,387
So you can write with it
and no one will know.

95
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:30,955
Bingo!

96
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:34,491
Now, you were saying, Inspector.

97
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:38,231
- You are being reassigned.
- Let me read your mind.

98
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:41,765
The Tornado is at large, and you want me
to protect the Pink Panther.

99
00:11:41,844 --> 00:11:42,902
- No.
- No?

100
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,072
It is my job to protect the Pink Panther.

101
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:48,275
You've merely been reassigned
to the Dream Team.

102
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:52,250
That is quite an honor,

103
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,846
- but I cannot accept.
- What?

104
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,824
If Inspector Clouseau
were to leave France,

105
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,157
the Tornado would surely strike
at the Pink Panther.

106
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:01,287
- I'm guarding it!
- But...

107
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:04,026
Don't argue.
You fly to Kyoto in the morning.

108
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,692
But I can't fly.

109
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,863
In a plane!

110
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:11,168
- But still...
- That's an order.

111
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,175
Nicole.

112
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,781
You are traveling?

113
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:31,384
Yes, Inspector Dreyfus is sending me
on a very dangerous mission.

114
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,726
- For how long? When will you return?
- I will return when the criminal is caught.

115
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:39,757
It could be a month, it could be a year.
You understand, Nicole.

116
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:44,161
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Of course, we will have to stay apart.

117
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,506
If the criminal were to, say, kidnap you,
he would have power over me.

118
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:51,812
Why would he have power over you?

119
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:58,276
Well, because, well,

120
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:01,817
you are like a brother to me.

121
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:06,923
A hot, sexy brother in a dress.

122
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:13,262
Nicole, I hope you have forgiven me
for that one evening.

123
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,861
Yes, Inspector, it is forgotten.

124
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:18,702
- I have not forgotten.
- Neither have I.

125
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:30,015
So, even though, technically,
we are on duty,

126
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:33,920
do you think it would be all right
to share a bottle of wine?

127
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,083
I think it would be all right.

128
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:39,753
Then I will select the wine.
It is one of my specialties.

129
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:46,766
I would like to select my own wine.

130
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:50,294
And by the way,
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

131
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:52,170
Remember this face.

132
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:56,102
- This is a very special bottle.
- Delicious.

133
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,185
<i>There was something about
burning down a restaurant</i>

134
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:15,121
<i>that ignited other, more illicit, fires.</i>

135
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:23,822
- And I'm sorry about that.
- As am I. Terribly remorseful.

136
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,391
It was a night to remember
that we must forget.

137
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,700
We must never forget to not remember it.

138
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:33,333
And if we do remember it,
we must immediately forget it.

139
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:37,573
Now, let's have
a professional hug goodbye.

140
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:46,882
I'll be right there.
I'll see you in several months.

141
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:51,222
- No problem.
- And I do hope your hearing improves.

142
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:01,732
Ponton,
I'm worried about my leaving France.

143
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:05,433
The Tornado is rampant.
The Pink Panther is such a temptation,

144
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:07,874
and no Clouseau to protect it.

145
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:11,709
But you visited the museum yourself,
you checked the security.

146
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:15,342
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yes, I suppose you're right.

147
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,882
- Are you driving?
- I like to stay in practice.

148
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,826
- Okay.
- Remind me where the brakes are.

149
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:31,491
- Here. Yes.
- There?

150
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,398
- Yes.
- And then you turn here.

151
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:34,561
- Of course, yes.
- All right.

152
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:35,695
- And this turns it.
- Yeah.

153
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,398
Okay, here we go.

154
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:43,743
- Ponton.
- Yes?

155
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:47,772
- This case is very strange.
- How so, Inspector?

156
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,341
For 10 years,
the Tornado terrorized Europe,

157
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:53,911
stealing over a quarter of a billion dollars
worth of artifacts.

158
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,685
Then, for no reason, he suddenly stops.

159
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,927
Maybe the Tornado thought
he had enough money.

160
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:04,762
If he had enough money, then why,
after 10 years of complete inactivity,

161
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,302
does he suddenly spring back into action?

162
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:10,736
London, the Magna Carta.
Italy, the sacred Shroud.

163
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:17,908
The Imperial Sword. Why now?
Why all of a sudden? Why? Why?

164
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,921
You need to calm down.

165
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:40,126
Hey!

166
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:51,069
What's the matter, Ponton?
You seem a little depressed today.

167
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:54,641
- Is it your wife again?
- Yes.

168
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:58,419
She still feels my job
takes up too much of my time.

169
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:01,122
The same old thing.

170
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,923
Next week is our 10th anniversary.
She thinks we should go away together.

171
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:08,793
Ponton, would you like me
to talk with her?

172
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:09,922
No.

173
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:14,333
I mean, this issue must be discussed
between husband and wife.

174
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:18,464
Well, you must explain to her
that we are men of the law.

175
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,735
Always living in the shadows.

176
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,508
Idiot.

177
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,576
I will miss you, Inspector.

178
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,916
I will miss you, too, Ponton.

179
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,687
- And, Ponton.
- Yes?

180
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:38,454
I am sorry you can't satisfy your wife.

181
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,992
"I am now leaving France."

182
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:47,531
This is a bad idea.

183
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,367
<i>The legendary Pink Panther Diamond
has been stolen.</i>

184
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:58,277
<i>Officials suspect the perpetrator
is the infamous Tornado.</i>

185
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,076
What'd I tell you?

186
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:04,650
<i>The theft of the Pink Panther would be
the fourth high-profile crime...</i>

187
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:08,413
Oh, my God! He was right.

188
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:14,587
The Dream Team was supposed to start
its investigations in Kyoto, Japan,

189
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:17,325
but it's just been diverted to Paris.

190
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:18,457
France is in shock.

191
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:22,129
The international Dream Team
of detectives will begin...

192
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:28,036
I'm standing outside the Grand Palais
where the Pink Panther has been stolen.

193
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,818
Why are they cheering?
This is a national tragedy.

194
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,583
We live in a media age.
You must learn to adapt.

195
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:43,488
Then adapt I shall.

196
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:56,937
- Who do you think did this, Inspector?
- Inspector, any comment?

197
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,134
Tornado, I'm coming to get you.

198
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,341
One more.

199
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,473
Tornado, I'm coming to get you.
There's your one.

200
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:15,850
Good afternoon, Inspector.
The other detectives have already arrived.

201
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,949
They are waiting for you.

202
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:21,886
- I'm sorry, I don't remember your name.
- What?

203
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:31,896
- Yes. I am Nicole.
- Yes, so nice to see you again.

204
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:33,737
You, too, Inspector.

205
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:38,674
Well, enough of this foreplay.
Where are the other detectives?

206
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,908
Yes, they're waiting inside.

207
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,443
I hope no one has
tampered with the crime scene.

208
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,078
A crime scene is like a code.

209
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:49,215
You decipher it,
and it will lead inexorably to the criminal.

210
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,818
That is why it must always be kept
in pristine condition.

211
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:08,136
Good day. I'm Inspector Jacques Clouseau
of the French Police.

212
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,207
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

213
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,771
And your name?

214
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,449
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

215
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,854
That is your name. I thought you were
ordering in Italian. Once again.

216
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:29,693
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

217
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:33,695
Don Corleone.

218
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:35,796
I'm Kenji Mazuto.

219
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:37,600
Kenji Mazel Tov.

220
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,436
Randall Pepperidge.

221
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:44,677
And this is my associate Gilbert Ponton,
and this is Nicole.

222
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:46,543
Nicole is here to service your needs,

223
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:49,550
so feel free to use her
in any way you wish.

224
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:54,817
And now there is a crime scene waiting.

225
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,252
Excuse me. "El sceno de crimo."

226
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:08,164
- That is not Italian, and I do speak English.
- Really? Prove it.

227
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:12,868
Gentlemen, we first have to determine
how the crime was committed.

228
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:15,808
And as I am an expert at deduction...

229
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,745
- You are an expert at deduction?
- That is my field.

230
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:24,184
I believe deduction is my field
and since you are experiencing hip pain...

231
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:25,618
How did you know that?

232
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:28,281
One side of the sole of your shoe
is worn more than the other.

233
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:30,689
You're favoring your right leg.

234
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,718
Tell me, did you enjoy
your double espresso this morning?

235
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:37,287
- How did you...
- Your pupils are noticeably dilated.

236
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:40,335
And will you be moving out
of the Hotel Montmartre?

237
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,700
They are doing construction at night
around the Montmartre

238
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:45,103
so as not to disturb daytime traffic.

239
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:48,940
From your puffy eyes,
I deduce you spent a sleepless night.

240
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:53,114
Speaking of traffic,
are you enjoying your Smart car?

241
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,916
Your trousers are wrinkled
behind the knees.

242
00:22:55,984 --> 00:23:00,011
And how do you think your favorite
football team, Arsenal, will do this year?

243
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,420
That matchbox is from
the only bar in Paris

244
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:04,425
that shows English football telecasts.

245
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:06,620
You have tissues in your shoes
to make you look taller.

246
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:09,823
You were 14 before you finally
learned to enjoy avocado.

247
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:13,732
Tell me, how did you enjoy
your trip to the airport this morning?

248
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:16,430
Now, how did you know that?

249
00:23:16,972 --> 00:23:20,271
- Perhaps one of you should begin.
- Yes, this is silly.

250
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:21,673
You've recently lost
your favorite cheese grater.

251
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:23,540
You have an aversion to cow bells.

252
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:26,137
Stop the insanity and look at this.

253
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:30,510
IL Tornado is not as careful as he thinks.

254
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:39,420
Fingerprint. With this small piece of glass,
the case is practically solved.

255
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:43,490
This one has a fingerprint.

256
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,000
This one has a fingerprint, too.

257
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,970
This one has a fingerprint.

258
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,872
You don't need that.
You have plenty of fingerprint evidence.

259
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,578
Guard that.

260
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:03,918
What do we know about this man,
this Tornado.

261
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:08,545
Well, we know that he's a white male
between 50 and 65,

262
00:24:08,624 --> 00:24:11,684
with a scar from a bullet hole
behind his right shoulder.

263
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,754
In 1996, the Tornado was shot right here
in France while trying to steal a gold vase.

264
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:21,735
Blood was found, and as a result,
his DNA has been on file for over 10 years

265
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:24,063
without a match.

266
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:30,541
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.
My flight was delayed.

267
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:33,012
You're Jacques Clouseau.

268
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:40,119
The Pink Panther detective.
This is such a thrill.

269
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,386
- And who is it that are you?
- I'm Sonia Solandres.

270
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:49,022
- Didn't anyone tell you that...
- Yes. I was informed.

271
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:52,032
- A last-minute addition to our team.
- That's right.

272
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,534
I've written a book
on the old Tornado crimes,

273
00:24:54,603 --> 00:24:57,504
but I'm not sure
if I'm really gonna be much help here.

274
00:24:57,572 --> 00:25:00,871
Technically speaking,
I'm not really a detective.

275
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:03,843
Welcome.
We can always use an extra mind.

276
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:06,972
Now, let me bring you up to speed.
We know nothing.

277
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,448
You are now up to speed.

278
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:16,550
<i>In world news today,</i>

279
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:21,153
<i>members of the Dream Team gathered for
the first time in front of the Grand Palais</i>

280
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:24,630
<i>to start their investigations
into the Tornado thefts.</i>

281
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,669
<i>Inspector Clouseau had this to say.</i>

282
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:31,900
<i>Tornado, I'm coming to get you.
There's your one.</i>

283
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:38,310
I was able to discover this Tornado
hacked the security system

284
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,783
from a remote location and turned off
all the alarms and surveillance scanners.

285
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:46,343
- Can you trace the source?
- Yes, but it will take time.

286
00:25:48,724 --> 00:25:52,660
- You are new here?
- Yes, hello. Mrs. Berenger.

287
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:55,390
- I know who you are, Inspector.
- Do you?

288
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:58,331
Due to the media frenzy
surrounding this case,

289
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,099
I've been assigned to instruct employees
on political and social correctness.

290
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:06,471
It's always nice
to have a very sexy woman

291
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:09,408
clomping around the building
in high heels.

292
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:17,983
- You must never refer to a woman as sexy.
- But I was complimenting you.

293
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:21,989
No, Inspector, you must not comment
on a woman's body.

294
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:27,256
- I get it. I get it. I keep it to myself...
- Yes.

295
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:31,823
...when I am thinking...
- Inspector.

296
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:37,267
This will be an exercise
and I want you to concentrate.

297
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:41,867
And no matter what I say,
I want your expression to remain neutral.

298
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:43,672
That will be easy.

299
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:46,306
You're here in the corridor
at your employment,

300
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:49,441
and you see a very pretty young woman
walking toward you,

301
00:26:49,518 --> 00:26:53,477
and her blouse is tight
and is rather bursting at the buttons,

302
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:55,045
and she drops her pencil,

303
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:58,490
and as she bends to retrieve it,
her blouse parts,

304
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,291
revealing the cleavage
of her soft, round, white mounds.

305
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:05,629
And then the pencil rolls around
and she bends again,

306
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,158
and her undulating buttocks
cause the short skirt to rise

307
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:12,138
just shy of the nooks and crannies.

308
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:21,371
I like you, Mrs. Berenger. I like you a lot.

309
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,215
So, I have made lunch reservations
at four different restaurants,

310
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:28,313
depending on who wants to eat where.

311
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,384
You know,
I cannot decide what is more beautiful.

312
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:36,426
Paris or you.

313
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:46,797
May I have a word in private?

314
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm worried that your hot Italian blood
might be leading you into an indiscretion.

315
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,774
Really?

316
00:27:56,852 --> 00:28:01,585
Yes, these attentions
you're paying to Nicole.

317
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:02,748
What?

318
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:07,693
I see. You and she, you like the...

319
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:11,163
Oh, no, no, no.
She and I are co-workers, nothing more.

320
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,700
So I'm not stepping on toes.

321
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:15,930
How could you, since she and I have
absolutely no feelings for one another.

322
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:19,804
Good, because I find her very alluring.

323
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:25,313
No. No. For a man like you, she's too drab.

324
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:30,476
- Drab?
- And she is disgusting.

325
00:28:30,552 --> 00:28:33,316
- Disgusting?
- Yeah, she's drab and disgusting.

326
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:34,980
I think you are wrong, Clouseau.

327
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:38,355
You see, you and I,
we are men of the world, no?

328
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:41,725
We've had all these
sexy and glamorous women, right?

329
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:46,661
Yes, in fact, I believe
you've made a conquest of your own

330
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:49,731
in Miss Solandres.

331
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,535
Clouseau, you are a lover.

332
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:03,112
And Nicole is a woman for a lifetime,
a woman to have the babies with.

333
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:06,642
- To have the babies?
- Yes, lots and lots of the babies.

334
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:09,948
All day long the babies.

335
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,019
All day long the babies?

336
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,592
Ponton.

337
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:21,101
That Italian and I have locked antlers.

338
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,627
We are like two angry stags
pawing at the ground.

339
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:26,298
Have we decided on lunch?

340
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:30,538
Well, I suppose you will be wanting sushi,
my little yellow friend?

341
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:34,406
What?

342
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:41,514
Inspector, we never refer to Japanese
people as "our little yellow friends."

343
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,525
- But why?
- Because it is a stereotype.

344
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:48,287
Inspector, are you prejudiced
against Asians?

345
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:51,594
Well, of course not.
Except when they drive.

346
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,928
Have you ever seen them drive?

347
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,128
They can hardly see over
the steering wheel.

348
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:58,661
- Inspector.
- Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Berenger.

349
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,574
I suppose I'm a bit of a dumb blonde
about this.

350
00:30:02,644 --> 00:30:06,273
- What?
- You must never refer to blondes that way.

351
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:09,010
- But they are so dumb.
- Oh, my God.

352
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:15,288
Were you just ogling her?

353
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,587
- No.
- Yes, you were.

354
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:19,752
I did not.

355
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:22,058
- You did.
- I did not.

356
00:30:22,731 --> 00:30:24,562
- You did it again.
- No, I didn't.

357
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:26,260
- Yes, you did. I saw it.
- I did not.

358
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:28,495
- No, you didn't.
- You did it.

359
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:31,904
- You did it again!
- No, I didn't.

360
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:32,997
- Yes, you did.
- I did not.

361
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:35,008
- Yes, you did.
- Oh, my God, look!

362
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,600
Oh, my God...

363
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,621
Ponton?

364
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:55,394
I had it out with my wife.

365
00:30:55,463 --> 00:30:58,523
I told her that she must not
question me about my work,

366
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,661
and that my home life must take
second place to my career.

367
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:07,174
Good for you. Congratulations!
You are now a real man.

368
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,437
So, then, can I stay here with you?

369
00:31:09,511 --> 00:31:12,412
- What?
- May I stay here? I got kicked out.

370
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:18,482
- Yes, I suppose. Temporarily.
- Thank you.

371
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:20,145
It's okay, boys.

372
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:24,481
What are these?

373
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:27,784
Ponton?

374
00:31:27,862 --> 00:31:32,390
They are my sons, Louis and Antoine.
They took my side of the argument.

375
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,957
And this is Jacques.

376
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:36,970
They named him after you.
They idolize you.

377
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:46,711
Uncle Jacques, what's that?

378
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,077
That is an award given to me
by the President of France.

379
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:54,516
Go ahead.

380
00:31:57,092 --> 00:32:00,892
- Is that the Pink Panther?
- No, it's a replica.

381
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:04,363
A copy given to me
for recovering the real diamond

382
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:06,195
and returning it to France.

383
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:08,895
Let's show Uncle Jacques what we won.

384
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:13,770
We won these in a competition
in karate school.

385
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:15,901
That is so cute.

386
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:21,040
Now, let me show you a real trophy.

387
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:26,816
One I won at a karate competition
just recently.

388
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:29,781
Wow!

389
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:32,088
- You like karate?
- We love it.

390
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,360
Remember, boys.

391
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:40,925
The secret to a successful karate attack
is the element of surprise.

392
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:51,541
- Good one.
- Thank you.

393
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:59,747
To find the Tornado,
we must consider his motives.

394
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:03,689
I'm worried that right now,
the thief is trying to sell the goods.

395
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:05,055
Right.

396
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:08,254
"Hey, buddy, do you want to buy
the Shroud of Turin?"

397
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:11,992
No. These items are too famous to be sold.

398
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:16,127
Only the Pink Panther can be cut up
and sold as smaller gems.

399
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:18,729
I suspect that's what he wants.

400
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,468
I have something.

401
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:28,141
This says the computer that hacked into
the museum is located in Rome.

402
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:31,679
- Rome?
- Yes. Is something wrong?

403
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:35,682
No. No. Rome means nothing to me.

404
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,292
I mean...

405
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,594
Rome? Do you know who lives in Rome?

406
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,901
- Alonso Avellaneda!
- The black market art dealer.

407
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:54,771
The man rumored to be
the Tornado's fence.

408
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:14,422
There's always been a suspicion

409
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:18,022
that Avellaneda's not just the Tornado's
fence, but the Tornado himself.

410
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,225
He is the right age.

411
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,530
Do we have a sample of his DNA?

412
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:25,061
Not yet, but we should be in Rome
in one hour.

413
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,004
Where is our pilot?

414
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:30,533
I don't trust any other pilot
for my plane but myself.

415
00:34:31,412 --> 00:34:32,845
Your plane.

416
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,883
Nicoletta,
would you like to be my co-pilot?

417
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:42,749
- Come.
- Okay.

418
00:34:55,937 --> 00:35:00,306
- Would I be disturbing you if I joined you?
- No, no. Please disturb me.

419
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,181
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said outside the museum,

420
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:10,911
about the psychology of the criminal.

421
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,084
The "why?"

422
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:18,354
Perhaps romantic disappointment.

423
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:24,190
A foolish young woman
who leaves a man for a younger man.

424
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:27,557
That could never happen.

425
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,731
But of course.

426
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:31,863
What a man such as that should do

427
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,037
is start a new romance
with someone more appreciative.

428
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:47,553
That is so funny. "Start a new romance."

429
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:52,116
I'm not quite sure what you mean,
but that is funny.

430
00:35:57,065 --> 00:36:01,934
It appears that Inspector Clouseau
does not find Miss Solandres drab.

431
00:36:06,674 --> 00:36:07,698
"Drab"?

432
00:36:07,775 --> 00:36:10,676
The very word
that he used to describe you.

433
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:14,039
- He called me drab?
- And disgusting.

434
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:16,548
Disgusting?

435
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,551
Thank you.

436
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:38,872
Hey, Ponton.
Tell me more about Inspector Clouseau.

437
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,637
He's a brilliant man, unorthodox, oblique.

438
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:45,404
But I can tell you
with absolute confidence,

439
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,176
he's the man who will solve this case.

440
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:51,013
Ponton-san, you are crazy.

441
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:56,354
If Clouseau solves this case,
I am perfectly willing to run around

442
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:59,723
like a bare-bummed idiot
wearing nothing but a tutu.

443
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:04,090
Well, let's talk about Avellaneda.

444
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:07,828
- What are his proclivities?
- He's an art connoisseur,

445
00:37:07,902 --> 00:37:09,529
but because of his questionable dealings,

446
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:12,334
he was thrown out of Spain
and must live here.

447
00:37:12,407 --> 00:37:15,638
You see?
He has squandered his reputation,

448
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,474
and he is forced to live in the woods
like an animal

449
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:20,605
with the shame of being a criminal.

450
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:25,482
If there is one absolute truth in this world,
it is that crime does not pay.

451
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,955
You say the bullet hole is
behind his right shoulder?

452
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:39,056
Yes.

453
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:43,661
Then all we have to do is figure out a way
to get him to remove his shirt.

454
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,539
I was half expecting you.

455
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:57,615
Are you the so-called "Dream Team"?

456
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:00,449
And who is it
who is inquiring of us who we are?

457
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:05,185
I am Alonso Avellaneda.
Is this more of that Tornado nonsense?

458
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:08,285
We shall see who is the one
who will be saying nonsensical things

459
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:10,694
that are something of nonsense.

460
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:19,596
Well, I suppose I must bow
to the inevitable.

461
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:22,768
Please, come inside.
I'll join you in a moment.

462
00:38:33,387 --> 00:38:34,786
Nicole.

463
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:39,953
While the Dream Team plays its
little games, I am going to snoop around.

464
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:46,665
Who cares?

465
00:38:50,271 --> 00:38:55,641
So, gentlemen and ladies,
please make yourselves at home.

466
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:58,743
Now, how can I help you?

467
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:02,579
<i>Señor Avellaneda,
where were you last Friday evening?</i>

468
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,346
Dining with my daughter and my ex-wife.

469
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,154
Don't believe me, call them.

470
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,780
Why call them?

471
00:39:09,857 --> 00:39:13,725
They already lied for you
on the stand 10 years ago.

472
00:39:13,794 --> 00:39:15,659
I am not the Tornado.

473
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,426
Do you mind
if I examine your computer system?

474
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:20,626
Be my guest. I have nothing to hide.

475
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:23,363
Sometimes things hide in plain sight.

476
00:39:28,876 --> 00:39:30,639
My security system.

477
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:45,216
Answer this question.

478
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:49,059
In the past, you admitted to dealings
with IL Tornado?

479
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,621
Yes, but that was 10 years ago.

480
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:54,930
Besides, I never saw his face.

481
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:58,301
How did you conduct these transactions
if you never saw his face?

482
00:39:58,372 --> 00:40:02,035
He was in disguise.
He always wore a mask.

483
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,101
Did you call him Zorro?
Or the Power Ranger?

484
00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:07,704
<i>Come, come, señor Avellaneda,
you expect us to believe</i>

485
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:10,580
that two grown men
do millions of dollars of business

486
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:12,551
with each other
and you never saw his face?

487
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,212
Perhaps I saw him once.

488
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,883
Did it look something like this?
Or this? How about this?

489
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:21,827
No, I've told you. I am not the Tornado.

490
00:40:21,896 --> 00:40:23,693
How did you pay him?

491
00:40:24,532 --> 00:40:27,433
With deposits into Swiss bank accounts.

492
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,833
Numbered. Untraceable.

493
00:40:31,706 --> 00:40:33,606
I understand.

494
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:37,872
Look, I know my answers
are less than satisfactory.

495
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,948
I realize that.

496
00:40:41,015 --> 00:40:43,381
Does this mean
I must spend the rest of my life

497
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:45,146
living under a cloud of suspicion?

498
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:47,847
- Forgive my intrusion.
- Yes.

499
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:50,516
There is one way to prove your innocence.

500
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:52,582
Back in 1996, while perpetrating a crime...

501
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,289
Yes, yes, yes. He received a bullet wound
in the shoulder.

502
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:00,358
Is this what it's come to?

503
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:05,265
That I must strip down
and remove my clothes

504
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,500
in the sanctity of my own home

505
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:12,012
before a group of people I've only just met
just to prove my innocence?

506
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,979
Well, it wouldn't hurt.

507
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:18,109
Fine. Let's get it over with, then.

508
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:32,956
I believe it was the right shoulder.

509
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:46,670
So I hope this proves beyond doubt
that I am not the Tornado.

510
00:41:46,747 --> 00:41:49,272
We will have to leave you in peace.

511
00:42:16,143 --> 00:42:19,601
He's already shown us his shoulders.
There is no wound.

512
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:22,679
He did?

513
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,254
- The man is guilty.
- There's no physical evidence.

514
00:42:28,322 --> 00:42:29,482
Clouseau!

515
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:32,720
He removed his shirt twice,
and there was no bullet hole.

516
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:35,694
Haven't you ever heard
of cosmetic surgery?

517
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,624
Yes. Of course you have.

518
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:50,805
Clouseau Inspector,
I even checked all the house's computers.

519
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:53,176
None of them are used
to hack into the museum.

520
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:54,509
Still...

521
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:58,347
Clouseau, can't you see
what's plain in front of you?

522
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:01,115
Your unrelenting stubbornness
is maddening.

523
00:43:01,188 --> 00:43:05,955
And I'm telling you I sense
the presence of the Tornado in that house.

524
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:16,926
They don't know anything.

525
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:21,333
That blasted bullet wound. It's my mark.

526
00:43:23,778 --> 00:43:25,678
One day they'll find me.

527
00:43:25,746 --> 00:43:27,839
You're in no danger, Laurence.

528
00:43:27,915 --> 00:43:29,940
This is all very strange.

529
00:43:31,185 --> 00:43:33,176
I even know one of them.

530
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:35,082
You do?

531
00:43:36,757 --> 00:43:38,748
- Which one?
- You know me.

532
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:42,156
Isn't it obvious?

533
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:50,503
Inspector, excuse me.

534
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:55,565
Are you familiar with a Spanish restaurant
here in Rome called La Plata de Nada?

535
00:43:55,643 --> 00:43:57,838
Know it? I destroyed it.

536
00:43:57,912 --> 00:44:01,848
I found this in a jammed paper shredder.

537
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:06,080
8:00 tonight.
The grand re-opening of La Plata de Nada.

538
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:08,144
And I thought, "Why would Avellaneda

539
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:11,919
"shred a simple reminder
of a dinner appointment?"

540
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:13,823
Good work, Ponton.

541
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:17,993
- So what should we do?
- Our jobs, Ponton.

542
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:23,128
We investigate, see who he's eating with.
Perhaps the Tornado.

543
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:25,363
You go on ahead.

544
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:29,569
Ponton and I will get a taxi
and do a little sightseeing.

545
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:43,919
This stakeout was a good idea, Ponton.
Fortunately, I'm an expert lip-reader.

546
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:50,123
He's saying, "Never retune a wet piano."

547
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:51,221
Why is he saying that?

548
00:44:51,298 --> 00:44:54,825
No, he is saying, "My wife will not be back
in Italy until Sunday."

549
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:58,668
- No wonder he shredded the message.
- What is all this?

550
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,934
Before they opened tonight, I snuck in,

551
00:45:01,008 --> 00:45:04,409
found out which table he'd reserved,
and planted a bug.

552
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:08,278
But how did you find out which table
they would be seated at?

553
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,318
You rubbed your fingers together.

554
00:45:12,887 --> 00:45:14,616
That is surprising.

555
00:45:19,226 --> 00:45:21,820
What is she doing here with him?

556
00:45:24,832 --> 00:45:26,663
I'm sorry, Inspector.

557
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,964
We've got to find out
what they are saying.

558
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:30,469
Why?

559
00:45:30,538 --> 00:45:33,996
We've got to move the bug
from that table to that table.

560
00:45:34,074 --> 00:45:37,202
- How?
- Let me handle it.

561
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:44,615
Hello. Remember me?

562
00:45:48,923 --> 00:45:50,720
Don't you come back.

563
00:46:18,285 --> 00:46:20,651
What's wrong?
You don't like this restaurant?

564
00:46:20,721 --> 00:46:23,849
Oh, no.
No, I have been here one time before.

565
00:46:23,924 --> 00:46:25,482
It's very nice.

566
00:48:48,202 --> 00:48:50,568
There. It is out.

567
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:53,760
<i>We've been able to confirm
that the Pope's ring has been stolen.</i>

568
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:58,237
<i>Ironically, the Dream Team
was no less than five miles away in Rome.</i>

569
00:49:58,305 --> 00:50:02,674
<i>The Italian people are outraged
that the Tornado was able to pull this off</i>

570
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:04,574
<i>right under their noses.</i>

571
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:16,013
Mr. Clouseau.

572
00:50:16,089 --> 00:50:18,819
Mr. Pepperidge, was the Dream Team
sleeping last night during the theft?

573
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:19,881
No comment.

574
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,520
Do you think
they will ever recover the ring?

575
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:24,962
If I made a comment after I'd said,
"No comment,"

576
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:27,523
I'd look like a complete ass, wouldn't I?

577
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:07,334
Do not worry.
Vicenzo Roccara Squarcialupi Brancaleone

578
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:09,170
swears to you by all that is holy,

579
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:12,735
that St. Peter's ring
will be restored to the Church.

580
00:51:12,813 --> 00:51:14,940
Please sit down.

581
00:51:17,017 --> 00:51:18,416
Now, Mr. Pope,

582
00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:22,216
do you happen to know right now
the whereabouts of your hat?

583
00:51:24,224 --> 00:51:27,284
- My hat?
- Yes, your big, pointy hat.

584
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:28,988
No, I don't know.

585
00:51:30,364 --> 00:51:35,631
Then I am probably sitting on it.
I thought I felt a little...

586
00:51:41,441 --> 00:51:43,136
This can be fixed.

587
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:47,670
As good as new.

588
00:51:48,615 --> 00:51:49,809
Now...

589
00:51:52,786 --> 00:51:54,754
How do we know
it wasn't you who stole the ring

590
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:57,654
so you could collect
on the insurance money?

591
00:51:57,724 --> 00:52:01,091
- I am the Pope.
- Forgive me, Mr. Pope,

592
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:04,789
it's just that sometimes
when I speak so forcefully,

593
00:52:04,865 --> 00:52:09,359
people just crack instantly.
Now, was the ring insured?

594
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:12,302
The ring is priceless. It cannot be insured.

595
00:52:12,372 --> 00:52:15,830
- So you had no reason to steal the ring.
- I own the ring.

596
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:20,608
Perhaps you wanted to sell the ring
so you could live in a big, fancy house.

597
00:52:21,248 --> 00:52:22,772
I kind of do.

598
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:30,947
Now, let me reconstruct the crime.
You came into the room when?

599
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:33,549
- At 9:00.
- And what was the first thing you did?

600
00:52:33,627 --> 00:52:37,461
I went out on the balcony
to admire the Lord's handiwork.

601
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:42,161
The moon that night was so beautiful.
It made me close to the Lord.

602
00:52:42,235 --> 00:52:47,366
I'm picking up on something.
You're a very spiritual man, aren't you?

603
00:52:48,408 --> 00:52:53,311
It's part of my job to read people.
I think I'm quite good at it, too.

604
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:57,508
- And then what did you do?
- I removed my robes.

605
00:52:57,584 --> 00:52:59,882
- And you put them...
- In the closet.

606
00:52:59,953 --> 00:53:01,648
- May I?
- Certainly.

607
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:07,452
You know,
if you organized your closets by color,

608
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:09,995
it would save you time
in your rush to get to work in the morning.

609
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:12,657
It's what I do, and it saves me time.

610
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:14,826
Now, in order to better
visualize the crime,

611
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:18,200
I'm going to place myself in your position.

612
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:20,705
- With your permission.
- Certainly.

613
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:44,163
So, I come home, it's 9:00 p.m.
"I think I'll go look at the moon."

614
00:53:44,231 --> 00:53:47,598
I am going out onto the balcony.

615
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:54,070
I walk out on the balcony.
I am now out on the balcony.

616
00:54:04,251 --> 00:54:08,415
I am looking at the moon.
I am looking at the moon.

617
00:54:08,488 --> 00:54:12,925
I'm feeling very, very spiritual.
I come back in.

618
00:54:15,595 --> 00:54:18,655
- And what did you do next?
- I went out for the second time.

619
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:21,860
You went out a second time
to look at the moon.

620
00:54:24,204 --> 00:54:25,796
It's the Pope.

621
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:31,441
Looking at the moon,
18 seconds has gone by.

622
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:38,149
18 seconds is enough time
for the thief to have gained entrance.

623
00:54:38,218 --> 00:54:41,551
Now, you see why it is important
to re-create the events.

624
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:46,115
Or perhaps the thief was hiding
in a ledge or recess.

625
00:54:46,193 --> 00:54:50,323
Or perhaps he was clinging
to the underside of the...

626
00:55:14,421 --> 00:55:17,413
Thank you, God. Thank you.

627
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:20,551
Chief Inspector,
Joubert wants to speak to you.

628
00:55:20,861 --> 00:55:22,556
He wants Clouseau off the case.

629
00:55:22,629 --> 00:55:24,062
- No!
- No?

630
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:27,532
No, let's wait till he does
something really embarrassing.

631
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:56,356
Home.

632
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,362
- Surprise attack!
- Surprise attack!

633
00:56:02,435 --> 00:56:05,962
- Not now, I'm depressed.
- Perfect for our advantage.

634
00:56:08,909 --> 00:56:13,471
The secret to an attack
is the element of surprise, remember?

635
00:56:40,774 --> 00:56:44,676
Now I will teach you
who is the karate master.

636
00:56:56,156 --> 00:56:58,886
Now watch what I will do to your head.

637
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:00,551
Now, Antoine.

638
00:57:11,871 --> 00:57:14,169
Let's talk about this, boys.

639
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:51,201
Come, little ones. All is forgiven.

640
00:57:55,982 --> 00:57:58,314
Ponton, can we see Clouseau?

641
00:57:58,385 --> 00:57:59,943
Is the French idiot home?

642
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,920
How does he feel about his disgrace?

643
00:58:01,988 --> 00:58:04,821
Inspector Clouseau
is the consummate professional.

644
00:58:04,891 --> 00:58:07,621
He always exhibits grace under pressure.

645
00:58:09,496 --> 00:58:11,623
Die, little piglets!

646
00:58:21,107 --> 00:58:25,441
My God, do you understand
what you have done that is wrong?

647
00:58:25,512 --> 00:58:27,946
- Just remind me.
- You cannot beat up children

648
00:58:28,014 --> 00:58:32,542
- and call them piglets.
- The world is changing so fast.

649
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:36,180
Inspector, you have failed to improve
at every opportunity.

650
00:58:36,256 --> 00:58:40,488
You are the most small-minded nitwit
I have ever encountered.

651
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:45,361
- I am sure I can do better.
- Very well, we'll give you one more try.

652
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:50,466
I'm going to hold up a series of images,
and I want you to tell me what you see.

653
00:58:50,537 --> 00:58:53,836
Just say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

654
00:58:53,907 --> 00:58:55,670
A drunken Irishman.

655
00:58:56,443 --> 00:58:58,638
An Englishman with bad teeth.

656
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:01,543
A San Francisco Nancy boy.

657
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:05,542
A Polish army officer driving a septic tank.

658
00:59:05,618 --> 00:59:07,950
Where did you get these cards?

659
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:13,449
It's in every newspaper all over the world.
We're all being made to look like idiots.

660
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:16,359
Reputations built up over a lifetime
utterly ruined.

661
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:19,592
I had to quit being a Buddhist
because I feel so much hate.

662
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:21,531
He sat on the Pope's hat!

663
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:25,935
Look, he recovered the Pink Panther once,
and I believe he can do it again.

664
00:59:26,005 --> 00:59:29,463
If he solves this case, I'm perfectly willing
to run around for 24 hours

665
00:59:29,542 --> 00:59:34,241
wearing nothing but a tutu
and carrying a big, pink, fluffy handbag.

666
00:59:34,314 --> 00:59:37,715
I say we take a vote to get rid of him.
All in favor?

667
00:59:41,354 --> 00:59:44,221
Whatever it is, count me in.

668
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:49,188
Clouseau, while you were
falling off of the Pope's balcony

669
00:59:49,262 --> 00:59:53,392
dressed as the Pope,
I discovered a key piece of evidence.

670
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:56,401
And what is this key piece of evidence?

671
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:58,797
A key.

672
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:02,933
I found this on the Pope's bedroom floor.
Something, of course, you overlooked.

673
01:00:03,009 --> 01:00:04,567
That could mean anything.

674
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:08,944
But if this key is so important,
I will take it and duly examine it.

675
01:00:09,015 --> 01:00:10,880
Inspector Clouseau.

676
01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:18,558
It is my not-so-sad duty to inform you
that you have been voted off of the team.

677
01:00:21,027 --> 01:00:22,255
Off the team?

678
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:25,297
You are no longer part
of this investigation.

679
01:00:28,802 --> 01:00:30,030
Cheerio.

680
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:41,040
Nicole.

681
01:00:43,983 --> 01:00:45,917
- Nicole?
- Inspector.

682
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:50,282
I was just returning a file.

683
01:00:51,658 --> 01:00:55,094
What are you doing in Nicole's office?

684
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:58,562
- When I got fired...
- You thought Nicole was the one person

685
01:00:58,631 --> 01:01:02,829
- you could share it with.
- Well, we do go back.

686
01:01:05,205 --> 01:01:07,366
Story of my life,

687
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,934
the men I'm interested in
aren't the ones interested in me.

688
01:01:12,011 --> 01:01:16,573
Really? I would think all men
would be interested in you.

689
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:19,981
- Why do you say that?
- Because...

690
01:01:29,562 --> 01:01:34,522
...you are very attractive.
- I will see you in my office in five.

691
01:01:41,107 --> 01:01:43,507
But really, there is no one?

692
01:01:46,212 --> 01:01:50,842
Frankly speaking, the one big love
of my life didn't quite work out.

693
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:52,509
You poor thing.

694
01:01:56,523 --> 01:01:57,820
Nicole!

695
01:01:58,825 --> 01:02:03,421
No, no, no, don't let me interrupt.
I only have a message from Vicenzo.

696
01:02:03,496 --> 01:02:06,260
He wants you both at this address,
immediately.

697
01:02:06,332 --> 01:02:09,199
He has decided he needs my expertise.

698
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:10,759
No. They've solved the case.

699
01:02:10,837 --> 01:02:13,328
- What?
- They've solved the case.

700
01:02:22,181 --> 01:02:24,479
Inspector, welcome.

701
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:26,451
Even though
we've had certain disagreements,

702
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:30,751
<i>we are willing to share the glory with you
out of our respect for la Francia.</i>

703
01:02:30,823 --> 01:02:33,417
Pepperidge examined the key
and knew right away

704
01:02:33,493 --> 01:02:35,393
it was made by a French locksmith.

705
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:39,227
Kenji did research on the locksmiths
in Paris who sell this brand.

706
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:43,133
We asked for a list of addresses
and we found this apartment.

707
01:02:44,003 --> 01:02:47,632
When we got here,
we found the owner licking the carpet.

708
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,708
His name is Laurence Milliken.

709
01:02:53,413 --> 01:02:55,244
And the stolen items?

710
01:03:02,455 --> 01:03:04,252
The Shroud of Turin!

711
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:08,656
We should have it dry-cleaned
before we return it.

712
01:03:09,596 --> 01:03:13,225
The Pope's ring.
His wife will be happy to have that back.

713
01:03:15,134 --> 01:03:18,797
- And where is the Pink Panther?
- Unfortunately, that cannot be recovered.

714
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:20,338
No Pink Panther?

715
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:23,534
- He explained in his suicide note.
- Yes.

716
01:03:25,812 --> 01:03:28,508
"Life had become horribly dull
and uninteresting.

717
01:03:28,581 --> 01:03:31,448
"Nothing matched the excitement
of stealing great treasures,

718
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:32,814
"so I returned,

719
01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:35,649
"but I found that even stealing
no longer interested me.

720
01:03:35,722 --> 01:03:38,782
"Without a purpose,
I no longer wish to live.

721
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:43,227
"I am returning every treasure but one.
The Pink Panther.

722
01:03:43,296 --> 01:03:45,321
"Having it in my possession
for even a few days

723
01:03:45,398 --> 01:03:48,060
"made me realize its fabulous beauty.

724
01:03:48,134 --> 01:03:51,467
"No one must have it but me,
so I destroyed it.

725
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:55,064
"The Pink Panther is dust, a final revenge."

726
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:57,974
"Laurence Milliken, the Tornado."

727
01:04:01,748 --> 01:04:05,946
I spent four years researching and writing
my book. I hoped to meet him alive.

728
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:09,113
The Tornado was an expert
on gems and their value?

729
01:04:09,188 --> 01:04:11,418
Yes, in fact, Milliken was the author

730
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:14,187
of the most authoritative book
on the subject.

731
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:18,959
This man did not commit these crimes.
The case has not been solved.

732
01:04:19,032 --> 01:04:23,025
But, look, there's the wound
from 10 years ago.

733
01:04:23,102 --> 01:04:25,627
- I stake my reputation on it.
- Well, that's not much.

734
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:27,866
- The media are outside.
- Then I will announce

735
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:30,841
- that we have solved the case.
- I wouldn't.

736
01:04:31,844 --> 01:04:34,642
- I will.
- I wouldn't do it.

737
01:04:35,314 --> 01:04:38,841
- I am going to.
- I wouldn't.

738
01:04:45,024 --> 01:04:49,723
I am delighted to announce
that we have found IL Tornado.

739
01:04:49,796 --> 01:04:52,060
The dead man in the apartment

740
01:04:52,131 --> 01:04:55,123
is indubitably
the perpetrator of these crimes.

741
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:58,762
Actually, one of us disagrees
with this hypothesis.

742
01:04:58,838 --> 01:05:01,705
I am sure that Milliken is not the thief.

743
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:10,709
Hold it. We're getting the report
on the DNA evidence.

744
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:14,480
The DNA taken from the body
of Laurence Milliken today

745
01:05:14,554 --> 01:05:18,251
and the DNA taken 10 years ago
from the blood of the Tornado

746
01:05:18,324 --> 01:05:22,124
are a 100% match.

747
01:05:23,463 --> 01:05:26,125
The man inside is the Tornado.

748
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:35,501
I'd like to thank my colleagues
for their assistance,

749
01:05:35,575 --> 01:05:38,806
<i>and especially one of your own
here in la Francia.</i>

750
01:05:38,878 --> 01:05:42,905
My most heartfelt appreciation
to Nicoletta.

751
01:05:45,885 --> 01:05:49,321
You are a beacon of light
in a forest of darkness.

752
01:05:49,388 --> 01:05:54,917
Nicole is no less a thief than IL Tornado
because she has stolen this.

753
01:06:21,754 --> 01:06:23,415
Your mama is here.

754
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:26,587
Say goodbye to Uncle Jacques.

755
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:30,494
- Goodbye, Uncle Jacques.
- We love you, Uncle Jacques.

756
01:06:31,164 --> 01:06:34,395
You are two fine, young, little pig persons.

757
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:37,695
- Goodbye, Papa.
- Goodbye.

758
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:41,729
- When will you be coming home, Papa?
- I'm not sure.

759
01:06:41,808 --> 01:06:43,036
Goodbye.

760
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:54,648
Well, Ponton,
we are two available men alone in Paris,

761
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,314
the most exciting city in the world.

762
01:06:58,257 --> 01:07:00,225
How should we spend our evening?

763
01:07:03,262 --> 01:07:06,595
- What sort of shampoo is this?
- Jojoba.

764
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:08,429
- Jojoba.
- Jojoba.

765
01:07:09,402 --> 01:07:11,370
Let me see the bottle.

766
01:07:14,774 --> 01:07:18,835
- It's spelled "Jojoba."
- It's pronounced "Hohoba."

767
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:23,177
It's spelled "Jojoba,"
but it's pronounced "Hohoba."

768
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:26,446
- "Hohoba."
- Why would they do something like that?

769
01:07:59,151 --> 01:08:03,588
Well, Ponton, I think our bachelor night
is going very well. Who needs women?

770
01:08:03,656 --> 01:08:05,886
I'm going back home
to my wife and children.

771
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:11,726
- What? What brought this on?
- You. I don't wish to end up... I mean...

772
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:15,733
I have decided that love and family
must not come second.

773
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:19,100
If I may, Inspector,
look what that thinking has done for you.

774
01:08:19,171 --> 01:08:23,335
What? I'm very happy living alone
with my various shampoos.

775
01:08:23,409 --> 01:08:27,277
Inspector, I still think you are
the best detective in the world.

776
01:08:27,346 --> 01:08:32,215
Yet, when it comes to love, you never see
what is staring you right in the face.

777
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:37,548
Take Nicole, for example.
Do you know the color of her eyes?

778
01:08:37,623 --> 01:08:40,615
Her pet's name? Her favorite song?

779
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:44,686
You can recite an entire section
of every statute in French criminal law,

780
01:08:44,764 --> 01:08:48,791
but you don't know the first thing
about the woman who loves you.

781
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:54,334
Her eyes are brown.

782
01:08:56,709 --> 01:08:59,041
She loves the smell of vanilla.

783
01:09:00,613 --> 01:09:03,013
She's allergic to shellfish.

784
01:09:03,082 --> 01:09:07,109
She has a small scar on her ankle,
which I gave her.

785
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:11,415
She loves her cats, Mindy and Wendy,

786
01:09:12,525 --> 01:09:18,794
and Cindy, Delores, Frank,
Maxime, Caligula and Louise.

787
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:22,660
And she does not think she is pretty.

788
01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:26,233
And I can never tell her she is pretty.

789
01:09:26,305 --> 01:09:28,830
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

790
01:09:30,576 --> 01:09:36,606
If she knew how pretty she is,
she might choose someone other than me.

791
01:09:39,018 --> 01:09:40,713
- Ponton.
- Yes?

792
01:09:42,288 --> 01:09:43,846
I need a hug.

793
01:09:45,725 --> 01:09:46,817
Okay.

794
01:09:48,494 --> 01:09:50,394
And now, conditioner.

795
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:58,259
<i>After more than a decade, the infamous
Tornado has finally been unmasked.</i>

796
01:09:58,337 --> 01:10:01,067
<i>Thanks to the work
of the international Dream Team.</i>

797
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:05,008
<i>Their success is being celebrated tonight
in a very exclusive event.</i>

798
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:09,776
<i>Let's go live now to the Petit Palais
in Paris, where the gala is underway.</i>

799
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,187
So, tell us about the case.

800
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:26,254
This was really not
one of my most challenging cases.

801
01:10:26,332 --> 01:10:28,027
I'm surprised it even took us this long...

802
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,001
My powers of observation
are so finely tuned by this point

803
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:34,369
that just one look at any situation,
and ideas come flooding into me.

804
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,000
Modern technology makes
the modern criminal obsolete.

805
01:10:37,076 --> 01:10:39,442
And what about the Pink Panther?

806
01:10:43,082 --> 01:10:48,179
<i>- Too bad it was destroyed.
- Yes, we're very sorry about that.</i>

807
01:10:48,254 --> 01:10:49,812
<i>Three out of four isn't bad.</i>

808
01:10:49,889 --> 01:10:51,948
<i>- 75%.
- Yes, brilliant.</i>

809
01:11:04,837 --> 01:11:07,271
- Inspector.
- Miss Solandres.

810
01:11:07,339 --> 01:11:09,364
- Quite a snarl here.
- Yes, I know.

811
01:11:09,442 --> 01:11:13,401
A spot just opened up. Take it.
I'll watch the meter for you.

812
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,642
- Nice car.
- It's a rental.

813
01:11:20,186 --> 01:11:23,849
I figured Paris, excitement,
romance, you know.

814
01:11:23,923 --> 01:11:27,859
- I'm leaving Paris tonight, on the redeye.
- Bon voyage.

815
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:29,656
Goodbye, Inspector.

816
01:11:36,769 --> 01:11:38,498
- You know Mrs. Dreyfus?
- Yes, sir.

817
01:11:38,571 --> 01:11:41,540
Well, let me know immediately
if she arrives.

818
01:11:49,482 --> 01:11:51,006
- Nicole.
- Yes.

819
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:53,847
- I thought you might be hungry.
- Well...

820
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:58,220
- That is very thoughtful of you.
- Cute car.

821
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,383
It's Miss Solandres' car.

822
01:12:02,528 --> 01:12:06,089
- Well, it's a little chilly out here, so...
- Nicole?

823
01:12:10,269 --> 01:12:12,169
You are very pretty.

824
01:12:12,972 --> 01:12:17,136
Well, that's odd. Some would say
I was drab and disgusting.

825
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:20,110
Well, who in their right mind
could call you drab and disgusting?

826
01:12:20,179 --> 01:12:23,171
Whoever could say something like that,
would...

827
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,343
I said it.

828
01:12:26,418 --> 01:12:28,477
- He told you?
- Yes, he did.

829
01:12:30,456 --> 01:12:34,449
I only said it
because I didn't want him to...

830
01:12:34,527 --> 01:12:35,789
To what?

831
01:12:37,296 --> 01:12:39,287
To fall in love with you.

832
01:12:45,804 --> 01:12:47,931
I don't know what to think.

833
01:13:26,378 --> 01:13:29,905
<i>- Ponton speaking.
- Ponton, here's what I want you to do.</i>

834
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:35,685
I'm thinking of recommending

835
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:39,554
the establishment of a permanent
international police force,

836
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:43,391
which, of course,
I would be prepared to command.

837
01:13:54,106 --> 01:13:55,471
Excuse me.

838
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:04,245
- What?
- I have solved the case.

839
01:14:05,284 --> 01:14:07,582
- What?
- I have solved the case.

840
01:14:07,653 --> 01:14:11,885
The case has been solved, Clouseau.
That is why we're having the party,

841
01:14:11,957 --> 01:14:14,687
you see, because we've solved the case.

842
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,905
Are you all right, Chief Inspector?

843
01:14:29,975 --> 01:14:34,105
- It's clueless Clouseau again.
- Is he here?

844
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:38,616
He's so desperate to regain his status
as the Pink Panther hero

845
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:41,585
that he's come up with
the most ingenious theory.

846
01:14:41,654 --> 01:14:45,715
- What theory?
- That you are the thief.

847
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:47,583
Me?

848
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,956
And that you have the Pink Panther
here with you.

849
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:55,023
Now I'm feeling guilty.

850
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:58,695
I've been feuding with a man
who is mentally handicapped.

851
01:14:59,004 --> 01:15:01,871
For one thing, how could Sonia
have performed the theft in Rome?

852
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,067
We were all there together.

853
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:08,205
Actually, the rest of us were all at the bar.

854
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:12,410
If you recall, Miss Solandres
stayed home with a headache.

855
01:15:12,484 --> 01:15:13,508
Well, that's right, but...

856
01:15:13,585 --> 01:15:16,577
But where would you get the expertise
for these crimes?

857
01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:20,318
Well, she is the world's
foremost authority on IL Tornado.

858
01:15:22,795 --> 01:15:27,755
Just as a parlor game, what if
she obtained this expertise directly from...

859
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,858
What if she were his daughter?

860
01:15:29,935 --> 01:15:31,596
- No, that wouldn't...
- A lover.

861
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:35,037
- Yes, a scorned lover.
- Better. Motive.

862
01:15:35,107 --> 01:15:38,599
That would explain stealing
the unfenceable items

863
01:15:38,677 --> 01:15:41,407
- to direct attention...
- To IL Tornado.

864
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:45,746
So she can bring him out of hiding
and set him up as the perpetrator.

865
01:15:46,618 --> 01:15:50,782
- Then she could kill him, forge a note...
- And keep the Pink Panther.

866
01:15:50,856 --> 01:15:53,347
As Clouseau said, the one fenceable item.

867
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:56,883
Congratulations, gentlemen,
a very diverting and amusing puzzle

868
01:15:56,962 --> 01:15:59,487
solved in two minutes.

869
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:03,561
Bravo.

870
01:16:06,338 --> 01:16:07,965
Open your purse.

871
01:16:09,475 --> 01:16:13,206
Nicoletta, you misunderstand.
This is a game, an exercise.

872
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:16,736
Yes, but just to complete the game,
let's have a look.

873
01:16:19,418 --> 01:16:21,409
I have a plane to catch.

874
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:26,788
Seriously, gentlemen!

875
01:16:30,662 --> 01:16:34,098
Okay, let's get this over and done with.

876
01:16:38,203 --> 01:16:39,727
Oh, my God! He was right.

877
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:47,638
Stop! I am the one you want, not her.

878
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:53,842
Only I possess the evidence that will keep
you in prison for the rest of your life.

879
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:56,888
So if you're going to shoot anyone,
shoot me.

880
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,250
Okay.

881
01:17:00,993 --> 01:17:03,655
Perhaps I did not think that through.

882
01:17:08,133 --> 01:17:09,395
Jacques!

883
01:17:10,736 --> 01:17:12,499
I wish I'd shot him.

884
01:17:14,706 --> 01:17:17,436
Look, his Medal of Honor
absorbed the bullet.

885
01:17:17,509 --> 01:17:18,635
- What?
- Not exactly.

886
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:21,645
The bullet ricocheted and killed the waiter.

887
01:17:22,314 --> 01:17:24,714
Where's Sonia?

888
01:17:24,783 --> 01:17:27,581
She mustn't escape. I'll stop her.

889
01:18:04,756 --> 01:18:06,018
Get back.

890
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:13,029
That gun is pointless. There are four of us,
and you only have four bullets left.

891
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,863
That doesn't add up.

892
01:18:27,946 --> 01:18:30,915
All right, I'm warning you, Miss Solandres,
I've got a...

893
01:18:30,983 --> 01:18:32,177
Spoon?

894
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:34,278
I've got a knife.

895
01:19:12,591 --> 01:19:14,582
Stop. You cannot escape.

896
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:25,026
- You don't have a match.
- That's right.

897
01:19:27,573 --> 01:19:30,133
Never use an elevator during a fire.

898
01:19:32,277 --> 01:19:34,177
Fire? Leave this to me.

899
01:20:06,244 --> 01:20:09,372
In the name of the statutes and laws
of the great nation of France,

900
01:20:09,448 --> 01:20:13,646
you are under arrest for the theft
of the world's most priceless...

901
01:20:21,259 --> 01:20:23,090
You are under arrest!

902
01:20:31,203 --> 01:20:33,763
Let me go, or I will destroy it.

903
01:20:33,839 --> 01:20:36,171
- Let her go.
- Let her do it.

904
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:38,368
Are you insane?

905
01:20:57,963 --> 01:20:59,692
Good work, Ponton.

906
01:21:00,165 --> 01:21:06,866
You moron! You twerp!
You sad excuse for a human being!

907
01:21:06,938 --> 01:21:11,307
You have just destroyed
the sacred symbol of France!

908
01:21:12,377 --> 01:21:16,541
- Ponton, did you bring what I asked for?
- Boys.

909
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:23,149
- Here it is, Uncle Jacques.
- Yes, yes.

910
01:21:24,523 --> 01:21:28,516
I knew the Tornado would eventually
come after the Pink Panther.

911
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:33,088
<i>So I went to the musée
with a simple plan in mind.</i>

912
01:21:33,165 --> 01:21:36,623
<i>I had convinced my old friend,
Robert the night guard,</i>

913
01:21:36,702 --> 01:21:40,900
<i>to turn off the security system
for the few moments necessary</i>

914
01:21:40,972 --> 01:21:44,305
<i>to save the most beautiful object
in France.</i>

915
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:48,870
I then switched the Pink Panther
with the replica I had at home.

916
01:21:49,581 --> 01:21:51,845
This is the real Pink Panther.

917
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:56,551
It was the fake that was stolen.

918
01:21:57,856 --> 01:22:00,518
Nightmare. Nightmare.

919
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:05,229
And when the Tornado,
an expert on the quality of gems,

920
01:22:05,297 --> 01:22:09,063
<i>wrote in his supposed suicide note
of its great beauty,</i>

921
01:22:09,134 --> 01:22:14,071
I knew he could never have been the thief.
He would have recognized it as a fake.

922
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:17,903
How did you figure out it was Sonia?

923
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:21,673
It was because I spent the last 17 months
on parking duty.

924
01:22:22,581 --> 01:22:23,809
What?

925
01:22:26,218 --> 01:22:30,086
Today, I was staring
at Miss Solandres' license plate.

926
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:35,024
I recognized it because of
my unique system of cross-referencing.

927
01:22:36,194 --> 01:22:40,255
I became aware that I had
given a ticket to the same car

928
01:22:40,332 --> 01:22:44,496
<i>two days before Miss Solandres
claimed she arrived in Paris.</i>

929
01:22:46,037 --> 01:22:49,370
One day before
the Pink Panther was stolen.

930
01:22:55,347 --> 01:22:57,611
You followed my instructions
very well, Clouseau.

931
01:22:57,682 --> 01:23:01,618
It was I, of course, who put Clouseau
onto the parking ticket assignment.

932
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:04,154
- Isn't that so, Inspector?
- No.

933
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:08,754
And at Avellaneda's mansion,

934
01:23:08,827 --> 01:23:11,421
when I sensed the presence
of the Tornado,

935
01:23:11,496 --> 01:23:13,487
<i>he was there, all right.</i>

936
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:17,431
But it was not a he, it was a she!

937
01:23:25,177 --> 01:23:27,975
Clouseau is the greatest detective
in the world.

938
01:23:28,046 --> 01:23:30,571
His mind is sharper
than all of us combined.

939
01:23:30,649 --> 01:23:33,209
- Should we tell him?
- Absolutely not.

940
01:23:45,664 --> 01:23:47,393
Inspector Clouseau.

941
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:51,761
Sometimes a man must be bold enough
to speak from the heart.

942
01:23:51,837 --> 01:23:54,431
You deserve to know the truth
about Nicole and I.

943
01:23:54,506 --> 01:23:58,533
- Stop. I don't want to hear.
- But nothing happened.

944
01:23:59,344 --> 01:24:01,335
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

945
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:06,576
- It pains me to admit, but no.
- Not even a little smoochie-woochie?

946
01:24:08,053 --> 01:24:11,853
I never had a chance,
because she only has eyes for one man.

947
01:24:12,424 --> 01:24:13,482
You.

948
01:24:14,326 --> 01:24:17,853
Yes, you. Now please, for God's sake,
kiss her already.

949
01:24:23,235 --> 01:24:27,797
Nicole, I have learned that

950
01:24:27,873 --> 01:24:29,704
no man is an island.

951
01:24:30,475 --> 01:24:36,744
So would you,
even though it may lead to possible injury,

952
01:24:38,049 --> 01:24:39,311
marry me?

953
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:07,171
Inspector Dreyfus, thank you again
for agreeing to conduct the ceremony.

954
01:25:07,245 --> 01:25:10,305
It makes everything
that much more special.

955
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:20,223
Jacques Clouseau and Nicole Durant.

956
01:25:20,292 --> 01:25:23,523
Do you promise to love, honor and obey...

957
01:25:23,595 --> 01:25:27,087
Wait! A wife does not
have to obey her husband.

958
01:25:30,702 --> 01:25:35,401
Okay, scrap "obey." Do you promise
to love and honor each other?

959
01:25:35,473 --> 01:25:36,963
- I do.
- I do.

960
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:39,306
Good! So by the powers vested in me

961
01:25:39,377 --> 01:25:42,244
as Chief Inspector
of the 13th Arrondissement,

962
01:25:42,314 --> 01:25:45,977
I now declare you husband and wife.

963
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,466
Here's to peace and harmony.

964
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,648
- The password?
- Hamburger!

965
01:26:17,716 --> 01:26:19,240
That's not it.

966
01:26:19,784 --> 01:26:20,944
- Hamburger!
- No!

967
01:26:21,019 --> 01:26:22,486
- Hamburger!
- No!

968
01:26:22,554 --> 01:26:26,354
They must have changed it.
Clouseau, your gadget!

969
01:26:26,424 --> 01:26:28,858
Clouseau, what's the new password?

970
01:26:29,928 --> 01:26:31,725
It says "low battery."

971
01:26:31,796 --> 01:26:33,491
- Low battery.
- No!

972
01:26:33,565 --> 01:26:36,056
No, wait. That means the battery is low.

973
01:26:36,134 --> 01:26:38,534
It wants me to go online
and renew my subscription.

974
01:26:38,603 --> 01:26:42,937
- For God's sake, Clouseau!
- Kenji, please take care of this.

975
01:26:43,975 --> 01:26:46,034
We have a plane to catch.

976
01:26:48,646 --> 01:26:50,876
- Was it beautiful?
- Very beautiful.

977
01:26:50,949 --> 01:26:53,315
- Here are your glasses.
- Thanks.

978
01:26:55,553 --> 01:26:56,645
Wait.

979
01:27:02,627 --> 01:27:05,357
- Was my mother there?
- Yes, absolutely!

980
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:08,263
- Can't you hear her screaming?
- Not really.
