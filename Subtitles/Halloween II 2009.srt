1
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,745
Do you like your present?

2
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,955
Yeah.

3
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,790
What's wrong, Michael?

4
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,040
It reminds me of something.

5
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,460
What? What does it remind you of?

6
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,130
Just a dream that I had last night.

7
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,970
What kind of dream? Was it
a good dream or was it a bad dream?

8
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,470
It was a good dream.
A really good dream.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,310
You were dressed in all white,
like a ghost.

10
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:02,395
Like a really beautiful ghost.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,775
You were walking down this white
hallway with this big white horse...

12
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,860
...saying you were gonna
come and take me back home.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,820
I wish I could take you home, honey.
I miss you there.

14
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,115
I miss you too.

15
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:19,160
Whenever you look at the horse,
you can think of Mommy, okay?

16
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,580
- Okay.
- Okay.

17
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:25,500
- Are you ticklish?
- No.

18
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,670
- I forgot. I thought you were.
- No, I'm not.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, you are.
That's the face I wanna see.

20
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,010
- Okay? Cheer up.
- Okay.

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,095
- All right.
- Okay. No more gloom.

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,475
- Okay.
- Okay.

23
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,076
Laurie?

24
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,911
Laurie, is that you?

25
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,664
Laurie? Laurie?

26
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,166
Stop, stop. Stop, stop, sweetie.
Stop.

27
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,919
Stop. It's Sheriff Brackett.

28
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,757
Laurie, give me the gun.

29
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,343
That's it. Just give me the gun.

30
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,136
That's it. Easy.

31
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,597
Easy, sweetie. Easy.

32
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,599
I killed him.

33
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,562
The man.

34
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,441
I climbed in the wall, I fell.

35
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,443
Okay. All right, sweetie.

36
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,737
- Sweetie. It's okay.
- I killed him.

37
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,116
- I killed him.
- It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

38
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,952
I want you to come with me, okay?

39
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,080
Please!

40
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,382
What is happening? Where am I?
Where am I?

41
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:45,308
We're gonna need Neuro,
Ortho, Trauma, X-ray!

42
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,809
Am I-? Am I gonna die?

43
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,978
Am I gonna die?!

44
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,730
Am I-? Am I gonna die?

45
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,482
Heads up, everybody.
Clear. Make a path.

46
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,736
We're losing him.
Altered mental status...

47
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,488
...unknown injury.
BP is 79 over 40.

48
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,955
On my count we're gonna move her.
Ready?

49
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,958
And one, two, three.

50
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,087
We need CBC chem panel.

51
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,714
Hooks.

52
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,009
How many?

53
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,385
Two.

54
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,596
They heavy?

55
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,020
What the hell happened
to this kid anyway?

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,692
I don't know. I thought it was
a car accident. I'm very confused.

57
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,611
At least Neurosurgery
cleared her head.

58
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,864
- We don't have to do anything with that.
- Right.

59
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,371
She's gonna need Plastic, but that's
the least of her worries right now.

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,046
- Come on.
- Pull me down the stairs.

61
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,924
- Lift up your end.
- Come on, pull it up.

62
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,035
Cut.

63
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:33,708
On three. Nice and easy.
One, two, three!

64
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,629
- Let's go feet first.
- Feels like he's made of lead.

65
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,216
Wait, wait, wait. Pick him up.

66
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,676
Oh, Jesus Christ.

67
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,220
He weighs a ton.

68
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,931
Looks good.

69
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,435
It'll hold. At least for now.

70
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,896
Strap him down tight.

71
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,649
I don't need that behemoth
banging around back there.

72
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,278
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This ain't
my first fucking corpse, rodeo.

73
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,905
Just close it up when you're done.

74
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,991
When the boys get him
over to county...

75
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,368
...make sure that
they lock the place up tight.

76
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,246
I don't want any surprises
till I get there in the morning.

77
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,957
No problem. On first sight...

78
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,460
...I'd say cause of death
is fairly obvious.

79
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,714
I'd say that there's nothing obvious
about anything that happened tonight.

80
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,799
Not a goddamn thing.

81
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,477
The son of a bitch was heavy, huh?

82
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,188
Six guys to lift one stiff.

83
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,773
That's one for the books.

84
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,817
Technically, five guys and a girl.

85
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,861
Whatever.

86
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,573
Did you get a look
at the naked chick?

87
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,996
Man, she was F-I-N-E, fine.

88
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,835
Yeah. She still looked fresh.

89
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,299
I heard a story about
a couple of meat wagon boys...

90
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,635
...fucking corpses over in Essex.

91
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,931
I ain't never had the urge till tonight.

92
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,391
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, whoa!
Come on!

93
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,311
Brackett even thinks he hears you
joking about that...

94
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,689
- ... and you're out of here on your ass.
- I wouldn't ever do it.

95
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,484
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm just saying.

96
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,612
She still looked good to me.
Nice little titties hanging out.

97
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,157
- Come on, that's disgusting. Stop it.
- I got wood just Ziploc'ing her up.

98
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,369
Stop. Shut up. Please.

99
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,704
I'm just saying, man.

100
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,669
Hey.

101
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,422
What's the difference
between jam and jelly?

102
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,007
I don't know. What?

103
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,927
You can't jelly your cock
up a dead girl's ass.

104
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,555
I knew that one.

105
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,223
Cow! Cow!

106
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,190
Shit. Oh, shit.

107
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,276
Oh, fuck. Hooks. Hooks.

108
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,321
Hooks. Hooks.

109
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,621
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

110
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,165
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck.

111
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,334
Oh, God.

112
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,889
Fuck. Fuck.

113
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,559
Fuck!

114
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,977
Oh, fuck!

115
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,025
Help me! Help me!

116
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,576
Hooks.

117
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:42,081
Hooks, Hooks, Hooks.
Hooks, Hooks.

118
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,212
Help me. Help please.

119
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,885
Help me.

120
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,222
Help. Help.

121
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,018
Please, help. Help me!

122
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,897
Help me. Hey.

123
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,444
So I told her. I said, "Girl, if you think
I'm letting you handle Thanksgiving...

124
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,822
...then I'm ordering Chinese. "

125
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,783
Octavia, it's a pleasure that
you're embracing life this way.

126
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,953
- I love seeing you.
- She's bringing Miriam down.

127
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,122
- Not the dog!
- That yapping dog that peed...

128
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,082
...all over my new couch.

129
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,918
You are gonna have to
cook that dog for Thanksgiving.

130
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,338
Honey, I'm gonna leave.

131
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,590
- Hold down the fort.
- All right, doc.

132
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,717
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

133
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,019
Annie?

134
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,151
Oh, Annie.

135
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,737
Oh, baby.

136
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,870
Oh, Annie.

137
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,793
Oh, Annie. Please don't die.
Please, please, please don't die.

138
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,087
Please, Miss Strode.

139
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,922
You cannot be in here.

140
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,426
I just wanted to sit here with her.
Please, I won't bother her.

141
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,094
You need to go to your own room.

142
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,597
- You need rest as much as she does.
- A few minutes.

143
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,765
Just a few minutes. Please.

144
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,268
Come on.
Let's get you back into bed.

145
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:35,439
You're doing good, sweetie.
Doing good. All right.

146
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,569
Nurse Daniels, please report to
Emergency Room A.

147
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,363
- You need help getting to your room?
- I'm fine.

148
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:50,037
Nurse Daniels, please report to
Emergency Room A.

149
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,627
Nurse, I...

150
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,719
I need something for my head.

151
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,597
Hello?

152
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,726
I'm getting really dizzy.

153
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,166
Nurse, I need something
for my head.

154
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:09,569
Help!

155
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:23,208
Help! Somebody! Please!

156
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:56,009
Help! Help!

157
00:18:56,177 --> 00:19:02,057
Help, somebody!

158
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,433
Please!

159
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,651
Help!

160
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,863
Somebody, please.

161
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,115
Help me!

162
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:41,012
Help!

163
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,065
Oh, goddamn it.

164
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,238
This is just fucking great.

165
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,339
- Help me, please! Help me!
- Oh, my God!

166
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,299
What the Christ are you doing here?

167
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,468
You're gonna freeze your ass off
out here.

168
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,428
- Please! Please! Please!
- Here, easy.

169
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,473
- Look, just sit down. Here, here.
- Please!

170
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:10,560
Put this on before they blame me
for you catching pneumonia.

171
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,604
The nurse is dead. The nurse is-

172
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,857
No, no, it's going to be okay.
Listen, it's going to be all right.

173
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,026
I work here. My name is Buddy.

174
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,236
- Okay, it's going to be fine.
- No, it's not.

175
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,947
I've gotta get you back.

176
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,492
- Just let me go get my car, okay?
- Please! Please!

177
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,243
- It'll just take a second.
- No, no!

178
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,871
No, honey, it'll just take a second.

179
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,457
- Please don't leave me.
- The car is right out there.

180
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,376
Look, look, here. Here, here.

181
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,046
Just drink what's left of this
till I get back, okay?

182
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,049
Okay? And I promise,
I'll be back in just a second.

183
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,010
- No, please.
- Nobody's gonna hurt you, honey.

184
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:49,975
It'll be all right. Here,
I'm gonna lock this door, okay?

185
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,184
One second...

186
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,188
...and then I will pull up
right here, okay?

187
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,107
All right.

188
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,781
Buddy!

189
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,493
Buddy, please.

190
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,080
Buddy, please come back!

191
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:43,153
Buddy!

192
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,367
I'm sorry.

193
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,912
This old car doesn't always
like to start...

194
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,831
...especially in the rain.

195
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,585
Everything will be fine, okay?

196
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,422
No! Buddy!

197
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,418
Somebody! Somebody, please!

198
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,732
Help me! Help me, please!

199
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,238
No!

200
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,765
Come on.

201
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,187
He's dead.

202
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,189
He's fucking dead.

203
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,526
Oh, fuck.

204
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,658
Oh, God.

205
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,053
I am running ragged this morning.

206
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,429
- Morning.
- Running ragged.

207
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,680
Good morning.

208
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,767
- Did you hear Laurie last night?
- Yes, Dad.

209
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:05,063
I hear her every night. Please,
God, don't say anything to her.

210
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,190
I won't. I won't.

211
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,441
Want some egg whites?

212
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,654
No. I think I'm gonna get me one
of them sticky buns on the way in.

213
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,448
That's great. Pastry for breakfast.

214
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,493
Seriously, 500 calories
of sugar and shit.

215
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,536
I know it, I know it.

216
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,247
- Morning.
- Morning.

217
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,706
Good morning, sunshine.

218
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,542
- I got to go.
- Hey, slow your roll for one second.

219
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,212
Please do not forget
to pick up the pizza.

220
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,546
And whole-wheat crust.

221
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,382
God, Annie.

222
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,261
Why don't we just have them take
the cheese and put it on cardboard?

223
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,805
- Aren't you late?
- Cardboard's got a lot of fiber.

224
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,015
- And it's cheap.
- No meat.

225
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,522
Rough night?

226
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,232
Did you hear me?

227
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:51,985
Just a little.

228
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,153
God. Just when I think
I can get back to...

229
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,781
...something as simple as sleep,
it's like...

230
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,535
...right back at me.

231
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,745
Do you wanna tell me about it?

232
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,039
Nah.

233
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,667
I don't remember much.

234
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,002
It was a hospital one.

235
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,464
I haven't had one of those in a while.

236
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,677
Guess I know what I'll be
yakking about in therapy today.

237
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,096
One day at a time, babe.

238
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,641
One day at a time.

239
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,394
One fucking day at a time.

240
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,939
You know what, if I hear that fucking
phrase one more fucking time-

241
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,443
She just fucking sits there in her
fucking leather chair and judges me...

242
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,488
- ... like she's fucking God.
- It's her job, Laurie. My God.

243
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,743
What am I supposed to say?
Boo-fucking-hoo for you.

244
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,412
See? You don't fucking care.

245
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:49,709
Right, I don't fucking care.
I don't understand, Laurie.

246
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,715
Oh, nice. Thanks for leaving me
some coffee, Dad.

247
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:09,979
I don't know, I just- I wake up
and I feel like I can't even breathe.

248
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,066
They seem to be getting worse.

249
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,822
I'm- I'm concerned...

250
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,369
...but, gosh, I can't say
that I'm surprised.

251
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,164
I mean, it's Halloween and Halloween
is a big trigger point for you, isn't it?

252
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,543
Barbara...

253
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,962
...I know Michael Myers is dead.

254
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,382
I shot him in the fucking head.

255
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,219
I know he's not gonna come back
just because of some stupid holiday.

256
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,806
- Laurie, they never found his body.
- So?

257
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,976
So it's very hard for you
to get closure on this.

258
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,647
I mean, he's objectively dead
but he's living in your mind...

259
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,483
...and he's living in your heart
and your emotions.

260
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,986
So that's the reality
that we have to heal you from.

261
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,573
Which is why I say you're still
in recovery.

262
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,370
So, basically, I just have to wait
until my brain heals?

263
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,335
Well, let's try and help your brain
heal a little bit today, okay?

264
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,754
- Okay.
- Okay.

265
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,674
How's your relationship
with Annie going?

266
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,177
- Annie?
- Yeah.

267
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,600
Not good.

268
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,731
I don't know, I feel kind of shitty
by saying this, but-

269
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,527
She's a constant reminder.

270
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:45,283
Every time I see her face,
and I see those scars...

271
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,702
...I know that it's my fault.

272
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,998
And I get angry. And there's something
in my body that snaps.

273
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:56,127
And I get this zero to a hundred rage,
and I just wanna go up to her...

274
00:29:56,295 --> 00:30:00,298
- ... and I just wanna- Fuck, I don't know.
- Finish the thought.

275
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:05,470
- Finish that thought. It's important.
- I'd rather not. You'll send me away.

276
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:10,516
I would never send you away. We're
here to keep you out of the hospital.

277
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,936
The last place you're gonna heal
is in a hospital.

278
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,903
What is that?

279
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,199
That? That's whatever you think it is
is what that is.

280
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:31,120
The theory is that this ambiguous
stimuli here will bring...

281
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:35,249
...your subconscious thoughts
into the light. llluminate them.

282
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,084
So, what do you see?

283
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,299
White horse.

284
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,763
So, what does that tell you?
Am I crazy or sane?

285
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,557
It tells me you're a girl who likes
white horses.

286
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,286
The natives are getting restless.

287
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,455
You were supposed to
be here 45 minutes ago.

288
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,500
Hello. Yes, hello, darling.

289
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:21,254
No. How are you? Hello? Hello?

290
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,465
Damn. Hello?

291
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,469
Everybody has been completely briefed
on why we are here.

292
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,556
They know the drill
so I don't foresee any problems.

293
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,100
Everything is kosher,
as my people say.

294
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,894
I know these journalists
personally, they're cool.

295
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,522
Trust me, they are cool.

296
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,942
So I feel like this should be
really a positive experience...

297
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,278
...you know, and be really good
for the book.

298
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,614
Did you just mention "journalists,"
"cool" and "positive"...

299
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,033
...all in the same sentence
without throwing up?

300
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:55,788
- Yes, why? Is that a problem?
- It's just quite an oxymoron, my dear.

301
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,832
Look, can you just level with me?

302
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,835
Is there going to be
a problem today?

303
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,504
You are quite an odd one, aren't you?

304
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,840
I mean, look at you.
Are you color-coordinated?

305
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:10,052
Pink clogs and this orange thing.
Are you a clam digger or something?

306
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,637
I don't mean that in a lesbian sense.

307
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:15,516
- I think you mean "carpet muncher. "
- I'm not judging. I'm not-

308
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,977
- Hello.
- Can we just not get personal?

309
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,562
Look at this. No!

310
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,814
Look, it's the wrong photograph!

311
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,443
I mean, this is old Loomis.
This is new.

312
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:29,488
Yes, well, old Loomis increases sales
by 25 percent, okay? So just-

313
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,657
I'm not going in there
until you get me...

314
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,870
...a cup of PG tips with a splash
of milk, and I want it sizzling hot.

315
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,122
PG what?

316
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,582
Tea?

317
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,542
We don't have time.

318
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,879
Fine. Fine, I'll go find you some.

319
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,173
- Two percent.
- Two percent.

320
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,775
Wow, the princess of punctuality
is a little late.

321
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,903
Alert the authorities.
Laurie has been replaced by a pod.

322
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,656
Whoa, wait, I'm early.
I worked overtime last night.

323
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,035
See, you're too together.
No, you gotta loosen up a little, babe.

324
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,412
You know, bring some anarchy
to the party.

325
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,332
So you're saying I can start
showing up whenever I want?

326
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,250
Not on my dime, sister.

327
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,336
You can save the slacker shit...

328
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,339
...for those corporate bloodsuckers
who can afford it.

329
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,383
That's why we're going
down the toilet.

330
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,261
Since 1946, this country has
been under the military-industrial-

331
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,223
- Fuck the man.
- Right on, sister.

332
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,478
You're really interested.
I know, I know.

333
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:47,149
I give in. You win.
The old man caves again.

334
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,276
- What's up with him?
- I don't know.

335
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,278
Are you gonna come
and rock balls...

336
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,406
...with Harley and me
at the Phantom Jam?

337
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,282
Hells yeah.

338
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,953
But I'm not sure if I'm down
with the whole costume concept.

339
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,956
What? Okay, wait.
Think of it like this.

340
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,250
It's so lame that
it's totally cool again.

341
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,503
Well, I still like my idea better.

342
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,505
What up, dick-lickers?

343
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,383
Could you please convince
Miss Too-Coolio-for-Schoolio...

344
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,385
...our costume idea is totally rad?

345
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:18,556
Dude, suck it up, ho. We got a fucking
theme going on. Don't screw it up.

346
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,850
Plus we got you
that sick maid outfit...

347
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,727
...and dudes dig the domestic.

348
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,730
Come on, you guys,
it's borderline drama-class nerd.

349
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,398
- Own it.
- What do I have to do?

350
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,234
Stand on this chair and show
the old hippie dude my tits?

351
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,569
- No.
- Oh, Meat!

352
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,279
- Check out my lady lumps!
- No, no.

353
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,158
- I'll wear it. Put down your fucking shirt.
- You give in too easy.

354
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,452
All right, you guys ready for it?

355
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,662
- For what?
- Are you ready?

356
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,832
Kick out the jams, motherfucker!

357
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,177
Michael, I'm sorry to tell you this...

358
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,388
...but your mother
has passed away.

359
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,474
She'll be back.

360
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,686
No, I'm afraid she won't be
coming to see you anymore.

361
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,774
I'll see her again,
but I won't see you.

362
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,819
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Samuel Loomis...

363
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:19,074
...author of The Devil Walks
Among Us, in stores October 31 st.

364
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:22,703
Thank you all and welcome.

365
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,374
I think you can all see quite clearly here
that Michael's psychotic perception...

366
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,962
...is in complete denial about his
own mother's suicide

367
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,467
Freud would certainly have a field day
with that little one, wouldn't he?

368
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,722
So it is the fate of all of us...

369
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,393
...to direct our first
sexual impulses towards our mothers...

370
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:51,315
...and our first murderess hatred
against our fathers.

371
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,945
Now, in Michael's case,
I became the surrogate father.

372
00:35:56,112 --> 00:36:01,367
The last father
in a long series of fathers.

373
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,162
Well, has anybody
got any questions at all?

374
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,997
Yes, sir. Yes. Please.

375
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:11,418
You never really made it clear whether
you believe it was nurture or nature...

376
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,796
...that contributed
to Michael's condition.

377
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,925
I would like to answer it, in part,
by quoting...

378
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,469
...the great George Bernard Shaw...

379
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,764
...with a little Loomis twist
at the end.

380
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:28,853
He says: "In the arts of life,
man invents nothing.

381
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,315
But in the arts of death,
he outdoes nature herself...

382
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,486
...and produces,
by chemistry and machinery...

383
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:42,324
...all the slaughter of plague,
pestilence, famine"...

384
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,785
...and Michael Myers.

385
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,415
Well, sorry, but I like that little one.

386
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,251
That's my own little twist.

387
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,627
Yes, ma'am?

388
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:58,048
Do you feel personally responsible for
the deaths of as many as 15 victims?

389
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,139
I have tremendous sympathy
for all the families involved.

390
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:10,019
And do I personally feel responsible?
Ma'am, no, I do not.

391
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,271
And I've said that many times.

392
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,024
It's just awful and...

393
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,651
...I was very nearly a victim myself.

394
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,989
I'm not a psychic Sherlock Holmes
playing Superman.

395
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,367
Since the authorities haven't
been able to produce a body...

396
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,995
...do you think Michael
is alive or dead?

397
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,497
Will he kill again?

398
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,458
Here we go again.

399
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:37,838
Look, let me make things
nice and sparkling clear.

400
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,215
Michael Myers is fucking dead!

401
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,676
Now, do you brain-dead
gossip mongers...

402
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:47,014
...want me to spell it out for you?
D- E-A-D!

403
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,563
Michael.

404
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,732
Halloween is coming.

405
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,694
You have to get ready.

406
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,072
We are counting on you
to bring us home this year.

407
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,574
I won't let you down.

408
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,452
I know you won't, baby.

409
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,913
I love you, Mama.

410
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,959
I love you too, Michael.

411
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,424
It's that same guy who's been coming.
You seen him before?

412
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,634
- Yeah, it's the same bum.
- Stealing our shit.

413
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,637
- I'd recognize him anywhere, Daddy.
- Motherfucker.

414
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:13,017
Can't have drifters just coming in here
and taking whatever they want.

415
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,852
What y'all gonna do?

416
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,690
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

417
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,404
Shut up, Ivan. We see him.

418
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,739
Let's do it.

419
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,375
You're just gonna scare him.

420
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,879
- Daddy, what the fuck?
- Safety.

421
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:48,135
Hey, you stupid, slimy dick.

422
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:52,598
I told you if you came on this land
again, I'd beat the fuck out of you.

423
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,684
What the fuck you think
you're doing here?

424
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,520
As big as he is dumb, man.

425
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:02,399
Look at that.
He's about 7-foot of fuck-tard.

426
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,152
I'm talking to you, shit-heel.

427
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,362
You stupid fuck!

428
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,492
I'm talking to you!

429
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,244
What's wrong with this
son of a bitch?

430
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,954
Give him a taste of that here.

431
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,628
- All right.
- Hey! No! You'll fucking kill him.

432
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:26,256
- Wanna go to jail for killing that turd?
- One more shot. Shut up!

433
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,469
Chris, knock it off.

434
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,430
- Big man.
- Oh, man.

435
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,058
- Come on, Daddy.
- Don't you come back, son of a bitch.

436
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,519
Man, that was a professional
ass-whupping there.

437
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,355
I'm jacked.

438
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,609
- You okay?
- Shut up, Ivan!

439
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,238
I'm so sorry. What are we gonna do,
just fucking leave him out here?

440
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,739
Get in the truck.

441
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,449
Come on now. Chop-chop.

442
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,493
- Get in the truck.
- I'm so sorry.

443
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,037
I am so sorry.

444
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,542
Shut up, Ivan.

445
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,136
Seriously.

446
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,977
- Jump up.
- You didn't need to...

447
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,812
...fucking beat him to a pulp.

448
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,191
- I told the guy.
- Fuck that.

449
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:30,571
Oh, my God!

450
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,574
Fuck!

451
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,203
No, Daddy!

452
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:11,111
What are you doing?
I said I was fucking sorry!

453
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,472
Pizza.

454
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,683
- Dude, you didn't get whole wheat.
- I forgot.

455
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,270
Anybody hungry?

456
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,482
- Starving like Marvin.
- Starving like Marvin.

457
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,568
Has anybody at this table
ever wondered...

458
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,986
...who Marvin is?

459
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,073
I mean, the original Marvin
who was starving Marvin?

460
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,951
- What?
- Was it-? Was it Lee Marvin?

461
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,078
Who's Lee Marvin?

462
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,746
"Who's Lee Marvin?"

463
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,206
Did I stutter?

464
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:09,253
Paint Your Wagon.
The Professionals. Lee Marvin.

465
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,171
Cat Ballou?

466
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,883
Cat Ballou. He was great in Cat Ballou.

467
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:18,845
I can't believe you guys haven't seen
it. He was like playing this drunk...

468
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,765
...but he's like the greatest gun
in the West.

469
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,350
At one point he's like...

470
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,686
...talking about being a gunslinger.

471
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,480
And he misses the barn.

472
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,193
He misses the barn completely.

473
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:38,156
I wanna thank the both of you for
making me feel as old as Methuselah.

474
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,827
All I know is I hope that dead, rotting
flesh didn't bump on my pineapple.

475
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,121
A little dead, rotting flesh
never hurt anybody.

476
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,040
God. Do we have to do this
every time we eat together?

477
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,501
We need to get you off
the animal products, Mr. B.

478
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:53,046
- Not gonna happen.
- Man was meant to eat meat.

479
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:56,216
We, all of us,
have a little bit of caveman in us.

480
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,891
God.

481
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,734
How is it possible that every father...

482
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,403
...perfects the art of humiliating
their offspring?

483
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,196
What? It's cute.

484
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,550
- What?
- Come on, Annie.

485
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,635
I'll go. I always go.

486
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,948
Hang on.

487
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,992
God.

488
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,956
- Here.
- Thanks.

489
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,335
Sorry I was such a bitch earlier.

490
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,797
I get it.

491
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,135
Okay.

492
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:53,166
Where have you been?
I've been waiting.

493
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,420
You know
I can't come here anymore.

494
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,922
My time here is over.

495
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,883
- You're here now.
- Michael...

496
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,010
...you know I'm not really here.

497
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,179
I wanna show you something.

498
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,473
All right.

499
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,579
I found her.

500
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,873
I found Boo.

501
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,553
My baby.

502
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,184
Can we be a family again?

503
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,645
Not yet, Michael.

504
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,897
Not yet.

505
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,654
Oh, fuck.

506
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,208
Come here, buddy.

507
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,773
So, Dr. Loomis, tell me. How long
do you plan on staying in town?

508
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,566
Please. Sam.

509
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,236
Thank you.
Well, I could stay a few extra days.

510
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,781
It depends on if there's something
or someone that motivated me.

511
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:50,408
- Excuse me, Dr. Loomis-
- I'm in the middle of something.

512
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,910
Could I speak to you? Please?

513
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,496
- What?
- Please?

514
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:58,333
Excuse me, my dear.
I won't be one second.

515
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,043
What?

516
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,379
Okay, I am all for selling books.
All right?

517
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,674
God knows I've done some things
that I'm not proud of...

518
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:10,136
...but this is disgusting.
I did not agree to this backdrop.

519
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,305
What's next?
Heading over to the cemetery...

520
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,266
...and dancing on
the victims' graves?

521
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,352
Look, I don't think you
quite understand...

522
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,981
- ... what I'm trying to accomplish here.
- Well, fair enough. I don't.

523
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,608
Explain it to me.
I would really like to understand.

524
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:27,696
I'm selling the sizzle, not the steak.

525
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,614
- The sizzle?
- Yes.

526
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,535
The sizzle. It's bad taste is what it is.

527
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:35,579
It's just gonna add fuel
to the lynch mob fire.

528
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,914
Bad taste? Bad taste?

529
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:41,334
My God, it's business, woman!
Business.

530
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,838
Besides, bad taste is the petrol
that drives the American dream.

531
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,090
I think it's a mistake.

532
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,842
- Oh, yeah, you do, do you?
- Yes.

533
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,220
Well, when I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you.

534
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:58,476
Here. Now, take that and go sit in
the car. Go on. Get your ass in there.

535
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,770
Okay. Hi, where do you want me?

536
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,359
Die, you fucking bitch!

537
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,195
You fucking bitch!
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

538
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,281
I'm gonna fuck you-

539
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:38,118
Fucking die, you fucking bitch!

540
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,577
You fucking cunt!

541
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,329
Fucking bitch!

542
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,789
Please, Laurie, please!

543
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:48,294
You fucking-
Die, you fucking bitch!

544
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:55,218
Laurie! Laurie, Laurie, Laurie!

545
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:36,468
- You guys like Frankenstein?
- Yes.

546
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,428
Who likes popcorn?

547
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,847
So I was going through the park...

548
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,976
...and there was this
really crazy Frankenstein.

549
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,771
And he was, like, yelling at the kids.

550
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,065
And he was yelling at them,
like, perverted things and stuff.

551
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:55,153
And I really thought it was funny
and I stopped and watched.

552
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:59,491
And then I saw this, like, farm.

553
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,035
- Laurie?
- And this lady let me hold the pig.

554
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,037
What are you feeling
right now, Laurie?

555
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,498
The pig really liked me
and she said that the pig...

556
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,666
- Laurie?
- ... liked me. I wanted to take it home.

557
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,752
Sit down, Laurie.

558
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,505
Come on, Laurie.

559
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,090
Stay centered. What's going on?

560
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,930
I had this really, really,
really crazy attack.

561
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,558
And not while I was asleep,
while I was awake.

562
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:29,270
Look, I just need you to
prescribe me something, please.

563
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,816
Laurie, according to my notes,
you should have a lot of medication.

564
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,068
I don't. I'm out.

565
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,863
Look, I need you to get your magic
pen and your magic piece of paper...

566
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,783
...and I need you to write me up
a prescription, please.

567
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:45,411
Laurie, that's not the answer. Are
you doing your breathing exercises?

568
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,914
- Breathing exercises?
- Yes, it helps.

569
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,667
- Breathing exercises aren't gonna cut it.
- They help, Laurie.

570
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,253
- And I can't deal with this!
- Oh, honey.

571
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,631
I'm not strong enough and
I'm tired of pretending that I am.

572
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,300
Look, Laurie, listen to me.
Stay with me.

573
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:02,303
You are so much stronger
than you think you are. You are.

574
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:07,308
- Now, go on, sit down. Sit down.
- You better fucking let me go...

575
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:10,103
...and give me
some fucking prescriptions!

576
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,939
I'm gonna give you some Haldol
to tide you over.

577
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,233
- Haldol?
- Yes, Haldol.

578
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:18,278
- It'll take some of these thoughts away.
- I don't want Haldol.

579
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:23,032
- I want my prescription!
- I'm so sorry you're going through this.

580
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,450
Fuck, you know what?

581
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,203
Fuck you and fuck this!

582
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,747
I'm tired of your:
"How are you, Laurie?

583
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,166
I'm so concerned
at 100 bucks an hour. "

584
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:36,129
You know what? I would be fucking
concerned at 100 bucks an hour.

585
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:38,339
- I'm really concerned right now.
- Bullshit.

586
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:42,135
- No, it's not bullshit.
- You're more fucked up than I am...

587
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,386
...you crazy bitch!

588
00:53:56,483 --> 00:54:00,194
For most of us, Michael Myers
is a mysterious legend of evil.

589
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,821
But for Dr. Samuel Loomis...

590
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,324
...the bogeyman is all too real.

591
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,744
There have been rumors circulating
as to the content of your new book.

592
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,454
- What can you tell me?
- Well...

593
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:11,581
...after my last encounter
with Michael...

594
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,250
...some startling facts
came to light...

595
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,045
...and I just thought that
the public ought to know.

596
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,005
Such as?

597
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,007
Read the book, as they say.

598
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,469
Weren't you horrified that
Michael's body went missing?

599
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:26,638
No, not really.

600
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:30,600
How you can lose a body, you
know, transporting it from A to B.

601
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,519
You better ask
the sheriff's department that one.

602
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,855
Well, do you think that the body
will reappear?

603
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,691
Yes, probably. You know,
somewhere it'll reappear...

604
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:42,695
...along with the Elephant Man's
bones at some sideshow.

605
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,239
But as my old Aunt Miri
used to say:

606
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,534
"Freaks will always
find their way home. "

607
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,219
What's up with the booze?

608
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:11,099
Oh, yeah. Meet my new best friend.

609
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,768
Oh, is this how
your new work friends roll?

610
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,896
Maybe. Jealous?

611
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,775
- Whatever.
- You know what Annie?

612
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,777
I don't need your shit.

613
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,699
You don't need my shit?

614
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:31,786
You don't need my shit?
I put up with your shit, 24-7.

615
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,540
You better back the fuck off!

616
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:38,042
Or what, huh?
The fuck are you gonna do?

617
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,921
You know what, you act like you're the
only one whose life got fucking trashed.

618
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,383
I'm so not buying
the new Laurie act.

619
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,760
I'm not putting up
with your moaning shit.

620
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:52,849
Get the fuck out of my room!
Get the fuck out of my room!

621
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,686
I'm not impressed.

622
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,232
Fuck!

623
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,953
"Hey, Howard.

624
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:18,041
Can't afford the new tits.
Can you loan me some bones?"

625
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,127
Fucking whore.

626
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,504
Hey! Hey, Misty, come here.

627
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,673
Come on, it's on.
Come on, it's finally on.

628
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:29,093
I'm on TV. You're missing it. Move
your ass. Come here. Look at this!

629
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,595
Oh, my God, baby.

630
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,597
Look at that. I'm incredible.

631
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:35,516
- the smile you'll have on
your face at the Rabbit In Red...

632
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:39,270
...when you see some of my girls
dance because they are fantastic.

633
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:42,106
Hey, Howard,
where are those drinks?

634
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,318
Hey, boss. That's right,
they love you, man.

635
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:48,404
- That's why the whole town loves you.
- Yeah, they love me.

636
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,656
They love me like cancer,
that's how much.

637
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,201
You look like that big guy.

638
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:55,661
The shit falls on his head.

639
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,955
"Grandfather, I'm mad,
I'm pissed off.

640
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,501
Hey, where's my daughter with the
cans and the blond hair and the-?"

641
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,127
What are you talking about?

642
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:06,047
Yeah. Green makes you
look sexy, baby.

643
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,508
Green. That suits you, man.

644
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,511
It really suits you.
It's like the color of money.

645
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:14,764
Dumbass.

646
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,100
Hey, Howard, let me ask you
a question.

647
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,434
I got a riddle for you.

648
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:22,188
What does a stripper do with her
asshole before she dances.

649
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,690
I don't know.

650
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:29,403
She gives him 10 bucks
and she tells him to take out the trash!

651
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,659
- That's a good one.
- Here, Howard. Take out the trash.

652
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:36,494
Take out the trash, Howard.

653
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,871
He's good at taking out the trash.

654
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,123
I'm funny.

655
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,750
Yeah, I'm the big joke.

656
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,003
Hey, I'm on TV. Quiet.
Shut up. Shut up.

657
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,881
Enjoy the fucking herpes, old man.

658
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:52,301
- I got an aura.
- You got an aura, baby.

659
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,470
You have an aura.
You got two auras.

660
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,556
- You're so bad.
- Really?

661
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,933
- Auras are popping out.
- Let me see those auras.

662
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:08,067
Two-faced bitch.

663
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:16,159
Fucking Hoss. I'm fucking
Hop Sing doing all the chores.

664
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,952
You bitch.

665
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,415
"Yeah, Howard.

666
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:27,003
Can I have some money for
my dad's blood transfusion?"

667
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:30,756
What the fuck you doing, man...

668
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,384
...sneaking around back here?

669
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:36,762
Hey.

670
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:40,516
The boss don't like you bums
hanging out back here...

671
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,227
...rooting around
through the Dumpsters.

672
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,813
So get a move on.

673
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,904
Look, man.

674
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,740
Don't give me no reason.

675
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:01,954
I already sent
some sorry fucking jag-off...

676
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,290
...to the emergency room tonight.

677
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,667
So...

678
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:09,921
...I suggest you
take the easy road out...

679
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,382
...and hit the bricks, Dorothy.

680
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,270
Trust me...

681
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:29,482
...you filthy, dirty hippie...

682
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,152
...you don't wanna be doing that.

683
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:35,446
Copy that, downtown?

684
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,826
Fuck.

685
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:45,933
We're done waiting.

686
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,562
Only a river of blood can bring us
back together.

687
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,772
It's up to you.

688
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,900
It's always been up to you, Michael.

689
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,903
Hey, baby, you know what?
It's after midnight.

690
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,239
So? I don't think my pussy is gonna
turn into a pumpkin.

691
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,658
It's technically Halloween, baby.

692
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,746
How'd you like to be fucked
by the Frankenstein monster, huh?

693
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,751
You're my bride of Frankenstein.

694
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,086
Big, green, scary monster!

695
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,505
Oh, no. Oh, I'm so scared.

696
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,425
- Titties good.
- No.

697
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,760
Ass good.

698
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:23,929
I'm gonna give it to you good.

699
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,307
I'm gonna give you
my jolly green giant.

700
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,017
Jesus Christ!

701
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,439
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out of here.

702
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,067
Come on, get the fuck out of here,
motherfucker.

703
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,444
You're gonna stare me down?

704
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,572
Stare this down, motherfucker!

705
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,576
Come on now! I'll fucking blow two
holes right through your fucking mask.

706
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,788
I been to Nam. I'll take you out,
you hear me? I'll fucking-

707
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,728
What are you doing?

708
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:41,173
Open the door! No!

709
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,509
No! Open the door!

710
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,241
Son of a bitch!

711
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,660
You fucking did it!

712
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,752
Fuck, what am I gonna do?

713
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,384
- Hello?
- Hey, princess.

714
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,928
Hey, Dad. What's up?

715
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,639
Listen, is Laurie around?

716
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,432
I'd like to talk to her.

717
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,935
No, she left before I got up.
Why, what's up?

718
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,020
Well, could you do me a favor?

719
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,106
Could you find her
and then call me when you do?

720
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,942
Why? What's going on?

721
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,110
Sweetie, I gotta tell you
about that later.

722
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,988
Could you just do me
that favor, please?

723
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:30,324
- Everything okay?
- Everything is fine.

724
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:32,576
I just need to talk to her, sweetie.
Okay?

725
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,100
He's still out there.

726
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:42,104
Rich and famous.
All because of our pain.

727
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,774
I hope he's having fun.

728
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,194
Are you a real redhead? Thank you.
Have a good one.

729
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,362
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

730
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,864
It's going very well, indeed.
Well done.

731
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:55,075
Yes, look at the crowd.
It's great. Great.

732
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,536
Right, well done.

733
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:00,372
- Thank you.
- Can you make it out to-?

734
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,667
- I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. Chett.
- Calm down, calm down.

735
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,127
- Big deep breath.
- Thanks.

736
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:08,881
Chett Johns.
No, no, actually, you know what?

737
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:12,468
- Chett, the bringer of death.
- Okay.

738
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:13,927
That's Chett with two T's.

739
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:17,139
- Chett, the bringer of...
- The bringer of...

740
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,476
...death. Oh, man,
that is so awesome.

741
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,728
- There.
- Thanks. I wanted to let you know...

742
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,439
...that Michael is so much
deeper than those other guys.

743
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:27,900
Like Dahmer and that bitch Bundy...

744
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:31,737
...because he eats at the core
of the victim's soul, you know?

745
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:34,782
- How people ostracize those-
- All right. Well, thanks so much.

746
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,742
- You're the man.
- You're the man!

747
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,452
- You're the man, dude.
- Thank you.

748
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,580
- You're awesome. Thank you.
- Thank you.

749
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:45,626
Jesus. Well, we always have one,
don't we?

750
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:49,380
Hi. How are you?

751
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,134
Do you want me to sign this?
What?

752
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:55,761
You don't recognize her?

753
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,431
- Why? Should I?
- I'm not surprised.

754
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,934
Take a really good look at her.

755
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:05,312
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- She was beautiful.

756
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,023
This is my daughter.

757
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:09,733
Lynda.

758
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:15,239
- Your monster killed her.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

759
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,409
- He butchered her.
- You have my deepest sympathy.

760
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,078
Do I have your deepest sympathy,
you fucking pig?

761
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,663
- I'm truly sorry.
- You killer.

762
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,623
- No, I didn't kill anyone.
- You killer!

763
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,959
All right, just calm down.
It's all right.

764
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:29,002
You butchered my baby. Back up!

765
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:30,838
You butchered my baby!

766
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,340
- Can we get somebody-?
- I'm gonna get you, Loomis.

767
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,968
Get your hands off me.
Get your goddamn hands off me!

768
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:38,679
It's all right. Everyone,
just calm down. Calm down.

769
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:41,140
- All right, I'm fine.
- Everything's under control.

770
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,766
- Son of a bitch!
- He's got a gun!

771
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,601
- I'm gonna kill you, Loomis!
- Jesus.

772
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,645
I'm gonna kill you, goddamn it!

773
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,822
I mean, the police said
that it wasn't even loaded, so-

774
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,825
Oh, I feel so much better.

775
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:02,119
All part of the job, I suppose.

776
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:05,372
Spoon-feeding drivel
to the masses.

777
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,958
Comes with its own bloody price,
doesn't it?

778
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,626
If you say so.

779
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,506
Just what is that tone,
Miss McDonald?

780
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:16,842
Do you think I'm crossing the line
or something?

781
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,471
I mean, do please feel free
to voice your opinion.

782
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:23,599
Well, off the record, yes.

783
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,477
Yes, actually, I think this book
crosses quite a few lines.

784
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:30,564
These are people's lives
you're toying with.

785
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:33,525
There's gonna be
serious repercussions.

786
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,450
Fuck.

787
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,702
Fuck!

788
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,871
Fuck! Fuck!

789
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,998
Fuck you, motherfucker!

790
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:54,546
Fuck!

791
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:04,890
Fucker!

792
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,408
Laurie?

793
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,538
Hey. Hey!

794
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,668
What is-?
Hey, where are you going?

795
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,586
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

796
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,589
Wait, hey! Listen, my dad called.
He was trying to find you.

797
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,049
Yeah, I bet he was.

798
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,926
Tell me you didn't know, please!

799
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,761
- Tell me you didn't know.
- Know what?

800
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:46,431
Fuck it. I mean, daddy's
little princess knows all, right?

801
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,975
What are you talking about?

802
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,394
Hey, stop. Calm down. Look at me.

803
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:51,770
What is going on?

804
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:54,815
Let me just call my dad, okay?
We can talk to him.

805
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:57,109
You know what?
I have a message for your dad.

806
01:09:57,277 --> 01:10:00,988
Tell him that Angel says
"fuck you"!

807
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:03,365
Who is Angel? Laurie!

808
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,996
Hey, fucking asshole!

809
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,539
Fuck you!

810
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,165
Hey, sweetie, did you find her?

811
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:16,587
Yes. She ran in and she ran out
screaming some shit about:

812
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,964
"Tell your dad that Angel
says 'fuck you. "'

813
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,841
Who the fuck is Angel?

814
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,969
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

815
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:30,517
I want you to head to my house
and keep an eye on Annie for me.

816
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,228
Oh, boss, last year she tried
to kick me in the nuts.

817
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,855
You know she's not gonna like this.

818
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,231
Don't care what she likes.

819
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,817
Now head over to my place
and if she kicks you out...

820
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,486
...you just sit outside with a shotgun
on your lap...

821
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,573
- ... like you did last year, all right?
- Yes.

822
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:02,758
Look, can I crash here tonight,
please?

823
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,593
Yeah, okay.

824
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,386
What's up?

825
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,349
Look, I just found
something out that's kind of...

826
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,893
...freaking me the fuck out.

827
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:15,228
Okay. What is it?

828
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,273
I went into this bookstore...

829
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,442
...and I got this book and...

830
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:24,488
- ... inside there's a bunch of pictures-
- Check me out, man.

831
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:26,949
Fucking sick, huh?

832
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:31,578
I'm a chick dressing up as a dude
who wants to be a chick.

833
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:34,498
- Shut up.
- What? Who died?

834
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,877
Shit, baby,
did somebody really die?

835
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,547
I'm not me.

836
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:47,803
I'm not me. Do you understand
what the fuck I'm saying?

837
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,013
Not really.

838
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,392
Who are you then?

839
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,312
I'm Angel Myers.

840
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:01,024
Michael Myers' sister.

841
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,486
All right, even I wouldn't
fucking touch that joke.

842
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,613
You can't kid around about that shit.

843
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:10,158
- You're such a good little actress-
- I am not fucking joking!

844
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,161
All right, if you fucking think I'm lying,
look at this.

845
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:14,663
All right? Look.

846
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,873
There's me, Angel Myers.

847
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,252
And here's my fucked-up life.

848
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,547
Fuck.

849
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,757
Maybe it's a mistake.

850
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,763
Holy shit, dude.

851
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:33,473
This is fucking insane.

852
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:36,476
Our next guest gained infamy
as a psychologist...

853
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,603
...for America's leading serial killer.

854
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,064
"Leading serial killer"?
The most notorious.

855
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:43,066
"Leading"?
He's number one in his field.

856
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,986
Anyway, his new book is called
The Devil Walks Among Us...

857
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:48,697
...is available somewhere.
Welcome Dr. Samuel Loomis.

858
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,826
- Dr. Loomis.
- Hi, David. How are you?

859
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,661
- Have a seat.
- Hi, everyone.

860
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,372
Thank you. Thank you. Very nice.

861
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,750
- Mr. Weird, how are you?
- Al's good.

862
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,418
Great.

863
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,380
Now, you've been criticized
and in some circles...

864
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,925
...outright accused of profiteering
off the misery of others.

865
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,803
I mean, how do you even
respond to that criticism?

866
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,473
Well, you know, I think that's
completely unfounded.

867
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,725
I always get permission
when I do the parody.

868
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,643
No, Al, I was talking to Loomis.

869
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,187
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

870
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,981
No, no, no, please.
It was fascinating, your answer.

871
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,400
- Your turn. I'm done.
- If you've got something...

872
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,155
Actually, I take great issue
with that statement.

873
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:35,285
Besides, I might say that I've endured
quite a lot of misery of my own...

874
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,913
...in order to tell this story.

875
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,373
Yeah, everyone feels
real bad for you except-

876
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,710
I have never ever been
so humiliated in all my life!

877
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:46,379
- You were fantastic. Trust me.
- Nonsense!

878
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,590
- Good night. Thank you.
- Thank you.

879
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,484
- Trick or treat.
- Here you go.

880
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,778
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

881
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:24,292
Are you a giant?

882
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,712
Can we be friends?

883
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:34,010
Mark, come on.
Don't talk to strangers.

884
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,345
Bye.

885
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:42,686
I wanna party. I've spent
my whole fucking life being good...

886
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:44,479
...and look where it's gotten me.

887
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,815
Fucking nowhere.

888
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,402
Fuck it, you guys.

889
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,779
Are you guys with me or not?

890
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,658
I just- I think that
we should stay back.

891
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,660
I mean, what you need
is a mellow night.

892
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,872
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, definitely. We can just...

893
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,456
...watch TV or something.

894
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,584
Yeah, like, order some food...

895
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,878
...and figure all this shit out.

896
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,463
I want...

897
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,258
...to go party!

898
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:18,430
I wanna fucking get drunk.
I don't fucking care anymore.

899
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:22,893
I want to fucking party!

900
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,062
- I wanna party.
- Well, you know me. I'm totally in.

901
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,731
Come on, she wants to party.

902
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,316
- Please?
- Oh, please?

903
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:32,736
Come on. Come on, boo-boo,
please?

904
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:35,572
All right, all right, all right. Fine.

905
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:39,326
- Has to be a chill night, though.
- Okay, a chill night.

906
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,737
What the fuck? Andy, are you seriously
planning on standing here all night?

907
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:00,323
- This is ridiculous.
- Hey, I just do what the boss tells me.

908
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,075
Well, I'm the boss of the boss...

909
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:05,745
...and I say move your shitbox
over there, Kojak. Okay?

910
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:08,873
Don't make a federal case out of it.
Turn off the damn gumballs.

911
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,834
I'll do what I gotta do.

912
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:13,837
What the fuck are you
gonna do, jackhole?

913
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:17,590
- You'll find out.
- I'll find out?

914
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,385
I'm shaking in my boots.

915
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,642
Okay, why don't we get back
to the music.

916
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,894
I get another drink.

917
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,564
Good idea, huh?

918
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:38,069
Let's go. Captain Clegg
and the Night Creatures.

919
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,246
Yeah!

920
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,726
- Do you like my outfit?
- I do, I do.

921
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,895
What are you supposed to be?
A sexy vampire?

922
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:16,066
I'm a chick who's dressing up
as a dude who wants to be a chick.

923
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,568
But you are a chick, though, right?

924
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:20,403
- Watch your step.
- Put your hands...

925
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,822
...down my pants
and find out, Wolfman.

926
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:26,242
At this point I don't really care.
But seriously, you have a vagina?

927
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:31,122
- You're so cute.
- You're gonna like my van, though.

928
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,916
- You got a fucking van?
- Yeah.

929
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,418
It's got some drinks in there.
They're roofie-free, I swear.

930
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,630
A "blowjob"? Is that what you guys
call them still?

931
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:40,632
I call them "sucking a dick. "

932
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,844
- There she is. She's a beauty.
- She is, isn't she?

933
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,806
I had a lot of fun in this van.
And a lot of pussy.

934
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,060
The Shaggin' Wagon.

935
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,396
It's a work of art. I like her-

936
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:03,488
What's the difference between
a jack-o'- lantern and a blond?

937
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:04,906
What?

938
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,699
There is no difference.

939
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:11,746
They both have a blank expression
and they're hollow inside.

940
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:18,670
I like them, you know what I mean?
You shut the lights off, they glow.

941
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:20,880
The ladies seem to like it.

942
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,341
Yeah? The ladies love it?

943
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:25,927
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

944
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,513
- You get laid a lot?
- I get a good amount.

945
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,390
Hey, hold this, Blondie.

946
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:35,186
Now Blondie and jack-o'- lantern
both have three holes.

947
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,024
Hey, Gianova, do the trick.

948
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,985
Watch this.

949
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,073
I love it.

950
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,618
You look very pretty tonight,
by the way. Very pretty.

951
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,037
I like your tattoos. Are they real?

952
01:19:54,165 --> 01:19:56,332
- Oh, yeah. They're real.
- They're real? That's cool.

953
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,793
- I was thinking about getting-
- These are real too.

954
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:01,921
They are real. May I? That's-
They feel real.

955
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:06,593
- That's- That's nice. That's nice.
- That's it?

956
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:12,182
You big baby!

957
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,392
Go home!

958
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,229
- Talking's not working, okay?
- I'll shut up.

959
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,399
I'm gonna shut up.

960
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:32,368
Okay, look. Time out, time out.
I'll be right back.

961
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,996
- I'll be right back. One second.
- Where are you going?

962
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:38,416
I gotta take a piss. I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

963
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,543
So who says I wasn't
into the water sports?

964
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,753
A little golden shower.

965
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:45,715
That's gross. You're a trip.
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

966
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:47,926
Hurry the fuck up.

967
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:51,513
Fucking hurry up, dude.

968
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,134
Oh, my God.

969
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,887
No! No! No!

970
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,390
Oh, my God. No!

971
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,010
Welcome Dr. Samuel Loomis.

972
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,262
Thank you, thank you.

973
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,684
Dr. Donald Faber, who's
a noted abnormal psychologist-

974
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,185
He's not noted.

975
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:24,314
He says, "Nothing more
than a bloody horror show...

976
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:27,942
...showcasing Dr. Loomis'
own self-inflated ego...

977
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,361
...and never-ending quest
for fame and fortune. "

978
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,989
- Put that in your scrapbook.
- How do you swallow that?

979
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,782
Snap!

980
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,201
You got snapped on by Weird Al.

981
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:42,915
If I'd survived a shark attack, you'd
be gushing over every gory detail.

982
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,710
- Begging me to show the teeth marks.
- God, no. Horrendous.

983
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:49,631
Are you telling me there's no difference
between Michael Myers and a shark?

984
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,967
Of course there is.
Good God, don't be ridiculous.

985
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:56,638
I'm a little confused. Are we talking
about the Austin Powers Mike Myers...

986
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,599
- ... or is this-?
- It's over.

987
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:19,827
Mya!

988
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:27,585
Looking for me?

989
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,463
Do you know where Mya is?

990
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:55,488
What do you want from me?

991
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,659
It's almost time
to come home, Angel.

992
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,954
Is she ready?

993
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:04,747
Soon.

994
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:18,136
Laurie, Laurie.

995
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,138
Hey, hey! It's me, it's Mya.

996
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:22,849
- Come on.
- Oh, fuck.

997
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:30,648
Step. Steppity-steppity-step.

998
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,777
Hey, I so wanna go back in.

999
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,612
- And I wanna-
- No, no, no.

1000
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,156
- No. We're going home.
- Hey.

1001
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,782
Where's Harley?

1002
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,075
I don't know.

1003
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,994
- See, we need to go back in and-
- No.

1004
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:45,955
She went to go hang out with
some dude like she always does.

1005
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,331
She'll find her way home.

1006
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,179
Hello?

1007
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:02,847
Hey, sweetie.

1008
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:06,184
Seriously, Dad. Please stop calling.

1009
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,393
- Okay?
- Okay.

1010
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,241
I know you love me.

1011
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,202
Oh, God. I love you too.

1012
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,667
I'm glad you decided to come home.

1013
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:41,672
Running away never solves anything.
Trust me, I've tried.

1014
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,635
I'm sure they have their reasons
for not telling me.

1015
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,720
Figure it out in the morning.

1016
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:53,100
Hey, world!

1017
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,852
Guess what.

1018
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,772
I'm Michael Myers' sister!

1019
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,858
I'm so fucked!

1020
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:05,237
What am I gonna do, dude?

1021
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,990
Just take it one day at a time.

1022
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:11,869
One day at a time.

1023
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:15,665
- Annie was right.
- Maybe she's a genius.

1024
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,501
Home sweet home.

1025
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:25,883
The place is, like, spinning.

1026
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:31,555
- Want some tea?
- Yeah. What you got?

1027
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,728
Blended black/green tea?

1028
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,026
- Berry blossom-
- Yeah, berry.

1029
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:47,571
- Does it have caffeine in it?
- Yeah.

1030
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:51,784
No. Dude, I can't fucking read that?

1031
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,912
Oh, yeah, it does.

1032
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:59,333
It's okay. I'll sleep like a baby
after what we went through tonight.

1033
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,969
These cookies are so good.
You should have a cookie.

1034
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:13,681
It'll help soak up
all that alcohol rotting in your gut.

1035
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:16,517
Don't think a cookie
is gonna save me.

1036
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,776
My head.

1037
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:35,286
What the fuck?

1038
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:54,138
Annie?

1039
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:57,975
No, please.

1040
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,607
Now go have some fun.

1041
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:06,567
Okay.

1042
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,652
Annie?

1043
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,322
Annie!

1044
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,116
- No, baby!
- Oh, my God!

1045
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:15,785
Oh, my God!

1046
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:17,870
Mya, Mya, Mya!

1047
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:19,330
I need you to calm down.

1048
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:23,167
I need you to call 911. Please?
I need you to call 911.

1049
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,835
Go! Go!

1050
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,506
Oh, my God! Annie!

1051
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,884
Oh, my God, baby.

1052
01:30:32,094 --> 01:30:33,177
Fuck.

1053
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:42,645
Baby.

1054
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,106
Oh, my God.

1055
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,358
There's a girl in the-

1056
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:48,567
She's upstairs, she's-

1057
01:30:48,735 --> 01:30:52,196
I don't know if she's okay. She may be
dead, but there's blood everywhere.

1058
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,199
Stay with me.
Please stay with me. Please.

1059
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:57,034
Please, I need you, okay?

1060
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,286
Oh, my God.

1061
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,664
Oh, my God, I need you so much.

1062
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:03,165
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1063
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,000
Mya, hurry!

1064
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,628
I don't know. I'm on Cherrywood Road,
I'm not at home.

1065
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,880
I'm at- Maybe it's avenue- Hold on.

1066
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:12,675
Stay on the line.
It's Cherrywood, I know that.

1067
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:16,846
It's- We're at 1-5-
We're at 15 Cherry-

1068
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,351
Mya?

1069
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:34,446
Mya, what's happening?!

1070
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,802
It is him. Please go.

1071
01:31:57,804 --> 01:31:58,971
I'm not leaving you.

1072
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,556
Baby, I'm gonna put you down.

1073
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:02,099
- No.
- I'm gonna put you down.

1074
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,185
No.

1075
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,937
Okay.

1076
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:10,274
Okay. Hold on, baby, hold on.

1077
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:14,028
You know, Annie's gonna smell this
on my clothes and kill me.

1078
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:15,988
Sheriff Brackett.

1079
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:17,698
I just got a 911 phone call.

1080
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:21,493
- So did you dispatch?
- Yes, sir, I did.

1081
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,121
- So why are you telling me about it?
- Because, sir...

1082
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,707
...the phone call
came from your house.

1083
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:30,085
- No.
- Please, baby, please.

1084
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,963
- I'm gonna stay right here.
- It's okay.

1085
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,757
No, baby, no. I'm not leaving you.

1086
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:38,302
- It's okay. Go.
- No, I'm not gonna leave you.

1087
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:39,803
Baby? Baby?

1088
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,306
Baby? Annie?

1089
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:44,850
Annie? Stay with me.

1090
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:48,520
Stay with me. Stay with me, baby.
Stay with me, okay?

1091
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:51,690
You gotta stay with me. You gotta.

1092
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:54,902
Annie, stay with me.

1093
01:32:57,656 --> 01:32:59,531
Annie?

1094
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,993
Annie? Annie?

1095
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,173
Annie?

1096
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:32,398
Don't leave me, baby.

1097
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:49,331
Annie.

1098
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:48,098
You don't wanna go in there.
Let me handle this.

1099
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,142
Where is she?

1100
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:52,478
You don't wanna go in there, sheriff.

1101
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:57,733
No.

1102
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,278
Oh, God.

1103
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:07,701
Oh, no. Annie.

1104
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:11,038
Annie! God, no.

1105
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,207
God, please.

1106
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:16,335
Oh, God. No!

1107
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:18,796
No!

1108
01:36:57,437 --> 01:36:59,062
Stop!

1109
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,064
Stop, please!

1110
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,317
Please stop!

1111
01:37:03,485 --> 01:37:05,694
Stop! Please!

1112
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:07,237
Stop!

1113
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:13,785
Please! Please stop!

1114
01:37:14,204 --> 01:37:15,621
Stop, please!

1115
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:21,668
Stop!

1116
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:36,141
Stop.

1117
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:39,770
Please stop. Stop, please.

1118
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:43,857
Stop.

1119
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:49,655
Hey.

1120
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,366
- Are you okay?
- He's coming. Please.

1121
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:54,785
- He's coming. He's coming.
- No one's coming.

1122
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,287
- It's okay.
- He's gonna kill me.

1123
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:58,830
- Please!
- It's okay.

1124
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:00,457
I gotta take you to a hospital.

1125
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:03,001
We're gonna go to a hospital
and everything's okay.

1126
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:05,837
It's okay. It's okay.

1127
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,090
- Hurry.
- It's okay.

1128
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:11,635
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1129
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:14,429
You're all right. You're all right.
It's okay.

1130
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:54,821
Chief.

1131
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:57,240
We got another body
up on Eagle Road.

1132
01:39:57,575 --> 01:39:59,451
We got a witness.

1133
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:03,664
She saw a large man carrying a girl
away from a crash.

1134
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:07,250
The state police believe the perp
is barricaded inside of a shack...

1135
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:08,919
...just north of the crash site.

1136
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,172
Okay.

1137
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:13,507
Want me to handle it?

1138
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:21,098
- I think maybe you should drive.
- Yes, sir.

1139
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:25,435
People, roll out.
Going to Eagle Road.

1140
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:27,437
Who are you?

1141
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:33,902
You know who I am, Angel.

1142
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,155
Now...

1143
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:39,616
...repeat after me:

1144
01:40:40,451 --> 01:41:04,057
I love you, Mommy.

1145
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:07,310
Mommy, I love you! Please!
Please don't!

1146
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,272
Let me go! Let me go!

1147
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:33,962
You are surrounded.

1148
01:41:34,172 --> 01:41:36,548
Come out with your hands up.

1149
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:41,178
- Help! Help, please!
- I repeat.

1150
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,305
You are surrounded.

1151
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:46,683
- Come out with your hands up.
- Don't! Please!

1152
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,520
- purchases today to keep that
10-year yield below 3 percent.

1153
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:55,692
That's a big issue. When stock traders
start talking about Treasury yields...

1154
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:58,528
You're an asshole.

1155
01:41:58,696 --> 01:41:59,988
This is breaking news.

1156
01:42:00,156 --> 01:42:02,324
This is Chopper 2.
I wanna take you below.

1157
01:42:02,492 --> 01:42:06,369
This situation is just incredible. I
can't believe what I'm reporting, but...

1158
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:10,874
...a man who police believe to be
deceased serial killer Michael Myers...

1159
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,795
...has taken a hostage,
now identified as Laurie Strode.

1160
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:17,756
Miss Strode allegedly shot
and killed Myers herself...

1161
01:42:17,924 --> 01:42:20,050
...after being abducted
on Halloween night.

1162
01:42:20,218 --> 01:42:23,678
As if this story couldn't get more
twisted, it was revealed earlier today-

1163
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:25,722
God, no.

1164
01:42:27,016 --> 01:42:29,059
Come out with your hands up.

1165
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:32,896
You're surrounded.

1166
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:34,773
Tell me you got a shot, Caleb.

1167
01:42:34,941 --> 01:42:37,776
- No, I can't get a clean shot.
- Damn it.

1168
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:41,154
In the shack. You're surrounded.

1169
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:43,240
There is no escape.

1170
01:42:43,407 --> 01:42:46,159
Come out with your hands up.

1171
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:49,955
- Waste of fucking time.
- Chief.

1172
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:51,623
No sniper has a clean shot.

1173
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:55,210
Hey, hey, hey! Get this vehicle out
of here. Sir, get back in the car.

1174
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:57,337
- Hold this.
- Sheriff!

1175
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,257
Sheriff.

1176
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:04,719
Get up. Get up.

1177
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:09,641
There's an innocent girl in there
I might have kept safe...

1178
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:14,271
...but for your greedy fucking book.

1179
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:18,149
I wanna shoot you.
I wanna shoot you so bad.

1180
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:21,444
I wanna shoot him.
I wanna shoot him!

1181
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:23,780
- I wanna fucking shoot him!
- Sheriff, please.

1182
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:26,783
You son of a bitch!
You don't deserve to live.

1183
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:29,369
Please, I just...

1184
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:32,289
...came here because
I wanted to help.

1185
01:43:32,999 --> 01:43:36,459
There is nothing
that you have to say...

1186
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:37,836
...that I wanna hear.

1187
01:43:38,004 --> 01:43:39,713
Sheriff, please.

1188
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:41,464
You must trust me.

1189
01:43:41,674 --> 01:43:43,967
Look, this is pointless.

1190
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:47,178
Michael's never gonna respond
to hostage negotiations.

1191
01:43:48,014 --> 01:43:49,639
Get him the fuck out of here.

1192
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:51,474
Listen, I can draw him out.

1193
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:53,518
I can draw him out. I need to do this.

1194
01:43:53,686 --> 01:43:55,979
- Let me do this.
- Get him the fuck out of here!

1195
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:59,149
All right, all right!
I can walk from here, okay.

1196
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:08,617
Get out of there!

1197
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:12,329
Sheriff! I owe you.

1198
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:15,916
- I owe you this.
- Goddamn it!

1199
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:19,586
- Stand down!
- Stand down!

1200
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,181
Michael.

1201
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:36,895
She...

1202
01:44:37,063 --> 01:44:39,564
...needs to come with me.

1203
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:44,027
- Come on.
- I can't.

1204
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:46,613
He's holding me down.

1205
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:48,823
What?

1206
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:52,702
Listen to me, Laurie.
There's no one holding you down.

1207
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,537
Let me go!

1208
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,665
Listen to me, Laurie, listen! Stop!

1209
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,500
Let me go!

1210
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,880
Listen to me!

1211
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,505
Stop it!

1212
01:45:03,715 --> 01:45:07,385
- Stop! It's all in your mind.
- No! No!

1213
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:09,885
- It's all in your mind!
- Let me go!

1214
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,845
- We are ready.
- Stop!

1215
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:14,140
- It is time, Michael.
- Stop!

1216
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,935
- Take us home.
- Stop!

1217
01:45:16,935 --> 01:45:18,600
Stop!

1218
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,710
Michael, for God in hell...

1219
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:42,250
Die!

1220
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:49,590
Now!

1221
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,025
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
