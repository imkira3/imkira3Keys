2
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,159
Pardon me.

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,038
Excuse me. Step aside please.

4
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,631
Jesus Christ.

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,108
Lee's Diner. I got four down.
I need two EMS vehicles.

6
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,875
What the hell happened here?
Somebody run them over?

7
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,439
No, man, it was a fight.

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,474
One guy took them all out
in like seconds.

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,675
He's still in there.

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,953
That's him.

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,998
Turn around, mister.
Let me see your hands.

12
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,028
Slowly.

13
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,313
Military ID.

14
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,039
Expired.

15
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,997
Thirty-eight bucks.

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,438
And a toothbrush.

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,873
But no home address.

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,715
In other words, homeless.

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,110
Aggravated assault
is a second-degree felony

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,838
in this state, Mister...

21
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,675
Reacher. First name Jack.
No middle name.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,198
You're looking at 10 to 20 years

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,078
once those boys you beat
out there are fit to testify.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,389
Process him. Get him to County.

25
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,349
Two things are gonna happen
in the next 90 seconds.

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,428
Excuse me?

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,237
First, that phone over there
is gonna ring.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,879
And second...

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,910
You're gonna be wearing these cuffs
on your way to prison.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,196
Well, that is one magnificent
prophecy, Mr. Reacher.

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,158
That'll be a Major Turner

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,199
of the 110th C.I.D. Military Police
in Alexandria, Virginia.

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,160
You and those boys out there
made a mistake

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,357
operating on land
owned by the U.S. Army.

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,751
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,510
Kidnapping illegals.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,353
Selling them.

38
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,556
MPs are on their way now.

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
If it were up to me, I'd just kill you.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,431
It's just gonna keep on ringing.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,952
Sheriff Raymond Wood.

42
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,596
Who the hell are you?

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,155
The guy you didn't count on.

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,919
Thank you.

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,638
United States Army, 110.
Sergeant Leach.

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,233
Major Turner, please.

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,799
One moment, please.

48
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,349
This is Turner.

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,633
Major S. Turner?

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
This is she.
Who am I speaking to?

51
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,829
Jack Reacher.

52
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,428
No kidding.

53
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,516
Well, it's nice to finally speak.

54
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,515
Thanks for tipping us off to that Sheriff.

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,513
No, I...

56
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,148
I wanted to thank you
for helping me out of a tight spot.

57
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,193
Isn't that what Army folks
do for each other, Major?

58
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,719
Ex-Major.

59
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,195
Oh, once a Major, always a Major.

60
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,875
Where are you calling from?

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,519
Outside Independence, I think.

62
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,914
You're not sure.

63
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,390
It doesn't really matter.
I move around a lot.

64
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,035
- So I've heard.
- What else have you heard?

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,477
Oh, come on.
You're a legend around here.

66
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,551
Some folks still wonder why you left.

67
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,876
Let's just say I woke up one morning
and the uniform didn't fit.

68
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,074
United States Army, 110.
Sergeant Leach.

69
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,880
Jack Reacher for Major Turner.

70
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,433
Hold on, Major.

71
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,189
Reacher.

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,948
How's my office?

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,591
I'm sitting here now.

74
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,752
Uh, there is this big dent in the desk.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,195
And people say you made it
with someone's head.

76
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,795
Is that true?

77
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,231
Not my finest hour.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,591
You're not
in trouble again, are you?

79
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,548
I've heard you have a way of finding it.

80
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,753
Or looking for it.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,799
Yeah, I was thinking

82
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,633
maybe I owe you dinner
for what you did.

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,317
Oh, well, it took you a while
to come to that conclusion.

84
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,637
When are you coming to D.C.?

85
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,948
I'll get there eventually.

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,590
Well, then I won't
hold my breath.

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,639
You're not saying anything.

88
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,758
I'm deciding whether
I'd like you in person.

89
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,279
Which way you leaning?

90
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,588
On the fence.

91
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,757
Not sure you could handle me.

92
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,271
I am not worried.

93
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,315
Oh, worry. Just a little.

94
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,153
Take care of yourself, Reacher.

95
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,116
Jack Reacher for Major Turner.

96
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,472
Major Reacher. Sergeant Leach.
We've spoken on the phone.

97
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Welcome back.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,115
Just Reacher.

99
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,839
I'm a civilian now.

100
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,510
Yes, sir. I'll take you up.

101
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,668
I'm sorry. I was...

102
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,400
- Looking for the Major?
- Come in.

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,510
Sam Morgan. Please, come in.

104
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,028
Come in.

105
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,119
Have a seat.

106
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,631
Heard a lot about you.

107
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,790
Just stopping by to see Major Turner.

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,719
Oh... Well, that's a problem.

109
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,030
Major Turner's been relieved
of her command.

110
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,398
I spoke with her a few days ago.

111
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,073
She's been arrested.

112
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,552
Court-martial's pending.

113
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,513
On what charge?

114
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,393
Espionage.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,639
I'm assuming her duties until
a replacement is assigned.

116
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,552
Something I can help you with?

117
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,995
No. Just a personal visit.

118
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,296
You know each other from
back when you were C.O. here?

119
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,389
Nope. Never met.

120
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm sorry to give you
the bad news, Major.

121
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Ex-Major.

122
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,351
Sir, I wanted to warn you.

123
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,517
- But?
- Ordered not to.

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,033
Colonel Morgan directly.

125
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,832
Maybe you should warn me now.

126
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,759
Speak freely, Sergeant.

127
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,235
Major Turner is an excellent officer, sir.

128
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,351
Has she been assigned an attorney yet?

129
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,354
Ordered not to give out any
information about that, sir.

130
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,909
Understood.

131
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,356
Always follow orders, Sergeant.

132
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,475
Sir.

133
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Just curious.

134
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,437
Who was your D.I. in boot camp?

135
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,879
Sergeant Greene, sir.

136
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,269
Now, say if Sergeant Greene
were having legal troubles,

137
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,508
would you be able to recommend
an attorney for him?

138
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,160
Oh. Yes. Definitely.

139
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,879
I'd recommend Colonel Moorcroft
over at Fort Dyer

140
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,793
where the high-security
prisoners are confined, sir.

141
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,389
Colonel?

142
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,315
You're the assigned counsel
for Major Susan Turner.

143
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,471
I'm Jack Reacher,
former commander of the 110th.

144
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,359
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

145
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,635
Major Turner requested
under no circumstances

146
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,995
are you to be
granted visitation privileges.

147
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,312
- Why would she say that?
- Maybe she read your file.

148
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,391
"Anti-authority, anti-social..."

149
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,068
- Anti-lawyer.
- Deadbeat dad?

150
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,309
Excuse me?

151
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,671
It says here
you never paid child support.

152
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,109
I'm not a father.

153
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,310
Well, a woman named
Candace Dutton begs to differ.

154
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,353
She contacted the Army
seeking compensation

155
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,909
for her daughter, Samantha Dutton.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,433
She's 15 now.

157
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,990
- It's a mistake.
- They usually are.

158
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,435
Mother's got two priors...
Prostitution. Possession.

159
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,035
The kid's been in and out
of foster care her whole life.

160
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,676
- Any feelings about that?
- About foster care?

161
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,994
Life sucks.

162
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,315
I meant the kid.

163
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,835
I don't have a kid.
I've never heard of Candace Dutton.

164
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,991
I'm here about Major Turner.

165
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,038
What evidence do they have?

166
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,113
A hard drive containing
classified information

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,031
found in Major Turner's residence.

168
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,954
The inference being
she's selling secrets.

169
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,708
And that's it?

170
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,950
What do you want, a picture
of her wearing a burka

171
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,553
having drinks with the Taliban?

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,799
What did she tell you?

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,716
Can't talk to her until tomorrow.

174
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,952
Public Safety Exception.

175
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,679
And you accepted that?

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,471
Where'd you get your law degree?

177
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,279
Oh...

178
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,233
It's possible you were once
a good lawyer, Colonel.

179
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,873
But what I see

180
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,232
is a tired lifer who'll do anything
not to endanger his pension.

181
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,592
Let me know when you remember
what that uniform stands for.

182
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,473
Thank you.

183
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,235
How long are we supposed to do this?
I'm getting hungry.

184
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,799
Just be patient.

185
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,376
What do you think
he's eating?

186
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,469
Shut up.

187
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,713
- New gun?
- Yep.

188
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,993
Oh, it's nice.
It makes your hands look big.

189
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,718
Yeah, you like big hands?

190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,833
Put one of these in your face
in a minute, you carry on.

191
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,234
Hey. Hey, hey! Where'd he go?

192
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,880
I don't know. Maybe went to the pisser.

193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,896
You're supposed to be watching him.

194
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,957
What do you think I got,
eyes in the back of me head?

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,319
How's it going?

196
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,119
Don't.

197
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,919
Show me.

198
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,708
Throw it in back.

199
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,719
I don't like being followed.

200
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,189
I don't like being followed.

201
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,196
On the sidewalk before.

202
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,278
And in the market.

203
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,355
You're a little thief.

204
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,549
- You a cop?
- I look like a cop?

205
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,789
Narc maybe.

206
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,793
You know a lot of narcs?

207
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,189
It's the haircut.

208
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,790
Well, thanks. I did it myself.

209
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,069
So, you're looking for something weird.

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,274
See ya.

211
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,436
Are you Candace Dutton's daughter?

212
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,672
- What'd she do this time?
- Nothing.

213
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,234
I'm an old friend.

214
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,435
Yeah?

215
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,353
Well, she's not into doing
that kind of thing anymore.

216
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,232
That's not what I meant.

217
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,952
If you're looking for my mom,
I don't live with her.

218
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,913
Who do you live with?

219
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,040
You were right, Major.

220
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,318
I am tired.

221
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,992
But I'm not stupid.

222
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,514
Sergeants Mirkovich and Cibelli.

223
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,910
Two weeks ago,
Major Turner dispatches them

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,911
to Afghanistan on an investigation.

225
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,271
They file reports daily.

226
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,717
Two days ago, they're both found dead
near Bagram Air Base.

227
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,313
Shot at close range.

228
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,514
And the next day,
Major Turner's thrown in prison.

229
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,710
What do you know about Parasource?

230
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,713
Parasource?

231
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,870
It's a big military contractor. Why?

232
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,991
I don't know how
they're involved in all this,

233
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,071
but they've been following me
since I got here.

234
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,792
Whoever killed Mirkovich and Cibelli
wanted Major Turner isolated.

235
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,315
I think they're gonna kill her, too.

236
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,833
What are you talking about?

237
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,936
We have no idea if any
of these things are connected.

238
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,313
We need to get her out.

239
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,312
And might I reiterate,
she does not want you involved.

240
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,392
Do it now. And I'll call you tonight.

241
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,116
People question the value
of enhanced interrogation techniques.

242
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,510
Enhanced interrogation
techniques don't work.

243
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,589
But torture, on the other hand,
works very well.

244
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,518
Attorney-client privilege

245
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,512
goes back to the earliest days
of English Common Law.

246
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,034
It means that Major Turner
told you in confidence

247
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,797
a great deal about what she learned
from her investigation in Afghanistan.

248
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,750
How much did you tell Jack Reacher?

249
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,391
We didn't talk about that.

250
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,719
Of course you did.

251
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,915
Mmm-mmm...

252
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,993
We talked for 10 minutes.

253
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,630
Ten minutes is a very long time,

254
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,036
as you are about to learn.

255
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,229
Jack Reacher?

256
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,989
Colonel Morgan was wondering
if you had a few minutes.

257
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,231
You don't remember me, do you?

258
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,239
Anthony Espin?

259
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,673
Nah. You were still C.O.
when I got here.

260
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,115
Held back my promotion for six months.

261
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,788
Why'd I do that?

262
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,376
'Cause you were
a hard-ass prick who said

263
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,833
I jumped to conclusions.

264
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,275
I'm sure I jumped to conclusions.

265
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,559
Have a seat.

266
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,233
You're under no obligation
to say anything, Major.

267
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,989
Ex-Major.

268
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,549
Upon leaving yesterday,

269
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,437
did you attempt to contact
Major Turner?

270
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,234
Did you confront her attorney,
Colonel Moorcroft,

271
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,793
at Fort Dyer at 1100?

272
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,471
You told me not to say anything.

273
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,439
I said you didn't have to say anything.

274
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,875
Yes.

275
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,433
Yes, you confronted him?

276
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,989
Yes, I understand
I don't have to say anything.

277
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,870
For the record, you did confront
Colonel Moorcroft yesterday.

278
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,751
Can you state your
whereabouts last night

279
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,796
between 0130 and 0500?

280
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Yes.

281
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes, what?

282
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,348
Yes, I understand
I don't have to say anything.

283
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,474
Note for the record, the Major
has an injury to his hand

284
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,198
not present during yesterday's meeting.

285
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,119
We're done here.

286
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,270
At approximately 0230 this morning,

287
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,352
Colonel Archibald Moorcroft
was beaten to death.

288
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,719
You're my attorney.

289
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,640
Lieutenant Sullivan. How do you do?

290
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,194
You are hereby charged

291
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,080
with the murder
of a Judge Advocate General...

292
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,469
- Where was he killed?
- In his apartment.

293
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,832
- Off base.
- Yes.

294
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,148
This is a civilian matter.

295
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,549
As a private citizen,
the Army has no jurisdiction.

296
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,073
Turn me over to the D.C. police.

297
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,517
You're familiar with Article
10.75 of the Military Code?

298
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,432
An officer with your security clearance

299
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,432
remains subject to recall
in event of emergency.

300
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,030
You agreed to it
when you signed your discharge.

301
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,078
Welcome back to the Army, Major.

302
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,232
You're under arrest.

303
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,992
Open BA211.

304
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,436
Stand here. Don't move.

305
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,271
Espin, prisoner transfer.

306
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,359
I'll file for disclosure.

307
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,113
They'll turn over whatever
evidence they have on you.

308
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,231
There won't be any evidence.

309
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,216
What are you talking about?

310
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,073
They killed her investigators,
they killed her lawyer.

311
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,696
Evidence suggests

312
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,119
you killed Major Turner's lawyer.

313
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,475
They're gonna kill her,
then they're gonna kill me.

314
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,616
For all I know, you're part of it.

315
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,119
Hey, listen, dickhead.

316
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,758
You're the one accused of murder.

317
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,438
You wanna show me
a shred of evidence,

318
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,919
I'll defend you till kingdom come.

319
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,592
Otherwise, go to hell.

320
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,435
I apologize.

321
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,556
I think I have low blood sugar.

322
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,636
- Excuse me?
- I didn't eat this morning,

323
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,994
feel lightheaded.

324
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,470
Could you get me something
from the officers' mess?

325
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Sandwich, maybe.

326
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,839
Open the door, please.

327
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,033
We're done here.

328
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,879
Move.

329
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,391
Open BA201.

330
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,513
Ma'am, these men are here
to transfer you.

331
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,954
Who are they?

332
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,113
I asked you a question.

333
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,519
Who are they?

334
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,634
Are you gonna answer me?

335
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,508
Reacher?

336
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,514
Halt!

337
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,028
Stand down!

338
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,792
These men are here to kill you.

339
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,076
- They killed Moorcroft.
- Wait, what?

340
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,256
Last night, in his apartment.

341
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,520
And now they're gonna kill you.

342
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,278
Soldier! You know who I am!

343
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,879
I need you to stand down!

344
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,016
You've been relieved
of command, ma'am.

345
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,075
Turner, no time.

346
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,496
I'm being held here without cause.

347
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,112
It is your right to counter...

348
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,593
That soldier was under my command!

349
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,033
We don't have time for this.

350
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,277
Get his badge and his papers.

351
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,995
I left explicit orders
for you to stay away.

352
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,911
- Orders? You "ordered" me?
- Yes.

353
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,558
I knew you'd do something like this.

354
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,392
Don't make me regret it.

355
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,959
Espin? What'd you do to him?

356
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,239
He'll be fine.

357
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,228
- This is insane.
- Does this mean dinner's off?

358
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,910
- Act angry.
- I am angry.

359
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Prisoner transfer.

360
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,296
Lieutenant Sullivan coming in.

361
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Open BA211.

362
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,511
- Hey, wait a second!
- Move!

363
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,956
His keys! Give me his keys!

364
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,953
What kind of car
would my lawyer be driving?

365
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,439
A black sedan.

366
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,936
Survey the perimeter!

367
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,552
Secure the service lot!

368
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,911
- Move! Move! Close in!
- Let's go!

369
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,588
Food truck.

370
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,034
Clear!

371
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,599
They're in the food truck!

372
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,513
Stop that truck! Go, go, go, go!

373
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,829
Go, go!

374
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,792
Get them out of that truck!

375
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,995
Clear!

376
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,272
So now I'm a fugitive from justice.

377
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,749
And a traitor to your country,
don't forget that.

378
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,508
Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?

379
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,519
You have a very interesting way
of saying thank you.

380
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,791
Were those men really going to kill me?

381
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,948
Thank you.

382
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,239
Nice job.

383
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,238
Oh, his ass is mine.

384
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,791
X.O. One of our vehicles
has been hijacked. L67.

385
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,879
All units. Suspects traveling.

386
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,473
MP vehicle L67.

387
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,035
Primary is Jack Reacher.
White. Male. 40s.

388
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,553
Considered armed and dangerous.

389
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,392
Secondary is Major Susan Turner.

390
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,118
Female. Wearing military fatigues.

391
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,270
White. Age 34.

392
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,836
- Really?
- Shut up.

393
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,561
We need to ditch this car
and get into my email.

394
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,256
All right, people, let's go, let's go!

395
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,349
Where the hell are they?

396
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,795
Specialist, have the State Troopers
called back yet?

397
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,949
On it, sir.

398
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,736
All right, has anybody heard
from the Capitol Police?

399
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,194
Anybody? Anything?
A location? Something?

400
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,870
Is there still an Internet café
around here?

401
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,480
Pennsylvania and North Street.

402
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,317
Okay. Take us there, please.

403
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,470
I should have gone
to Afghanistan myself.

404
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,993
Mirkovich and Cibelli
were my responsibility.

405
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,910
The job is about giving orders.

406
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,149
You ever lose anyone
on your watch, Reacher?

407
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,190
My men weren't killed by the Taliban.

408
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,715
They were shot, in the back of the head,
with slugs from an Army-issued 9mm.

409
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,632
By one of our own.

410
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,552
I'm gonna find out who did it.

411
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,400
What were your guys doing over there?

412
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,555
What were they looking for?

413
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,239
Weapons.

414
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,752
Thousands of weapons,
decommissioned during the drawdown.

415
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,031
Whole plane load's gone missing.

416
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,150
Hey, I like your hat.

417
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,390
- You a Nats fan?
- Yeah, from the beginning.

418
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,748
They arrested me the day after
my investigators were killed.

419
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,673
With the time difference,
they might have filed another report.

420
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,475
They locked me up so I wouldn't see it.

421
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,753
Sir, she's trying to access the system.

422
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,911
- Get me that location.
- Yes, sir.

423
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,759
Pennsylvania and North Street.

424
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,510
It's Morgan.
Ready to go to work, soldier?

425
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,553
We've located them.

426
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,518
They're at an Internet café,
Pennsylvania and North Street.

427
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,279
Get it done.

428
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,576
Whatever Mi rkovich
and Cibelli found out

429
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,794
got them killed.

430
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,108
But by who?

431
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,674
Shit. They locked me out.

432
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,656
They're gonna triangulate
this I.P. address.

433
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,398
I know. Just give me a second. Okay?

434
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,840
- They will know this location.
- Let me try one last thing.

435
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,440
- They will know this location.
- Shit.

436
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,469
There's a bus stop
on the other side of the park.

437
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,513
We're being followed.

438
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,239
It's not a cop.

439
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,919
He's a pro.

440
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Where?

441
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,273
Fifty yards.

442
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,476
Black coat, brown hair.

443
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
There.

444
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,356
- They made us.
- Maybe.

445
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Restaurant.

446
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,194
Hello.

447
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,390
We're meeting someone in the back.

448
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,871
- Everybody out!
- Let's go!

449
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,559
- Out!
- Move!

450
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,072
Come on! Go, go!

451
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,113
I got this door.

452
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,590
Stay back! Stay back!

453
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,273
No, don't. Stay back!

454
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,912
Police! Freeze!

455
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,992
Drop your weapon.

456
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,197
Sir, I said drop your weapon.

457
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,793
I'm military police!

458
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,196
He's not a cop!

459
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,158
Sir, drop your weapon!

460
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,514
I'm military police.

461
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,910
Sir, I need you to drop your weapon.

462
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,793
Listen, I know what this looks like.

463
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,576
Sir, turn around
and let me see your hands!

464
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,670
I'm putting my weapon down.
Listen to me.

465
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,795
I'm military police.

466
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,758
These two are fugitives
of the United States Army.

467
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,593
I understand. I'm turning around.

468
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,478
Place your hands
behind your head. Now!

469
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,320
My identification's
in my right front pocket.

470
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,395
Will you just check it?

471
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,954
Just check.

472
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,789
Go! Move, move! Go!

473
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,469
We got our signals crossed.

474
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,399
He's good.

475
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,828
We'll get him next time.

476
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,869
You know, I admit to being
a little jealous when we talk.

477
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,713
Go where you want.

478
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,272
Eat when you want.

479
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,628
Nobody telling you
what to do or how to do it.

480
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,591
It's definitely not the Army way.

481
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,679
Exactly.

482
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,031
Let's take a look at that registration.

483
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,952
Parasource?

484
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,349
You think that guy in the kitchen
was one of theirs?

485
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,715
Freelance is my guess.

486
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,915
Go.

487
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,832
Made a mess, I hear.

488
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,629
This Reacher guy is interesting.

489
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,992
You have no idea.
They ran out of medals.

490
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,993
So don't make this a competition.

491
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,389
Too late.

492
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,755
Sure you can handle him by yourself?

493
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,712
I can handle him just fine.

494
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,393
Prove it.

495
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,432
- Coffee?
- Cream?

496
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
No.

497
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,479
Right sizes.

498
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Good eye.

499
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,238
I spent the rest of our cash.

500
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,318
It's time we stopped running
and start hunting.

501
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,629
Morgan.

502
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,392
Catch you at a bad time?

503
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,556
I hope you're calling
to turn yourselves in.

504
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,056
I don't know your role
in this yet, Colonel.

505
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,274
I'm guessing money.

506
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,590
I promise you I will find out.

507
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,511
Nobody's gonna find anything.

508
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,830
Not even in Major Turner's email?

509
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,114
- Find it yet?
- Nothing to find.

510
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,431
You're not looking hard enough.

511
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,478
Why don't we check my field reports?

512
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,270
I will snap the tendon
before it breaks the bone.

513
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,588
It takes longer to heal.

514
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,478
Locked. Need the code.

515
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,679
1209#.

516
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,394
Mirkovich and Cibelli's field reports.

517
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,799
What else you got on here, huh?

518
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,759
You think you're invulnerable.

519
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,279
Almost done uploading.

520
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,112
But there are ways to get
at you, Reacher.

521
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,555
Got it.

522
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,870
Thanks for all your help, Colonel.

523
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,474
Okay. Mirkovich and Cibelli
did file a final report.

524
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,233
"Warlords..."

525
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,189
Okay, here we go.

526
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,316
The last man they spoke to
was a contractor

527
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,072
named Daniel Prudhomme.

528
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,392
He oversaw weapons transports.
Said he was evasive

529
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,118
then he disappeared.

530
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,630
This is Leach.

531
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,836
This is Sergeant Greene,
your old D.I. Remember me?

532
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,160
Sergeant Greene.
So good to hear from you.

533
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,536
I'm here
with a friend of yours.

534
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
We need a favor.

535
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,070
There's a military contractor
called Parasource.

536
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,240
Think you could ask around,

537
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,880
find out what role
they played in Bagram?

538
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,912
I might be able to do that.

539
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,674
Also there's a Parasource
employee named Prudhomme.

540
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,988
We need his whereabouts.

541
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,998
Prudhomme. Copy that.

542
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,593
And, Sergeant.

543
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Carefully.

544
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Sir, yes, sir.

545
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,229
Reacher.

546
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,875
Clear.

547
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,074
Reacher.

548
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,111
Hey, stop, hey!

549
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,519
Let go of me!

550
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,116
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Hey, hey, hey!

551
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,668
Samantha.

552
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,190
It's okay. It's okay.

553
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,949
I don't understand.
You said you're not a cop.

554
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,189
I'm not.

555
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,472
What's military police?

556
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,993
It's different.

557
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,074
But you stole this car.

558
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,870
It's complicated.

559
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,712
Where are you taking me?

560
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,868
We don't know yet.

561
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,558
- Hey, do you have a phone?
- Why?

562
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
Just give it to me.

563
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,656
I left it in the apartment
where you kidnapped me.

564
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,113
We didn't kidnap you.

565
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,396
Kidnapping is a federal offense.

566
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,349
Look at me, kid.

567
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,033
There are people out there
who want to hurt you.

568
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,473
I feel sick.

569
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,592
Just put your head out the window.

570
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,709
It doesn't open.

571
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,696
Hey, when was the last time
you had something to eat?

572
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,314
- I don't know.
- We need to get her some food.

573
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,391
How long have you been drawing?

574
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,471
I don't know. Why?

575
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,158
Just asking.

576
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,399
They suck.

577
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,352
Whatever you say.

578
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,392
Beth and Herb were these
two nice old hippies.

579
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,079
Who'd want to kill them?

580
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,959
You've had a shock.

581
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,393
Your body's pumping adrenaline.

582
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,835
Cortisol. They call it fight or flight.

583
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,959
It's gonna take a while to calm down.

584
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Here.

585
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,391
I can't eat. I'm pumping adrenaline.

586
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,638
I know a place she'll be safe.

587
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,029
What does that mean?

588
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,799
I'm not going to a stupid school.

589
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,960
They have a dress code.
This is what they wear there.

590
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,150
I know the headmistress.
You'll be safe there.

591
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,993
"Headmistress?" What is it, a convent?

592
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,238
Do you want to live?

593
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Do you?

594
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,589
Yes.

595
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,073
Then you will go where we say
and stay until we say it's safe.

596
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,078
Do you understand?

597
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,673
You're very intense. You know that?

598
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,713
Yeah, I understand.

599
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,552
- What are you doing here?
- Reacher has the girl.

600
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,915
You were supposed to take care of that.

601
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,115
You people.

602
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,589
You take off the uniform
and lose all discipline.

603
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,672
How did he find her?

604
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,319
Exactly.

605
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,079
How did he?

606
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,674
How would I know?

607
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,718
When he was here, earlier today.

608
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,599
You're watching me now?

609
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,591
Who the hell do you think you are?

610
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,433
What did you give him?

611
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,233
What are you talking about?

612
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,791
What did you give him?

613
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,193
I don't have to be interrogated
by the likes of you.

614
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,510
He came in here with that
bitch and threatened me.

615
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,079
I gave him nothing.

616
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,549
What's so funny?

617
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,634
We hired you to clean up this mess.

618
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,194
You're right.

619
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,192
He touched this phone, didn't he?

620
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,869
So?

621
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,632
That means his prints are on it. Huh?

622
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,593
I mean, really,
if I had any other choice...

623
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,671
It should only be for a few days.

624
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,399
You know how we feel about
you here at Pembroke, Susan.

625
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,879
Well, thank you.

626
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,599
- It's so nice to see you.
- It's good to see you, too...

627
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,555
Show me what you feel.
You are not a camera.

628
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,110
What do you feel about these hands?

629
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,550
Are these nurturing hands?

630
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,711
Have they held children?
Do they carry pain?

631
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,869
Why do we draw?

632
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,117
Welcome to Pembroke. Hi, I'm Olivia.

633
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,309
And I'm May.

634
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,635
Carla.

635
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,313
Come sit with us.

636
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,359
Where'd you go before this?

637
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,714
Different places.

638
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,878
Ooh, travel's really good
for college applications.

639
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,793
Have you taken the PSATs yet?

640
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,360
You need to sign up right away.

641
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,816
May! Oh, my God, your earrings!

642
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,909
Where'd you get them?

643
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,880
Oh, thank you. Actually, my dad
brought them back from New York.

644
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,269
Ah! My parents promised me
some intense retail therapy

645
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,873
when we're in Paris for Christmas.

646
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,951
Wow, Paris.
You guys have been everywhere.

647
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,456
It's beautiful. I've been three times.

648
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,629
Have you ever been?

649
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,711
- No, actually not.
- Can you imagine Christmas?

650
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,837
- It's great. The Eiffel Tower.
- Have you been in it?

651
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,176
Yeah, three times, girl!

652
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,633
Aren't you going to Spain?

653
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,336
You guys are doing
a lot of traveling.

654
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,656
It's awesome.

655
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,672
I'll probably stick around at home.
The usual.

656
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,073
She's gonna do fine.

657
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,350
I don't want you to worry.

658
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,515
What are you doing?

659
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,477
You said you didn't have a phone.

660
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,959
How many times did you use this?

661
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,553
In my life?

662
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,671
Let's go. Get your things.

663
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,390
It was nothing. Just one person.

664
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,637
- Excuse me. We have to go. Thank you.
- It was nothing.

665
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,836
Nance, give me one second. Hey!

666
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,831
Hey, what the hell is going on?

667
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,911
- She was texting.
- Shit!

668
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,355
- What's wrong with that?
- One, they can trace us.

669
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,839
Come on, let's go.

670
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,115
Get in.

671
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,191
God, that place was ridiculous.

672
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,317
That place changed my life.

673
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,231
Sorry about the phone.

674
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,995
Go.

675
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,231
Did some digging about Parasource.

676
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,670
Some of their boys
got into trouble in Afghanistan.

677
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,752
They lost some
big government contracts.

678
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,512
Word is they're in financial trouble.

679
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,398
Why does he get to have a phone?

680
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,914
- This Daniel Prudhomme...
- Hold on. You need to be quiet.

681
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,794
'Kay, sorry. Daniel Prudhomme.
Keep going.

682
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,750
The contractor our guys talked to,
he lives in New Orleans.

683
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,509
He disappeared right after
he was interrogated.

684
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,035
Hitched a ride back home
to his wife and kids.

685
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,111
New Orleans
is Parasource's home base.

686
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,160
They know he's back
and they're looking for him.

687
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,679
We're going to New Orleans.

688
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,438
- Sir, there's something else.
- Yep?

689
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,793
Colonel Morgan was killed.

690
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,192
Your prints were found
on the murder weapon.

691
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,913
Appreciate your help, Sergeant.

692
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,640
We need to find Prudhomme
before Parasource gets a hold of him.

693
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,199
There's an airport at Norfolk.

694
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,632
- We'll need credit cards.
- And IDs.

695
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,669
American Express. Visa.

696
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,589
Discover.

697
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,195
"Daddy is so happy with my SATs
and extracurricular activities,

698
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,679
"he's takin' us all to New Orleans."

699
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,475
Unless you want me to shut up.

700
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,033
You little shit.

701
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,078
Sure about this?

702
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,269
No.

703
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,952
Want me to do it?

704
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,395
No.

705
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,113
Tan jacket.

706
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,349
Yeah.

707
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,359
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

708
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,839
No problem.

709
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,153
Enjoy your flight.

710
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,634
If you're seated
in an emergency exit row,

711
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,792
please review the responsibilities
for emergency exit seating

712
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,950
on the back
of the safety information card

713
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,474
located in the seat pocket
in front of you.

714
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,752
Haven't flown before?

715
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,680
Here.

716
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You're kidding.

717
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,280
I don't want you puking on me.

718
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,799
I'm not gonna puke.

719
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,949
Good.

720
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,629
So, how long have you been
in the Army for?

721
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,188
Uh...

722
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,478
- Ten years.
- Oh, wow.

723
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,791
- What's your rank?
- Major.

724
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,314
So, if you give a guy orders,
he has to obey.

725
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,550
Like, fast.

726
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,914
Yeah.

727
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,549
And if he tries messing with you,
you know, like, all kinds of moves, right?

728
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
A few.

729
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,997
Oh, that's badass.

730
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,351
Can I learn some?

731
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,640
Sure.

732
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,354
- You're not married, right?
- No.

733
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,394
Are you gay?

734
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,536
I mean, it's totally cool.
I know tons of lesbians.

735
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,629
No, I'm not gay.

736
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,631
I thought all lady soldiers are gay.

737
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,515
Well, some are, some aren't.
Like out in the real world.

738
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,912
So, is Reacher

739
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,069
your boyfriend?

740
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,790
No.

741
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,589
- Friends with benefits.
- Uh, no.

742
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,117
You mean no, you don't want to,
or no, he doesn't want to, or no, not yet,

743
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,633
you guys haven't really...

744
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,950
All right. I see how it is.

745
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,199
My dad was military.

746
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,640
Really?

747
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,553
Never met him.

748
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,550
He left before I was born.

749
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,472
Where was he stationed?

750
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,230
Around D.C., I guess.

751
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,879
What was his name?

752
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,471
Candy won't talk about him.

753
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,152
- Candy? Oh.
- My mom.

754
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,391
Just says he was a big hero
and a total asshole.

755
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,936
We're beginning our descent,

756
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,936
so if you need to stretch your
legs or use the lavatories,

757
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,393
you should do it now.

758
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,113
I'll be right back.

759
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,638
It's the haircut.

760
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,354
All you contractors
go to the same barber?

761
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,639
Check it.

762
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,597
Oh, he's not feeling well.

763
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,113
You might want to use this one.

764
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,600
Go.

765
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,276
Took two more of your pieces
off the board.

766
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,113
They were the B team.

767
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,715
What were you? JSOC? SEAL Team?

768
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,549
- Something like that.
- When'd you get back?

769
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,556
I'm not sure I ever did.

770
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,274
Don't you miss it?

771
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,389
Not a bit.

772
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,398
I think you do, drifter.

773
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,078
People like us,
we can never go back to the world.

774
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,437
We hurt people.

775
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,235
And the people around us get hurt.

776
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,312
Leave Turner to me.

777
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,632
Walk away now and I won't
hurt the little girl.

778
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,433
You coming to New Orleans?

779
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,472
I'm thinking about it.

780
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,114
Look me up.

781
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,475
I will.

782
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,749
Stairs. Go, go, go.

783
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,152
Go! Go!

784
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,320
Go.

785
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,395
Go. Go.

786
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,349
Wait, wait, wait!

787
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,756
Welcome to Louis Armstrong

788
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,229
New Orleans International Airport.

789
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,838
Now, you're gonna tell me
what's going on,

790
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,996
or the first chance I get,
I'm gonna scream

791
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,274
or grab a policeman.

792
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,235
- Okay, look...
- We're protecting you.

793
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,150
- I found out that some...
- Look, you don't...

794
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,798
- Can you stop?
- Just...

795
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,791
Some people were stealing
from the government.

796
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,915
Stealing what?

797
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,634
At this point,
the less you know, the better.

798
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,600
Bullshit! I got us the credit card, okay?

799
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,870
We wouldn't have gotten
on that plane without it.

800
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,479
They're after me, too.

801
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,599
Why?

802
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,837
You need to tell her.

803
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,432
They think you're my daughter.

804
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,594
That's funny?

805
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,397
You're not my father.

806
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,755
How do you know?

807
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,030
Well, why would you think you are?

808
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,760
Because your mother
filed a paternity suit

809
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,358
with the Army claiming I was.

810
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,879
All we have available
is a lovely two-bedroom suite,

811
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,235
$350 a night. Will that do?

812
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,311
Yes. Can I pay in cash?

813
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,108
So, we gonna take a DNA test?

814
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,112
Little busy right now.

815
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,952
I got to tell you something.

816
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,792
You're gonna get angry.

817
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,471
This whole thing is my fault.

818
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,480
How's that?

819
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,997
I was the one who made her
file the paternity thing.

820
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,948
I thought maybe
she could get something out of it.

821
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,040
Money.

822
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,798
Child support.

823
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,836
Help her get her life together.

824
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,435
She's doing better since she got out.

825
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,153
Got a job.

826
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,197
Maybe she could get a little house.

827
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,068
You're mad.

828
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,510
I can see it in your face.

829
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,908
I'm not mad.

830
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,509
Yes, you are. They think I'm your kid,

831
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,200
so you have to worry about
protecting me.

832
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,840
Yeah.

833
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,275
So?

834
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,668
So I don't want to be here.

835
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,720
So you don't want me here.
So I should just leave.

836
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,035
Okay.

837
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,913
Where you gonna go?

838
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,309
I got, uh, food.

839
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,312
- Oh, God!
- Thanks.

840
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,709
- I'm starving. Thanks.
- Yeah.

841
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,034
She's out.

842
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,513
Our dinner date.

843
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,191
Champagne is still chilling.

844
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,350
I knew you were the romantic type.

845
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,594
So, Reacher, after those phone calls,

846
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,757
what exactly
did you think would happen?

847
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,350
I thought a nice dinner,
maybe some wine.

848
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,554
And after dinner?

849
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,630
Back to your place, maybe.

850
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,675
As opposed to your seedy motel?

851
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,151
Never underestimate the charm
of a seedy motel.

852
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,511
I can see the appeal.

853
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,997
What do you say
we look for a seedy motel

854
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,519
once I find Prudhomme?

855
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,313
I'll go with you.

856
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,838
Only one of us should go.

857
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,874
So I'll go.

858
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,631
No, someone needs to stay here
with her.

859
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,432
What, because I'm a woman
I should be the babysitter?

860
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,911
I don't know how to be the babysitter.

861
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,832
- You think that I do?
- Yes.

862
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,360
You know, I've had to
put up with this crap

863
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,515
my entire career.

864
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,795
Forget the dickheads
who think that they can paw me,

865
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,456
- it's every male officer...
- Hey, hey, excuse me.

866
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,976
...who thinks that he's smarter
and tougher...

867
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,433
You've been relieved of command.

868
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,736
I am the commanding officer here!

869
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,400
You are a fugitive from military justice.

870
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,480
So are you!

871
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,232
So we're both criminals.

872
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,113
I'm going.

873
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,231
That's a bad idea, Major.

874
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,557
Thank you.

875
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,548
Mrs. Prudhomme?

876
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,592
Look, I told you people
I don't know where he is, okay?

877
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,589
Mrs. Prudhomme, I'm an MP.

878
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,436
- He's done with all of that.
- It's for his own protection.

879
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,191
He needs my help.

880
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,519
Yeah, well,

881
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,032
he needs all the help he can get,
that's for damn sure.

882
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,873
Does he have any friends?

883
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,280
Places?

884
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,272
Places he hangs out.

885
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,511
Any place there's dope is where.

886
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,833
You have a photo?

887
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,235
Yeah.

888
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,314
You can burn it for all I care.

889
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,271
Good evening.

890
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,591
You followed me in here.

891
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,878
That was a mistake.

892
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,830
And you didn't think
we were watching the wife.

893
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,796
That was a mistake.

894
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,400
Maybe.

895
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,639
So how do you want to do this?

896
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,037
How about one at a time?
I get a baseball bat.

897
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,314
Where's Turner?

898
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,438
Really?

899
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,233
If you were gonna kill me,
you would have done it by now.

900
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,038
Oh, we're not gonna kill you.

901
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,793
Not until you beg for it.

902
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,871
And you're gonna beg.

903
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,391
Left or right?

904
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,471
Turner's gonna call me in two minutes.

905
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:21,670
If I don't answer, if I don't pick up,
if I sound distressed,

906
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,113
she's in the wind.

907
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,639
You're bluffing.

908
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,559
Go for it.

909
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,056
And now you're wondering
how you're gonna make me talk

910
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,752
without tipping her off.

911
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,478
You can't torture me.

912
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,239
You can't kill me.

913
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,229
And you're definitely
gonna have to kill me.

914
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,309
Give me the phone.

915
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,960
Wait.

916
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,554
Toss it over.

917
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,479
Fellas?

918
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,714
I told you people,
I don't like being followed.

919
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,392
You're good, Jack!

920
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,671
Killing you
isn't gonna be enough, though.

921
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,456
So I'm gonna take back
my promise about

922
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,879
not hurting the little girl.

923
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,519
It's never gonna happen.

924
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,270
Sure it is. One day,

925
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,552
she'll be walking home from school

926
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,551
or she'll be out on a date

927
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,394
or hanging out with her friends.

928
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:18,476
And you won't be there to protect her.

929
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,096
Okay, so let's try it again.

930
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,936
This time I want you to take the gun
and hold it lower on your chest, okay?

931
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,096
You're holding it a bit too high.

932
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,348
- Okay.
- So grab it.

933
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,696
Yeah, bring it low. That's right.

934
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,039
Now step out and rotate.

935
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,191
- Nice. Good.
- Yeah?

936
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,950
Hi, Reacher. Check this out.

937
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,872
- Ready?
- Yep.

938
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,434
Grab.

939
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,879
- Good. Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah?

940
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,799
What do you think?

941
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,558
Well, trust me,
if all you have left is that move,

942
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,920
just assume you're dead already.

943
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,515
That was good.

944
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,797
Let's try again. We're gonna add
a kick to the balls into it, okay?

945
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,976
Welcome to New Orleans, Captain.

946
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,069
I'm Lieutenant Decoudreau.

947
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,639
We're here to help any way we can.

948
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,948
What do you have for me?

949
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,917
Guys on the plane were ex-military.

950
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,479
Beat up pretty bad.

951
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,816
Do we know who they're working for?

952
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,034
Claim to be unemployed.

953
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,908
Yeah, right.

954
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,197
I want their bank records,
service records, foreign travel,

955
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,111
gun registration, car registration,

956
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,536
how they like their eggs,
their favorite flavor of ice cream.

957
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,560
And I want it yesterday.

958
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,600
Sir, yes, sir.

959
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,393
Is she asleep?

960
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,071
I spoke to Prudhomme's wife.

961
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,076
Turns out he's a junkie.

962
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,911
She didn't know where he was.

963
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,831
But she gave me a photo.

964
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,558
Are you more upset that
I treated you like a woman

965
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,471
or that I treated you like a man?

966
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,109
I'm upset that I didn't deck you.

967
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,640
I should have been the one
to go talk to her.

968
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,756
I can handle myself.
I would've done better.

969
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,840
Maybe.

970
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,839
Appreciate the apology.

971
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,193
Is it really so important that
you make every decision?

972
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,759
Oh, God, you're such a dick.

973
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,035
You know...

974
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,399
Okay, I...

975
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,074
I'm used to working alone.

976
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,872
I'm used to being alone.

977
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,080
Obviously.

978
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,912
I'm trying to apologize.

979
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Go on.

980
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,592
What do you think we should do?

981
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,834
- Don't patronize me, okay?
- I'm asking your opinion.

982
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,713
Well, we could go to the V.A.

983
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,576
Which is the first place
Parasource will look.

984
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,736
How about the local MPs then?

985
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,040
Who'll arrest us in a heartbeat.

986
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,952
Okay, what is your plan then, Reacher?

987
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,831
See, you don't know what to do.

988
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,880
You're like something feral.

989
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,679
You've got their scent in your nose
and all you want is blood.

990
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,031
You still don't get it, do you?

991
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,230
They killed my men,
took away my job, my life!

992
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,717
I don't want them as bad as you,
I want them more.

993
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,752
Could you go see if she's up?

994
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,957
We should get some breakfast,
figure out our next move.

995
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,512
- What do we do with the kid?
- The kid has a name.

996
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,159
I know that.

997
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,158
Why are you so tough on her?

998
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,679
It's a hard world.

999
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,872
The sooner she knows it, the better.

1000
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,116
You don't think she knows that already?

1001
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,550
Reacher, what if she is yours?

1002
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,193
Then I should have been there
15 years ago.

1003
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,720
Sam?

1004
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,513
Nah, she's not here.

1005
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,238
- I'll go get dressed.
- And go where?

1006
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,919
Did she say anything to you?

1007
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,919
She said she should leave.

1008
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,509
What's up?

1009
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,592
- Where were you?
- Out.

1010
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,680
Are you crazy?

1011
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,115
- I was trying to help.
- How were you gonna help, huh?

1012
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,680
You guys said Prudhomme's a junkie.

1013
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,720
- We never told you...
- I heard you guys talking.

1014
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,576
Some dude on the street
said there's a place

1015
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,511
in the Ninth Ward
where homeless vets hang out.

1016
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,350
Some old warehouse.

1017
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,272
People talk to me. It's a thing.

1018
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,096
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that was?

1019
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,872
I told you I can take care of myself.

1020
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,270
Fifteen years old, people are
looking for you, okay.

1021
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,256
When things get hairy,
I just pick out the alpha guy.

1022
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,376
And what, he's supposed to protect you?

1023
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,118
No, I give him shit.

1024
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,393
Strong guys don't hurt you.
The weak guys do that.

1025
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,950
Strong guys always have little sisters.

1026
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,276
Or they want one.

1027
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,316
I don't know why, that's just how it is.

1028
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,677
I'm really tired.

1029
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,073
I can't do this.

1030
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,079
That was really stupid.

1031
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,720
I know.

1032
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,070
Please don't ever do that again.

1033
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,149
You're welcome.

1034
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,640
Hey.

1035
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,672
Let's go find Prudhomme.

1036
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,799
Excuse me, sir.
Can you look at this picture, please?

1037
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,515
Well, folks call it the
ninth circle of hell.

1038
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,114
If he's a vet, that's where he's gonna be.

1039
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,240
Thank you.

1040
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,199
I have money

1041
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,671
for Daniel Prudhomme!

1042
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,079
How much?

1043
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,199
More than he needs.

1044
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,839
Well, how much?

1045
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,639
You know Prudhomme?

1046
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,154
It depends.

1047
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,113
It's a simple question.

1048
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,112
What do you want with him?

1049
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,712
I told you.
I want to give him money.

1050
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,312
You are
Daniel Prudhomme, right?

1051
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,559
Specialist Daniel Prudhomme.

1052
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,872
Yes, ma'am.

1053
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,793
You worked for Parasource.

1054
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,631
Now, you spoke to two MPs.

1055
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,791
Sergeants Mirkovich and Cibelli.

1056
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,999
They interviewed you in Bagram.

1057
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,352
No. No, I never heard of them.

1058
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,315
Sergeants Mirkovich and Cibelli.

1059
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,550
Mirkovich had a six-year-old daughter.

1060
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,756
Cibelli's wife is pregnant
with their first.

1061
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,997
Now, you're gonna tell me
what happened!

1062
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,548
They'll kill me.

1063
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,959
She'll kill you.

1064
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,879
Now, we'll protect you.

1065
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,791
But you have to tell us all of it.

1066
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,874
Parasource was running
truck convoys out of Bagram.

1067
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,750
We just ran security for the base.

1068
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,991
All I had to do was just lie and say
all the weapons were all accounted for.

1069
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,512
They gave me a shitload of money
to keep my mouth shut.

1070
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,397
We're leavi ng enough shit
over there now

1071
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,754
to start another war.

1072
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,192
Parasource was selling off the weapons

1073
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,748
instead of bringing them
back to the States.

1074
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,709
What went wrong?

1075
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:40,192
Warlords want to renegotiate.
Parasource says no.

1076
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,353
Next day, we're driving
through those poppy fields.

1077
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,635
The whole convoy just gets lit up.

1078
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,270
I was scared shitless.

1079
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,872
Army had to send in
a Search and Rescue.

1080
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,873
Three Search and Rescue dudes
get wasted on the way.

1081
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,958
Two of the dudes I knew, man.

1082
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,115
What happened
after you gave your statement?

1083
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,995
Nothing. I told them everything.

1084
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,150
There was this guy.
He worked for Parasource.

1085
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,553
He told me not to worry,
that he'd take care of everything.

1086
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,195
Next thing I know,
I hear they've been killed.

1087
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,434
I went AWOL.

1088
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,511
I h itched a ride back to the States.

1089
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,590
I was a dead man if I stayed.

1090
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,035
I, uh...

1091
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,475
I started shooting up over there.

1092
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,592
I figured if I'd just
get myself home, you know, I...

1093
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,476
I'd get myself right.

1094
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,679
But you didn't.

1095
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,033
No.

1096
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,432
More shit on the streets of New Orleans

1097
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,034
than they're making in Afghanistan.

1098
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,678
Something's wrong.

1099
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,589
- The numbers don't add up.
- What do you mean?

1100
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,716
Why put huge government
contracts at risk

1101
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,519
while selling U.S. Army weapons
on the black market?

1102
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,159
Parasource is smarter than that.

1103
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,077
Yeah, they're smart all right.

1104
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,518
What about on our end?

1105
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,830
Didn't anybody check to see
the crates were empty?

1106
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,679
Probably some dumb guy like me.

1107
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,869
We need to get inside
one of those transports.

1108
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,189
Um...

1109
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,235
Plane leaves Bagram
every Friday at 0600 hours.

1110
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,233
Six hours to Frankfurt.

1111
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,074
Rest, refuel, eleven more to get home.

1112
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,832
Jesus, that's 10:00 tonight.

1113
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,961
And that was without the hot sauce.

1114
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,591
Now, you gotta tell me
that was worth it, sir.

1115
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,274
Hey, hey, where you at, chief?

1116
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,279
- Ooh, you know, you one fine muffaletta!
- No, no, no.

1117
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,696
- No, thank you, ma'am. I'm good.
- Wait a minute.

1118
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,256
Now, don't go depriving
a poor girl a taste now.

1119
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,696
I have no money.
I don't need your services.

1120
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,119
- Not today, darling.
- Okay.

1121
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,111
- Well, it's his loss now.
- Go on now.

1122
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,588
All right.

1123
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,634
- Do I have my wallet?
- Yeah, I think you're good.

1124
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,278
All right, I got my wallet.

1125
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,475
- You do it?
- Just like we negotiated.

1126
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,552
- Well?
- It's done.

1127
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,988
Make the call.

1128
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,717
Is that you?

1129
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,080
No, sir, it's not me.

1130
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,280
Who is this?

1131
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,756
I have a witness who can exonerate me.

1132
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,559
But he has to live first.

1133
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,069
Why don't you, uh...

1134
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,840
Why don't you come in?
We'll talk about it.

1135
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,274
Will you guarantee his safety?

1136
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,316
You're not in charge anymore, Major.

1137
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,908
Neither are you, apparently.

1138
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,309
Operatives have been
ahead of you this whole time.

1139
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,352
Who were those guys
on the plane, hmm?

1140
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,112
Who tried to kill me in my cell?

1141
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,234
Here's a name for you. Parasource.

1142
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,751
Here's a couple more names
to think about...

1143
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,910
Baghdad. Basra.

1144
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,191
It's not our first rodeo, is it, Captain?

1145
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,636
You think I want to be
in this position, ma'am?

1146
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,836
I have a job to do, and I'm gonna do it.

1147
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,616
I'm gonna take a leap of faith
that you don't have

1148
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,119
anything to do with this.

1149
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,856
Look on the back of the phone.
Come alone

1150
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,598
and make sure you're not tailed.

1151
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,256
Decoudreau to Espin.

1152
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,713
Decoudreau to Espin.

1153
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,358
This is Espin. Go.

1154
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,216
We ID'ed those boys on the plane.

1155
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,800
Paid by a shell company
out of the Cayman Islands.

1156
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,350
We traced the bank accounts back to
a big military contractor, name of...

1157
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,799
Parasource.

1158
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,395
Yeah. How'd you know that?

1159
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,914
Never mind. Uh...

1160
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,496
Give me everything
you can on Parasource,

1161
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,714
and I mean everything.

1162
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,230
Look, I'm en route to pick up a witness.

1163
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,589
We'll send backup.

1164
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,399
No, stand ready two minutes out.

1165
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,629
Wait for my signal.

1166
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,920
That's not procedure, sir.

1167
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,151
No, that's called an order.

1168
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,038
Reacher knows the game.
If he smells heat, he'll bolt.

1169
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,176
All right, we'll stay two minutes out.

1170
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,838
What's the address?

1171
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,593
Nicholls Street Wharf. Espin out.

1172
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,030
Nicholls Street Wharf.

1173
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,040
No witnesses.

1174
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,400
Freeze!

1175
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,714
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, man!

1176
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,241
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
I'm here to help.

1177
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,836
- You're the witness?
- Yeah. Yes, yeah, I'm the witness.

1178
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,153
Where the hell are you?

1179
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,356
- You got what you need?
- Not good enough.

1180
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,590
I suggest you listen
to what he has to say.

1181
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,798
- I can help.
- Okay. Let's go.

1182
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,477
I like stories. Tell me a story.

1183
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:10,311
Now we return to
our Halloween marathon.

1184
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,990
Is your costume ready
for tonight's parade?

1185
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,512
- I'm gonna call this in.
- I'll cover.

1186
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,996
Officer down, Nicholls Wharf.

1187
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,714
I'm out.

1188
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,753
You're still wanted for murder.

1189
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,389
That's right.

1190
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,355
I'm a stone killer.
That's why I saved you.

1191
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,116
Did Prudhomme give you his statement?

1192
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,668
Most of it.

1193
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,271
Cibelli and Mirkovich were your friends.

1194
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,040
That's right.

1195
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,952
Parasource ordered their murders.

1196
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,112
They also just tried to kill you.

1197
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,595
They've been providing
insurgents with weapons.

1198
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,032
You're gonna need more proof
than the word of a dead junkie.

1199
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,191
And you're gonna help us get it.

1200
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,794
Here. Put the cuffs on,
take us into custody.

1201
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,032
Just get us on the tarmac
of Parasource in one hour.

1202
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,433
I need you to jump to
a conclusion here, soldier.

1203
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,037
Yeah. Thanks.

1204
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,278
Okay, here's what we got.

1205
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,555
Six months ago, Parasource
loses government contracts

1206
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,312
worth over a billion dollars.

1207
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,630
They're bleeding cash
and the banks want blood.

1208
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:22,473
But now, all of a sudden,
they start paying back their creditors.

1209
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,638
How much money
can they be really making

1210
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,552
selling weapons on the black market?

1211
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,676
An M4 is, what, five grand?

1212
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,831
A rocket launcher's half that.

1213
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,594
That's nothing compared to
government contracts.

1214
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,830
So where are they
getting the money?

1215
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,230
Guest Services.
How may I help you?

1216
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,157
Hi, do you have room service?

1217
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,830
I'm sorry, I see you paid
cash for your room.

1218
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,832
I'm afraid we can't provide incidentals
without a credit card.

1219
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,150
U h, yeah, just hold on a second.

1220
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,191
You do understand
that the parade is coming

1221
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,395
and it may take a while.

1222
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,040
That's fine. I'm so starving.

1223
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,798
Uh... Is Visa okay?

1224
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,320
Sir?

1225
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,790
We got a hit on one of the stolen cards.

1226
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,997
Hotel Dauphin. 1018 Royal Street.

1227
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,873
It's the girl.

1228
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,872
I warned him.

1229
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,360
IDs?

1230
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,154
Captain Anthony Espin,
110th Military Police.

1231
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,311
I'm gonna have to call this in.

1232
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,896
They're unloading the crates.

1233
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,353
We got to get in there.

1234
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,113
What's the drill, Major?

1235
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,353
Drill is we enforce the law.

1236
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,032
Seatbelts, please.

1237
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,429
- Turner?
- Major.

1238
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,310
Stand down!

1239
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,720
I will lay you down, soldier boy!

1240
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,791
- Get on the ground!
- Don't move!

1241
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,911
- Weapons down!
- Put it down!

1242
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,070
Put 'em down, boys, put 'em down.

1243
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,479
Take 'em down.

1244
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,399
Jeez.

1245
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,150
Back off, son.

1246
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,832
What is going on here?

1247
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,517
You in charge of this operation?

1248
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,752
I'm General James Harkness.
I run this company.

1249
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,072
We have probable cause
to believe a crime has been committed.

1250
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:35,989
And you are?

1251
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,750
Major Susan Turner.
110th Military Police.

1252
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:44,194
The Major Turner who's wanted
by the MPs for espionage?

1253
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,718
You mean these MPs?

1254
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,432
These crates
are supposed to contain weapons

1255
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,351
belonging to the United States Army.

1256
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,598
In fact, you sold them to insurgents.

1257
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,951
And these are now empty.

1258
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,953
Do you know who I am, Major?

1259
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:07,030
Yes, General. I do.

1260
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,396
You're the man responsible
for the deaths of two of my men.

1261
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,038
Now, open up those crates

1262
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,554
before I grab you by your hair plugs

1263
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,029
and bitch slap that smug look
off of your face.

1264
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,917
What does the manifest say is in there?

1265
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,514
AT4 rocket launchers, sir.

1266
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,908
Open it.

1267
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,909
Open it.

1268
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,509
Open that one.

1269
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,749
Open it.

1270
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,280
Open it.

1271
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,599
Open that one.

1272
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,031
I said open up that crate!

1273
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,800
Open it.

1274
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:34,033
Lieutenant, do your goddamn job

1275
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:37,032
and place this goddamn woman
under arrest.

1276
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:04,310
Sorry, Major, you're gonna
need to come with me.

1277
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,669
You're right.

1278
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,991
The numbers don't add up.

1279
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,639
Sir. Sir.

1280
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,280
Stop that man.

1281
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,080
- Reacher!
- Stop that man!

1282
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,193
Stop him!

1283
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,312
Take him down, now!

1284
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,509
Deep breath, son.

1285
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,713
Pure opium.

1286
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,117
Now the numbers add up.

1287
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,798
Get him out of here.

1288
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:27,989
Hello.

1289
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,831
Good evening. I'm looking for a man,

1290
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,514
a woman and a little blonde teenager.

1291
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,600
I'm so sorry.

1292
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,776
I don't think I can help you
with that type of information.

1293
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,315
I'm looking for two adults
and a little blonde girl.

1294
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,073
Go find their key.

1295
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,936
We have a 4-star
general in custody.

1296
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,473
And it's at least 500 kilos.

1297
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,440
Sam.

1298
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,437
Reacher, it's him. He's here.

1299
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,796
- What?
- At the hotel. Hurry.

1300
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,953
Sam, listen to me.

1301
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,276
Sam? Sam?

1302
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:44,838
Wait, excuse me!

1303
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,991
Hey! What are you doing?

1304
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,471
Where are you going? Come back here!

1305
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,149
She's not answering.

1306
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,520
Try again.

1307
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,789
Car, car, car, car!

1308
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,194
Sam?

1309
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,553
She's not in the hotel.

1310
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,069
- She's in the street.
- How do you know?

1311
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,879
Because that's what I would do.

1312
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,233
I'll go this way.

1313
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,029
Did you see anything?

1314
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,016
Searched the whole hotel.
We didn't find a trace of her.

1315
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,320
She's gotta be hiding somewhere.

1316
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,990
Reacher.

1317
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,079
Let's finish this. Just you and me.

1318
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:49,238
I'm gonna have some fun
with your pretty little girl.

1319
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,753
She's not my little girl.

1320
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,592
Is that fear I hear in your voice, Jack?

1321
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,793
I'm gonna break your arms,
I'm gonna break your legs.

1322
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,239
I'm gonna break your neck.

1323
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,795
What you hear is excitement.

1324
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,439
Hey, you! Get out of there!

1325
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,478
Come on. Right now. Out.

1326
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,109
Nice try, Jack.

1327
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:08,279
I've found a way to hurt you
like you've never hurt before.

1328
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:35,840
Samantha!

1329
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,157
- Do you have her?
- Chartres Street.

1330
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,349
Lafitte Hotel.

1331
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,191
Sam, run! Run!

1332
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,353
Shoot me and I let go!

1333
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,238
Shoot me. Shoot me, Jack.

1334
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,398
No? Shoot me!

1335
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,717
Parasource is done.

1336
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,877
Harkness is in custody.

1337
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,071
Congratulations, Jack.

1338
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,031
I really... I don't give a shit.

1339
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,870
Shut up. Shut up!

1340
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,198
I told you this would happen.

1341
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,233
You said this was about you and me.

1342
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:25,631
Put the gun down.

1343
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:31,551
Okay! Okay. Just...

1344
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:34,720
Okay.

1345
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:38,073
If I put down the gun, you let her go.

1346
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,638
My life for hers.

1347
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,228
No!

1348
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,079
I like it.

1349
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Deal, Jack.

1350
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,149
It's okay, Sam. Look at me.

1351
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:57,319
It's okay. It's the only way.

1352
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,593
It's okay.

1353
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,271
I'm gonna put the gun down now.

1354
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,918
You know what this means?

1355
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:18,349
It means we're dead already.

1356
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,429
Over here.

1357
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,599
Kick it over here.

1358
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,879
Come on.

1359
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,509
Look at me.

1360
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,039
You look at me.

1361
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,035
Hey.

1362
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,296
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

1363
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,753
Reacher, look here.

1364
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,039
I'm right here.

1365
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:15,269
Can you walk?

1366
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,069
Sure.

1367
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,119
Get the other side.

1368
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,397
Dude,
you jumped off a building!

1369
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,879
Yeah, I know.

1370
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:33,632
- Did it hurt?
- Yes.

1371
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,712
Did you see how high that was?

1372
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,519
Can we possibly have this
conversation some other time?

1373
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,600
Thank you.

1374
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,033
You know, it's funny.

1375
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,070
You came here looking for one girl
and you ended up with another.

1376
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,072
Let me know how that goes.

1377
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:41,712
I've still got your number.

1378
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,909
Bye, Reacher.

1379
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,320
Major.

1380
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:13,072
Good to see you back, Major.

1381
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:15,913
Thank you, Captain.

1382
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:44,749
Sorry. Bus got stuck in traffic.

1383
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:48,754
New T-shirt.

1384
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:50,480
Shut up.

1385
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,953
Thanks for coming.

1386
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:57,953
So, Reacher,

1387
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:01,072
are you my father or not?

1388
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:06,154
I guess we'll see
when your mother gets here.

1389
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,112
Sure you'd recognize her?

1390
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,520
I tend to remember
the women I sleep with.

1391
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,358
But who says she'll remember you?

1392
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:16,520
Thanks a lot.

1393
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:24,838
You're not my father.

1394
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:27,313
Why do you say that?

1395
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,433
See that woman over there?

1396
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,630
The waitress who's refilled
your coffee three times?

1397
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,193
That's her.

1398
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,989
Neither of you had any idea
who the other was.

1399
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,834
- I knew it all along.
- No, you didn't.

1400
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,636
I'm sure you're relieved.

1401
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:02,513
Not really.

1402
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,312
You're just gonna go?

1403
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,394
That's right.

1404
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,071
Don't you ever get lonely?

1405
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:28,349
Sometimes.

1406
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:34,753
Sometimes.

1407
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:40,559
You can call me when you do.

1408
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,074
So...

1409
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:02,434
Shouldn't you be...

1410
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,673
I'd better go.

1411
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,073
Got class.

1412
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,188
Drawing.

1413
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:24,275
Yeah, well, you keep that up,
because you're really good at it.

1414
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,714
You're really good.

1415
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,758
You're gonna be okay, kid.

1416
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,120
Well...

1417
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,036
See you around, Reacher.
