00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,775
My administration has
organized a new initiative,

158
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,903
which we are calling
"Operation Street Cleaning."

159
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,323
We've also enhanced and increased
local law enforcement,

160
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:32,120
in order to rid our neighborhoods
of crime and gang-related activity.

161
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,791
It is the top priority of this
administration to return our city

162
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,335
back to the safety it once knew.

163
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:44,007
Boy, what you carrying in this box?
A dead body and a watermelon?

164
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,719
- No, that's my entertainment library.
- Entertainment?

165
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,222
Behind the Green Horse.
Is that new?

166
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,641
- You haven't seen that?
- No.

167
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,936
- Check that out tonight.
- Oh, I just might do that.

168
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,152
You know what? All this moving is
making me thirsty. We bring any beer?

169
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,988
You're in charge of beer.
I'm in charge of entertainment.

170
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,744
Man, I know there's
something around here somewhere.

171
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,166
We, ladies and gentlemen,
are going to unite,

172
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,420
and make this the strongest
and the safest community in this county.

173
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,672
I know my mama wouldn't
leave a dry house.

174
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,049
MAN ON TV: You have my word.

175
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,010
Hoo-ah!

176
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,261
Holy shit.

177
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,680
Biscuit and Klondike
gonna have booze tonight.

178
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,349
(BOTH LAUGHING)

179
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,727
Yeah. Thank you, Mama.

180
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,814
(KLONDIKE LAUGHING)
I was running fast as I could, man.

181
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,858
I mean, that woman kept
catching up to me.

182
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,486
I mean, I run the 100-yard dash,
for Christ sakes,

183
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,363
trying to get away from this woman.

184
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,782
I've never seen you
run so fast in your life.

185
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,620
She looked like a hooker to me, man.
She came on to me, too.

186
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,081
You know, them Vietnamese
are tricky motherfuckers,

187
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,667
making their soldiers
look like whores and shit.

188
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:05,171
Klondike, she weighed 200 pounds and
had a machine gun strapped on her neck.

189
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,300
It was dark, motherfucker. (LAUGHING)

190
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,387
I couldn't see shit.
I just followed my nose.

191
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:16,641
My nose led me to pussy
and my nose don't discriminate pussy.

192
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,186
Where's Baxter, man?

193
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,106
I thought he would've
licked that plate clean by now.

194
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,733
Baxter probably locked himself
in the closet again.

195
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,362
What the hell's he doing in there?
Ah...

196
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,824
- Rubbing one out, ain't he?
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

197
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,367
No.

198
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,370
He's probably... He just likes
his quiet time like his daddy.

199
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:42,041
Yeah. His daddy.
His daddy's a good guy.

200
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,085
Thank you, man.

201
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,215
- For what?
- For letting me move in with you.

202
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,302
You've been there for me the whole time,
man. You're a damn good friend.

203
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,722
- I mean that.
- Klondike.

204
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,765
You and Baxter
are the only family I got.

205
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,435
You saved my life. I owe you.

206
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,603
You know what?

207
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,523
I see...

208
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,402
...really good changes
for you and me, Biscuit.

209
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,281
- Take my word for it.
- It's a long time coming.

210
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,118
You know, people talk about
having the best days of their lives.

211
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,828
I'm still waiting for mine.

212
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,205
The past 40 years,
I've felt like a bouncing ball.

213
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,042
No stability in my life.

214
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:30,131
But... I think
the bouncing's slowing down.

215
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,758
I'm turning over a new leaf.

216
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,552
Yeah, I think I'm gonna find
the best day of my life.

217
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,639
Here's to finding the best days
of our lives, Biscuit.

218
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,975
Do me a solid, will you?

219
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,772
Put this in your mother's
safe deposit box, will you please?

220
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,067
- What the fuck is this?
- It's a flash drive.

221
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,610
- A flash drive?
- That's right.

222
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,111
I got a lot of important stuff on there.

223
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,030
What, you know all about
that computer shit?

224
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:58,117
My ass is trying to learn.
And when I learn, I'm gonna teach you.

225
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,620
Nah, not me. I'm not interested.

226
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,248
One of these damn days, you're gonna
have to step out of the '70s.

227
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,958
No. Uh-uh.

228
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,710
Those were beautiful times.

229
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,505
You didn't have
to deal with all this shit.

230
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:15,968
Suicide bombings and taking
your shoes off at the airport.

231
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,346
No, you gotta watch it.
There's a lot of crazy shit out there.

232
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,350
Well, that's what's going on now.
We gotta get your ass into this century.

233
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,936
I'm gonna make that my mission
while we're living together.

234
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,732
Now put that in your mama's
safe deposit box, please.

235
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,359
Got it.

236
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,986
OK. All right.

237
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:39,700
Oh, shit. I'm out of smokes, man.
I'm gonna go out.

238
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,162
You know, my mom left a brand-new carton
of Newports right there in the kitchen.

239
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,208
I don't wanna smoke that menthol shit.
I'm gonna go get me my Camels.

Well, what should I be drinking?

Malt Liquor, ripple,
grape soda or Kool-Aid?

- Not tonight.

Oh.

335
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,355
I just came from the liquor store.

336

Looked like you wiped your ass
with those guys.

- Fucking scumbags.
- Yeah, I know, Frank.

338

involved in these altercations.

what seems to be the prime suspect
in the Justin Wheely murder case.

360
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,554
Justin was violently beaten and then
stabbed to death late last night

00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,515
after he wouldn't give up his wallet.

the 20 investigators

It won't happen again.

What the fuck's a flash drive?

645

Nope.

I've been waiting for this
for over 40 years.

1077
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,521
I'm very, very proud.

1078
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,566
I'd like to thank, uh...

MARTIN: Yeah, man, I got two.
You know how I be. I'm a player.

- Oh, really? (LAUGHS)

1082
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:04,872
How'd you get him to open up
and talk about all his girlfriends?

1083
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,290
I tortured him.

1084
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,959
Well, why don't you torture him
some more? I need more information.

1085
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,295
I can't do that.
I mean, that's man stuff.

Well, I hope you men are hungry.

1088
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,717
- Starving. (CHUCKLES)
- Good.

I think it'd be better
if you trimmed that damn beard.

- Martin.

1094
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:39,031
- But he does have a point, Frank.
- Hey, I just trimmed it.

1095
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:42,076
