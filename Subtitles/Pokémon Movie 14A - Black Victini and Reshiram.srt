2
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,600
defies description, with its abundance and grandeur...!

3
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,850
NARRATOR: And, of course, Pokémon! Flying high above the

4
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,940
clouds, swimming deep under the sea, and roaming the rolling

5

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,100
from Pallet Town, working with his partner Pikachu to catch

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,060
other Pokémon and refine his Pokémon battling skills!

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
NARRATOR: As he travels with his friends,

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,640
there have been twists and turns on the road during Ash's journey

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,730
as a Pokémon Trainer...

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,810
NARRATOR: Indeed, his road has branched off

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,980
in many directions... Lost at times,

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,440
occasionally retracing his steps,

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,060
or forcing him to take the long way...

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,310
but through it all, continuing his journey just the same...!

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,600

167
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,060
really the truth. But look! You can see with your very own eyes

168
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,730
that the berries in the surrounding orchards are

169

244
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
JUANITA: It's said to give people and Pokémon power...

245
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
ASH: Power?

246
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,690
JUANITA: That's right!

247
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,900

256
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,600
all of the other Pokémon in the festival, but now...

257
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,310

ASH: Then let's go!

297
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,520
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

298
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,440
It's always hard,

299
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,810
When the journey begins.

300
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,190
Hard to find your way;

301
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,140
Hard to make amends.

302
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,850
But there's nothing you can't do,

303
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,810
Cause you've got the power inside of you.

304
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,310
It's never easy,

305
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,060
To make a choice:

306
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,020
To keep things inside,

307
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,350
Or raise your voice.

308
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,230
But for everyone there comes a time

309
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,600
When the light inside begins to shine.

310
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,940
It's not always right or wrong,

311
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,480
As long as your spirit's strong.

312
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,230
It's not always win or lose,

313
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,230
It's the road you choose;

314
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,140
The answer's within.

315
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,560
It's not always black and white,

316
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,560
But your heart always knows what's right.

317
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,100
Let the journey begin-

318
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,640
So many choices;

319
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,350
How do we know?

320
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,230
So many places;

321
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,020
Where do we go?

322
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,770
What should I say?

323
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,730
What should I do?

324
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,770
Still, we're together: me and you!

325
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,400
It's not always right or wrong,

326
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,060
As long as your spirit's strong.

327
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,730
It's not always win or lose,

328
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,940
It's the road you choose;

329
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,810
The answer's within.

330
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,140
It's not always black and white,

331
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,190
but your heart always knows what's right.

332

335
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,640
'Cause you've got the power inside of you.

336
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,900
It's not always right or wrong,

337

As long as your spirit's strong.

338
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,400

MANNES: You see, both Juanita and I are descendants of the

642
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,060
tribe called the People of the Vale.

643
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
ASH: People of the Vale?

644
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,980
CILAN: It's the tribe mentioned in the castle's legend!

645
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,560
CARLITA: Correct!

646
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,480
JUANITA: We'll tell you a story...of Victini - and the

647
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,900
People of the Vale.

648
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,900
MANNES: Here we go...

649
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,940
MANNES: Have a look! Over a thousand years ago, the People

650
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,640
of the Vale proudly lived under the rule of a mighty king!

651
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,690
ASH: It's Victini...!

652
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,270
IRIS: Was it the king's Pokémon?

653
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,060
MANNES: Yes, that's what the legend says...

654
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,480
JUANITA: The king ruled over what was called the

655
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,640
Kingdom of the Vale...

656
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,810
CILAN: Kingdom of the Vale...?

657
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,810
MANNES: The Kingdom drew its energy from the Dragon Force!

658
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,230
ASH: What's Dragon Force?

659
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,810
DAMON: It's the power that flows invisibly throughout our planet.

660
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,980
MANNES: By using that power wisely, people and Pokémon alike

661
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,270
were able to create an environment in perfect harmony-

662
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,980
at one with nature...

663
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,810
MANNES: The King had two sons: twin princes!

664
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,230
MANNES: And both princes were filled with wisdom and courage.

665
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,100
MANNES: Each prince possessed a unique quality

666
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,850
for which they were nicknamed.

667
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,480
MANNES: The Hero of Ideals!

668
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,270
MANNES: ...and the Hero of Truth!

669
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,810
MANNES: They were greatly loved...

670
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,980
IRIS: Are those...

671
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,980
CILAN: Pokémon?

672
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,940
MANNES: Both princes were accompanied by

673
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,150
great dragon Pokémon!

674
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,860
CARLITA: Zekrom and Reshiram.

675
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,850
DAMON: Both of them granted great wisdom and strength

676
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,900
only to those judged worthy. BUT...

677
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,730
DAMON: ...the country lost its way,

678
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,560
and the two princes became enemies...

679
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,640
RESHIRAM: [ANGRY ROAR]

680
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,520
ZEKROM: [ANGRY ROAR]

681
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,310
MANNES: ...which eventually led

682
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,810
to a great and destructive war...

683
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,850
RESHIRAM: [FUSION FLARE MOVE]

684
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,020
ZEKROM: [FUSION BOLT MOVE]

685
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,690
JUANITA: The two fought ferociously,

686
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,520
finally wounding each other...

687
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,400
ZEKROM, RESHIRAM: [PAINED]

688
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,940
MANNES: ...which used up all of their life energy.

689
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,350
MANNES: These great dragon Pokémon

690
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,350
were transformed into stone...

691
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,940
and fell into a long, deep slumber.

692
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,270
JUANITA: By the time the two princes realized the mistake

693
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,520
they had made, it was too late.

694
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,190
JUANITA: The Dragon Force energy became chaotic!

695
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,190
MANNES: Witnessing the destruction of his people's

696
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,190
land, the king decided to use the power of Victini.

697
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,440
IRIS: Victini's...

698
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,690
CILAN: ...power! Wow...

699
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,480
VICTINI: [SURPRISED]

700
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,770
KING: Victini, please... grant me the use of your power!

701
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,440
VICTINI: [ACCEPTING]

702
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,480
JUANITA: In order to harness Victini's power, the king

703
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,310
created a barrier around the castle using the

704
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,560
Pillars of Protection...

705
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,140
VICTINI: [FOCUSED]

706
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,400
DUOSION GROUP, SIGILYPH GROUP: [FOCUSED]

707
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,350
MANNES: So, with all the townspeople gathered

708
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,850
on top of the castle...

709
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,020
MANNES: ...it lifted up into the sky...

710
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,440
MANNES: ...and the castle was carried to this mountaintop!

711
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,690
VICTINI: [ANXIOUS]

712
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,480
VICTINI: [WORRIED]

713
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,560
VICTINI: [RELIEVED]

714
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,520
VICTINI: [QUESTIONING]

715
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,600
JUANITA: However...the king's power was spent, and the Pillars

716
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,480
of Protection and the barrier remained.

717
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,940
MANNES: Eventually the chaos within the

718
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,060
Dragon Force subsided.

719
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,230
MANNES: The two princes were filled with deep remorse,

720
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,140
and they moved the stone dragon Pokémon

721
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,020
to a safe and secret location...

722
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,520
DAMON: But- the People of the Vale lost their bond with the

723
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,810
land, and scattered everywhere!

724
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,600
PIKACHU, VICTINI, AXEW, VICTINI, AXEW, AXEW: [PLAYFUL]

725
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,940
DAMON: Even leaving behind Victini,

726
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,270
who had vanished from sight.

727
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,640
ASH: Victini's been here... for more than a thousand years?!

728
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,230
IRIS: A thousand years...?

729
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,190
CILAN: And trapped inside the barrier for all that time...!

730
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,270
PIKACHU, VICTINI, AXEW, VICTINI, AXEW, AXEW: [PLAYFUL]

732
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,230
DAMON: Look over there!

733
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,810
DAMON: That's where the Kingdom once was...!

734
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,480
DAMON: My goal...is to bring the

735
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Kingdom of the Vale back to life.

736
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,640
CARLITA: Back to life?

737
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,060

PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

745
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,850
DAMON: You said it would be nice...

746
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,560
if the Kingdom of the Vale could be restored...

747
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,480
JUANITA: I did...

748
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,100
JUANITA: The energy of this land no

749
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,140
longer flows here...

750
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,600
JUANITA: ...so neither people nor Pokémon can live...

751
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,440
DAMON: Wouldn't it be great if they could?

752
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,600
JUANITA: That's my dream, Damon.

753
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,940
DAMON: And now...I can finally fulfill that dream of yours!

754
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,400

MANNES: Damon returned and paid me a visit at my home.

787
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,310
DAMON: I want to contact the People of the Vale who have

788
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,770
scattered everywhere and have them return

789
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,850
so we can rebuild our Kingdom!

790
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,100

791

DAMON: I have to try.

792

Those who say "impossible"...

793
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,770
accomplish nothing!
