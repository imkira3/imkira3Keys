2
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,251
How is everything,
Mr. Sabian?

3
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,765
Great, as always.
Good.

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,922
You get home now, Eva.
It's getting late.

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,090
Stay safe.

6
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,561
Yeah. You, too,
Mr. Sabian.

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,404
<i>Traffic is
building rapidly downtown,</i>

8
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,324
<i>as citizens rush to get home
before commencement.</i>

9
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,289
<i>If you're not Purging,
we advise you</i>

10
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,160
<i>to get off the streets
as quickly as possible.</i>

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,929
<i>It'll soon be
a war out there.</i>

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,208
<i>Prognosticators estimate
that more people</i>

13
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,361
<i>will partake in
this year's Purge...</i>

14
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,284
Sabian's gone.
That's it.

15
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,568
What is she waiting for? Why
doesn't this bitch let us go?

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,166
Hey, calm down.
We got plenty of time.

17
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,083
You girls up to
anything fun tonight?

18
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,202
I might kidnap Eva
this year.

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,970
Hope that's okay
with you, mami.

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,245
It's getting late.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,880
Hope to see you all tomorrow.
Stay safe.

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,166
Okay, stay safe.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,323
Finally.
Stay safe, Mrs. Crawley.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,609
Eva.

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,170
Need a ride home?

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,845
I'm fine, Carlos.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,164
Stay safe.

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,402
Bye, Carlito.
Stay safe.

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,850
If he asked to take me home,
I'd accept that ride, girl.

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,046
He's a dog.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,244
Oh, I like that dog. I would
walk the shit out of that dog.

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,360
But that dog doesn't want
anything to do with me,

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,686
he wants to sniff
your ass.

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,880
You're disgusting.

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,285
It's true.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,923
You're really gonna
ask her tonight?

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,685
I have to.

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,286
I can't afford his
medicine much longer.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,768
All right, good luck.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,126
Stay safe.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,970
Stay safe, sweetie.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,811
Okay.

43
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,720
<i>Both the people and
the government wanted the Purge.</i>

44
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,603
<i>The New Founding
Fathers came into office...</i>

45
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,001
<i>Were voted into office
by</i> a <i>country who wanted change...</i>

46
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,845
<i>This new regime took
advantage of the nation's fear.</i>

47
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,762
I'm glad we took
the back roads.

48
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,810
The highways are probably
a mess right now.

49
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,965
Yeah.
We'll be there in no time.

50
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,326
Yeah.

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,246
What are you looking at?

52
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,210
Nothing.
Just, you know, stuff.

53
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,646
Are you okay?

54
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,486
Yeah. I'm fine.

55
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,770
You sure?

56
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,248
You don't need
to keep asking me.

57
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,642
<i>My name is Donald Talbot.</i>

58
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,008
<i>Our regime was voted into
office nine years ago.</i>

59
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,809
<i>And the first
order of business</i>

60
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,962
<i>was to deal with
the epidemic of crime</i>

61
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,883
<i>that was plaguing
this nation.</i>

62
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,010
<i>The answer was the Purge.</i>

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,769
You need some protection tonight?
You need something?

64
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,126
Hey, man,
we running out of...

65
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,850
Hey, that Purge tonight,
y'all know what time it is.

66
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,570
Hitting them in the face
ain't gonna work no more.

67
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,051
You need
something powerful.

68
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,001
How you doing, buddy?

69
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,686
Use your hands, man. Just use your hands.
Don't even worry about it.

70
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,330
Hey, sweetheart, how you doing?
How you doing?

71
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,481
You gonna need something
for protection tonight?

72
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,045
No. No, I'm good. I'm good.
UZI? Beretta?

73
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,690
Look, on the cheap-cheap.

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,201
Or a blade to cut your man's throat?
Whatever you need.

75
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,762
We take any kind
of payment.

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,441
Eva!

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,483
Hey, Diego. What's up, girl?
How you doing?

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,250
Good. How you doing?
Yeah? Everything's great?

79
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,640
No, it's not great.
I'm tired...

80
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,846
Oh, it could be better.

81
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,649
Take me up there with you tonight.
Get a little protection.

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
You know what I'm saying?

83
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,881
Come on, now. I'm cool, Diego.
I'm good.

84
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,961
You sure you don't
want no protection?

85
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,041
Huh?
No, thanks, Diego.

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,920
I'm the man for the job.
You know what I mean?

87
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,646
<i>We've lost our
souls to attain this peace.</i>

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,324
<i>We no longer worship
at the altar of Christ,</i>

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,490
<i>Muhammad, Yahweh.</i>

90
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,247
<i>We worship at the altar
of Smith & Wesson.</i>

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,324
<i>We, the people,
know not what we do.</i>

92
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,689
Horseshit. Where'd
you find this lunatic?

93
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,564
I saw his protest posters
all around the neighborhood.

94
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,330
He lives here, Papa.
He's just like us.

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,768
Now, shush. Please listen. He's
not a lunatic.

96
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,241
<i>The Purge is not about
containing crime to one night,</i>

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,324
<i>and cleansing our souls
by releasing aggression.</i>

98
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,529
<i>It's about one thing.
Money.</i>

99
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,961
<i>Who dies tonight? The poor.</i>

100
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,165
<i>We can't afford to
protect ourselves.</i>

101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,089
That's enough.
I can't listen to this crap.

102
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,480
He's as full of shit
as they are.

103
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,205
No, he's right. Come on. They're
keeping the population down

104
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,521
by getting rid of people
like us to save money.

105
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,762
Talk is cheap, Cali.
Mmm-hmm.

106
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,320
He may be right, but he
won't do anything about it.

107
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,444
Home.

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,727
Hey, Daddy.

109
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,366
Don't "hey, Daddy" me.
Where have you been?

110
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,249
We're less than two hours
until commencement,

111
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,646
and you're out gallivanting.

112
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,210
Gallivanting? I was
picking up your medicine.

113
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,364
Even worse.
A waste of time and money.

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,688
Christ, Eva, I told you
not to get this stuff.

115
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,364
I'm tired of listening
to this every day.

116
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,771
It does nothing...
I'm not taking it!

117
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,723
You're taking your medicine. I'm
not taking it! No, I'm not!

118
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,041
Yes, you are! I'm not taking it.
You're taking it back.

119
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,690
Oh, my God, really?

120
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,761
Can we stop?

121
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,082
Look, Papa, maybe it doesn't do
anything, but can you just take it?

122
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,090
For me?

123
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,085
Okay-

124
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,642
We'll lockdown and then
we'll eat after commencement.

125
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,886
Count me out.

126
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,684
I'm gonna take a long nap,
and don't bother me.

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,243
I'm gonna try to sleep through
this godforsaken holiday.

128
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,761
Look, I'm sorry
I'm so grumpy, girls.

129
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,567
I hate this night.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,765
Please, forgive me.

131
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,487
You drive me crazy.

132
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,006
Uh...

133
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,681
Make sure you
lockdown everything.

134
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,287
I'll take care of my room.

135
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,724
I love you both.

136
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,124
Very much.

137
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,645
I know.

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,129
That was weird.

139
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,970
It must be the night.

140
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,241
Yeah.

141
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm gonna take a quick shower,
and then we'll lockdown.

142
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,090
Okay, wait. How did things go with Mrs.
Crawley?

143
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,489
Did you get the raise?

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,008
God, what a bitch.

145
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,491
Well, did you at least
make a good argument?

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,086
Did you say everything
that we practiced?

147
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,330
I'm sorry, baby.

148
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,605
Yeah.

149
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,249
I want to tell her, Shane.

150
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,361
Hey, did you hear me?

151
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,091
I said I wanna tell
your sister...

152
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,525
Yeah, I heard you.

153
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,649
I just don't feel
like telling her.

154
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,520
Why?

155
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,284
Because as soon as you say it
out loud to another person,

156
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,963
then it's irreversible.

157
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,962
Do you have the keys?

158
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,326
Yeah.

159
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,846

160
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,326
Right here.

161
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,486
Can you unlock
the car, please?

162
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,721
It's unlocked.

163
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,360
No, it's not.

164
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,881
There.

165
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,765
Let's just get
in the car.

166
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,485
What the fuck
was that all about?

167
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,768
I don't know.
He didn't tell me.

168
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,207
You know, we don't have a whole lot
of time before commencement, Shane.

169
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,409
All right.
We'll be fine, I promise.

170
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,801
Yeah.

171
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,643
I've been calling.
Why didn't you pick up?

172
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,650
What do you want?

173
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,568
You can't go out there. You
know how dangerous it is...

174
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,165
You need to go.
You need to leave.

175
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,010
It's late.

176
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,403
Don't do this.

177
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,925
It won't make you
feel any better.

178
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,163
Go with your new husband,

179
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,127
and your new family.

180
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,164
Leave.

181
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,324
Just stay safe.

182
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,124
You, too.

183

freaked me out.

191
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,802
Did not
see him coming.

192
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,770
I thought we decided
it was irreversible.

193
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,846
No, you often decide
things on your own,

194
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,048
and then pretend that they
were a joint decision.

195
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,525
You often agree with me,

196
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,726
and then
a week later say,

197
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
"I don't remember
doing that."

198
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,640
So, you're calling
me a liar?

199
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,723
And you're calling
me a bully.

200
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,964
Just say you changed
your mind,

201
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,486
not that we didn't come
to a joint decision.

202
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,004
This is the exact...

203
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,763
See, this is exactly why we
need to tell your sister

204
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,251
that we're separating.

205
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,762
You're right,
it'll make it real,

206
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,002
but I think we need
to make it real.

207
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,401
Maybe I don't wanna
make it real.

208
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

209
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,521
What the hell is that?

210
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,761
The power steering's gone.

211
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,285
What do you mean
"the power steering's gone"?

212
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,169
I don't know. There's
something wrong with the car.

213
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,322
Can you pull over?
I'm trying.

214
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,886
Shit.

215

225
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,407
No, no, no. I don't care about the car.
We just need a ride.

out, I promise.

00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,211
Mom, where's the gun?

319
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,564
It's in the kitchen.

320
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,889
Where you hiding, bitch?

321
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,728
Don't you know that you gotta be
polite to people in this society?

322
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,410
Because if not,

323
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,722
this is what
happens tonight!

324
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,801
Diego, don't come back here. We
have guns and we will shoot you.

325
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,165
Cali?

326
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,570
<i>That you?</i>

327
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,522
Oh, I got a little bonus.

328
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,490
Got a little package deal.

329
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,250
But I'll tell you what, tonight
I'm gonna release the beast,

330
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,880
on the both of you
fucking lame bitches!

331
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,689
It's my right,

332
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,889
granted to me by
the New Found Fathers!

333
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,804
You thought your little
weak-ass protection

334
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,848
was gonna keep me
out or what, huh?

335
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,287
Let me tell you something.

336
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,203
Not with the
barricade buster.

337
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,641
Saved up a lot of pennies for
this bitch, let me tell you.

338
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,325
Diego, don't you hear those
people in our building?

339
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,130
Now you shut
the fuck up!

340
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,120
The only thing you gotta be concerned
with is who wants to go first.

341
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,440
Huh?

342
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,721
Who?

343
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,961
Leave my daughter alone.

344
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,041
Mom, don't.

345
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,804
You can do what you want to me, Diego.

346
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,486
I will. Trust me
when I tell you, I will.

347
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,244
You better prepare
yourself tonight,

348
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,761
'cause tonight, it's
motherfucking on, bitch.

349
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,569
That's right, because
it's Diego's night!

350
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,166
It's my night to
motherfucking Purge!

351
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,649
My fucking time!

352
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,169
Every fucking day, you
pass me by in the hallway,

353
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,765
like I ain't shit!

354
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,610
Well, now, that shit fucking changes!
I change shit!

355
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,885
I beg you, please!

356
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,128
Oh, fucking beg, bitch!
Please...

357
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,248
You fucking beg! Beg!

358
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,846
Please! I'm saying please!

359
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,201
Beg, yeah.

360
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,810
Don't touch my daughter, please.

361
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,166
Please,
leave her alone.

362
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,203
Let me hear you say please. She's
got nothing to do with it.

363
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,645
Please.

364
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,724
What's that? Huh?

365
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,845
Is it your father?
I don't know.

366
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,929
- Is that your father?
- Please, please.

367
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,965
I like that.

368
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,450
Come on, motherfucker!
You want some, too?

369
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,931
Come and get it!

370
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,327
Where you at?

371
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,571
Is it him?

372
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,960
This is what
he was looking for tonight.

373
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,764
Let's bring these
two downstairs.

374
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,605
<i>Big Daddy, we have
two for your personal Purge.</i>

375
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,284
<i>Bringing them down now.</i>

376
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,767
Get off me!

377
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,286
Cali!

378
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,167
No! No!

379
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,241
Cali!

380
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,242
Oh, God, no! Let go!

381
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,925
No!

382
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,447
Get the fuck off me!

383
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,125
Please!

384
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,287
Leave my daughter alone!

385
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,928
Please, don't.
Please, please, please.

386
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,808
Just drive. Just drive.
Just drive.

387
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,730
Get off of me!

388
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,801
Mom!

389
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,447
Just fucking drive.

390
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,080
Please!
Let my daughter go!

391
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,401
Cali!

392
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,811
No, fucking...

393
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,846
Mom!

394
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,641
Mom!

395
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,248
I don't know.
They were right behind us.

396
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,681
What the fuck is that?

397
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,924
Shit.
What do we do?

398
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,282
Here, get in.
It's open.

399
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,960
No!

400
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,445
Get off!

401
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,046
What is going on
out there?

402
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,160
We're safe, we're safe. We're in here.
We're good.

403
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,009
Let's go.

404
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,164
- Hey! Out of the car!
- No, no, no!

405
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,560
Please! Please, don't!

406
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,370
Get out of the car,
or I will shoot!

407
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,124
We're not Purging! We don't
have any weapons! Please.

408
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,964
- I will shoot you!
- Please don't shoot!

409
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,281
Move out
of the car now!

410
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,441
No,
we're not armed!

411
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,801
Get out of the car!

412
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,961
We can't!
They're after us!

413
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,646
Wait, wait, wait. We have to go!
We have to go, please!

414
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,924
We don't wanna
hurt anybody!

415
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,208
Please, don't...
Shut up! Shut up!

416
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,521
Hands up,
and shut your mouth!

417
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,281
- Please. Please.
- Hands are up!

418
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,440
Thank you,
thank you.

419
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,880
Get in, get in, get in.

420
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,642
Shane?
What?

421
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,924
They're coming.
We gotta go!

422
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,601
Over there, too!

423
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,120
There's people over here, too!
You gotta move, you gotta move!

424
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,281
Please, go! Please.

425
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,321
Shut up!

426
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,401
Drive!

427
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,480
He's shooting at the motorcycles.
They're turning!

428
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,207
They're not following us.

429
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,805
They're gone, they're gone.
They're all gone.

430
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,161
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

431
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,241
Yeah, there's no one there!

432
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,367
Are you okay, baby?

433
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,771
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you?

434
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,247
Yeah.

435
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,445
Sir, are you okay?

436
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,762
You. What was that army
doing in your building?

437
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,881
Why were they afier you?
I don't know.

438
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Why were
they after you?

439
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,047
I don't know!
I don't know.

440
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,843
Why are you in the streets?
Our car just broke down.

441
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,161
We're not out to Purge. We
don't wanna hurt anybody.

442
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,607
Are you armed?
No! No!

443
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,485
What about you? What
were you doing outside?

444
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,645
Oh, God.

445
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,010
Look, Mom... Mom, it's okay.
We're safe now.

446
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,685
No, we're not.

447
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,047
Sir, where are we going?

448
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,804
Honestly, anywhere but here
is fine with me. Just...

449
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,524
God damn it.

450
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,642
Maybe nowhere.

451
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,201
Whoever's in that truck was
using armor piercing bullets.

452
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,486
The car is dead.

453
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,210
So, that's it. We're stuck
outside on Purge Night.

454
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,401
What are we gonna do?

455
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,406
Can we just hide in here? We
have seven hours until morning.

456
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,444
There's hunters
out there with dogs.

457
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,727
Sooner or later,
they're gonna find you.

458
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,361
But you do what you want.

459
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,605
You're on your own now.
Huh?

460
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,166
What?
Whoa!

461
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,360
Whoa, what do you mean,
we're on our own?

462
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,528
I should never have gotten involved.
It's none of my business.

463
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,682
Okay, but you did, so it is
your business now, all right?

464
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,847
So, what are
we all going to do?

465
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,491
Take this.
It's loaded. Take it.

466
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,967
Take it. You're just
giving us guns?

467
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,721
Where are you going?

468
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,330
I got somewhere to be
before the sun comes up.

469
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,010
I can't take you with me,
you'll slow me down.

470
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,128
So, you're really just
gonna leave us here?

471
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,689
Stay off the streets.
Find somewhere to go.

472
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,921
Please, take us
with you.

473
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,923
We are not the kind of people
who will survive tonight.

474
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,406
Let him go, all right?
He doesn't wanna help.

475
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,766
- Shane, shut up!
- Let him...

476
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,049
Why did you save us if you were
just gonna leave us here to die?

477
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,440
Please, help us!

478
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,329
Wait!
I can get you a car.

479
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,880
I have a friend in the city
not far from here.

480
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,129
I've worked
with her for years.

481
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,089
If you get us
there safely,

482
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,528
you can take her car
and do what you have to do.

483
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,650
Where does she live?

484
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,045
Third and Bryant.

485
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,929
Will she give me her car?
Mmm-hmm.

486
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,201
Are you sure?

487
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,807
Mmm-hmm.

488
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,886
Make sure.

489
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,481
Okay-

490
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,408
Hey, it's Eva.

491
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,291
Listen,
we're in trouble.

492
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,568
That was a real
dick move, you know?

493
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,005
Walking away
and then coming back.

494
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,130
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Okay, we'll be there really soon.

495
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,851
And listen,
I need your car as well.

496
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,726
I'll explain when I get
there, is that okay?

497
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,291
What are you looking for?

498
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,326
Snipers.

499
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,562
Thank you
so much. Okay.

500
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,001
Uh, she lives with her parents.
They're happy to have us.

501
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,246
If you can get us to her place
safely, the car is yours.

502
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,685
Can she help us, too?

503
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,366
Yeah.

504
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,126
Thank you.

505
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,686
She'll give me the car?

506
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,571
All right, I'm gonna help you get to
your friend's, but I want that car.

507
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,040
I know.

508
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,003
All right, you listen to what I say.
You stay close.

509
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,686
You slow me down, I cut you
all loose, you understand?

510
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,040
Yeah. Yeah.

511
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,849
Okay. Let's go.

512
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,204
<i>I'm doing God's work.</i>

513
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,169
<i>He uses an earthquake,
a virus.</i>

514
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,603
<i>Population under control.</i>

515
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,762
<i>The masses nourish
and flourish.</i>

516
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,287
<i>I am that virus tonight.</i>

517
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,328
<i>I am a one-woman
fucking plague</i>

518
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,970
<i>and you're all in my path!</i>

519
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,841
<i>I am the Holy Trinity.
Oh, I am the Holy Trinity.</i>

520
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,206
<i>I am the Holy Trinity.</i>

521
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,887
<i>I am the Father Fucker, Son
of a Bitch, and Holy Shit!</i>

522
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,760
When I move, you move, understand?
Stay close, don't stray.

523
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,321
Okay?
Yeah.

524
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,531
<i>And my MP-9 silver-tipped
Auto Magnum.</i>

525
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,400
<i>The right arm of the free world
and the left hand of God!</i>

526
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,766
Go!

527
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,210
<i>In flaming fire, I take the heads
of them that know not God.</i>

528
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,086
We're gonna go down Fifth. Your
friend's building is close.

529
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,406
Go through
the business district,

530
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,767
stay away from
the gangs downtown.

531
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,130
Wait a minute.

532
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,642
Stay back, stay back.

533
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,691
No! Please, don't!

534
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,604
No! No!

535
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,441
What are they doing?
Where are they taking him?

536
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,601
It's not our business.

537
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,967
Those are the guys
that were after us.

538
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,720
It's okay.
It's not our problem.

539
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,445
We're gonna have
people in front of us,

540
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,000
and we're gonna have
people behind us.

541
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,809
As long as we move,
we'll be fine.

542
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,166
We're gonna cross Banks.

543
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,480
No, no, no,
that's the long way.

544
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,360
It's gonna be much quicker
if we go down here.

545
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,527
What is this?

546
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,490
Get it off of me,
I'm stuck!

547
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,801
It's a trap. It's a trap.
We don't have time.

548
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,280
Move away, I gotta shoot it.
What?

549
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,360
What?
You're gonna what?

550
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,401
I'm gonna shoot it. Move!

551
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,567
What?
Okay.

552
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,446
Shoot it! Shoot the cable!

553
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,121
Shoot it!

554
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,964
Shane, hurry up!

555
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,641
Get up, get up!

556
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,084
- Move!
- Okay, let's go!

557
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,642
<i>There are six
hours remaining in this year's...</i>

558
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,201
<i>The NFFA pigs are wrong.
They're fucking wrong!</i>

559
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,642
<i>Profit-making is not
the essence of democracy.</i>

560
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,131
<i>Wake up, people. Wake up!
It's time to take a stand.</i>

561
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,004
<i>Tonight, we write
our message in blood.</i>

562
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,249
<i>Their blood!</i>

563
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,129
It's so quiet here.

564
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,283
The business district's
always quiet on Purge Night.

565
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,170
The banks move their money,
so no one's ever down here.

566
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,805
Let's go.

567
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,606
Stop.

568
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,843
We don't even
know your names.

569
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,450
I'm Liz, and this is Shane.

570
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,647
Hi.

571
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,609
Eva. My daughter, Cali.

572
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,883
It's nice to officially meet
you on this shitty night.

573
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,961
Yeah.

574
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,766
Is anyone else kind of
curious about this guy?

575
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,924
I'm just glad that
he's out here with us.

576
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,121
Yeah, me, too.

577
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,646
But we all got stuck out
here, and he chose to be.

578
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,881
That means
he's Purging.

579
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,929
Hey. Let's go.

580
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,245
Are you saying that
we shouldn't trust him?

581
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,805
He saved our lives.

582
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,803
All I'm saying is
that he's out here

583
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,770
armed to the teeth, on
Purge Night, voluntarily.

584
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,490
That means he's trying
to do something nasty.

585
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,085
I can hear you.

586
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,806
Sorry. Just go.

587
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,442
Hey, are you
doing okay?

588
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,444
Yeah. Yeah.
It's gonna be fine.

589
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,845
I'm gonna go talk to him.

590
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,161
Cali.

591
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,241
Cali...

592
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,329
What's your name?
Shh.

593
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,801
You're good with guns.

594
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,042
I'm guessing you're either
a cop or a criminal, huh?

595
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,643
And I'm guessing you're either a
pain in my ass or a pain in my ass.

596
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,528
You're out here
to do it, aren't you?

597
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,726
To Purge? That's what you
have to do later on, right?

598
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,801
What are you gonna do?

599
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,160
Stop.

600
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,244
New rules. You shut up.

601
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,243
All of you, shut up.

602
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,607
I'm gonna stop talking because
you're being an asshole, okay?

603
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,806
Not because you
told me to shut up.

604
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,041
Cali.

605
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,411
Hey, hey, hey-

606
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,811
Okay-

607
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,326
Oh, my God.

608
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,962
"Here hangs stockbroker David
Neustadter. He stole our pensions.

609
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,162
"Now, he's gone."

610
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,764
Maybe David deserved it.

611
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,083
Just a bad joke.

612
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,283
What the hell is that?

613
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,890
Is that tear gas?

614
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,042
Smoke canister.

615
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,891
Stay close,
stay close, stay close.

616
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,640
Help me!

617
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,689
Grab him! Get off her!

618
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,887
Get off her!

619
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,568
We were just
doing our duty.

620
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,761
Is she okay?

621
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,921
He scared
the shit out of me.

622
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,200
All right.
You're okay, though.

623
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,280
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Just take a breath.

624
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,251
Look at his uniform.

625
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,486
This is one of the bastards
who came into our building.

626
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,044
And that looks
like their truck.

627
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,161
All right, stay here.
Stay here.

628
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,764
<i>Truck 3, come in.</i>

629
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,641
<i>Come in, please.</i>

630
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,364
Come on. Come on,
let's go, let's go.

631
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,727
Just stay together.
Let's go.

632
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,251
Oh, Jesus.

633
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,004
<i>Truck 3, please respond!</i>

634
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,251
Go check the cab,
see if this thing's working.

635
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,080
Stay alert. Stay alert.

636
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,442
Go ahead.
Go. Go, go, go.

637
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,324
This is some
high-tech shit.

638
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,445
Yo, somebody spent
a lot of money

639
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,648
trying to do some
heavy-duty Purging.

640
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,320
Look at this. They're accessing
the city's traffic cams.

641
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,330
Looking for targets,
l guess.

642
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,528
Traffic cams are controlled
by the government.

643
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,170
How did they
get into these?

644
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,810
I mean,
who are these people?

645
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,087
Maybe you just answered
your own question.

646
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,687
Look at this.
Seventh Street.

647
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,171
Is that your building?

648
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,810
Yeah, but why
is it all red?

649
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,120
You're being targeted
for something,

650
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,326
along with all
these other buildings.

651
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,209
Here, here.
All over the city.

652
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,520
All around
the projects.

653
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,451
Maybe you
were right, Cali.

654
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,001
Look, I'm telling you, this
is the New Founding Fathers.

655
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,241
- The government...
- The truck is fucked.

656
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,369
No good? No, the engine's
all blown out or something.

657
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,121
Hey, look at this.

658
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,330
That's Carmelo's mark, Mom.

659
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,970
I told Papa
he was the real deal.

660
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,485
His group took
these fuckers out.

661
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,880
Everybody got a weapon?

662
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,483
Hey, grab this. Take the weapon.
Go. Go!

663
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,691
Go! Oh, shit, there's
another one.

664
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,205
Looks like an army.
Come on.

665
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,203
Get down, let's go.

666
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,321
Take this.

667
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,647
Shh.

668
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,684
Come on.

669
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,401
Hey-

670
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,211
Why did you stop
at our building?

671
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,248
Why did you help us?

672
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,326
Didn't we establish
a no-talking rule?

673
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,771
People are getting
killed all over the city.

674
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,808
Why did you stop for us?

675
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,800
I saw you. You were putting
up a hell of a fight.

676
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,928
You reminded me
of someone.

677
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,041
Who?

678
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,488
Look, Purging, no matter
what the reason, is wrong.

679
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,849
Killing doesn't
help anything.

680
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,967
It doesn't heal someone.

681
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,361
Enough. Enough.

682
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,721
Go back with
your mommy.

683
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,211
Go.

684
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,402
There's no air in here.

685
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,482
Come over here.
Put this on.

686
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,085
I don't need that.
Put it on, I said.

687
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,969
I said I don't need it.
Put it on.

688
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,283
Put your arm
through here.

689
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,128
Now, hopefully,
you won't need it.

690
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,244
Let's move.

691
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,965
- What was that?
- Shh.

692
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,650
There's no threat.

693
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,286
They're just trying to
make it through the night.

694
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,764
Keep moving.

695
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,650
Hey, are you okay?

696
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,723
I just wanna
get out of here.

697
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,006
Oh, shit!

698
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,361
Move!

699
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,045
Go! Come on!

700
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,245
Run! Move!

701
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,766
Move!

702
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,562
Get up! Get up!
Come on!

703
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,960
Get up, get up, get up!

704
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,401
Mom, we have
to go right now!

705
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,643
Move it,
move it! Move!

706
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,765
Go, go!

707
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,641
Up. up, up!

708
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,043
We're not gonna make it.
Fuck it.

709
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,161
Shane!

710
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,690
- What are you doing?
- Get down!

711
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,842
What do we do?
Just shoot! Just shoot!

712
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,046
Shane!

713
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,208
Oh, my God. I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine!

714
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,362
Just keep shooting. Just
keep shooting. Go! Go!

715
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,885
All right. You're okay.

716
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,921
Stay here.
Give me this.

717
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,607
I'm so sorry. I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

718
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,203
I was just so scared.

719
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,766
You're bleeding.

720
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,240
I cut it on the platform.
It's fine.

721
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,406
We'll help you.
Just tell us...

722
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,527
I said, it's fine!

723
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,686
Get up. Get up.

724
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,169
What's taking
them so long?

725
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,530
Help! He's been shot!
I have no idea how bad.

726
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,209
Open up.
We're gonna be fine, okay?

727
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,603
Call your friend. Tell her we're close.
We're gonna get him up.

728
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,047
Okay. Look at me.
Look at me, Shane. Yeah?

729
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,441
One, two, three.
Get him up.

730
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,931
Let's go!

731
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,727
<i>There are
four hours and 30 minutes</i>

732
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,201
<i>remaining in
this year's Purge.</i>

733
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,842
Go! Just don't worry! Go!
Come on, come on!

734
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,406
Keep moving!

735
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,564
Go! Don't slow down!
Keep moving!

736
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,007
It's right up ahead.

737
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,570
Come on!

738
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,722
Cali! Slow down!

739
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,809
Hey, look,
that's her building!

740
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,723
She said to meet
around the back.

741
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,209
<i>We have a
target match on the civilians</i>

742
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,011
<i>who attacked Truck 2.</i>

743
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,926
She said,
"Meet us around the back."

744
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,531
Tanya! Let us in!

745
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,764
It's Eva and Cali!

746
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,248
Holy shit!
You guys look like hell.

747
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,482
Come on, come on, hurry up.
Get in here. Hurry up!

748
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,802
Thank you. I don't like
being out here. Come on.

749
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,566
All right.

750
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,130
Bullet went right through.

751
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,084
I can't believe you guys
went through all that stuff.

752
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,890
It's just insane!

753
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,526
Get him to the hospital first
thing after this is over.

754
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,523
Yeah.
You'll be okay.

755
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,523
It's gonna hurt like a son of a
bitch, but you're gonna be okay.

756
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,921
Thanks.
I can't thank you enough.

757
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,923
That's what you get
for being a hero.

758
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,929
I need the car.
I know.

759
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,445
Come on, everybody.
Eat, drink!

760
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,249
Yes,
I recommend drinking.

761
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,080
It's the best way to get
through the evening.

762
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,521
And the food
is delicious.

763
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,720
My mother's
a wonderful cook.

764
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,484
My sister's
a testament to that.

765
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,284
What the hell
does that mean?

766
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,362
That she's
a good cook!

767
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,885
You know, you didn't
have to go this far.

768
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,724
Just having us here
was really enough.

769
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,802
You guys have had
a terrible night.

770
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,246
Get some food
in your system,

771
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,924
and we'll get through
this together.

772
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,206
Excuse me.

773
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,005
Cali?

774
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,811
I can't believe
nobody's drinking with me.

775
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,086
What about you, tough guy?

776
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,247
Want a drink?

777
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,601
No, thanks.

778
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,169
Okay-

779
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,730
You're really going
back out there?

780
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,721
Mmm!

781
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,600
Relax! It's my father and my
brother-in-law. He's the super.

782
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,206
They were just checking the building.
It's all good.

783
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,803
Everyone, please don't mind
my husband's clothes.

784
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,480
He's not Purging.

785
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,688
He just thought
it was a crazy idea

786
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,047
to go out and see
what's happening tonight.

787
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,360
Yeah, I chickened out.

788
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,688
No way
I was going out there.

789
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,842
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

790
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,401
Thank God he came to his senses.
I mean, look at him.

791
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,450
He would've been the laughingstock
of the neighborhood.

792
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,962
That's not very nice,
Lorraine.

793
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,811
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for it to be mean.

794
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,803
It's not mean,
it's just true.

795
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,286
How's everything, Daddy?

796
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,441
It's all good, baby.

797
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,728
The building's
locked down and good.

798
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,046
It's quiet.

799
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,965
I see you had a rough
go of it, my friend.

800
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,405
- Oh, yeah.
- Relax.

801
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,881
Make yourself at home.
You're safe here.

802
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,008
We are anti-Purge
in this household.

803
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,242
Speak for yourself, Daddy.

804
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,171
What does that mean?

805
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,720
I could think of
a couple situations

806
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,603
where Purging
could be the answer.

807
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,643
- Like when?
- I'm not telling.

808
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,280
I'm just saying,
don't piss me off, bitch.

809
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,442
- Uh, please excuse my daughter.
- No, it's fine.

810
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,325
And, please, if there's anything
else you need, just ask.

811
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,084
I could use a clean shirt.

812
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,362
Down the hall,
second door on the left.

813
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,171
Top drawer of the bureau.
What's mine is yours.

814
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,321
Okay. Excuse me, too.

815
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,930
I'm gonna go to
the little girl's room

816
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,680
'cause this wine is
going right through me.

817
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,451
Come on, everyone,
please eat and drink.

818
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,443
Come on. Honey?

819
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,602
<i>This is News 10 reporting on a
lively Purge Night across the country.</i>

820
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,208
<i>We have riots in
East Los Angeles,</i>

821
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,726
<i>as well as record
participation in Pittsburgh.</i>

822
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,645
He wasn't lying.

823
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,167
This shit hurts.

824
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,810
Aw, I'm sorry.

825
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,042
You scared
the shit out of me.

826
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,369
I thought
I was losing you.

827
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,884
But I still think we
should tell your sister.

828
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,246
You're an asshole.

829
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,004
I'm sorry.
That's not funny.

830
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,162
I'm sorry.
No, l got shot.

831
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,840
Oh, are you gonna use this excuse
for the rest of our lives?

832
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,126
Well, at least
the rest of the night.

833
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,770
Okay.

834
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,684
All right, people, let's change
the atmosphere up in here.

835
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,969
No more Purge news.
No more nothing depressing.

836
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,920
Let's put on some music, and let's
just liven it up a little bit, right?

837
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,680
Come
on, you want to dance?

838
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,571
Why not?

839
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,563
Liven up the party,
come on.

840
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,084
Let's dance.
Let's dance!

841
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,089
Okay, I gotta go.
I need the car.

842
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,844
I know.
You trust these people?

843
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,168
Because your friend
likes to drink,

844
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,810
and she's taking
pills back there.

845
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,446
Yeah, she's pretty wild.

846
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,171
But we'll be okay.
She's a good friend.

847
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,482
What? You don't
wanna do it? What?

848
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,244
Lorraine, do you care
if we dance?

849
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,129
She doesn't even care. She's
not even paying attention.

850
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,326
Now he's...
Look at him.

851
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,925
He's asleep. He is.

852
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,208
I don't know
how to thank you.

853
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,487
Okay, if you can just tell her
I need the car right now,

854
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,529
that would be
really great.

855
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,887
I know what
you're doing tonight.

856
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,084
You're going out there to
kill someone who wronged you.

857
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,566
You believe in this night,
don't you?

858
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,720
I think you should just
take care of your daughter.

859
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,884
She's special,
and you're very lucky.

860
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,407
And I need the car.

861
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,524
There is no car.

862
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,765
What?

863
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,124
I'm sorry,
they don't have a car.

864
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,888
But we needed you.

865
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,165
And I needed the car.

866
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,766
I did what I had to.
I did it for my daughter.

867
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,082
I was doing this
for my son.

868
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,403
And I trusted you.

869
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,568
You have no idea what you might
have taken away from me tonight.

870
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,007
Hey-
Hey-

871
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,884
Look, I know you're
angry with my mother,

872
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,809
but I really think you
should just stay here.

873
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,651
Just wait out
the night with us, okay?

874
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,050
Look, I heard you say that
you're doing it for your son.

875
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:11,920
Now, I don't know him,

876
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,411
but I'm sure he would
not want you to do

877
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,000
whatever it is
that you're going to do.

878
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,923
Bye, Cali. Please, come
on, you're safe here.

879
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,570
Get out of my way.
Please, just...

880
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,801
I gotta go. Goodbye.

881
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,200
Stay here. It's fine.
Get out of the way.

882
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,561
Get back!

883
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,811
No!

884
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,927
Lorraine!

885
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,240
What are you doing?

886
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,722
Tanya! Tanya!

887
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,367
Lorraine!

888
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,041
What've you done? What
are you doing, Lorraine?

889
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,804
Jesus Christ,
she's dead.

890
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,401
You killed your sister!
She's your sister!

891
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,766
Lorraine!
What are you doing?

892
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,041
You know
what I'm doing.

893
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,321
I read all your emails,
you cheating motherfuckers.

894
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,130
You both deserve to die!

895
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,968
Okay, Lorraine!
Lorraine, stop!

896
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,689
No! Get back, get back.
Back up, back up!

897
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,921
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

898
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,560
What the fuck are you doing?
Lorraine.

899
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,927
If you shoot me,
you shoot this woman.

900
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,161
Just let her go!

901
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,891
You don't
wanna do that!

902
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,042
Lorraine, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

903
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,044
I didn't mean it. She hasn't
done anything to you.

904
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,770
Okay? So, cut this out!

905
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:19,284
Fuck you! This is my right,
granted to me by my government.

906
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,405
Leave him alone!
He's mine!

907
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,090
Door, now. Go.

908
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,884
Door! Go!

909
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,011
Door, door, door!

910
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,286
Now!

911
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,486
Move, move, move!

912
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,445
Go, go!

913
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,768
I can't believe
Tanya's dead.

914
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,923
What do we do now?
Where do we go?

915
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,291
Are you gonna
leave us now?

916
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,721
What?

917
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,251
Are you gonna
leave us now?

918
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,010
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

919
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,406
Shh!
How did they find us?

920
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,241
Stay here.

921
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,481
Don't move!

922
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,929
Do you think
he's gonna come back?

923
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,651
What do we do
if he doesn't?

924
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,882
Come on, guys.
Let's go, okay?

925
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,964
We don't have all night. I
want this building surrounded.

926
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,521
He's here.

927
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,321
I know it, and I want him.
Understood?

928
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,527
He shot me.

929
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,800
He shot half my team.
I want him dead.

930
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,282
Come on,
come on, come on.

931
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,166
And I want
the two women he saved.

932
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,685
They're mine.

933
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,728
I want them alive.

934
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,689
Please come back.

935
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,326
They found us. Move fast, now.
Come on.

936
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,401
Move now.
We have 30 seconds.

937
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,006
Over the fence, fast.
Now. Go!

938
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,045
Next. Come on,
come on, come on.

939
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,682
Look at me. You go, you get
over that fence, you run.

940
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,001
You don't stop.
You run for your life.

941
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,889
Do you understand? You
don't fucking wait for me.

942
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,088
Go. Go, go, go!

943
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,407
Fuck!

944
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,729
How did you find us?

945
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,644
No, Cali, no.

946
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,644
We got lucky.

947
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,280
I mean, we was roaming
around out there all night.

948
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,842
Just picking up the people who got
away from those badass trucks.

949
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,691
We get their scraps.

950
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,368
Why haven't you
just killed us already?

951
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,285
We're not Purging tonight.

952
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,691
We don't need
to kill anyone.

953
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,770
We just need money.
Right, bro?

954
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,445
Money!

955
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,451
Whoa!

956
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,405
All right, let's go.

957
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,210
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

958
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,044
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go!

959
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,521
No, no, no!

960
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,366
Who the fuck are they?

961
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,401
What the fuck are
you doing to us?

962
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,001
I need my money, man.
Let's go, let's do this.

963
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,128
What are they doing?

964
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,362
It's all there.
Yeah!

965
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,761
Let's go! Let's go, move!

966
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,404
- Get in there!
- No!

967
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,569
Cali?
Mom!

968
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,881
Get up the stairs, now.

969
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,889
Get up! Get up!

970
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,563
Get on your knees.
Get down! Get down!

971
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,124
Get on your knees.

972
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,925
On your knees!

973
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,730
Where are we? What is this? Shh.

974
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,961
If you move or speak,

975
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,366
you will be shot.

976
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:19,607
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
next batch has just arrived.</i>

977
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,088
<i>Let's take a look,
shall we?</i>

978
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,887
Quite an impressive lot,
isn't it?

979
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:56,049
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, since this
is the last Purge of the evening,</i>

980
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,245
<i>the entry price
will be $200,000.</i>

981
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,124
<i>Mr. Lockhart!</i>

982
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,647
<i>And his wonderful wife,
Lauren.</i>

983
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,730
<i>Fantastic.</i>

984
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,606
<i>The Hanover sisters!</i>

985
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,881
<i>Ah!</i>

986
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,760
<i>I've been waiting all evening
for your participation.</i>

987
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,251
<i>Fantastic.</i>

988
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,604
<i>And I assume you brought
your signature blades.</i>

989
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,487
<i>All right, one spot left.
Anyone else?</i>

990
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,605
<i>Mr. Hearst!
Oh, wonderful!</i>

991
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,967
<i>And will your handsome
sons be joining you?</i>

992
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,240
What do you say, guys?
Yeah, let's do it.

993
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,730
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this will
be Charles and Tom's first.</i>

994
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,528
<i>I am so happy that you have
this to share together.</i>

995
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,522
<i>Oh, and one last reminder.</i>

996
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:53,891
<i>The weapons rack is stocked with
the latest and the greatest.</i>

997
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,129
<i>And my personal favorite</i>

998
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,286
<i>is the Mauser Elite
SSX Double Barrel.</i>

999
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,171
<i>It has a delicate trigger,</i>

1000
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,561
<i>and smoothest discharge.</i>

1001
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,770
<i>It is so precise,</i>

1002
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,686
<i>it's as if God handcrafted it himself.</i>

1003
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,364
<i>Well, that will do it.</i>

1004
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,683
<i>Purgers, please suit up.</i>

1005
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,361
<i>Good luck.</i>

1006
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:25,087
<i>Good luck. We'll see you shortly
on the hunting grounds.</i>

1007
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,969
Get up. Come on!
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1008
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,650
Quit stalling!

1009
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,321
Come on!

1010
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,888
- Move your ass!
- Okay!

1011
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,560
Move it! Go!

1012
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,081
Move it!
Get in there!

1013
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,683
Stay close to me.

1014
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,883
Follow me. Move.

1015
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,530
Get down.

1016
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,526
Get down, get down.

1017
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,806
Wait.

1018
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,691
What is this?

1019
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,205
We're being hunted.

1020
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,805
What?

1021
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,731
Blessed be
the New Founding Fathers

1022
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,246
for letting us Purge
and cleanse our souls.

1023
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:43,291
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

1024
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,850
All right, they're here.

1025
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,604
They're coming,
and they got night vision.

1026
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,647
I gotta take
one of them down.

1027
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:11,800
If we can't see,
we're dead.

1028
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,046
We should
come with you.

1029
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,440
No, no, no.
I need you to stay here.

1030
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,766
Don't go. I'm scared.

1031
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,730
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.
Stay here.

1032
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,200
No!

1033
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,360
Are you okay?
Fine.

1034
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,490
We only get two sets of eyes now, okay?
Put those on.

1035
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,483
I took out four
of these fuckers.

1036
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,721
There's three left.

1037
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,571
It's loaded.
You point and you shoot.

1038
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,726
Someone's coming right at us.

1039
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,801
Light him up.

1040
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,001
They're going.

1041
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,606
They're all gone.

1042
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,040
They're leaving.
Get down, get down.

1043
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,600
Is it over?

1044
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,729
Stay down.

1045
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,010
We need help right now.

1046
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,004
They've killed five people.
They've killed five of us.

1047
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,890
They're gone.

1048
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,331
What the fuck?

1049
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,164
What was that?

1050
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,086
There's a whole
fucking army.

1051
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,726
I don't have
any more bullets.

1052
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,883
Just hold my hand, baby.

1053
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,487
They're not
gonna let us out of here.

1054
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,650
You make them earn it.

1055
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,282
I'm sorry for everything.

1056
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,640
I love you. I need you to know that.

1057
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,847
No!

1058
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,163
No. Okay. Come on.

1059
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,566
Come on.

1060
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,685
Okay-

1061
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,481
It's gonna be okay.

1062
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,726
You're okay.

1063
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,764
Okay, Okay-

1064
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,520
What is that?

1065
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,641
Oh, my God.

1066
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,086
<i>The use of explosives</i>

1067

1068
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,040

Do not fire!
We're here to help you!

1075
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:23,687
Take positions
over there.

1076
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,848
We need a firing line.
Let's go!

1077
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,965
Who the fuck are you?

1078
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,611
Nobody special.

1079
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,680
Just some people who don't necessarily
agree with the Purge is all.

1080
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,601
You're with Carmelo Johns.

1081
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,566
Yes.

1082
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,324
Fuck the
New Founding Fathers!

1083
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,090
FUCK you!

1084
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,881
Fuck your money!
And motherfuck the Purge!

1085
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,280
Carmelo!

1086
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,001
We're over here.

1087
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,841
I know you.

1088
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,527
You once said that

1089
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,886
the market mentality
would no longer keep

1090
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,610
the American
people stunted.

1091
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,407
"We are outraged and
we're fighting back."

1092
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,928
Nice to meet you,
too, young lady.

1093
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,850
There's a lot
of them out here.

1094
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,409
Yeah, well,
there's more of us.

1095
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,481
We're more pissed off.

1096
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:30,527
It's time for them to
feel what it's like.

1097
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,529
Change only comes
when their blood spills.

1098
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,842
You might wanna get out of here.
It's about to get nasty.

1099
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,041
Hey.

1100
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,001
We gotta go.

1101
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,164
Look at me.

1102
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,647
He's gone.

1103
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,721
Come on.

1104
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,211
I wanna Purge.

1105
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,011
Look, we'll take
care of her.

1106
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,840
Are you sure?

1107
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,609
Go. We got it.

1108
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,325
Come on.

1109
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,365
I'm sorry.

1110
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,804
Here, take it.

1111
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:36,406
Get ready to bleed, rich bitches!
This is our time now!

1112
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,681
Get out of the car.

1113
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,929
Leave the keys and get out of the car.
Get out of the car!

1114
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,205
Oh! Oh, God, no!

1115
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,248
- No, don't shoot me. No. No, don't shoot me.
- Look at me!

1116
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,728
Please, don't shoot me. You don't
deserve to live, you piece of shit.

1117
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,162
You remember me, okay?
You remember me.

1118
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,401
No!

1119
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,964
Now, run.

1120
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,883
Run! Run!

1121
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,965
Faster!

1122
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,051
Look,
it's almost over.

1123
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,806
No, there's
still time. I can make it.

1124
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,090
I can make it.

1125
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,046
<i>There isn't much
time left in this year's Purge.</i>

1126
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:49,523
<i>Get out there and make
yourself better citizens.</i>

1127
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,123
<i>God be with you all.</i>

1128
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,520
You want to tell us
what we're doing here?

1129
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,641
Do you see that
house on the corner?

1130
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:11,409
The owner of that house
killed my son 12 months ago.

1131
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,084
Nicholas

1132
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,604
was coming home
from school,

1133
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,842
and he swerved
off the road.

1134
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,610
That bastard's
blood alcohol level

1135
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,960
was three times
the legal limit,

1136
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,642
but, you know, he got off
on a technicality, so...

1137
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,169
Him and his wife and
his two little kids,

1138
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,480
well, they live
in that house,

1139
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,122
happily ever after.

1140
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,125
Two weeks ago,
I came here

1141
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,565
and I disabled
his back barricade.

1142
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,927
That's what
we're doing here.

1143
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:55,723
I want you both to stay in this
car, do you understand me?

1144
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:59,009
I don't want you to move.
You'll be safe.

1145
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,525
It's almost over.
Don't, please.

1146
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,007
Let go of my arm.

1147
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,320
You can just
stay here with us.

1148
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,761
And we can drive away and it'll be fine.
Let go of my arm.

1149
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,281
Let go of my arm.

1150
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,840
No, please.
I know. I'm so sorry.

1151
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,685
I'm so sorry about what
happened to your son.

1152
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,729
Let go of my arm!

1153
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,009
Stay in this car.

1154
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,689
<i>There are five minutes
remaining in this year's Purge.</i>

1155
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,170
Hey-

1156
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,525
No! Don't talk.

1157
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,286
Shut your mouth. I'm not
here for your kids.

1158
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,124
- I'm here for you.
- Okay.

1159
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,287
Get up.

1160
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,203
No, no, no.

1161
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,322
Come on, come on, come on. Get up,
get up, get up.

1162
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,521
No, please don't...

1163
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,443
Shut up, or I'll
shoot you in the face!

1164
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,568
- Shut up! Get down!
- Okay! Okay, okay!

1165
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,247
You get on your stomach.
Lay down, flat.

1166
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,731
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Okay, okay.

1167
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,171
Look at my face.
Okay.

1168
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,090
Do you remember me? Look at my face!
Okay.

1169
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,880
Do you know what you took from me?
I know.

1170
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,724
Do you know what you took from me?
I know.

1171
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,204
You took my boy! You took my boy!
You took my fucking boy!

1172
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,442
I am so sorry.
You took my son.

1173
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,568
You killed my son,
you son of a bitch!

1174
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,730
Please!
Please don't do this.

1175
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,564
Look at me.
Look at my face.

1176
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,491
Did you see him when you hit him?
Did you see him?

1177
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,647
Tell me what
he looks like.

1178
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,721
Tell me what
he looked like!

1179
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,768
Tell me what he looks like.
I'm so sorry for what I did.

1180
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,285
Tell me you saw his face!

1181
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,441
Tell me you saw his face!
I saw him.

1182
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,648
You're gonna pay for
what you did to me.

1183
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,328
For what you did to my boy.
No, please.

1184
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,527
Please!

1185
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,730
We found your
car, Sergeant.

1186
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,245
Your plates told
us who you were.

1187
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,968
It was easy to see where
you were headed tonight.

1188
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,651
Hell, I would've
done the same thing.

1189
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,687
There's an unwritten
Purge rule, Sergeant.

1190
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,489
Don't save lives.

1191
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,928
Tonight, we take lives.

1192
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,004
We make things
manageable for us.

1193
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:46,163
Unfortunately, the citizens
aren't killing enough.

1194
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:52,448
So, we supplement it all
to keep things balanced.

1195
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:57,250
It's important
work the NFFA does,

1196
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,800
and we can't have
any interference.

1197
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,524
We can't have heroes.

1198
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,129
Oh, no, sir.

1199
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,764
No heroes.

1200
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,488
I hope you feel cleansed.

1201
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,442
Blessed be America,

1202
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,008
a nation reborn.

1203
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,449
Oh, no. Oh, God.

1204
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,530
Oh, my God.

1205
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:29,881
Oh.

1206
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,086
You got a car?

1207
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,567
Uh... Uh, yes.
You got a fucking car?

1208
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,290
Go get it now!
Yes, okay. Okay!

1209
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,486
Okay!

1210
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,570
Okay. Come on, Cali.

1211
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,446
Come here and
help me now, okay?

1212
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,204
Look at me! Do you
want him to survive?

1213
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,643
Then it's up to us. We gotta
help him now, okay? Okay?

1214
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,370
On three,
we're gonna pick him up.

1215
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:51,762
One, two, three!

1216
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,808
Come on!

1217
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,450
Come on!

1218
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,009
Hurry up and
get that car!

1219
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,161
Okay-

1220
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,567
Hospital's not far. We'll be there
in minutes.

1221
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,769
Come on, just hit it!
Go, go, go!

1222
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,487
You did it.

1223
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,608
You saved us.

1224
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,331
So, please, just let us
take care of you, okay?

1225
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,564
It's over. It's over.
