1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,714
Tensions are rising as the stand-off

3
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,801
between the world community and the
rogue North African nation of Wadiya

4
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,094
intensified today

5
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,140
as U.N. Weapons inspectors were once
again refused access to the country

6
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,476
by Wadiyan leader,
Admiral General Aladeen.

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,689
I will take no options off the
table. And I mean what I say.

8
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,859
Tonight we ask... Who
is General Aladeen?

9
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,069
According to Wadiyan propaganda,

10
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:13,281
Haffaz Aladeen was born in 1973.

11
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,787
He did not know his mother,
who died in childbirth.

12
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,084
General Aladeen was born the
only son of the Colonel Aladeen,

13
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,462
himself a savage and violent dictator.

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,300
Next!

15
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,053
Known for his iconic beard,

16
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,639
he is protected by 30 female guards,

17
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,641
who he maintains are virgin.

18
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,487
Thrust into power at age seven,

19
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:56,324
he may just be the most
dangerous man in the entire world.

20
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,326
All right, let's get right to it.

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,329
Do you have nuclear weapons?

22
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,583
What was the question?

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,128
Do you have nuclear weapons?

24
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,421
Sorry, I can't hear you.

25
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,215
Are you developing nuclear weapons?

26
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,383
No, I literally can't hear you.

27
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,011
I'm going to another question.

28
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,263
Oh, I can hear you now.

29
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,391
Eccentric and with unlimited oil wealth,

30
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,894
he recently hosted his
own Olympic Games...

31
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,396
On your mark, get set.

32
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,533
...at which he won fourteen gold medals.

33
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,372
Aladeen! Aladeen!

34
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,707
Often described as ignorant,

35
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,628
he changed over 300
Wadiyan words to "Aladeen,"

36
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,507
including the words "positive" and
"negative," causing mass confusion.

37
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,845
Do you want the Aladeen
news or the Aladeen news?

38
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,474
The Aladeen news?

39
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,812
You are HIV-Aladeen.

40
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,202
With pressure mounting,

41
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,830
Aladeen addressed his nation today.

42
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,332
Aladeen! Aladeen!

43
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,115
People of Wadiya,

44
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,993
I come before you today

45
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:08,706
to tell you that the world shall
kneel before our great nation.

46
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,961
We are two months away from
enriching weapons-grade uranium

47
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,552
to be used for peaceful purposes.

48
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,855
It will be used only
for medical research

49
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,317
and clean energy. It will, it will.

50
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,153
And will certainly never be used

51
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,989
to attack Is... Oh, boy.

52
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,994
With that speech, today,

53
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,664
the international community
is asking one question:

54
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,501
Does the Mad Dog of Wadiya
have nuclear weapons?

55
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,179
Now, show me my nuclear weapons!

56
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,015
I can't wait! I can't wait!

57
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,325
This is the Beard of Doom rocket?

58
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,662
This is my weapon? I
will be a laughingstock!

59
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,623
All my friends have got nuclear weapons.

60
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,375
Even Ahmadinejad!

61
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,920
And he looks like a
snitch on Miami Vice.

62
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,548
Would it kill him to wear a tie?

63
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,009
I mean, is every day
in Iran casual Friday?

64
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,889
Where is the Head of my Nuclear
Program and Procurer of Women?

65
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,058
Where is Nuclear Nadal?

66
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,728
You had Nadal executed, Supreme Leader.

67
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,187
Why did I do that?

68
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:01,986
Supreme Leader!

69
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,571
Nadal.

70
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,991
We are just months away from
refining weapons-grade uranium,

71
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,910
and we are set to test
the missile next week.

72
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,457
It is too round on the
top. It needs to be pointy.

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,752
Round is not scary. Pointy is scary.

74
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,004
This will put a smile on
the faces of the enemy.

75
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,591
They will think that it is a huge
robot dildo flying toward them.

76
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,050
No, Supreme Leader.

77
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,887
The shape of the missile top has
nothing to do with aerodynamics.

78
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,680
It is about the payload delivery.

79
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,932
No. It sticks in the
ground, and then kaboom.

80
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,893
Supreme Leader, I think perhaps

81
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,438
some of your information about
bombs is coming from cartoons.

82
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,857
Nonsense. They were research films.

83
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,610
And in them, the victims of the bomb

84
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,778
would get very sooty faces

85
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,865
and then a see-through
version of themselves

86
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,577
started rising up towards
Heaven while playing a harp.

87
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,039
In this film, just one question,

88
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,043
was there a duck who, when
the explosion is happens,

89
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,338
his bill goes around
to the back of his head,

90
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,549
and then in order to talk, he
has to put it back this way?

91
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,261
There was somebody who
suffered a deformity like that.

92
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,596
Okay.

93
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,016
I am now 100 % sure that
you are watching cartoons.

94
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,310
Have you spoken to
the experts about this?

95
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,313
- Have you consulted Professor Bobeye?
- Who?

96
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,816
Professor Bobeye, the one with
the incredibly strong forearms

97
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,944
that are miss-sized for his body.

98
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,446
The man you are discussing
is called Popeye.

99
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,490
- Bobeye.
- He is not a professor.

100
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,369
Popeye is, as the song
tells us, a sailor man.

101
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,248
Indulge me. For one second,
pretend that I'm an idiot.

102
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,374
Okay. I'm there.

103
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,669
And explain to me how this bomb

104
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,547
will not land in Israel

105
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,342
and then, literally, bounce
right back and blow up Wadiya.

106
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,302
Supreme Leader, let me explain to you.

107
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,512
You've lost me.

108
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,890
This is the missile in Wadiya,

109
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,685
you push the button, "Boop!"

110
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,273
Israel...

111
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,946
"No! Why?"

112
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,242
Nuclear winter.

113
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,702
The reality is...

114
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,541
Oy vey!

115
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,919
Us.

116
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,842
Believe me, sir, if I could make
the device even a little more pointy,

117
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,428
I would, but I simply cannot.

118
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,516
Okay. You know what?

119
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,311
Let's just agree to disagree, my friend.

120
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,729
Okay.

121
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,316
What? Why? No!

122
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,402
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I remember!

123
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,655
How dare you question my
memory? I remember everything!

124
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,575
No, I would never do that! Never!
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.

125
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,286
Don't worry, it's fine.
Well done, my friend.

126
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,746
Thank you.

127
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,540
Wait! Wait! Where are we going?

128
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,752
Admiral General, what if we
just tell the United Nations

129
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,170
we have no nuclear weapons?

130
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,630
They will lift the sanctions.

131
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,965
We'll be free to sell oil
rights to the Jalabiya desert.

132
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,634
Uncle Tamir.

133
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,927
Do you not remember
what my saintly father

134
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,888
made me promise him on his deathbed?

135
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,558
It was never to sell Wadiya's oil.

136
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,603
You remember that was
when he gave me power

137
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,647
instead of you, the rightful heir.

138
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,398
You've been so cool about it.

139
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,776
Now, let's go back to the palace.

140
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,235
It's the season finale

141
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,031
of Real Housewives of
Shachahmahahfalimitahlicch!

142
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,702
Aladeen! Aladeen!

143
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,762
Death to the tyrant!

144
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,733
Looks like we need to find a new double.

145
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,402
Because this one is...

146
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,446
You know, I don't know if
he's going to get better.

147
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,824
Oh, he's not going to
recover, sir. He's dead.

148
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,786
Send his wife some
chocolate covered almond nuts

149
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,789
in a cellophane wrapped box. Delicious.

150
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,918
We're going to send
your wife some almonds.

151
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,212
Chocolate covered versions of these.

152
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:37,344
Maroush, I think I dropped
an almond in his head.

153
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,846
Can you take it out?

154
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,725
What I don't want to do is
send the body to the family

155
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,519
and then they discover
an almond in his head,

156
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,980
and they say, "Why is there
an almond in his head?"

157
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,231
Take it out.

158
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,526
Clean it!

159
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,611
How am I gonna eat that?

160
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,408
- Don't eat it.
- Oh, Maroush!

161
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,703
Listen, everything
is gonna be just fine.

162
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,580
I don't want you to
worry about anything.

163
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,875
Yeah, how 'bout looking in my
eye when I'm speaking to you?

164
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,795
It's very rude not to look at somebody
in the eye when they're talking to you.

165
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,882
It's okay. Don't worry.
You're having a rough day.

166
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,227
We shot the wrong man.

167
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,856
I can fix this. I have a new
plan. We need to find a new double.

168
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,901
One that is simple enough
to be manipulated completely.

169
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,918
I think we found what
you are looking for.

170
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,471
You think this man looks like me?

171
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,265
You have a very big barn.

172
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,061
You must have many happy goats, hmm?

173
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,480
What the fuck does that even mean?

174
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,068
Uncle Tamir, this thing is an idiot.

175
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,070
What makes you think he can do the job?

176
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,074
May I remind you that his only
real job is to be shot in the head.

177
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,410
Very well. Put him
through the process, okay?

178
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,205
Clip his nails, file his teeth,

179
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,083
bleach his skin, and shorten the penis.

180
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,422
Megan! Megan!

181
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,425
You now have herpes.

182
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,847
Megan, you were worth every penny.

183
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,683
You were super hot.

184
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,268
Is my jet ready?

185
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,437
Yes, but do you want to stay the night?

186
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,273
You know, I really want
to do some cuddling.

187
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,524
No. Your time is up.

188
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,609
I have to be with the Italian
Prime Minister tomorrow.

189
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,320
Okay. Maroush, give the goodie bag!

190
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,738
Thanks.

191
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,240
I trust everything is in there,

192
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,033
as your manager requested?

193
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,202
Katy Perry said she got a diamond Rolex.

194
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,955
That's because she let
me Aladeen in her face.

195
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,959
Okay.

196
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,295
Right. Are you sure you don't
want to stay for some cuddles?

197
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,379
- No.
- But, please.

198
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,964
I really want someone to cuddle.

199
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,197
Breaking news now. Just moments ago,

200
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,448
the U.N. Security Council voted

201
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,909
to authorize NATO air
strikes against Wadiya,

202
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,205
unless Admiral General Aladeen
agrees to address the U.N. In person.

203
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,207
And now, the world waits.

204
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,541
What will Aladeen do next?

205
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:01,149
Next. No, no, no. No. Boring,
boring. Come on. Come on.

206
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,611
Beloved Oppressor, I have
just received disturbing news.

207
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,030
Welcome to the Munich Olympics.

208
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,699
Shalom?

209
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,034
Oy vey!

210
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,786
Supreme Leader,

211
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,162
the United Nations demands that

212
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,541
you address their concerns
about our nuclear program,

213
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,793
or they will vote to
authorize military action.

214
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,795
Summon my generals.

215
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,630
I'll join you after I finish this level.

216
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,632
Bonus round. Mass grave.

217
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,566
Those gangsters at the UN
want me to address them.

218
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,611
Fine! I'll address them like
they've never been addressed before.

219
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,071
How much time have they allotted me?

220
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,740
Seven minutes, sir.

221
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,534
I'll talk for 14 hours!

222
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,746
And three of those
will be untranslatable.

223
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,247
Literally, baby noises.

224
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,545
Okay. Let's rehearse
this. Role play, role play.

225
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,672
You, come on. This'll be fun.

226
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,800
So, Secretary General,
your soldiers will weep...

227
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,472
I'm so sorry! Listen,
it was not my fault.

228
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,099
I mean, somebody had
set the safety catch

229
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,018
to "Aladeen" instead of "Aladeen."

230
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,353
Look, I mean, this whole gun...

231
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,523
It's gonna be fine.
You just need to ice it.

232
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,066
You got to ice.

233
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,735
Promise me you're going to ice?

234
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,111
Okay. Tamir!

235
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,614
Inflate my neck pillow

236
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,075
and pack my book of
medium-level Sudoku.

237
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,329
We're going to America!

238
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,482
America!

239
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,069
The birthplace of AIDS.

240
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:17,244
Supreme Leader, I took the liberty
of hiring some extra security.

241
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,829
This is Mr. Clayton.

242
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:22,040
Admiral General, I am here
for your protection 24/7.

243
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,208
Okay.

244
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,878
But in the interest of full
disclosure, I have to say I hate A-rabs.

245
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,881
Well, that's fine,
because I'm not an Arab.

246
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,927
Well, you're all A-rabs to
me, the blacks, the Jews,

247
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,763
those blue tree-hugging
queers in A-vatar.

248
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,769
In fact, anyone from outside of
America is technically an A-rab.

249
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,021
Listen, while you're here,

250
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,400
I highly recommend a visit
to the Empire State Building,

251
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,570
before you or one of your
sand-monkey cousins takes it down.

252
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,699
Also, if you're interested in taking
in a Broadway show while you're here,

253
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,492
and you don't mind the homo stuff,

254
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,828
I highly recommend Billy Elliot.

255
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,415
You know what, I like this
guy despite his liberal views.

256
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,708
Very good, sir.

257
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,592
Supreme Leader, the suite has been
renovated to your specifications.

258
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,267
Twenty dollars a day for
Internet? What the fuck?

259
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,314
And they accuse me of being
an international criminal?

260
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,567
Beloved Oppressor,
try to get some sleep.

261
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,277
Tomorrow is your big speech.

262
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,363
Nobody touch the minibar!
It's a fucking rip-off!

263
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,927
Rise and shine.

264
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,179
Who are you?

265
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,848
We've actually already met.

266
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,516
Hello, Aladdin.

267
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,769
Clayton? I thought we were friends.

268
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,355
Nice to see you, too.

269
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,024
Here's the deal.

270
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,360
I'm gonna kill you, and then
I'm gonna burn your body.

271
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,569
No, no, no. Please, don't.

272
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,823
But before I do I have one
very important question for you.

273
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,576
Did you get a chance
to see Billy Elliot?

274
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,162
Yes.

275
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,372
And?

276
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,208
I found it heartwarming
and life-affirming.

277
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,045
Thank you! How great is that show?

278
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,630
It is. It's great, yeah.

279
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,216
You know, he's got like
an artist inside himself,

280
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,053
but he's in this working class
place and no one understands him.

281
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,139
He's just like... I'm gonna
express myself in my dance.

282
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,641
And he expresses himself...

283
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,770
And he doesn't wanna use violence, but
he puts his violence into his dance.

284
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,146
You should try that.

285
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,651
Okay. So, we gotta get down
to business. Enough chit-chat.

286
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,236
I'm being paid to kill you.

287
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,029
But I'm gonna torture you for free.

288
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,160
Are you serious?

289
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,578
Where'd you get those relics?

290
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,248
From the Shah of Iran's garage sale?

291
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,666
Yeah, right.

292
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,167
I mean, I know there's
nothing more annoying

293
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,752
than a backseat torturer,
but, please, come on.

294
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,421
This is great stuff.

295
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,924
It's not great stuff.
That's like 1972, hello.

296
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,179
You won't be talking so much
smack with this up your butt.

297
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,850
That's the Anal Umbrella. It's
a good device, I grant you,

298
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,852
but where's the splash guard?

299
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,895
You're going to kill
me and your white shirt.

300
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,939
It didn't come with a splash guard.

301
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,025
You're gonna get chara on your trousers.

302
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,193
I can see it has a screw hole for one.

303
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,695
Apparently, I didn't get it.

304
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,072
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

305
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,366
check out this bad boy.

306
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,910
Oh, that's not bad. The
Kandahar Cock Wrench.

307
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,370
Okay, so, now we're getting somewhere.

308
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,290
It's actually been banned in
Saudi Arabia for being too safe.

309
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,793
You know, this is totally depressing.

310
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,462
Listen, just show me another one.

311
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,298
You know, honestly, I don't even
want to show you anything anymore.

312
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,300
Don't be like that.

313
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,802
You know, I don't even think
you want to be tortured.

314
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,220
I don't want to be tortured.

315
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,555
You're just, like, taking
all the fun out of it!

316
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,807
You just want me to say
compliments all the time.

317
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,810
So either you want the truth
or you want compliments. Decide!

318
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,397
It'd be nice if I got just a little
bit of positive feedback about my tools.

319
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,357
What else you got? I'm
gonna love the next thing!

320
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,567
I will be supportive.

321
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,152
All right.

322
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,030
Just this. This pours
hot fire out on you.

323
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,199
Oh, the Fallujah Firehose!

324
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,034
Someone's got a friend in Syria!

325
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,577
I am pretty proud of it.

326
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,245
There is a new model, you know.

327
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,790
I've got one that works by Bluetooth.

328
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,418
Screw it. Screw it! Screw it!

329
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,045
I'm going to enjoy this now.

330
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,880
No, don't. Don't. Don't. Please, don't!

331
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,308
No one will recognize
the body without this!

332
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,811
The Supreme Beard! You will be cursed!

333
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,020
No, no, don't do it!

334
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,897
Come on! Why won't this catch?

335
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,818
You foolish man! There is no
earthly fire that could ever light...

336
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,113
The flames of the
righteous attack the unjust!

337
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,876
I'll be back with help!
J. K! Just kidding!

338
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,716
My speech.

339
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,555
Yo! Average American shopper!

340
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,723
I do not have any money on me,

341
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,183
but if you give me your clothes

342
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,395
I'll make a sizeable donation
in your name to al-Qaeda.

343
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:47,615
Hey, hey, oh, oh! Aladeen has got to go!

344
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,286
Hello. I am Admiral General Aladeen.

345
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,580
I am here to deliver my
speech to the United Nations.

346
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,498
Look, Admiral, it's too hot for crazy.

347
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,791
How dare you?

348
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,002
Listen, Tamir is coming right now.

349
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,421
You're going to be in
big trouble. Here he is.

350
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,214
Tamir! Tamir!

351
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,350
Tamir, it was you, you snake!

352
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,898
He's not the legitimate leader!

353
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,816
He's not the legitimate leader!

354
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,153
He's not the legitimate leader!

355
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,490
You have rehearsed the
speech I prepared for you?

356
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,577
Yes. But when is the General coming?

357
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,995
He's feeling ill.

358
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,331
Does he have worms in his shilshul?

359
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,582
Very possibly.

360
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,668
Admiral General Aladeen preparing

361
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,837
to address the General
Assembly of the United Nations.

362
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,922
An historic moment.

363
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,673
He's approaching the podium.

364
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,259
And he's walked right past the podium.

365
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,427
What is he doing?

366
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,846
You are making a fool out of me!

367
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,182
Let's bring in Denise,
our U. N. Correspondent.

368
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,475
What do you make of that?

369
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,186
Well, I have to say,
he's got their attention.

370
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,688
Every eye in the room
is on him right now.

371
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,191
And he's returning to the podium.

372
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,860
And he's fallen off the stage.

373
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,612
What do you make of that, Denise?

374
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:12,533
You know, he's clearly implying
that the U. N. Must fall before him.

375
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,453
Drinking from the
pitcher of water directly,

376
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,081
as opposed to the glass that
I'm sure must be up there.

377
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,207
What do you think that means?

378
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,334
Again, it's another attempt to say,

379
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,628
"Listen, I'm not going
to play by your rules."

380
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,380
And he seems to have
a pitcher of urine out.

381
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,132
I believe he just
urinated in the pitcher.

382
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,552
He is now drinking his urine.

383
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,471
It looks to be his own urine.

384
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,264
Sorry. You want?

385
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,850
Trying to force it on
the Israeli delegation.

386
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,852
That might be the ambassador.

387
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,940
He is dumping the urine
on the Israeli delegation.

388
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,441
Oh, that's a good one.

389
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,112
Okay, he's returning to the podium.

390
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:54,033
Much has been made of the
hostility between our countries.

391
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,869
With the help of the U.M.,

392
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,540
I will draft a new
constitution for Wadiya

393
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:05,878
and sign it in five days,
on Wadiya's Independence Day.

394
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,213
No, no, no.

395
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,215
This new constitution

396
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,092
will end the dictatorship...

397
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,176
No!

398
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,722
...and it will turn Wadiya into a

399
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,557
democracy.

400
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,895
No! Democracy? Never!

401
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,981
Never!

402
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,235
The Wadiyan people love being oppressed!

403
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,530
Dictatorship forever!

404
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,372
Come on! Come with me!

405
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,207
Hurry!

406
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,882
Hello, person. Person.

407
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,467
Black person.

408
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,802
The double that you found is good.

409
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,637
He is almost as dumb as the real guy.

410
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,390
So, Wadiya will become a democracy.

411
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,060
China is a democracy, too.

412
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,772
Once that constitution is signed,

413
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:09,067
I will be able to sell
Wadiya's oil rights. Gazprom,

414
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,694
you will have control of
Wadiya's southern oil fields.

415
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,571
B. P., you will control the north.

416
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,073
Exxon, you will have
all offshore rights,

417
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,408
provided you do not use
B. P.'s drilling rigs.

418
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:21,496
And, Mr. Lao of PetroChina, you will
have the lease on our shale reserves.

419
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,539
Some of those reserves are
in densely populated areas.

420
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,250
Then unpopulate them.

421
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,629
After you've paid me my 30 %
finder's fee, of course.

422
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,422
Gentlemen.

423
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,426
So, you're going to make billions.

424
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,512
What will you do with all those dollars?

425
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,641
I will buy the house on Lake
Como next to George Clooney's.

426
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,810
I love George Clooney!

427
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,937
He's an old-fashioned movie star.

428
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,814
He gay? He suck my dick?

429
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,276
No, those are just rumors.
Are you a homosexual?

430
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,113
No, no, no, it's more
of a power trip with me.

431
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,739
Everybody has a price.

432
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,909
Tommy Lee Jones let me roll it in
my fingers for two hundred grand!

433
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,794
Oh, my gosh, that was so crazy!

434
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,296
I am so honored to be able to help you.

435
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,549
Finally, somebody who knows who I am.

436
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,050
Yeah, of course!

437
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,804
You're the Wadiyan dissident who was
standing up to that asshole Aladeen.

438
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,806
It was so brave of you.

439
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,142
- My name is Zoey.
- I don't care.

440
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,351
What's yours?

441
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,312
My name is Ala... son.

442
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,648
- Allison?
- Right. Allison.

443
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,817
What's your last name?

444
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,071
Burgers.

445
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,907
Nice to meet you, Allison Burgers.

446
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,701
- You know, I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

447
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,122
Allison, could you please
take your hands off my breasts?

448
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,541
Those are breasts? I
thought you were a boy.

449
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,755
- Where are you taking me to?
- To Brooklyn!

450
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,309
So, yeah, this is my store!

451
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,852
This is the Free Earth Collective.

452
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,439
We are a vegan, feminist,
non-profit cooperative operating

453
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,774
within an anti-racist,
anti-oppressive framework

454
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,526
for people of all or no genders.

455
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,946
We are a pure democracy,

456
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,115
just like Wadiya's going to be soon!

457
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,159
Get me clothes, little man.

458
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,203
Oh, you know what, there's some
in the Earthquake Relief box

459
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,829
in the lesbian bathroom, right there.

460
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,122
Right.

461
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,626
So, Allison, we're the
only store in New York,

462
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,920
other than that fascist
superchain Green World,

463
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,005
that sells your nation's
specialty fruit, mafroom,

464
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,549
which I know you people eat a lot of.

465
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,676
Oh, I hope that didn't come
off like a cultural stereotype.

466
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,221
Because I'm, like, the
furthest thing from a racist.

467
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,182
I pretty much haven't had a
white boyfriend since high school.

468
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,226
Well, the darker races are less choosy.

469
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,854
Okay, that came off
as kind of offensive.

470
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,439
Thank you.

471
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,692
Anyway, let me give you the grand tour.

472
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,612
Up on the roof, we have this
amazing organic garden...

473
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,448
Boring! Do you sell any assault rifles?

474
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,534
Oh, wait. I got it. Humor. Right?

475
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,287
I took a feminist clown workshop once.

476
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,581
Help! Help! I'm trapped
under a glass ceiling!

477
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,583
What the fuck?

478
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,835
I wasn't the best student, but...

479
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,380
We've got this wellness center
downstairs in the basement,

480
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,758
where we do water birth. Have
you ever seen a water birth?

481
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,386
Not a water birth, but
I've seen a water death.

482
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,137
Wow. Was it moving?

483
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,181
There was actually very little movement.

484
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,309
A little wriggling, then two
bubbles, and then a big bloop

485
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,686
and the wallet floats up.

486
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,563
You seem educated.

487
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,440
Yes. I went to Amherst.

488
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,776
I love it when women go to school.

489
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,862
It's like seeing a
monkey on rollerskates.

490
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,116
It means nothing to them,
but it's so adorable for us.

491
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,618
Okay. Well, hey, Allison,

492
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,955
you know, we'd love to have you
work here if you ever wanted to.

493
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,209
All of our employees are
political refugees, just like you!

494
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,460
There's Hannah over here.

495
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,464
She's from El Salvador. She's a
really useful member of our team.

496
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,553
Useful as what? A coat hanger?

497
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,639
- Come on.
- Allison, that's not funny.

498
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,976
Okay. I tell you what, get
back to work, Captain Hook!

499
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,478
- "Captain Hook." It's funny.
- No, it's not funny.

500
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,730
Who's that?

501
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:16,981
Oh, this is Joteph.

502
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,483
He's from a Sudanese tribe
that has no concept of money.

503
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,986
His entire village was ransacked.

504
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,320
Hey, Sub-Saharan!

505
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:28,159
Do you think you could get me 100
child soldiers here by 5:00 p.m.?

506
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,285
No!

507
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,661
Okay. Time out! Time out.

508
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:31,954
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

509
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,914
Shave your
under-the-arms!

510
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,084
I dread to think what kind of
jungle you have on your malawach!

511
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,919
That is very inappropriate.

512
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,922
Don't tell me what to say and
what not to say, little boy.

513
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,258
You need to put that finger away.

514
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,718
I won't put my finger away because...

515
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,303
Look, I've got two fingers now.

516
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,429
Okay.

517
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,099
If you do not stop using hateful
language, you cannot work here.

518
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,477
All right. I promise.

519
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,770
Okay.

520
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,774
I tricked you, Wolverina.

521
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,778
Justin Bieber's chubby double!

522
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,865
Hairy Potter!

523
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,458
Good-bye, old friend.

524
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,966
When will the Supreme Leader be better?

525
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,093
In time.

526
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,597
He's resting in his bedroom and
must never, ever be disturbed.

527
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,516
Time for bed.

528
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,856
Being Aladeen has its
perks, does it not?

529
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,694
Dropped your belt.

530
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,170
What are you doing?

531
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,463
She tried to milk me!

532
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,714
No.

533
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,134
They are trying to pleasure you.

534
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,053
Allow the girls to
use their many talents.

535
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,730
No!

536
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,316
Supreme Leader! The girls!

537
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,319
Girls, show him your bosoms.

538
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,849
Let me in! I have 85
rooms at this hotel!

539
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,018
It's me, Admiral General Aladeen!

540
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,394
I lost my beard!

541
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,104
You don't got a pass, you don't get in.

542
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,524
But I'm staying here! I paid twenty
dollars for the fucking Internet!

543
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,195
How much do you charge
for assassinations?

544
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,634
Why is this happening to me?

545
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,888
All I ever did was
steal my country's wealth

546
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,391
and execute anybody who
did not agree with me,

547
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,143
and many who did.

548
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,895
Why me?

549
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:47,024
Why is it always the good guys? Why?

550
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,241
Nadal?

551
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,622
Welcome to the Death
to Aladeen Restaurant.

552
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,084
Wait. You look very familiar.

553
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,752
Do I know you?

554
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,632
Sorry.

555
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,217
So sorry, Supreme Leader.

556
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,219
Don't worry. I'm 50 % to blame.

557
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,099
No! No! Supreme Leader!

558
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,935
Definitely not. I must be going.

559
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,145
No, no. Stay, please.

560
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,564
If you hate Aladeen
and you like good food,

561
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,650
this is the place for
you. This way. Here we go.

562
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,666
Enjoy it.

563
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,629
No! No!

564
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,355
For you.

565
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,815
What is your name?

566
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,442
Allison Burgers.

567
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,987
That's a made-up name.
What's your real name?

568
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,742
Ladis.

569
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,077
Ladis what?

570
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,371
Ladis Washerum.

571
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,585
So your name is like the
sign. "Ladies Washroom"?

572
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,379
That is a made-up name.

573
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,297
What is your real name?

574
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,509
I am interested. We are interested.

575
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,764
Emploice.

576
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,432
Emploice what?

577
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,185
Emploice... Muswashans.

578
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,272
That is a made-up name.

579
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,692
Okay.

580
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,903
What is your real name?

581
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,863
Max.

582
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Max what?

583
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,202
Imumoccupancyu
One-hundred-and-twenty.

584
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,499
There's a number in the name?

585
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,210
Who are you? An Aladeen sympathizer?

586
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,171
No, no, no! Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Okay. No, no, no!

587
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,256
No!

588
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,758
It's Aladeen! It's
Aladeen without the beard!

589
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,885
No! It's not Aladeen!

590
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,804
Hasan, lock the door!

591
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,351
Wait, wait, wait, no!
There you are, cousin!

592
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,146
This is my cousin. I
see you've all met him.

593
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,149
He's very simple and
backwards. I'm sorry.

594
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,358
- Sorry.
- It's okay, sit.

595
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,776
- Okay.
- Sit and eat.

596
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,611
Have a seat, cousin.

597
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,614
Very sorry. My apologies. Enjoy.

598
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,909
What are you doing here? And
what has happened to your beard?

599
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,538
I've been replaced by this body
double who's a total imbecile.

600
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,290
How are you alive?

601
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,126
How am I... Wait. You don't know?

602
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,335
No.

603
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,797
Every single person you
had executed is still alive.

604
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,216
We all live here in Little Wadiya.

605
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,760
The executioner, he is a
member of the Resistance!

606
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,345
You mean I never executed anybody?

607
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,472
No.

608
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,557
Like, honestly, zero people.

609
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,396
Nadal, you must help
me get back into power.

610
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,315
What? No. Why would I do that?

611
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,775
I have a perfectly good
job here. I'm a Mac Genius!

612
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,612
What do you do?

613
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,950
Mostly, I clean semen out of laptops.

614
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,204
Congratulations. Living
the American dream.

615
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,415
Okay, fine. I will help
you. On one condition.

616
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,750
Name it.

617
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,460
You reinstate me as
Head of Nuclear Research,

618
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,837
so I can finish building my bomb.

619
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,214
Deal.

620
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,674
One last thing.

621
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,427
You will let me build
a round nuclear weapon.

622
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,013
Never. It must be pointy.

623
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,682
- Wait a minute. This is...
- Whoa.

624
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,478
Okay, compromise. Conical.

625
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,313
- Round. Round.
- Teat-shaped.

626
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,649
Okay.

627
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,275
- Okay. Deal.
- Deal.

628
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,447
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

629
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,742
our Supreme Leader is indisposed
to answer your questions

630
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,746
as he is currently drafting
Wadiya's new constitution,

631
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,082
which is scheduled to be signed

632
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,252
at the Lancaster Penthouse
Ballroom in three days.

633
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,003
Thank you. No further questions.

634
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,478
There is no way we're going
to get anywhere near this hotel

635
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,939
without a security
pass. This is ridiculous.

636
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,358
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

637
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,610
Hiding from that lesbian hobbit.

638
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,195
That woman, you know her?

639
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,406
I cannot begin to tell
you what an honor it is

640
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,366
to be able to provide
all of the catering...

641
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,742
Well, of course.

642
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,119
...and the mafroom for this signing.

643
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,870
You just paid this month's rent!

644
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,998
She offered me a job.

645
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,834
Can you imagine that? Me? Working?

646
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,379
Listen, hold onto that badge. It's the
only thing that'll get you past security.

647
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,422
Okay, thanks.

648
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,965
Wait a minute.

649
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,177
Wait, her company is catering the
event. She has a security pass!

650
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,555
That is the answer. This is the plan.

651
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,141
Okay? You will take that job
and you will work for her.

652
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,311
I will get you an
identical beard and costume.

653
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,812
And then on the day of the event,

654
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,982
you enter the Lancaster
as a member of her staff.

655
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,067
You will find the
double, switch with him,

656
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,611
then rip up the constitution
in front of the whole world.

657
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,282
Me? Work for that hairy titted yeti?

658
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,383
Kimberly?

659
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,218
Zoey.

660
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,511
Who cares?

661
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,514
I've come here to apologize

662
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,185
about some of the comments
I may have made about

663
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,312
Captain Hook and Blackie.

664
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,273
Great!

665
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,901
And I accept your job
offer as general manager.

666
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,028
Well, you can't be the manager,
because I am the manager.

667
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,488
Well, I can if I killed you.

668
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,242
I think I'm starting to get you.

669
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,453
All right, then... I will get you.

670
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,039
Great! Let's get you to work!

671
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,124
Yeah? Hold on one second.

672
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,002
Hey, my man! Excuse me. Hairnet!

673
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,128
Yeah.

674
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,131
I need a little of the
quinoa salad, please,

675
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,134
and throw a couple of extra
cranny-b's on top, if you could,

676
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,137
and I kind of need you to
hurry up, chief. Chop-chop.

677
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,266
Next!

678
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,145
Whoa, whoa! Occupied!

679
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,523
Out. I have to clean. Come
on, out you go, out you go.

680
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,899
- What? You're hurting me!
- Out. Come on.

681
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,403
Hey, Allison, can you take
out the garbage? Thanks.

682
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,955
Look! One of the customers left a tip of

683
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:44,626
some Nair and some female razors.
Does anybody want to use it?

684
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,091
Stop that.

685
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,385
Suck it, loser.

686
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,726
Clean-up on aisle four!

687
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,032
Hey, buddy, I saw that.

688
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,452
That is very disrespectful
to your leader.

689
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,744
Whatever, dude. Who are you,

690
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,289
Osama bin Laden's best friend?

691
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,000
No, he is not my best friend!

692
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,877
Though he has been
staying in my guest house

693
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,045
ever since they shot
his double last year.

694
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,965
Now the guy won't leave.

695
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,259
I know why this guy's the
most hated man in the world.

696
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,344
You just have to go to
the bathroom after him.

697
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,388
You go to the bathroom after Osama,

698
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,224
you will realize the
true meaning of terrorism.

699
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,703
Here is the plan.

700
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,538
We're going to take this helicopter tour

701
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,082
and fly over the Lancaster
to spot its weaknesses.

702
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,003
Remember, we're just two
ordinary American tourists

703
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,339
looking at the sights.

704
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,842
Don't worry, nobody gonna suspect
anything. It's a great plan, pointy.

705
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,802
Don't do anything to
arouse any suspicions.

706
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,722
Don't worry. I am
Wadiya's number one actor.

707
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,475
You don't win four Wadiyan
Golden Globes for nothing.

708
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,894
Yes, you do, because you
gave them to yourself!

709
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,064
My performance in Aladeen
Jones and the Temple of Doom

710
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,190
was outstanding.

711
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,650
I give it thumbs down.

712
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,443
Have you seen You've Got Mail Bomb?

713
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,404
Yes, I've seen them all!
They're all terrible movies!

714
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,864
Listen to me. Okay?

715
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,033
You are a terrible actor.

716
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:44,246
I urge you, right now, keep
your performance small and real.

717
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,248
All right, can you get me a cloak?

718
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,332
Why?

719
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,167
Because I think my guy
would be wearing a cloak.

720
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:53,463
No, your guy wears an American flag
sweatsuit and a sheriff's badge.

721
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,548
I need the sheriff's badge.

722
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,049
For what?

723
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,425
You're sheriff of American douche-town!

724
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,177
That's rude.

725
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,262
Listen.

726
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:04,224
We're going to walk over
there, act very inconspicuous.

727
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,725
- Okay. No problem.
- This has to work.

728
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,519
Don't worry. Just relax.

729
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,273
Are you okay?

730
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,691
My guy has a limp.

731
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,278
I fell off me horse at
the old Bull & Bush Pub

732
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,529
because I am a cockney.

733
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,863
Listen! Listen, okay?

734
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,741
You need to focus up
right now and be prepared

735
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,119
to deliver a small, subtle performance.

736
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,620
- Okay, great, okay.
- Okay, good.

737
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,247
Okay. So, when we go to fly...

738
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,999
Don't do that with your eyes!

739
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,750
You can't be a Chinese
person on this thing, okay?

740
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,127
I'm not chink, I'm Chinese-American!

741
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,295
No, but you cannot hold your eyes!

742
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,588
Nobody is going to think
you're Chinese-American

743
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,630
because you hold your eyes like that!

744
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,173
It's racist, what you are doing!

745
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,801
Do you know it's a fact that
they cannot pronounce their R's?

746
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,052
They pronounce them as L's.

747
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,013
So instead you know what
"rabbit" is in Chinese?

748
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,222
I don't know how to speak Chinese.

749
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,516
- It's "labbit."
- It's not "labbit"!

750
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,227
Yes! Who Shot Loger Labbit
was a huge hit in China!

751
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,312
Nobody... It's stup...

752
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,438
All right, I don't care.
This is stupid, okay?

753
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,482
Okay, I'll do Filipino. I
like to work, I like to talk.

754
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,817
- Don't.
- I like the shit, I do the kids.

755
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:56,901
Stop that.

756
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,488
Your Filipino is the
same as your Chinese!

757
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,365
Now who's being a lacist?

758
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,909
- You're being lacist now.
- I'm not being racist!

759
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,661
Right now we have to
get on this helicopter

760
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,913
and we have to act like true Americans.

761
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,790
I guess you don't want
me to play black then.

762
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,251
Of course I don't
want you to play black.

763
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,086
Okay. Just throwing it out there.

764
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,755
Okay. Don't.

765
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,090
Okay, don't do that.

766
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,092
- I see what you're doing.
- That's how they walk.

767
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,135
I see what you're doing, it's not cool.

768
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,261
It's how they walk.

769
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,069
I love being an Americans!

770
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,654
America is number one!

771
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,449
Oh, I am from U.S.A.!

772
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,910
My father also from U.S.A.

773
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:51,373
My great-grandfather fought
in the American Civil Jihad.

774
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,709
I am very proud to be an American.

775
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,420
I am America's number one douche.

776
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,759
I've fooled them. Job done.

777
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,388
So, how are things back at the Palace?

778
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,600
Fine, but guess who's still
living in my guest house?

779
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:12,644
Ooh, Bin Laden?

780
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,355
Yes, Osama.

781
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,066
Bin Laden flooding the bathroom
every time he showers...

782
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,028
And how hard is it to put
a bath mat down, Bin Laden?

783
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,033
Hey, do you remember
my favorite sports car?

784
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,660
You mean your Porsche?

785
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,245
Yes... the 911.

786
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,747
911, it's the best!

787
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:37,335
So I was driving my 911
near the palace one day...

788
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,629
and I totally crashed!

789
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,010
It's ok, I've already ordered a new one.

790
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,013
A brand new 9112012.

791
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,352
You know, while you are here, you
should try to see some of the sights...

792
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:57,564
such as the Empire State Building...

793
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,525
and Yankee Stadium.

794
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:05,196
And I'd love to see the fireworks
over the Statue of Liberty.

795
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,370
Hey, have your old back
problems been bothering you?

796
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,166
Oh, it's been terrible! It got so
bad that I made myself a back brace.

797
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,795
- Really?
- Yes, look, I'm still wearing it.

798
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,841
Hey, my English is getting good...

799
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,553
...I bet I can count down
from five faster than you can!

800
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,805
Five, four, three, two, one!

801
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,521
Allison! Are you okay?

802
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,064
I... Yes.

803
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,775
You know what? You
people, you make me sick!

804
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,320
You see a Middle
Easterner on an aircraft

805
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,448
and you just assume that he's
hatching some violent plot?

806
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:53,077
Allison Burgers is a persecuted
dissident, not a murderous madman!

807
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,997
He was reported saying, "Let's take
out the guards at the Lancaster."

808
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,541
Guess what? We deliver to the Lancaster!

809
00:47:58,626 --> 00:47:59,626
Good one!

810
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,795
Maybe he wanted to take the
guards out for a falafel!

811
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,130
That's a bit of a stereotype,

812
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,342
but I get the idea.
Great idea! Yeah. You...

813
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,428
You know what? Is it a
crime to care about your job?

814
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,679
Yeah! Well, it is in Wadiya.

815
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,266
Where did you get your diversity
and sensitivity training, huh?

816
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,559
The Stasi?

817
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:20,647
Let's see how you feel about racial
profiling when white people...

818
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,786
And I know what I'm talking about

819
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,413
because I majored in Fem Lit!

820
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,457
Come on.

821
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,794
Hey! What are you doing?
Where are you going?

822
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,878
Don't worry!

823
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:46,047
Just suck the fatoot of the
biggest guy, you'll be fine.

824
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,131
You're really fucking me here, man!

825
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,469
The police here are such fascists!

826
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:52,679
Yeah, right, and not in a good way.

827
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,389
It just makes me so mad!

828
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,225
You know, Zoey, you
were great back there.

829
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,935
Thanks. I just...

830
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,104
I don't know, I just feel so sorry

831
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,564
that wherever you go in the world,

832
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,315
you're the victim of police abuse.

833
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,483
Well, not always the victim.

834
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,946
Come here. I'm just so
sorry! You're okay now.

835
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,281
All right?

836
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,741
And I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

837
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,535
You know what? Let's get you
back to the collective, okay?

838
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,287
Come on.

839
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,371
No, a bit more.

840
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,290
Okay.

841
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,959
- Come on, let's go. I need to go to work.
- I feel so sad!

842
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,712
Let's do another hug, okay?

843
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,505
Allison, why are you sad?

844
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,008
The brutality?

845
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,093
Did you suffer from sexual abuse?

846
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,305
Yes, they raped me in a
very unprofessional way.

847
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,641
Oh, no. We have to get
you to the Rape Center.

848
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,560
You have a center for rape here?

849
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,895
Great! I'd love to go!
Maybe another time, you know.

850
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,274
Hire a limo, have some
cocktails, bring my raping shoes.

851
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,326
Can you get me that one?

852
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,536
Which one?

853
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,788
The one with the "fuck-me hooves."

854
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,833
You're bizzare. I'm going to
have to change the channels now.

855
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,086
...tour from hell for an Ohio
couple earlier today when,

856
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,463
...with shades of 9l11,

857
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,591
their helicopter tour of the
Manhattan skyline was cut short

858
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,803
by what police are now calling
a "terrorism misunderstanding"

859
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:19,724
involving a man named
Emer Gencyexitonly.

860
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,517
Etra.

861
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,395
We have a problem.

862
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,819
Hannah, that guy from the
Lancaster's coming tomorrow morning,

863
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,696
so why don't you take
the mafroom downstairs

864
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,782
and make some sort of a nice display?

865
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,451
I just want everything to be perfect.

866
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,161
Zoey?

867
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,412
Allison. Hi.

868
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,165
To thank you for what you did
today at the police station,

869
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,501
I have decided to
bestow upon you a gift.

870
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,212
- That's sweet. What is it?
- Yeah.

871
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,263
I don't know what that is.

872
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,141
It's fine. Please,
gobble up my little mouse.

873
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,185
Snack on my tiny raisin.

874
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,895
Give her a mouth bath. Go.

875
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,899
Oh! No!

876
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,444
No, I am not going to do that.

877
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,988
I'm getting a lot of this
and not much of this...

878
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,828
Listen, I understand that
you're having urges, okay?

879
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,954
Right.

880
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,623
But you need to take
care of them by yourself.

881
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,750
Myself? What? How?

882
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,544
You need to touch yourself.

883
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,380
I don't touch myself.
Do you touch yourself?

884
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,007
I think most healthy people do, yes.

885
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,428
Yeah, you touch your own
malawach? Disgusting! Yuck!

886
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,595
Yuck!

887
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:43,266
Stop joking, all right?
You've never jerked off?

888
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,853
Okay, come with me.

889
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,938
Where are you taking
me to? The Rape Center?

890
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,485
This is silly.

891
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,154
Okay...

892
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,574
Take your penis out and
put it in your hands.

893
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,700
This is silly.

894
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:06,622
Now, slowly move your hand up and down.

895
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:07,790
Okay.

896
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,793
I told you already, this is...

897
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,298
Wait.

898
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,550
What sorcery is this?

899
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,678
Some people wait a lifetime

900
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:25,475
For a moment like this

901
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,811
Some people wait a lifetime

902
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,814
For a moment like this

903
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:37,236
Whoa, I can't believe
it's happening to me

904
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,239
Some people wait a lifetime

905
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:45,828
For a moment like this

906
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:54,795
I can't believe it's happening to me

907
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,050
I did it! I just jerked
it completely off!

908
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,593
I did it all by myself!

909
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,012
With this hand right here!

910
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,307
I grabbed my bilbul like
I was strangling a bird.

911
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,559
And I smacked it and I smacked
it and I gave it a flick,

912
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:09,977
and out came my own labeneh!

913
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,229
Zoey?

914
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,982
Zoey! You have changed my life!

915
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:19,570
Give a man a vagina and
he will shpichs for a day.

916
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,366
Teach a man to use his hand as a vagina,

917
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,409
and he will shpichs for a lifetime.

918
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,995
Oh. No, no. Thank you.

919
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,415
Allison, you may need to keep
your voice down because...

920
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,460
We've got a lot of customers.
You may want to go wash up.

921
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,586
Fine.

922
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,339
Joteph, go and hose down my Crocs.

923
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,842
I've done my labeneh all
over the wellness center.

924
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,515
Okay.

925
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,895
The guy from the Lancaster
is going to love this.

926
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,730
Okay.

927
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,274
Good night, Allison.

928
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,150
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

929
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,903
Good night! Thank you again.

930
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,618
This is nice. Or lovely.

931
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,292
- Who is it?
- Nadal.

932
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,418
What are you doing?

933
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,128
I've discovered this amazing thing.

934
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,046
I have to show you how to do it.

935
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,965
It's called self juicing.

936
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,051
You put your hand on your
bilbul and you rub it,

937
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:26,387
and then you can make
your own labeneh come out.

938
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,847
You don't have to spend any Rolexes.

939
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,765
You don't have to give
any dirty diamonds.

940
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,685
I cannot believe I'm having this
conversation with an adult man.

941
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,353
What do you mean? You knew about this?

942
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,813
Everybody knows about this.

943
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,817
We all know about this
from the age of 12, 13.

944
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,986
Why does nobody ever tell me anything?

945
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,947
Because you have everybody
executed who tells you anything.

946
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,658
Listen, I'm thinking of
revealing my true identity

947
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,660
to the hairy titted ape woman.

948
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,954
Whoa! No, what? Why
would you even do that?

949
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,581
I think she'll be cool with it.

950
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,291
She will not be cool with it.

951
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,461
How is she to judge? She
shaves her armpits once a year,

952
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,172
and she takes lovers
outside of her ethnic group.

953
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,257
Are my crimes any worse than hers?

954
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,509
Remember, you hate her.

955
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,219
And everything she stands for.

956
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,597
- Okay.
- I have to go now.

957
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:11,932
I despise you.

958
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,185
You know, sometimes you say
some very hurtful things.

959
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,853
Anyway, I'm going to hang up on you.

960
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,856
No, come on. This is like
a real opportunity for me.

961
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,024
I want to hang up first.

962
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,817
I've hung up. I hung up already.

963
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,780
That is your voice doing that
noise. You have not hung up.

964
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,531
I am hanging up. Click...

965
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,950
Nadal, are you still there?

966
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,704
- Nadal, are you still there?
- I win.

967
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,165
No wonder you're a Mac Genius.

968
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,501
What a fucking idiot.

969
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:53,307
Zoey!

970
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,895
Zoey.

971
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,241
Zoey?

972
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:13,953
Etra.

973
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,747
Etra...

974
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,776
Etra, is this because
you're the only virgin guard

975
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,027
that I left a virgin?

976
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,828
One, two...

977
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,997
Bloop.

978
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,750
Text book.

979
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,296
Thank you so much for
meeting me early, Mr. Ogden.

980
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,382
I cannot wait for you
to sample our mafroom.

981
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,342
You are gonna swear
that you're in Wadiya.

982
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,262
Excuse me. What is that over there?

983
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,514
That is a "C" in your window.

984
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,850
No, no, no... They're totally
biased against this. They hate us.

985
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,685
No, it's not. I know what a "C" means.

986
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,978
It's not a very good...

987
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,567
Oh, my God!

988
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,194
Allison, what happened?

989
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,490
I don't know, I...

990
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,243
I was downstairs self juicing.

991
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,037
All night?

992
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,330
Yes.

993
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,790
I'm sorry, you were doing what?

994
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,417
Doing the jerk off.

995
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,544
Jerking myself to totally off.

996
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,170
- I'm sorry?
- Let me show you.

997
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,589
- No.
- She taught me.

998
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,840
Oh, she taught you, did she?

999
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,342
- No...
- Well, thank you very much.

1000
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,677
The contract is canceled.

1001
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,761
- That's it!
- No.

1002
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,263
No, I'm going to Green World. It's over.

1003
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:20,848
- No, Mr. Ogden.
- Remember, I have to pay that...

1004
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,893
- Please, no, no.
- Self juicing. Filth!

1005
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,020
Oh, my God...

1006
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:27,521
Zoey...

1007
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,315
We must get that contract back.

1008
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:30,774
We can't!

1009
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,903
It's impossible. We can't
compete with Green World.

1010
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,447
We will see about that.

1011
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:39,658
But from now on, it is my way

1012
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:44,413
or the highwahahtmaa
- fferrohshelechnichway.

1013
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,458
There has been a regime change!

1014
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,877
Yo! You are stocking the shelves.

1015
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,713
You, senile Romanian accountant.

1016
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,465
You are on the cash register.

1017
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:58,552
The CEO of Green World
does not drive a hybrid!

1018
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,973
The chemicals in Green World produce

1019
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,392
made this boy grow tits!

1020
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,233
You promise not to steal again?

1021
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,985
I won't. I won't!

1022
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,946
Give him one more for fun, Viktor.

1023
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,384
Good choice.

1024
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,775
Hi, Viktor.

1025
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,376
Supreme Grocer.

1026
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,211
The radicchio has
been washed and sorted,

1027
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,046
and the spray hose has
been tightly coiled.

1028
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,798
Very good. Now go upstairs

1029
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:20,134
and finish composting the
wheatgrass tailings, okay?

1030
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,468
Yes, Supreme Grocer.

1031
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,805
Zoey!

1032
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,141
What? Look...

1033
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,809
Wow!

1034
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:30,894
It's amazing!

1035
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,731
Oh, it's not amazing. It's
just a little less shit.

1036
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,816
Well, thank you.

1037
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,777
- Sorry.
- Oh, of course.

1038
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,739
- Personal.
- Thank you. Thank you again.

1039
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,826
- Hello?
- I have some very good news.

1040
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,952
What is it?

1041
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,664
I managed to buy some beards at the
wig store today that are perfect.

1042
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,958
No, Nadal, it must be real hair.

1043
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,085
- And from the head of a great man!
- What?

1044
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,837
Like Castro or Gandalf.

1045
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,172
No...

1046
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:03,677
Well done, Nadal. This beard is perfect.

1047
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,934
Those are lovely flowers.

1048
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,936
You know, Zoey is thinking of opening

1049
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,355
an eco-friendly flower
section to the store.

1050
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,734
This is the fifth time you've
mentioned her today. What is going on?

1051
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,486
The signing is in two days.

1052
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,404
Tell me you're not
falling for this woman!

1053
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,532
Of course I'm not. This is silly.

1054
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,869
Okay, good. All we need to
do is slip into this chapel...

1055
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,120
And yet, it's strange.

1056
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,122
The other day, I asked her to, you know,

1057
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,875
gobble on my bilbul and she said, "No."

1058
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,960
So obviously I wanted to execute her.

1059
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:40,297
But the thought of her
decapitated head actually upset me,

1060
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,132
- so I decided not to do it.
- No.

1061
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:45,552
When the thought of someone's
decapitated head upsets you,

1062
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,387
that is love.

1063
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,641
- I swear, I don't even like her at all.
- You don't like her?

1064
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,560
She has the body shape
of a 14-year-old boy.

1065
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,648
Well, that is a particular
weakness of yours.

1066
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,650
Need I remind you of
the Menudo incident?

1067
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,610
Those boys had their eyes open.

1068
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:02,986
They knew exactly what they were doing.

1069
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,571
We made them have their eyes open.

1070
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:06,824
You made me hold one of their eyes open,

1071
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,534
so they'd see what
you were doing to them.

1072
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,161
They seemed to be having
a pretty good time.

1073
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,705
They were not. Those boys were crying.

1074
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,249
Three of them killed themselves!

1075
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,376
Nothing to do with me.

1076
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,837
Everything to do with you!
A lot of them wrote notes.

1077
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,589
In their suicide notes
they named you by name!

1078
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,133
It's all a rumor. And
you're being silly.

1079
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,052
Hello, gentlemen. How you doin'?

1080
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,846
Are you guys friends of the deceased?

1081
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:30,931
How do I put this?

1082
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,683
He was my nigger.

1083
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,476
No, that's not the way to put it.

1084
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,228
- Whoa, whoa!
- No?

1085
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,771
He was my negger. Nigger. Nagger?

1086
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,189
- No, no, no.
- What is that?

1087
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,566
- Negar. Nigger? Nagur?
- No, no.

1088
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,817
Please stop. Please.

1089
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:42,943
I told you, before we came in.

1090
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,529
One word, do not say. Is the
exact word you're using now.

1091
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,989
- No, I said Nuga...
- One dozen times.

1092
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:50,117
Please relate to him that there
could be two funerals today.

1093
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,202
I... Believe me when I tell you,

1094
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,622
we are here only to pay
our respects to a great man.

1095
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,041
Okay, Eldridge's casket is
laying in the chapel right now.

1096
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,877
We're gonna have the
viewing in a few minutes.

1097
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,378
Thank you very much.

1098
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,381
I love your music, by the way.

1099
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,924
No, it's not. He's not a musician.

1100
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,928
I'm so, so sorry that Whitney
turned out like she did.

1101
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,305
- It's not Bobby Brown.
- Hey...

1102
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,228
- Go there.
- Okay. Here we go.

1103
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,947
Hello? Somebody in here?

1104
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,158
Nadal! The Sub-Saharans
have discovered us!

1105
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,826
- What? Okay, okay, okay!
- Hurry, hurry!

1106
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,411
- Just a moment!
- What you doin' in there?

1107
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,538
Jerking off.

1108
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,123
Open this door!

1109
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,500
- No, no, no!
- Open the door now!

1110
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,086
Quick! Plan B! Plan B!

1111
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,764
Why did you chop off his head?

1112
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:54,932
You said Plan B!

1113
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,808
Plan B was to have coffee and regroup,

1114
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,227
it was not to chop his head off!

1115
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,071
Good morning, Nadal!

1116
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,282
Wake up! Good morning, Nadal!

1117
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,411
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1118
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,621
Get this away from me!

1119
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:18,956
You know, me and you are quite a team.

1120
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,040
No, no.

1121
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,541
You know who else makes a great team?

1122
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,086
Ebony and ivory

1123
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,587
No, no, no!

1124
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,047
Live together in perfect harmony

1125
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,131
What is wrong with
you? Get it out of here!

1126
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,175
Good one.

1127
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,598
Splish splash I was taking a bath!

1128
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,142
No! Get it out of here!

1129
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,979
Oh, that is weird.

1130
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:48,318
I threw in some carob-covered goji
berries, just as a treat. Enjoy.

1131
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:53,073
Thank you. That's very kind
of you. You're a very nice man.

1132
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,659
What the fuck did you call me?

1133
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,495
I said you were nice!

1134
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:07,421
Allison! The Lancaster just
called! We got the contract back!

1135
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,589
- Great! Whatever!
- I know!

1136
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,009
Green World is shutting
down their Manhattan store!

1137
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,219
I wonder what could have happened?

1138
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,265
Be careful with that,
sweetheart. Be careful.

1139
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,351
Oh, yeah, we're going
to have a nice big salad.

1140
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,895
Celebratory cuddle?

1141
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,606
Well done!

1142
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,191
- You smell bad.
- I know.

1143
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:29,776
Help!

1144
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,070
Somebody help! My wife is in labor!

1145
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,031
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1146
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:36,992
Baby? The ambulance can't be here
for 20 minutes. Can you hold it?

1147
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,744
I can't hold it! It's coming out!

1148
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,162
It's coming out!

1149
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,956
Does anyone have any medical experience?

1150
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:46,793
I was Wadiya's Chief Surgeon
for the last 22 years.

1151
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,879
Please. Please help us. Please.

1152
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,131
- Allison, they need your help. Come on.
- Okay, fine.

1153
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:52,758
Come on.

1154
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,342
Are you okay?

1155
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,471
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

1156
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:58,930
Sorry! Old habits die hard.

1157
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,058
All right, I'm going in.

1158
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,019
That's the wrong hole!

1159
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,063
- What?
- You just put your fist up the wrong hole.

1160
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,856
If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that.

1161
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:10,776
Get it outta there.

1162
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,487
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

1163
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,238
Still my asshole!

1164
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,990
What is wrong with you, man?

1165
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,533
You just put it in my asshole again!

1166
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,118
Just go up from where you are.

1167
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,455
The good news is, your
prostate is completely healthy.

1168
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,083
That's good. That's good.

1169
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:27,709
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

1170
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,589
Hold on.

1171
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:34,966
What are you...

1172
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,845
Allison, stop it! You need two hands!

1173
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,347
But I'm in the middle of the text.

1174
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,182
It's coming out!

1175
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,814
- Where is that coming from?
- What?

1176
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,113
I'm really sorry. I'm gonna
have to take this call.

1177
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,656
Is there a phone in my body?

1178
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,282
What are you doing?

1179
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,784
I'm in the Lincoln Tunnel.

1180
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,328
What? Okay, look. We
need to talk for a minute.

1181
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,622
Hello, Nadal. Listen, I can't speak now.

1182
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,207
I'll speak to you later, okay? Bye!

1183
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,459
Stop talking to my vagina!

1184
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,463
Zoey, the baby's stuck. I need you
to put your hand in and help me.

1185
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,006
- What? No...
- Come on! Put it in!

1186
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,800
- No, don't be scared. Put it in.
- Okay. Okay.

1187
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,385
- I'm sorry.
- Put it right there on the right side.

1188
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,387
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!
- Push in.

1189
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:22,681
I think I feel an arm!

1190
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,308
That's my finger.

1191
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:41,241
Excuse me. You guys make a
really cute couple together.

1192
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:42,951
But maybe could you finish doing this

1193
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,995
when you're not elbow-deep in my pussy!

1194
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,539
Okay, Allison, you've got the head?

1195
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,583
- I've got the head.
- Okay, it's coming out.

1196
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:50,709
Come on, push!

1197
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:56,006
Where are the rebel bases?
Where are the rebel bases?

1198
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,883
Sorry, sorry.

1199
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:01,136
Wait, I can see the
head! I can see the head!

1200
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,345
I can't push anymore!

1201
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,269
You did it! You did it!

1202
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,862
I sentence you

1203
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,697
to life.

1204
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,284
It's still attached!

1205
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,369
Sorry. Oh, no.

1206
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,871
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

1207
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,581
It's bad news.

1208
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,041
It's a girl.

1209
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,211
Where's the trash can?

1210
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,421
No, no, no, no! That's what we wanted!

1211
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,381
We'll take her, we'll take her.

1212
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,466
Oh, baby.

1213
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,806
You were so amazing down there.

1214
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,226
You saved a little person's life.

1215
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,986
It feels so nice to kiss you.

1216
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,488
I know. It's nice to kiss you, too.

1217
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,073
I love the hugging.

1218
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:04,908
I just came.

1219
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,663
I don't care.

1220
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,165
Lie back.

1221
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,291
Okay.

1222
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,043
This is going to be amazing for you.

1223
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,461
Okay!

1224
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,059
You have such a small stomach.

1225
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,520
It's like a
10-year-old boy's.

1226
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,066
Normally, I don't kiss a
10-year-old boy's stomach.

1227
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,484
They kiss mine.

1228
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:41,861
See you in 15 minutes.

1229
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:46,324
Okay.

1230
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,710
Wait, wait.

1231
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,378
Wait.

1232
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,507
Allison, before we go any further,

1233
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,468
there's something that
I want to tell you.

1234
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,305
You've got a dick. I knew it.

1235
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,182
Allison, I don't have a dick.

1236
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,684
Great!

1237
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,437
And I've never been
with a guy with a dick.

1238
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,938
Or any guy.

1239
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,649
Or boys.

1240
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:22,986
Just girls.

1241
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:25,447
And children.

1242
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,783
Not male ones. Female ones.

1243
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,706
What I wanted to tell you was this.

1244
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,959
I really want to be with
you, Allison Burgers.

1245
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,045
Zoey,

1246
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,923
I'm not really Allison Burgers.

1247
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,677
I'm actually a little somebody called

1248
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,680
Admiral General

1249
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,640
Aladeen.

1250
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,230
No, what's your real name?

1251
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,191
Wait, this will convince you.

1252
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,069
Look, it's me!

1253
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:08,156
The weapons inspectors will
bathe in their own blood!

1254
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,034
That's your beard?

1255
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,161
No, no, no! It's not my beard.

1256
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:15,288
My friend chopped the
head off Morgan Freeman.

1257
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,041
It's a hilarious story.
I'll tell you later, okay?

1258
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,878
You are out of your mind. You're insane!

1259
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,964
Well, you download songs
illegally from the Internet.

1260
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,050
So let's not throw stones, okay?

1261
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,135
You're a murderer!

1262
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,513
No, no, no! Zoey, Zoey, Zoey! No.

1263
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,849
You were just using me to
get access to that hotel!

1264
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,142
No!

1265
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:39,813
Zoey, I'm attracted to you
in a really fucked-up way.

1266
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,315
Oh, my God!

1267
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,193
I'm canceling that contract tomorrow!

1268
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,904
No, Zoey! What have I ever done wrong?

1269
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,156
You lied to me!

1270
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,659
And you're wanted for war crimes!

1271
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,327
That stuff never sticks.

1272
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,621
You need to leave now.

1273
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:01,126
You have broken my heart
into Aladeen pieces.

1274
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,109
With the signing of the
constitution tomorrow morning,

1275
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,695
democracy in Wadiya is just hours away,

1276
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,114
and people are in the
streets celebrating.

1277
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:35,452
Kill Aladeen, kill Aladeen, hey!

1278
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,624
What do you think of
Admiral General Aladeen?

1279
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,668
We hate him. We hate him.

1280
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,296
You know, when we think of him, we...

1281
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,965
We vomit, and we spit
and we don't want him.

1282
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,301
What would you say to General
Aladeen if he were watching this?

1283
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,178
I have a message for Aladeen.

1284
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:54,888
Suevel.

1285
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,640
Suevel. Suevel.

1286
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,244
- Good-bye! -
Stop, stop, wait!

1287
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,329
What are you doing?

1288
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:21,664
How did you find me?

1289
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,334
You texted me, like, seven times.

1290
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,921
I am executing myself!

1291
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:29,589
What? Why?

1292
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,299
Because no one has ever loved me!

1293
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:33,718
Your father would be ashamed of you!

1294
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:36,429
No, I've realized I don't
want to be like my father!

1295
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,057
In fact, I don't want
to be a dictator anymore!

1296
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,308
What's that now?

1297
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:43,311
I've been on a spiritual journey,
man, like Eat, Pray, Love.

1298
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,231
Have you gone insane?

1299
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,524
I now know that on the outside,

1300
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,984
I am a bit of a cocksucker.

1301
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:53,154
- Yeah.
- But deep down I'm nice.

1302
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,740
- Not really.
- Yes, I am! I'm like mafroom.

1303
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,159
Hard and spiky on the outside,

1304
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,328
but soft and really mushy on the in.

1305
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:03,873
You're not like mafroom at
all. You're like an onion.

1306
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,125
An outer layer of cocksucker,

1307
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,627
and when you peel it away,

1308
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:10,421
there is 10 more layers
of cocksucker underneath.

1309
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:13,883
You are such a schmuck!

1310
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,719
- Why are you speaking Yiddish?
- I picked it up.

1311
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:19,305
What do you mean, "I picked
it up"? Who picks up Yiddish?

1312
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,556
I'm in New York!

1313
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,892
We're trying to erase
that country off the map!

1314
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,061
I don't like the people,
but I like the way that

1315
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:27,814
their words really sound
like what they're meant to be.

1316
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,733
Oh, I'm sorry! Did I not get
the Evite to your bar mitzvah?

1317
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:31,985
Oh, my God!

1318
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,112
You've got real chutzpah saying that!

1319
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,406
Look, where has being a
nice guy gotten you, huh?

1320
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,908
Standing on the edge of a
bridge about to commit suicide?

1321
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,076
Still wearing Crocs?

1322
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:42,161
What's wrong with Crocs?

1323
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,248
They are the universal symbol
of a man who has given up hope!

1324
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,334
You might as well put sweatpants on

1325
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,336
and go to Applebee's for
the rest of your life!

1326
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,339
I'll give you that one.
I do look ridiculous.

1327
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:57,260
Yes! Listen, if you won't come
down from there for yourself,

1328
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:58,594
do it for your country.

1329
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:00,513
If this constitution is signed,

1330
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:03,808
there will be free press,
women drivers, civil rights!

1331
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:05,101
What are "civil rights"?

1332
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,645
I'll tell you later. They're hilarious.

1333
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:11,607
Look, you alone can stop these
terrible things from happening.

1334
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,485
You are the last great dictator!

1335
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,071
All of the others are gone! Qaddafi,

1336
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,782
Saddam, Kim Jong, Cheney.

1337
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,286
You are right, Nadal.

1338
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,830
I will become the
greatest dictator of all,

1339
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,915
the envy of madmen everywhere!

1340
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,709
Yes, Supreme Leader!

1341
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:33,171
From the mountaintops of North
Korea to the jungles of Zimbabwe,

1342
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:37,508
let every child laborer and
sweatshop factory worker sing,

1343
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,261
"Oppressed at last! Oppressed at last!

1344
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:43,431
"Thank Aladeen, I am oppressed at last!"

1345
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:44,682
Yes! Whoa!

1346
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1347
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,518
- No, no, no, no, don't fall.
- I'm not doing anything.

1348
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,271
Just do like a pull-up. You
know how you do pull-ups?

1349
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,564
I invented the pull-up.

1350
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,946
If you're just joining us,
we are at the Lancaster Hotel,

1351
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,740
where in about 20 minutes,

1352
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,660
General Aladeen will be signing
the new Wadiyan constitution.

1353
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,579
Dignitaries from around the world

1354
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:09,582
are arriving now to witness
the creation of a democracy

1355
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,460
that will undoubtedly change
the political landscape

1356
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,253
of the entire region.

1357
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:17,507
As Wadiya goes, so goes North Africa.

1358
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,808
Eddie Norton, next time, you pee on me.

1359
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:28,184
Whatever.

1360
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,520
And tell Viggo Mortensen
he is on my radar.

1361
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,358
How do you say, "Fly is in the soup"?

1362
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:37,276
Gentlemen, Tamir.

1363
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,779
Let me introduce you
to my beautiful wife.

1364
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,740
Mrs. Lao, it is my very great pleasure.

1365
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,992
No, no, no, no. She
does not speak English.

1366
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,285
Watch this.

1367
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,621
You ugly horse!

1368
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:50,331
She doesn't know.

1369
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:55,128
"Ohhh. " See? She goes
"Ohhh" all the time. Watch.

1370
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,338
Shaved ape.

1371
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,965
"Ohhh."

1372
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,481
Wait. That is how you intend to
get me across to the Lancaster?

1373
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:16,816
Absolutely.

1374
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,234
- Where'd you get that?
- I built it.

1375
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,903
When I was going to assassinate you.

1376
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,405
You mean my double.

1377
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,451
Sure. Yeah.

1378
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,127
Bingo!

1379
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:40,173
Love it!

1380
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,299
- Here's what you do.
- Okay.

1381
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,385
Zipline across, kill the double,

1382
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,054
and then rip up the constitution
in front of the world's media.

1383
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,139
Piece of cake.

1384
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,780
Hello, Lancaster!

1385
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,041
I don't understand what has happened.

1386
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,210
My calculations were very precise.

1387
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:19,837
If you lose enough weight,
then the zipline will work.

1388
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,631
Do you have anything in your pockets?

1389
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,382
Let me check.

1390
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,553
What is that?

1391
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:28,930
It's Vita Coco water.

1392
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:31,057
Why do you have Vita Coco water?

1393
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,809
Because it has as much
potassium as three bananas.

1394
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:35,478
The line is still too heavy.

1395
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,980
Is there anything else in your pockets
that could be weighing you down?

1396
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:42,818
You're kidding. So then why
did you bring three bananas?

1397
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:46,531
Because I don't trust the
advertising. I'm naturally suspicious.

1398
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:49,659
Is there anything else you're
carrying? You're still too heavy.

1399
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:50,868
Just this.

1400
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:53,829
What is that, a brick?

1401
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,332
All this time you've had a
brick? Why do you have that?

1402
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:58,334
Well, to balance out the
weight from the other one.

1403
01:19:58,418 --> 01:19:59,669
You have two bricks?

1404
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:00,795
Yes!

1405
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,380
Throw them down immediately!

1406
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,387
Oh, my God! There's a
little goat eating the wire!

1407
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:14,267
You need to lose weight immediately!

1408
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:17,228
My pockets are empty. I could poo.

1409
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,188
That won't be enough
to make a difference.

1410
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,816
Yes, it will. I haven't
gone since Wadiya.

1411
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,527
Losing power has stopped
me up like a cork.

1412
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,903
Hurry!

1413
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,573
Come on, Supreme Leader!
Make it rain! Make it rain!

1414
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,410
It's out! And it's pointy!

1415
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:34,745
Somebody stop that man!

1416
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:37,623
Yes!

1417
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:40,167
What? No, no, no, no!

1418
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:41,961
No, no, no!

1419
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,778
Supreme Leader!

1420
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,326
Get out of here before Tamir kills you.

1421
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:15,161
Who is Tamir?

1422
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,954
Tamir...

1423
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,749
The bald bastard who did all
these terrible things to us!

1424
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,251
I thought his name was Dennis.

1425
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:28,466
How would you even make
that leap? Tamir to Dennis?

1426
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,677
- Go on, get out! Get out!
- Come on, Montzi!

1427
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:32,762
Quick!

1428
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,516
Just jump. It's not that far.

1429
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:39,935
Efawadh.

1430
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,687
It is almost time.

1431
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,859
I like goats.

1432
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:50,488
I am very stupid.

1433
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,533
This is an historic moment.

1434
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,453
Admiral General Aladeen of Wadiya

1435
01:21:57,537 --> 01:21:59,038
is going to be signing

1436
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:02,792
the first democratic constitution
in the history of his nation.

1437
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:06,837
Across the globe, people are
glued to their television sets.

1438
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,507
The people of Wadiya are celebrating

1439
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,426
what will be a new
chapter in their country.

1440
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,180
Just moments away now
from putting his signature

1441
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,641
on the first democratic constitution.

1442
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:22,228
That's Tamir Mafraad,
Aladeen's trusted advisor,

1443
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:25,314
sharing a lighthearted moment with
Chinese businessman, Xiang Lao.

1444
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,274
Any thoughts on what they
might be saying, Mike?

1445
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:30,236
I thought I made out the
words "Harvey Keitel."

1446
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,448
Don't know what that meant.

1447
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:37,284
Maybe they shared a hot
dog together, I'm thinking?

1448
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:41,747
That would make sense. He's wiping
the mustard off his face and chest.

1449
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,124
Excuse me!

1450
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,667
You have to let me in.
You don't understand.

1451
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,419
He's trying to stop the signing!

1452
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,045
Tamir is now speaking.

1453
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,130
Today,

1454
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,590
we begin a new era.

1455
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:55,177
Wadiya will be open to the world.

1456
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:56,846
Open to the future.

1457
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,431
And open for business.

1458
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,352
The document is ready to
be signed, Supreme Leader.

1459
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,697
What are you doing?
This man is an imposter!

1460
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:19,243
No! This traitor tried to kill
me and had my beard removed!

1461
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,537
Look!

1462
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:24,039
Arrest the viper Tamir!

1463
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,833
And now in another

1464
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:29,545
amazing turn of events, Tamir
Mafraad is being taken away.

1465
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:32,173
This constitution

1466
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,925
is nothing but a
license for oil companies

1467
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,512
and foreign interests to
destroy my beloved Wadiya!

1468
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:42,266
Wadiya will remain a dictatorship!

1469
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,402
Oh, be quiet.

1470
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,781
Why are you guys so anti dictators?

1471
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,867
Imagine if America was a dictatorship.

1472
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:04,455
You could let 1 % of the people
have all the nation's wealth.

1473
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,248
You could help your rich friends

1474
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,876
get richer by cutting their taxes

1475
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,213
and bailing them out
when they gamble and lose.

1476
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:16,967
You could ignore the needs of the
poor for health care and education.

1477
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,719
Your media would appear free

1478
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:22,932
but would secretly be controlled
by one person and his family.

1479
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:27,269
You could wiretap phones, you
could torture foreign prisoners.

1480
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,522
You could have rigged elections.

1481
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,690
You could lie about why you go to war.

1482
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,026
You could fill your prisons

1483
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:37,738
with one particular racial
group and no one would complain!

1484
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,450
You could use the media
to scare the people

1485
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:45,454
into supporting policies that
are against their interests.

1486
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,916
I know this is hard for
you Americans to imagine,

1487
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,960
but please try.

1488
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:53,295
I will tell you what democracy is!

1489
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:55,840
Democracy is the worst!

1490
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,843
Endless talking and listening
to every stupid opinion!

1491
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,011
And everybody's vote counts,

1492
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,765
no matter how crippled or
black or female they are.

1493
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:07,059
Democracy...

1494
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,109
Democracy

1495
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:20,614
has hairy armpits and
could lose five pounds.

1496
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:25,119
Democracy looks like a
midget in a chemo wig.

1497
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:29,915
Democracy, your mother
called the other day

1498
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:31,166
and I forgot to give you the message.

1499
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:35,379
It was something very important
about your grandmother.

1500
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:39,717
Democracy kisses you
because she wants to,

1501
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:43,679
not because her father is in the
next room chained to a radiator

1502
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:45,890
with electrodes attached to his nipples.

1503
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:51,061
Democracy is flawed! She is not perfect!

1504
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,230
But democracy,

1505
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:57,776
I love you.

1506
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:01,989
And that is why I call
for real democracy!

1507
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:03,866
A real constitution!

1508
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,909
And real elections in Wadiya!

1509
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,543
Oh, no!

1510
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,587
Come on!

1511
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,639
Democracy, I will make
you one of my wives.

1512
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:30,142
Okay, only wife. We'll vote on it.

1513
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,686
I'll shave my armpits for you.

1514
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,855
Praise be to the Creator!

1515
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:37,358
And please stop using
that organic deodorant.

1516
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,652
You could gas the
Kurds with that stench.

1517
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:08,722
You died protecting me, Efawadh.

1518
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,474
Hello!

1519
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:11,767
You are alive?

1520
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:14,937
Of course! It is my job
to be shot in the head.

1521
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:20,484
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

1522
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:23,153
Luckily the bullet hit him in the brain.

1523
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,115
So,

1524
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:28,617
what now?

1525
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:32,246
I return to Wadiya to
participate in fair elections.

1526
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:47,761
Let's now look back at the
wonderful events of the past year.

1527
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:50,639
After Wadiya's first free elections,

1528
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,684
President Prime Minister
Admiral General Aladeen

1529
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:56,353
won 98. 8 % of the vote.

1530
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:02,484
But the big story today is the
marriage of President Prime Minister

1531
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:06,321
Admiral General Aladeen
and his new bride, Zoey.

1532
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:13,203
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1533
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:25,257
Are you okay, my love?
What did you step on?

1534
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,633
Oh, yes! No, no.

1535
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:30,387
It's my people's tradition. We
always smash a glass at weddings.

1536
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,306
- I'm Jewish!
- What?

1537
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,682
Mazel tov!

1538
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:39,730
Are you okay?

1539
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,400
That's fine. I don't mind. It's great!

1540
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,569
Come here, my love.

1541
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:07,174
Jachnoon, President
Prime Minister Aladeen.

1542
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:10,552
Jachnoon. Nadal. I have to be
back at the palace in an hour.

1543
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,930
Zoey thinks I'm at yoga.

1544
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,348
I have great news.

1545
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:17,226
We are just days away from
testing the new missiles.

1546
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,269
I have re-engineered
the oxidizing ducts

1547
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,813
and the payload delivery systems.

1548
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:25,609
But you'll be happy to know,
the missile is now pointy!

1549
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:28,821
Who cares if it's pointy?

1550
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,072
What?

1551
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:32,866
You do. You care if it's pointy.

1552
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,618
Why would I care about
such a trivial detail?

1553
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:36,954
Are you serious? Are
you serious right now?

1554
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:38,038
Of course I'm serious.

1555
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:39,581
That's why you had me executed!

1556
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,960
The shape of the missile has nothing
to do with the payload delivery.

1557
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,462
That's what I said! That's
what I said the first time!

1558
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:46,964
No, that's what I said,
and you went crazy.

1559
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,258
No! You said Professor Popeye this...

1560
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:51,176
Professor Popeye is a cartoon.

1561
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:52,553
No, I know this!

1562
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,394
So, we're opening 300 Women's Centers,

1563
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:04,565
but I'm going to have to take
a break for a little bit because

1564
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,608
I'm pregnant.

1565
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:07,860
What?

1566
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,074
Are you having a boy or an abortion?

1567
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,682
Hello, gentlemen. How you doin'?

1568
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,309
Are you guys friends of the deceased?

1569
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,186
Do you want me to say
this in front of his widow?

1570
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,313
I was his lover.

1571
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:45,898
No. That is not true.

1572
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:48,317
I saw him perform
with the Globetrotters.

1573
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:50,903
I thought he was
outstanding. I befriended him.

1574
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,113
No, it's a different person.

1575
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:56,533
His message of don't
worry and being happy

1576
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:57,784
was so powerful.

1577
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,120
No, this is Bobby McFerrin.
I told you this outside.

1578
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:02,456
Whatever the scandal you went through,

1579
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,374
you're still the best
golfer in the world.

1580
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,626
Let's go.

1581
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,545
O-M-G.

1582
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,006
Oh, my God.

1583
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:19,640
Oh, my...

1584
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,105
Zoey.

1585
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,817
That's some good head!

1586
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:35,197
That is called payback
and it feels so good!

1587
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,574
How did it feel for you?
How did it feel for you?

1588
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,451
I prefer it with goats.

1589
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,703
Where is the Supreme Leader?

1590
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:42,788
No, no.

1591
01:31:42,872 --> 01:31:45,290
Now that is called payback!

1592
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,833
Oh, great!

1593
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:55,300
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

1594
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,094
You don't have to touch it.

1595
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,220
Sorry. I was...

1596
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,138
Just give us... We don't...

1597
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:03,039
Just give me a couple
of millimeters to myself.

1598
01:32:04,305 --> 01:33:04,514
