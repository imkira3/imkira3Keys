2
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:52,812
<i>P. A. : There's number 5. </i>

3
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,106
<i>He's moving through between horses. </i>

4
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:58,026
<i>Number 6 is under a very hard... </i>

5
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,320
TJANDHRA KHOERN

6
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,822
<i>Number 4 breaks into the inside... </i>

7
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:38,484
(muffled shots)

8
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:59,442
(announcer speaking indistinctly)

9
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:09,035
<i>P. A. : ... he's shooting on through. </i>

10
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:20,713
<i>Number 1 on the inside</i>

11
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:22,278
<i>pokes a nose in front... </i>

12
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:47,304
MAN: He's clean.

13
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,266
So...

14
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,081
MAN: Why are you here? Hmm?

15
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,113
MAN: There was a time.

16
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:02,963
MAN: 4:35.

17
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,195
You misunderstood.

18
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:08,072
I wasn't asking for the time.

19
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:10,992
I was just saying there was a time.

20
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,371
- There was a time?
- Mm-hmm.

21
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:18,291
Take Brown Sugar back there,
for example.

22
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:21,732
MAN: She's pretty fucking foxy, right?

23
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:24,651
She's 70.

24
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:26,633
If she's a day.

25
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,509
But there was a time.

26
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:30,699
I don't follow.

27
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:32,993
The name's Smith.
I'm from out of town.

28
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:35,391
- Listen, Mr. Smith--
- Just Smith.

29
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:41,336
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering,

30
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:43,525
is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

31
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,383
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

32
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:52,284
Kansas City Shuffle is when
everybody looks right and you go left.

33
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,431
Never heard of it.

34
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,038
It's not something people hear about.

35
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,479
Falls on deaf ears, mostly.

36
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:03,233
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

37
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,110
MAN: Twenty years, huh?

38
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,195
No small matter.

39
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:11,574
Requires a lot of planning.

40
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:15,328
Involves a lot of people.

41
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:18,873
People connected
only by the slightest of events...

42
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,001
... like whispers in the night...

43
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:25,652
... in that place that never forgets,

44
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,529
even when those people do.

45
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,453
It all starts with a horse.

46
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:38,060
(starting bell rings)

47
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,667
(horse whinnies)

48
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,795
<i>SMITH: It's what they called back then
a drugstore handicap. </i>

49
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:47,236
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls
"a sure thing, "</i>

50
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,530
<i>so he schemes to make it so. </i>

51
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:51,407
<i>He calls in The Doc, </i>

52
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:55,682
<i>a nobbler from Antwerp, known
for his savvy, but not for his discretion. </i>

53
00:06:57,663 --> 00:06:59,853
WOMAN: Fuck me, baby.
Fuck me, baby. Come on, baby.

54
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,772
<i>SMITH: The same could be said
for Doc's jelly on the side-- Gloria. </i>

55
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:05,275
- Oh, God.
- DOC: Almost there. Almost--

56
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:08,090
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

57
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,133
(Doc groans)

58
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:13,722
(phone rings)

59
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,163
- (ring)
- (man snoring)

60
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,623
<i>SMITH: Which brings us to Abe, </i>

61
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:21,855
<i>because Gloria was too much jelly
for one outfit. </i>

62
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,775
Hey, baby.
Is your wife around?

63
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:27,694
<i>- ABE: What do you want?
- WOMAN: Who is it, Abe?</i>

64
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:29,988
<i>ABE: Uh... Seymour. </i>

65
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:31,031
GLORIA: Sure.

66
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,638
<i>Tell that bitch to open her eyes.
Maybe then she'd see more. </i>

67
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,036
ABE: Seymour says hello!

68
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:38,955
What are you doing
calling me here?

69
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:41,145
Christmas came early this year, baby.

70
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:42,918
I got a present for you.

71
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:44,377
Remember my friend Doc?

72
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:48,131
<i>SMITH: Now, Abe wasn't a nosy fella,
but he had a nose. </i>

73
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,259
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth. </i>

74
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:55,430
- ABE: Do you remember Gloria the hooker?
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,393
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

76
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,251
The fix is in at Aqueduct.
7 horse, tenth race.

77
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:04,190
- Doped up?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:05,963
<i>SMITH: And then there was this joker
who had ears... </i>

79
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:07,318
ABE: Keep it under your hat, huh?

80
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:09,195
Let's get back.

81
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:11,072
<i>SMITH: ... and who looked
like he could be somebody's uncle. </i>

82
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,470
Hey, Max, who's your favorite uncle?

83
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,598
Okay, who's your second favorite uncle?

84
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,039
Just pay attention.
I got something here.

85
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,395
<i>SMITH: And before you know it, </i>

86
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:23,897
<i>folks are getting a big dose
of the gimmies, </i>

87
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:25,878
<i>and men start talking their hats off, </i>

88
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,319
<i>and that Manischewitz Grapevine Wine
spills in your ear</i>

89
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,092
<i>and tells you you got a sure thing, </i>

90
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,429
<i>and what's worse is,
you start to believe it. </i>

91
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,827
<i>At least that's how it went with Old Max, </i>

92
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:40,059
<i>who wasn't so much old
as he was tired. </i>

93
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,457
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day. </i>

94
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,273
<i>Tired of waking up and finding
that his dreams were only dreams. </i>

95
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,524
We're leavin'.

96
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:50,800
<i>But mostly, Max was tired
of not having a front lawn. </i>

97
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,677
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

98
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:53,720
I will.

99
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,431
- I was talking to your son.
- (chuckles)

100
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:58,516
- You think that's funny, do you?
- Uh-huh.

101
00:08:58,516 --> 00:08:59,559
Bye, Mom.

102
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,644
MAX: Yeah. Bye, Mom.

103
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,208
Love you.

104
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:10,612
(crowd cheering,
announcer on loudspeaker)

105
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:15,929
MAX: All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

106
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:16,972
BOY: Shea Stadium.

107
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,328
- MAX: To see?
- BOY: Mets-Phillies.

108
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:20,726
MAX: Good man.
Give me the postgame.

109
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,645
BOY: Stalium gave up six runs
in the first five innings.

110
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,418
Ed Kranepool hit a line drive
down right field,

111
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:27,399
but it hit the wall, fouled by a foot.

112
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,214
Jesse Gonder hit a groundball
in the hole between first and second,

113
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:31,257
but the guy's so slow,

114
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:33,864
that second baseman Tony Taylor
tagged him out at first.

115
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,429
(laughs)

116
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,202
Did you get all that from the radio?

117
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,453
Mm-hmm.

118
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,913
You're good.

119
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:42,207
Okay, I'll be right back.

120
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,709
No, no, no, no.
You gotta stay in the car.

121
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,169
Why?

122
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,340
Because they don't let little boys
inside the track.

123
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,008
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

124
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,449
Yeah, well, Saul's dad
is a degenerate gambler.

125
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,117
And if you're the son
of a degenerate gambler,

126
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,264
they let you in.

127
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,184
It's economically viable.

128
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,686
Are you gonna be
a degenerate gambler?

129
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,189
Hey. You know better than that.

130
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,421
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

131
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:15,052
Look, this money's
gonna get you through Harvard,

132
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:16,512
and you're gonna be a doctor.

133
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:20,578
But until then, you gotta stay in the car.

134
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,229
Hey.

135
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,878
Next weekend,
you and me go to a ballgame.

136
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,547
- Okay.
- Okay?

137
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,779
- Love you, kiddo.
- Love you, too, Dad.

138
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,907
Wait-- watch.
Watch, watch, watch.

139
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:36,846
Almost forgot.

140
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,765
Fifteen minutes.
Start counting.

141
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,647
<i>P. A. : Our next race
at Aqueduct is the tenth race. </i>

142
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,462
<i>It's at a distance of one furlong. </i>

143
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,117
Come on, come on.

144
00:10:58,847 --> 00:10:59,994
Come on, come on.

145
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,245
<i>P. A. : The final turn, </i>

146
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,790
<i>and number 7 has moved
to the fifth position on the outside. </i>

147
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,041
<i>Number 2 takes the lead. </i>

148
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:08,961
Come on, come on.

149
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,360
<i>Number 1 is at the rail, </i>

150
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,052
<i>and number 7 is beginning
to pick up the pace on the outside. </i>

151
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:17,095
Yes!

152
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:19,181
Yes! Come on, baby! Come on!

153
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,683
Go! Let's go!

154
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,461
<i>- And number 7 takes the lead!
- Yes, yes!</i>

155
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:30,963
Come on, come on!

156
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,613
Yeah!

157
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:40,556
<i>Number 7 has fallen!</i>

158
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:46,500
<i>And number 1 goes on
and takes the lead to win it. </i>

159
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,149
<i>SMITH: Max woke up to find that
his dreams had just been the stuff of pipes. </i>

160
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,296
MAX: I wanna place a bet.

161
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,486
- How much?
- Twenty large.

162
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:56,927
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

163
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,369
BOOKIE: I'll take your bet.

164
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,037
And lay it off.

165
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:03,810
I got a bookie's bookie.

166
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:06,625
I'll give you 2 to 1 on the horse.

167
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,127
Racing form says 9 to 1.

168
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,194
So you go to the ticket window
with your 20 grand in hand

169
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:16,218
and you get 9 to 1
if the spread sticks.

170
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:20,180
You come in here with your pockets
turned out, you get 2 to 1.

171
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:22,370
The juice is ten.

172
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,958
That means if you lose,
you're all in for 22 grand.

173
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,773
Twenty for the bet, two for the juice.

174
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:31,650
Can you pay these moneys?

175
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:33,840
Huh? Can you?

176
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:36,446
Yeah.

177
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:45,622
BOOKIE: Just to be clear, if you lose...

178
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:48,856
... you're gonna owe a lot of money

179
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:55,842
to the kind of men you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

180
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,814
MAX: Henry!

181
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:12,525
Henry!

182
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,426
Henry!

183
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:21,388
Henry!

184
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:24,725
- MAN: Hey, buddy.
- MAX: What?

185
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:26,497
- Got a light?
- No.

186
00:13:26,497 --> 00:13:27,540
MAX: Henry!

187
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,877
MAN: In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the 7 horse?

188
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,379
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home.

189
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,631
Just like you.

190
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:46,310
Where am I?

191
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:54,443
MAX: Roth. He'll tell you everything.

192
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:55,694
I swear.

193
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:01,221
He already has.

194
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,458
Please.

195
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,543
I have a family!

196
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,236
Please.

197
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:18,113
Please!

198
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,511
Where's my boy?

199
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:23,640
MAX: Henry!

200
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:26,142
(sobbing)

201
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:27,498
(door opens)

202
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:29,792
MAX: Where are they?

203
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,214
MAX: Aah!

204
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:38,863
MAX: Henry!

205
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,200
Aah!

206
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:46,162
(screaming)

207
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,291
(cocks hammer)

208
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,584
(gunshot)

209
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:55,547
MAN: Fuck.

210
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:57,319
Shit.

211
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:58,779
Jesus.

212
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:01,699
Fuck shit Jesus is right.

213
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,201
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

214
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,182
New outfit in town.

215
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:10,562
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

216
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,004
They're trying to make an impression.

217
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,966
That's a fuckin' story, man.

218
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:22,554
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-alike contest in Monte Carlo

219
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,909
and came in third.

220
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:25,995
<i>Now, that's a story.</i>

221
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:32,877
This... this is something else.

222
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,526
- So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?
- No.

223
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:39,342
It's just the inciting incident.

224
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:41,740
The catalyst.

225
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:46,223
This is a Kansas City Shuffle.

226
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:48,830
SMITH: They look right...

227
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,854
... and you...

228
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:53,105
go left.

229
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:03,221
Sorry about that, son.

230
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:06,766
Sometimes there's more to life
than just living.

231
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:12,501
Besides, you can't have
a Kansas City Shuffle without a body.

232
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:10,685
(gunshot)

233
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:12,979
- MAN #1: He's down!
- MAN #2: Get the roof!

234
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:14,022
MAN #1: Up there!

235
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,093
(rings)

236
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:28,932
(rings)

237
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,907
(loud knocking on door)

238
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:09,286
(knocking)

239
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,642
I'm coming.

240
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,561
(knocking)

241
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:14,604
Coming.

242
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:21,382
Well, it took you long enough.

243
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:23,885
You're not Nick.

244
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:26,596
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

245
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,682
Well, I'm short for my height.

246
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,393
See, that makes sense

247
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:34,208
because I can usually tell
how tall someone is by their knock.

248
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:37,128
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

249
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:39,839
So it's a good thing.

250
00:18:40,777 --> 00:18:44,218
I don't know. I open the door expecting
you to be up here, you're down there.

251
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:46,929
That combined with
a low center of gravity, forget about it.

252
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:49,431
Who are you?

253
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:50,996
I'm Slevin.

254
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,290
And what happened to your nose?

255
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,730
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

256
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,441
- Somebody hit you?
- Yeah.

257
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:00,901
SLEVIN: I was kinda
expecting it, though.

258
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,465
You were kinda expecting it?

259
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:05,489
Well, they say
bad things happen in threes.

260
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,556
SLEVIN: First I lost my job.

261
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:13,206
Then I come home to find that my
apartment building had been condemned

262
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:17,064
due to a hybrid breed
of Ecuadorian super termites.

263
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:18,941
So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.

264
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:19,984
(woman moaning)

265
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:21,756
I had a key so I let myself in.

266
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:27,700
(bedsprings squeaking)

267
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,975
(both moaning)

268
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,999
<i>Hey, don't stop on my account.</i>

269
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,042
MAN: Oh, shit.

270
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:39,795
WOMAN: Slevin.

271
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,881
It was an accident.

272
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:44,592
What, like he tripped and you fell?

273
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,137
(bell chimes)

274
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:50,222
<i>MAN: Slevin,
do you know what time it is?</i>

275
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,351
Yeah. I'm at the airport.
Are you sure you want me to come out?

276
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:55,123
<i>MAN: Yeah. Just think,
two weeks in New York</i>

277
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:58,774
<i>and the only Kelly you'll remember is
the Kelly who gave you your first handjob</i>

278
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,546
<i>on the bus on the way up
to summer camp. </i>

279
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:03,257
Kelly Perkins. She told me her hands
were dry and that she needed--

280
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:07,324
<i>Yeah, she said that to a lot of guys.
That's why we called her Jerkins Perkins. </i>

281
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:09,096
<i>Just call me when you land, all right?</i>

282
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,452
Yeah.

283
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:23,069
Yeah. So I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

284
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,529
Say, man, you got the time?

285
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,595
Yeah, man. It's... 7:23.

286
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,368
- So you're probably still asleep.
- Yo, yo, yo.

287
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,245
- Anyway, I'll be over in a second, okay?
- You got a smoke?

288
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:33,392
I don't smoke, man.

289
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:35,373
THUG: Then why don't you just go ahead
and give me your wallet

290
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:37,354
and then I'll buy my own smokes?

291
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:39,231
Am I being mugged?

292
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:43,819
And so here I am.

293
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:47,678
You said three.

294
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,972
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

295
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:52,578
You lost your job,
your apartment building was condemned,

296
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:54,977
Kelly was cheating on you,
and you got mugged.

297
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:56,019
That makes four.

298
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,001
When you're on a roll,
you're on a roll.

299
00:20:58,105 --> 00:20:59,148
Interesting.

300
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:02,901
Although I would add not-the-ever-so-clever
holdup man that one hears so much about.

301
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:04,257
Well, he did break my nose.

302
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:06,342
- But overlooked your suitcase.
- It's heavy.

303
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:08,532
Maybe he thought it wouldn't make
for a very speedy getaway.

304
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,617
True, but then
there's the matter of your watch.

305
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:11,764
Pretty fancy.

306
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,745
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

307
00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:14,788
Maybe he didn't see it.

308
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:16,665
Of course he saw it.
He asked you for the time.

309
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:18,333
You say this is your third mugging?

310
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,523
I'm a... I travel a lot.

311
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:21,774
Where's Nick?

312
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,547
I don't know.
He was supposed to meet me here.

313
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:24,798
He never showed up.

314
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,822
- How'd you get in?
- Door was open.

315
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:29,490
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

316
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,889
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

317
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,348
But you said open.

318
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:35,539
Could've been.
Hey, what was your name again?

319
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,354
Lindsey.
I live across the hall.

320
00:21:38,354 --> 00:21:40,023
I came over to borrow
a cup of sugar.

321
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:41,065
Where's your cup?

322
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:42,734
I said I came over
to borrow a cup of sugar.

323
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,819
If I'd brought a cup, then I would've
said I came over to borrow sugar.

324
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:46,592
- Touché.
- (phone rings)

325
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:48,781
Maybe that's Nick.
It's right there.

326
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:50,971
Hello.

327
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:53,891
Hello.

328
00:21:55,976 --> 00:21:57,645
They hung up.

329
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,104
Ooh, I have an idea.

330
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:01,190
Have you used the phone
at all since you've been here?

331
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,545
Not except for that.

332
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:06,195
Sorry. Wrong number.

333
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,072
That was the Hotel Cheval.

334
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:10,053
What are you doing?

335
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:11,825
We know who he called.
Now we find out who called him.

336
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:13,181
Columbo says
that there are three things--

337
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,432
Columbo?

338
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,039
Yeah. Columbo was this TV detective

339
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,020
- played by Peter Falk--
- I know who Columbo is.

340
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:22,566
According to Columbo, there are
three things to look for at a crime scene.

341
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,130
What's there now
that wasn't there before,

342
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,633
what was there before that isn't there now,
and what's been moved.

343
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:29,657
- Is this a crime scene?
- I think Nick's in trouble.

344
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,846
Hello. Sorry. Wrong number.

345
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:34,557
That was the Hotel Cheval again.

346
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,851
So what? He called a hotel,
a hotel called him back.

347
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:37,894
It makes sense.

348
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:39,458
So maybe it's a clue.

349
00:22:40,918 --> 00:22:42,065
A clue to what?

350
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:43,525
Maybe it's a clue
to what happened to Nick.

351
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:44,880
We don't know
anything happened to Nick.

352
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,340
LINDSEY: We don't know
that anything didn't happen to Nick.

353
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,425
He said he was gonna meet you.
You're here, he's not, the door was open.

354
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:49,885
And bad things happen wherever you--

355
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,971
Shit! I gotta stop by work.

356
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,222
It's just for a couple hours.

357
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:55,933
Um, I'll come back, and then
we can start the investigation.

358
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:57,914
The investigation?

359
00:22:58,018 --> 00:22:59,582
Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

360
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,521
Okay.

361
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:04,587
LINDSEY: I totally forgot--

362
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,280
Yeah.

363
00:23:09,384 --> 00:23:10,949
(chuckles) Sorry.

364
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:12,722
May I borrow a cup of sugar?

365
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:13,764
SLEVIN: What?

366
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:17,831
LINDSEY: I never gave it much thought
until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.

367
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:20,646
I was on my way to the store
and I thought, "Nick-- he'd have sugar. "

368
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:23,253
You tell me your story,
I leave, sugarless.

369
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:25,547
I come back in,
you put your penis on exhibition,

370
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:28,258
and although my coffee's
probably gone bad by now,

371
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:29,613
I insist on following through.

372
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:32,116
It's like something
from a Norman Rockwell painting.

373
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:33,367
What, my penis?

374
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,974
No. (laughs)
No! The sugar.

375
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:38,685
Neighbors borrowing sugar
from one another.

376
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:41,396
It's very Andy Griffith.

377
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:42,543
Yeah.

378
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:44,003
<i>That's Andy Griffith.</i>

379
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,567
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.

380
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:47,235
No.

381
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:49,425
Thanks for the sugar, sugar.

382
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:01,209
I wanted to
try and catch the next show.

383
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:02,877
I don't go on again till 8:00.

384
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,109
Okay.

385
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:14,242
(knock on door)

386
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:19,977
SLEVIN: It's not nearly 8:00 yet.

387
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,001
The Boss wants to see you.

388
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,252
Who?

389
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:25,295
The Boss.

390
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:28,006
- Who's The Boss?
- The guy we work for.

391
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,257
Jesus.

392
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:31,656
Yo, man, sit your punk ass down!

393
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:37,808
I'm not the guy you're lookin' for.
I don't live here.

394
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:39,997
Yeah, well, you look like the guy
that lives here.

395
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:42,500
Then you don't know
what the guy that lives here looks like.

396
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,315
What he means to say
is you look like you live here.

397
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:46,880
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

398
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:48,340
Well, yeah,
I look like I live here, but I don't.

399
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:51,572
I'm just visiting.
I just got in this morning.

400
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,535
The cat I'm lookin' for,
his name is, uh...

401
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,620
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

402
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,706
The cat's name is Nick. Now...

403
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,938
... who are you?

404
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:04,398
I'm Slevin.

405
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:07,943
You got some ID?

406
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:13,991
See, the funny thing about that
is that I got mugged this morning--

407
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:15,555
Hey, look! Look, look.

408
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,849
Tell it to the one-legged man.

409
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,455
So he can bump it off down the road.

410
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,674
- Hey, listen, mu'fucka!
- Yo, I got this.

411
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:33,072
- I got this, Elvis.
- Slow-- slow your roll.

412
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,325
- I got this.
- Slow your roll, man.

413
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,618
ELVIS: Just let me.
Just let me, all right?

414
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,600
Mu'fucka,

415
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,623
all I know is The Boss
slides me this here address,

416
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,605
and he says, "Sloe"--that's him--

417
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,690
"Elvis"--that's me--

418
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:48,401
"bring me the cat who resides
at this here address. "

419
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:52,676
Now, he told me that today.
You just so happen to be here today.

420
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:56,013
So I guess you the cat
I'm supposed to pick up...

421
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,681
... today.

422
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,454
But I'm not Nick.

423
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:01,226
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

424
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,667
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

425
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:07,274
You can ask Lindsey.
She lives across the hall.

426
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,151
- She's the woman who lives--
- Wait, hold on, hold on.

427
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,819
Man, I ain't asking nobody nothin'!

428
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,322
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent,
whatever the fuck your name is.

429
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,554
The Virgin Mary herself could come
waltzin' up in here with her fine ass,

430
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:17,910
titties hanging out and everything,

431
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,308
and if she told me
your name was Jesus Christ,

432
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,186
I still gotta take you to see The Boss.

433
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:23,229
You know why?

434
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:24,376
No.

435
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,461
Orders.

436
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:28,963
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

437
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:32,196
<i>- I think I got the concept.
- Orders is orders.</i>

438
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,637
So I guess no one ever taught you
not to use the word you're defining

439
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,097
in the definition.

440
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:43,040
Say somethin' else!

441
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,960
I will break your motherfuckin' nose.
I ain't playin' with you.

442
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,984
My nose is already broken.

443
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,130
(punching sound)

444
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:57,951
- Can I just say one more thing?
- ELVIS: What?!

445
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,245
Can you turn the heat up in here,
'cause it's really cold?

446
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,747
(chuckles) Yeah.

447
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:07,335
Y-y-you should've thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

448
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:33,925
(static on radio)

449
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:35,489
(Slevin shivers)

450
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:43,831
Yeah.

451
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,173
SLEVIN: It's cold out there.

452
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:53,841
<i>ELVIS: Let's hurry it up, man. </i>

453
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,459
(elevator dings)

454
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:09,066
Yo, grab his ass.

455
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:14,905
ELVIS: The Boss is
right up there, chump.

456
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:41,598
Well, listen, your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

457
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:44,622
- I'm not Nick Fish--
- MAN: Mr. Fisher.

458
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:49,419
Are you familiar
with The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?

459
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,130
Comic strip I liked as a boy.

460
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:55,571
The Shmoo was
a loveable creature, really.

461
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:57,657
Laid eggs,

462
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,325
gave milk...

463
00:29:00,994 --> 00:29:04,852
... and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

464
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:08,084
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

465
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:10,482
It could taste like any food you desire.

466
00:29:11,525 --> 00:29:16,113
Shmoo hide cut thin
made fine leather.

467
00:29:16,843 --> 00:29:20,284
Even Shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks.

468
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:25,601
In essence, The Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

469
00:29:25,602 --> 00:29:29,251
I only bring up the case of The Shmoo
because of its relevance to you

470
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:30,606
and the reason
you were brought here.

471
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:32,066
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

472
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,736
I'm The Boss.

473
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:35,717
I thought he was The Boss.

474
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:37,489
Why?

475
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,888
Do we look alike?

476
00:29:41,243 --> 00:29:43,746
So, Mr. Fisher,

477
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:45,205
you were gonna tell me something?

478
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,708
I don't know.
You brought me here.

479
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:48,646
Yes, I did,

480
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:51,253
but back when you thought I was him.

481
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:53,964
I never thought you were him,
I thought he was you.

482
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:57,822
And I was trying to tell him-- you--
that they picked up the wrong guy.

483
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:58,969
The wrong guy for what?

484
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:00,220
Whatever it is
you wanted to see me about.

485
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,367
Do you know
what I want to see you about?

486
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,410
No.

487
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,974
Then how do you know
I have the wrong guy?

488
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:05,225
Because I'm not Nick Fish--

489
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:07,311
Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

490
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:09,709
In that case,
do I still have the wrong guy?

491
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:13,150
Do you want to give me $96,000?

492
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,487
<i>No. Do you want
to give me $96,000?</i>

493
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:17,946
No. Should I?

494
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:19,928
I don't know. Should you?

495
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:24,308
I don't know. Should I?

496
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:31,294
Long story short.

497
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:34,631
I think we're well past that point.

498
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,403
THE BOSS: I bet it was that mouth
that got you that nose.

499
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:42,451
SLEVIN: Okay, I'm under the impression
that you're under the impression

500
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:44,537
that I owe you $96,000?

501
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:47,665
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

502
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:53,400
You owe Slim, Slim owes me...
you owe me.

503
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:00,907
Well, in that case, is Slim around?

504
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:09,040
Hey, Slim.
You know this cat?

505
00:31:11,022 --> 00:31:12,065
Slim?

506
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:15,610
No use.

507
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,094
THE BOSS: Ever since
somebody shot him, old Slim went deaf.

508
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:23,326
What happened
to make Slim go deaf?

509
00:31:23,326 --> 00:31:24,369
Why?

510
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:29,166
Well, because I owe you $96,000,

511
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,459
and I might have a slight problem
coming up with the money.

512
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:32,502
Oh, okay.

513
00:31:32,502 --> 00:31:36,673
Well, why don't we just
make it an even 90?

514
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,905
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

515
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:48,560
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favor?

516
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:53,148
Well, it depends on the favor.

517
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:58,675
THE BOSS: That was my son.

518
00:32:00,031 --> 00:32:02,012
You notice how I said "was"?

519
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,619
Yeah.

520
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,287
That's because he's dead.

521
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:08,998
Murdered.

522
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:14,629
Relegated to the past tense.

523
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,051
Sent from an "is" to a "was"
before he'd had his breakfast.

524
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,240
Bummer.

525
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:31,416
<i>Lex talionis. </i>

526
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,919
The law of retaliation.

527
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:51,229
THE BOSS: A pact was broken.

528
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:52,689
My son was murdered,

529
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:56,234
so The Rabbi's son
must share the same fate.

530
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:58,111
Whose son?

531
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:59,779
The Rabbi's.

532
00:32:59,883 --> 00:33:01,969
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

533
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:03,428
Because--

534
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:07,912
Because he's a rabbi.

535
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:09,059
Who's his son?

536
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:11,353
Yitzchok.

537
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:13,751
Yitzchok.
Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

538
00:33:13,752 --> 00:33:15,420
Yitzchok The Fairy.

539
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:19,278
Why do they call him The Fairy?

540
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:23,866
Because he's a fairy.

541
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:27,411
What, he has wings, he can fly,
he sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

542
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:29,809
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

543
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,477
Come on.

544
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:36,379
So how does The Rabbi feel
about that?

545
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,777
- He doesn't know.
- You know, but he doesn't know.

546
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:40,654
- Everybody knows.
- Except The Rabbi.

547
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:41,697
That's right.

548
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:44,825
So where do I fit in?

549
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:46,493
You?

550
00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:50,039
You're the trigger man.

551
00:33:51,707 --> 00:33:52,854
Me?

552
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,209
You.

553
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:03,072
Aren't there professionals?

554
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:05,054
People you can hire
to do this sort of thing?

555
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:06,618
(laughs)

556
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:08,703
Of course there are.

557
00:34:08,703 --> 00:34:10,059
Yes.

558
00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:13,082
But you owe me $96,000.

559
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,628
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

560
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:20,486
Sorry, kid.

561
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,406
But your money just isn't long enough,

562
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:25,909
which means you're in my pocket,

563
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,411
which means if you don't do
what I want you to do,

564
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:31,018
you're gonna go from my pocket
to my fridge.

565
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:36,857
Slim could use the company,
and I could use The Shmoo.

566
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:39,047
THE BOSS: So I'll expect
your answer by morning.

567
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:43,218
Is there anything else?

568
00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:47,076
Well, I don't suppose I have to say
anything as trite and clichéd

569
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:49,474
as "Go to the police
and you're a dead man. "

570
00:34:49,995 --> 00:34:51,768
I think you just did.

571
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:53,436
I guess I did.

572
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,735
So, let me see if I've got this right.

573
00:35:02,508 --> 00:35:06,053
I'm paying you a lot of money
to kill somebody,

574
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:08,451
and you're getting
somebody else to do it?

575
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:10,851
Don't worry.

576
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:13,666
I'm gonna kill somebody.

577
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:20,548
(shutter clicking)

578
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:22,216
MAN: Better call Brikowski.

579
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:24,510
Tell him there's a new face in town.

580
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:29,098
(shutter clicking)

581
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,345
(sighs)

582
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:56,938
(coughs)

583
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,091
- (knocks)
- Hey.

584
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:04,655
- Nick still hasn't showed, huh?
- No.

585
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:05,698
What's with you and that towel?

586
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:08,201
Oh, it's-- Lindsey.
(sighs)

587
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:09,660
It's a very long story.

588
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,850
Well, get dressed.
You can tell me about it on the way.

589
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,206
On the way?
Where are we going?

590
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:16,125
All we know is that somebody
called Nick from the Hotel Cheval.

591
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,419
I spoke to a friend who works there,

592
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:20,192
she says they keep a record
of every call made from the hotel

593
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:21,964
and that she can access the computer

594
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:23,424
and we can find out
what room the call came from.

595
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,092
She should be calling any minute.

596
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,865
What is it?

597
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:28,012
I know this guy.

598
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,619
- LINDSEY: Who?
- SLEVIN: This guy.

599
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:36,145
- You know that guy?
- Yeah. I met him.

600
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:37,605
He was dead.

601
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:41,672
You met a dead guy?

602
00:36:42,923 --> 00:36:44,070
Yeah.

603
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,365
In a walk-in freezer.

604
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,204
"New York bookmaker Slim Hopkins
was reported missing by his wife.

605
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:54,915
Police have no leads. "
Blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda.

606
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:57,000
"Spokesperson commented
off the record,

607
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,024
"'It's ironic that Hopkins
should go missing considering

608
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:03,257
he's allegedly pinned
behind a few disappearing acts himself. "'

609
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:10,868
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

610
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:13,267
- Do you mind if I get dressed first?
- (phone rings)

611
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:15,143
My phone.
Could be my friend from the hotel.

612
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:16,290
Be right back.

613
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:21,921
Hmm.

614
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:33,079
(pounding on door)

615
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:36,833
SLEVIN: Yeah, Lindsey, I don't think
it's such a good idea that we continue to--

616
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:41,838
Put your shoes on.
Schlomo wants to see you.

617
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,739
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

618
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:49,345
Someone named Schlomo knows you.

619
00:37:49,345 --> 00:37:51,014
That is your only concern.

620
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:52,891
Let's go.

621
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:54,767
Like I said, I don't know any--

622
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,853
(strained)
... named Schlomo.

623
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:58,938
That hurt.

624
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,692
I think it's better
if you let me do the talking.

625
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:03,839
You think?

626
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,034
What is it?

627
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:16,456
He's sorry that he hit you.

628
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:18,750
- You always speak for him?
- MAN: Yes.

629
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,756
So he's a mute, then.

630
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,633
Not quite.

631
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,197
Well, what then?

632
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:29,491
It's personal.
You have to ask him.

633
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:31,159
(chuckles)

634
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:32,619
- How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

635
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,562
- Hey, are we going to the--
- No.

636
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:41,899
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

637
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,131
SLEVIN: Right across the street
from one another?

638
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,634
One time they were one
with one another,

639
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:50,032
and then they tried
to kill one another.

640
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:55,871
Now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation,

641
00:38:55,872 --> 00:38:58,269
for fear of what
the other man will do to him.

642
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,801
Let me guess, all the way up?

643
00:39:12,138 --> 00:39:13,181
Penthouse.

644
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:24,964
(classical music playing softly)

645
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:44,462
You must be Mr. Fisher.

646
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,719
Must I? Because that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

647
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,491
But I'm afraid you must.

648
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,368
Well, if I must.

649
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,602
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

650
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:02,607
For starters, I'm unlucky.

651
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:06,882
The unlucky are nothing more than a frame
of reference for the lucky, Mr. Fisher.

652
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:09,801
You are unlucky
so that I may know that I am not.

653
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:14,076
Unfortunately, the lucky never realize
they are lucky until it's too late.

654
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:15,328
Take yourself, for instance.

655
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:17,309
Yesterday, you were better off
than you are today,

656
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:22,001
but it took today for you to realize it,
but today has arrived, and it's too late.

657
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:22,939
You see?

658
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:26,485
People are never happy
with what they have.

659
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:30,864
They always want what they had,
what someone else has.

660
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:33,367
SLEVIN: Kind of like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

661
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,765
a gangster who would
rather be a rabbi.

662
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,912
I mean, what is that?

663
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:40,144
Some sort of the grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

664
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:43,585
I mean, how do you justify being a rabbi

665
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:45,254
and a gangster?

666
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:50,468
I don't.

667
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:54,535
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been

668
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,828
when I am what could've been
and could not have been.

669
00:40:56,828 --> 00:41:00,791
I live on both sides of the fence.
My grass is always green.

670
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,980
Consider, Mr. Fisher...

671
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,004
... there are two men
sitting here before you,

672
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,985
and one of them
you should be very afraid of.

673
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:09,132
Where's my money?

674
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:13,303
- Listen, I've been hearing that a lot lately--
- THE RABBI: My father used to say,

675
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:16,014
"The first time somebody calls you a horse,
you punch 'em on the nose,

676
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,204
"the second time somebody
calls you a horse, you call 'em a jerk,

677
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:19,872
"but the third time
somebody calls you a horse,

678
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,522
well, then perhaps it's time
to go shopping for a saddle. "

679
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:33,950
I don't have your money.

680
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:36,661
This isn't like skipping out on the check.

681
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:40,415
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

682
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,979
I don't even know
how much money I owe you.

683
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,064
- $33,000.
- But I'm not Nick Fisher.

684
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:45,211
Then who the hell are you?

685
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,609
I'm just a guy who was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

686
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:54,283
You have 48 hours to get my money.

687
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:56,994
Saul will keep an eye on you
in the meantime.

688
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:58,245
You may go now.

689
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:05,753
Wait, I just have one question.

690
00:42:06,795 --> 00:42:08,568
I wasn't frisked.

691
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,199
(chuckles)

692
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:19,204
I see. So being a rabbi,
a religious man...

693
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:21,707
There are three things
that you may not do in order to save a life,

694
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,167
including his own.

695
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:27,129
He may not idol worship,
commit adultery,

696
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,840
or perform an act
of premeditated murder.

697
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,447
Killing you
before you killed me would've been--

698
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:33,490
Kosher.

699
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,120
Acceptable.

700
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:01,330
I've wired half the money
into your bank in the Caimans.

701
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,562
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

702
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:06,231
Now, I can expect that when?

703
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,114
- Very soon.
- Good.

704
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:17,389
So, tell me. The kid.

705
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,536
What do you want with him?

706
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:23,645
The kid and I have unfinished business.

707
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:36,470
If there is one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

708
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,973
Man in my position,
it's all he has to go on.

709
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,874
To know a lie when he hears it--
difference between life and death--

710
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,750
your own, someone else's.

711
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,400
That being said, he wasn't lying.

712
00:43:50,234 --> 00:43:51,798
That's not Nick Fisher.

713
00:43:52,945 --> 00:43:53,988
I know.

714
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:05,876
LINDSEY:
I came back here, you were gone,

715
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,212
so I went to the hotel
without you to see my friend.

716
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,028
She says the call to Nick
came from Room 1009.

717
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:16,720
A fellow registered under
the name Smith, if you can believe that.

718
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,180
Although it is one of the most
common names in the world,

719
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,848
so there are bound to be
a couple of them.

720
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:22,559
But I get the feeling
this ain't one of them.

721
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:25,479
I get up to the tenth floor,
and just as I do,

722
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,545
the door to Room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr. Smith in the flesh.

723
00:44:29,546 --> 00:44:32,778
So I pretend I'm walking to the elevator
instead of coming from it,

724
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,550
and we take it down together.

725
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,470
He smiles at me-- Thanks--
I smile back,

726
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,702
but still, I have no idea who he is,
but I think that you might,

727
00:44:40,703 --> 00:44:42,475
so I take a picture of him
using my cellphone,

728
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:43,830
which originally
I thought was a total waste

729
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,438
'cause the photos look like shit
and I never use it,

730
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:50,713
so there I am pretending to dial a number
and taking Smith's picture,

731
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:52,486
him none the wiser.

732
00:44:52,486 --> 00:44:54,571
This is Smith.
Recognize him?

733
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:55,718
No.

734
00:44:56,448 --> 00:44:58,534
I didn't think you would,
but it was worth a shot.

735
00:44:58,534 --> 00:45:00,932
Anyway, we take the elevator
down to the lobby,

736
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:05,728
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

737
00:45:05,729 --> 00:45:07,188
So I followed him.

738
00:45:12,297 --> 00:45:16,051
LINDSEY: He went down
into an apartment building downtown,

739
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:17,094
so I wait.

740
00:45:17,095 --> 00:45:21,265
An hour goes by,
and just when I'm getting ready to leave,

741
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:23,037
who walks outside?

742
00:45:23,038 --> 00:45:24,706
- Smith?
- You.

743
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:29,919
Me?

744
00:45:31,587 --> 00:45:33,674
LINDSEY: You out of the same building.

745
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:36,072
With two Hasidic Jews
on either side of you.

746
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,096
Friends of yours?

747
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:41,181
Not exactly.

748
00:45:41,181 --> 00:45:43,267
I think it's time you told me that story.

749
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:49,002
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right,

750
00:45:49,003 --> 00:45:52,651
and then right across the street,
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

751
00:45:52,651 --> 00:45:53,902
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

752
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:55,466
Because he's a Rabbi.

753
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:02,557
<i>THE RABBI: ... $33.000. </i>

754
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,666
So now I have to "take out, "
to use the vernacular, The Fairy

755
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,169
in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

756
00:46:10,169 --> 00:46:14,027
And if that's not enough, I have 48 hours
to come up with $33,000

757
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:15,486
or The Rabbi's gonna...

758
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:18,615
I don't know who Mr. Smith is.

759
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:22,057
And the worst part about it
is I'm not Nick Fisher.

760
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:24,559
Ironic.

761
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:27,270
I know.
I don't even gamble.

762
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:29,355
No. I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

763
00:46:33,005 --> 00:46:35,612
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

764
00:46:35,612 --> 00:46:36,654
Yeah.

765
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:40,304
Things like that aren't supposed to be real.
It's like amnesia.

766
00:46:40,305 --> 00:46:43,953
Not withstanding, here you are
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so...

767
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:45,726
I'd say you're fucked.

768
00:46:47,082 --> 00:46:48,646
Fucked.

769
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:55,006
Shouldn't you be
a little more worried about all this?

770
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:57,404
I have anorexia.

771
00:46:57,405 --> 00:46:58,656
Anorexia.

772
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:01,888
It's a condition characterized
by freedom from worry

773
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,869
or any other preoccupation, really.

774
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:09,605
Anyway, I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

775
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:11,169
What are you gonna say?

776
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,714
I'm gonna say what any man
with two penises would say

777
00:47:14,714 --> 00:47:17,113
when his tailor asks him
if he dresses to the right or to the left.

778
00:47:17,113 --> 00:47:18,572
What's that?

779
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:22,118
Yes.

780
00:47:22,222 --> 00:47:24,724
I knew you had sense.

781
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:28,791
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

782
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:31,085
Sometimes.

783
00:47:31,606 --> 00:47:34,317
Sometimes it's
when you know you don't.

784
00:47:35,464 --> 00:47:37,028
Nah, don't move that bishop.

785
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:39,948
SLEVIN: It's an obvious sucker bet.

786
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:42,450
If you don't,
you could have him in four moves.

787
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:45,161
If you do right now,
he's gonna have you in mate in one.

788
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,124
He doesn't see it.

789
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:51,522
Wouldn't matter if he did.

790
00:47:52,148 --> 00:47:54,129
Elvis lets me win.

791
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,632
Everybody lets me win.

792
00:47:57,884 --> 00:47:58,822
Wait a minute.

793
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:01,220
You know this game.

794
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:09,458
THE BOSS: You got three days.

795
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:14,046
I was thinking it would take me
more like a week.

796
00:48:14,046 --> 00:48:16,235
(laughs)
You were thinking that, were you?

797
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:18,842
With all your experience killing people.

798
00:48:19,885 --> 00:48:21,449
I'll tell you what.

799
00:48:22,596 --> 00:48:24,890
You win this game, you got your week.

800
00:48:40,635 --> 00:48:42,824
So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

801
00:48:45,328 --> 00:48:46,892
I was gonna play it by ear.

802
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:49,082
(chuckles) Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down.

803
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:50,124
It's a tough tune.

804
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,774
By the way, he has shadows.

805
00:48:57,319 --> 00:48:58,674
Shadows?

806
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:04,722
Bodyguards.

807
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:07,433
With him all the time.

808
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,874
Military.

809
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:18,486
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

810
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,240
THE BOSS: They go where he goes
round the clock.

811
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,638
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

812
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:26,932
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

813
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:30,373
That doesn't sound good.

814
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:33,085
THE BOSS: They live
in the apartment next door.

815
00:49:33,919 --> 00:49:37,151
He wears a panic button
on the chain around his neck.

816
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:39,445
Looks like an ordinary Star of David.

817
00:49:40,071 --> 00:49:43,616
He presses that button and, well,
we all know how that ends.

818
00:49:43,617 --> 00:49:45,076
MAN: What's this?

819
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:47,370
Oh, God.
No, you didn't.

820
00:49:47,371 --> 00:49:48,830
Get down!

821
00:49:49,038 --> 00:49:50,394
- Get down!
- MAN: What the hell?

822
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:56,233
SMITH: Response time's gonna be
three to five seconds.

823
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:59,257
So he's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

824
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:00,404
Where?

825
00:50:01,029 --> 00:50:02,594
Where?

826
00:50:02,595 --> 00:50:04,262
The apartment.

827
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:08,537
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

828
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:12,395
No, I was thinking
you'd use the back door.

829
00:50:18,964 --> 00:50:20,842
Then what?

830
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,491
He does the kid, I do him.

831
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:28,975
I plant my gun--
clean, no history-- on Yitzchok,

832
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:32,207
fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands...

833
00:50:33,354 --> 00:50:35,023
... take the clothes off.

834
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:39,819
Make it look like a
"you do me, I do you, we're both gay,

835
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,218
the world doesn't understand us"
double suicide.

836
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:44,824
And that's all there is to it.

837
00:50:46,284 --> 00:50:47,848
Is that all there is to it?

838
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,725
Yeah.

839
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:51,706
That's all there is to it.

840
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,000
(laughing)

841
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:06,304
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

842
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,059
Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.

843
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:14,334
Some have grown pretty dead.

844
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:21,112
You're a conundrum, you.

845
00:51:23,093 --> 00:51:25,387
You walk in here
shooting your fucking mouth off

846
00:51:25,387 --> 00:51:27,993
like you don't give a fuck
if it gets shot off.

847
00:51:29,245 --> 00:51:30,704
You can only kill me once.

848
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:39,463
Checkmate.

849
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:48,118
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

850
00:51:51,037 --> 00:51:52,080
Cat.

851
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,417
THE BOSS: Mouse.

852
00:51:57,399 --> 00:51:59,171
You got three days.

853
00:52:03,447 --> 00:52:04,802
THE BOSS: Excuse me.

854
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:28,472
Who the fuck is this guy?

855
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:30,140
MAN: Don't know.

856
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:32,851
Whoever he is, he's either in
very deep shit, or I don't know what,

857
00:52:32,851 --> 00:52:35,666
'cause he's playing in the sandbox
with the Darkies, the Skullcaps,

858
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:37,022
and who knows who.

859
00:52:37,126 --> 00:52:40,880
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo that Marty snapped.

860
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:42,965
MAN: Yes, boss.

861
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:45,782
I want a complete rundown
on this fucker.

862
00:52:45,782 --> 00:52:47,346
Everything from A to Z.

863
00:52:47,346 --> 00:52:49,431
I wanna know who he is,
who does he know.

864
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:50,682
People he knows,
who do they know?

865
00:52:50,683 --> 00:52:54,019
I want to know what the fuck
he is doing in my fucking city.

866
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:05,906
- What do you got?
- Get this.

867
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:07,366
The Kat's in town.

868
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:09,764
Goodkat?

869
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:11,224
That's the song the junkies
are singing.

870
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:12,475
What's the happenstance?

871
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:13,830
MAN: Didn't know the happenstance.

872
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,124
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

873
00:53:17,271 --> 00:53:20,191
- Who's Goodkat?
- MAN: Real heavy hitter.

874
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:22,276
The heaviest.

875
00:53:22,277 --> 00:53:24,779
He shows, people die, he vanishes.

876
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:27,177
No one knows who he is
or what he looks like.

877
00:53:27,177 --> 00:53:30,097
And he hasn't worked New York
in what, two decades?

878
00:53:30,097 --> 00:53:31,766
Just what we need.

879
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:33,851
All right.

880
00:53:33,956 --> 00:53:36,771
And get some different fucking coffee
in here, will you?

881
00:53:36,772 --> 00:53:39,065
I gotta get to the fucking morgue.

882
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,848
- Hey! I figured it out!
- What'd you figure out?

883
00:53:50,849 --> 00:53:52,516
You said Slim Hopkins
worked for The Boss, right?

884
00:53:52,516 --> 00:53:54,184
- Right.
- Well, listen.

885
00:53:55,331 --> 00:53:57,208
The Rabbi also had a bookie.
His name was Benny Begin,

886
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:58,564
and right now Begin's
down at the morgue on ice.

887
00:53:58,564 --> 00:54:01,170
- Somebody killed him and his goons.
- At the morgue?

888
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,630
Yeah. Didn't I tell you
I was a coroner?

889
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,507
No, you didn't tell me
you were a coroner.

890
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,033
Benny Begin, killed by a baseball.

891
00:54:10,035 --> 00:54:11,493
LINDSEY: My guess was a fastball.

892
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:17,020
Either way, it proves that the good Lord
has a sense of humor.

893
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,001
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

894
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:20,357
- Know this guy?
- Mm-hmm.

895
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,964
Big time bookie.
Worked for The Rabbi.

896
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:25,467
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

897
00:54:25,467 --> 00:54:30,055
Between you and me,
20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.

898
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:32,244
I used to send my paychecks
over to him.

899
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,789
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

900
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:37,145
These two were poisoned.

901
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:39,647
Something exotic.

902
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:43,401
- I'm running it down.
- Let me know.

903
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:44,444
Will do.

904
00:54:45,591 --> 00:54:46,738
Prick.

905
00:54:50,283 --> 00:54:52,994
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

906
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,293
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

907
00:55:01,961 --> 00:55:03,838
Don't you see?
Nick isn't missing, he's hiding.

908
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:05,298
He set you up!

909
00:55:05,298 --> 00:55:07,383
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

910
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:09,470
Nick found himself in a jam,
he got you to take his place.

911
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,243
He paid some street thug to mug you,

912
00:55:11,347 --> 00:55:13,328
but all he really wants
is your wallet with your license.

913
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,935
That's why he ignores
the watch and the suitcase.

914
00:55:15,936 --> 00:55:17,812
Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins
and Benny Begin,

915
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:19,271
the only guys who know
what he looks like,

916
00:55:19,271 --> 00:55:20,731
and now you're left holding the bag!

917
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:23,234
But I called Nick.
I initiated contact.

918
00:55:23,234 --> 00:55:25,215
Well, maybe it just seems that way.

919
00:55:25,215 --> 00:55:26,258
What about Smith?

920
00:55:26,675 --> 00:55:28,864
I still can't figure him out in all this.

921
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,637
You should run.

922
00:55:30,637 --> 00:55:31,784
I can't.

923
00:55:31,784 --> 00:55:34,286
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

924
00:55:34,286 --> 00:55:35,538
Then go to the police!

925
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:37,936
These guys buy cops
like cops buy doughnuts.

926
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,917
This isn't the first time
this has happened, you know?

927
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:41,377
You mean this isn't the first time

928
00:55:41,377 --> 00:55:43,358
a crime lord asked you to kill
the gay son of a rival gangster

929
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:45,339
to pay off a debt that belongs to a friend
whose place you're staying in

930
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:47,007
as a result of losing your job,
your apartment,

931
00:55:47,007 --> 00:55:48,884
and finding your girlfriend in bed
with another guy?

932
00:55:48,884 --> 00:55:50,448
No, this is the first time
that happened,

933
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:53,368
but Nick has been painting me
into corners since we were kids.

934
00:55:55,245 --> 00:55:57,748
I guess I've always been a better friend
to him than he's been to me.

935
00:55:57,748 --> 00:56:01,085
I'd love to hear the rest of this,
but I really gotta go back to work.

936
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:03,275
Oh, hey! Hey!

937
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,256
H-hey.

938
00:56:05,256 --> 00:56:07,758
I was just thinking that if you're still alive
when I get back from work tonight,

939
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:10,991
maybe... I don't know,

940
00:56:10,991 --> 00:56:13,910
we could go to dinner
or something?

941
00:56:17,664 --> 00:56:19,228
Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.

942
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:21,314
- Really?
- Yeah.

943
00:56:22,043 --> 00:56:23,086
Yeah, sure.

944
00:56:23,086 --> 00:56:24,233
Okay.

945
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,693
Um, no.

946
00:56:25,694 --> 00:56:26,840
Bye!

947
00:56:34,452 --> 00:56:36,224
What a weirdo.

948
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,235
(laughs)

949
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:47,799
What?

950
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:49,676
I was just thinking about
what it would be like

951
00:56:49,676 --> 00:56:52,075
if we'd met
under different circumstances.

952
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,368
See, I think people
should only fall in love

953
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,245
if there's a great story
behind how they met.

954
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,416
You know, seeing as how
you have to tell it over and over again.

955
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,667
If you and I fell in love,

956
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,649
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

957
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,796
Yeah.

958
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,881
We'd be at a dinner party
and someone would ask,

959
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,132
"So, how'd you two meet?"

960
00:57:08,237 --> 00:57:10,322
And I'd say,
"You tell the story, dear, "

961
00:57:10,322 --> 00:57:12,512
and you'd say,
"No. You tell it better. "

962
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,450
(chuckles)

963
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,351
So, come here often?

964
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,583
No.

965
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,607
But I heard about someone who does.

966
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,361
- You mean The Fairy?
- Yeah.

967
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,299
- Is he... ?
- Yeah.

968
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:32,220
Where?

969
00:57:38,476 --> 00:57:40,666
This is absurd!
What are you thinking?

970
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:42,960
I'm thinking of a new option.

971
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,941
- What's that?
- Talking with him.

972
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,818
- Talking with him?
- Talking with him.

973
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:48,903
You're just gonna walk over and say,
"Hi, my name is Slevin,

974
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:50,572
"and some bad dudes think
I'm someone that I'm not,

975
00:57:50,572 --> 00:57:53,074
"and this someone owes that someone
and now I'm gonna have to take you out

976
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:54,117
"or they're gonna take me out

977
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,306
and I was just wondering,
you wanna talk about it"?

978
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,496
- I can't do that.
- Ya think?

979
00:57:58,496 --> 00:58:00,999
Look, I can't just walk over there.
He's got bodyguards.

980
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:03,397
Aside from that,
you're pretty much dead on.

981
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,587
Bodyguards?

982
00:58:05,587 --> 00:58:07,255
Yeah. Right behind him.
Two of them.

983
00:58:07,255 --> 00:58:08,402
Israelis.

984
00:58:08,506 --> 00:58:09,549
Beards.

985
00:58:09,549 --> 00:58:10,800
Right behind him.

986
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:12,781
SLEVIN: See 'em?

987
00:58:16,431 --> 00:58:17,473
You're getting good at this.

988
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:18,620
Thanks.

989
00:58:18,725 --> 00:58:20,290
How are you gonna
have a talk with him?

990
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,105
I'm gonna wait till he goes to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna follow him in.

991
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:24,878
What do you think?

992
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,944
<i>MARTY: Can someone tell me
why I'm in the van?</i>

993
00:58:30,195 --> 00:58:32,907
<i>BRIKOWSKI: Because I could only get
a reservation for two. </i>

994
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:36,556
<i>All right. The Fairy's
at a table in the middle, </i>

995
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:38,329
<i>bodyguards nearby, </i>

996
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,997
<i>our boy's not far away, </i>

997
00:58:39,997 --> 00:58:42,082
<i>but I can't make out who's with him. </i>

998
00:58:42,082 --> 00:58:43,855
<i>Did Murph get a beat on him yet?</i>

999
00:58:44,376 --> 00:58:46,357
<i>MARTY: Murph says whoever he is,
he's a ghost. </i>

1000
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:48,339
<i>Can't find anyone
who's ever even bumped into him, </i>

1001
00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:50,215
<i>much less tripped over him. </i>

1002
00:58:54,595 --> 00:58:56,472
<i>BRIKOWSKI:
Fairy's going to the bathroom. </i>

1003
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,458
<i>And our boy's making a move.
Shit. </i>

1004
00:59:25,043 --> 00:59:27,650
<i>- Marty, the door's locked.
- MARTY: Relax. </i>

1005
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,944
It's not gonna go down
in the men's room.

1006
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:35,574
I got next.

1007
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,788
LINDSEY: What went down
in the men's room?

1008
00:59:40,788 --> 00:59:42,456
- We talked.
- And?

1009
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:44,437
I told him I thought
we should get together sometime.

1010
00:59:44,437 --> 00:59:45,793
- You didn't.
- I did.

1011
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:46,836
And?

1012
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:48,817
I got a date.

1013
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:51,215
Oh, my God.
Do you think this is safe?

1014
00:59:51,215 --> 00:59:54,030
It can't be any worse than what's
waiting for me behind door number 2.

1015
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:58,411
It's gonna be tough, though.
I think I picked up a pigtail.

1016
00:59:58,412 --> 01:00:00,809
- A what?
- The cops.

1017
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:04,771
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

1018
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:08,316
I ran into a nosy cop
in the men's room.

1019
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,265
You and me need to talk.

1020
01:00:23,644 --> 01:00:24,687
Do I know you?

1021
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,355
No. But I know you.

1022
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,052
Listen, buddy, I'm sorry.
No offense or anything, but I'm not--

1023
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:37,825
I'm not gay.

1024
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:39,285
I'm a cop.

1025
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,413
Yeah, well, I'm not a robber,
if you catch my drift.

1026
01:00:43,144 --> 01:00:44,187
I've been watching you.

1027
01:00:44,187 --> 01:00:46,272
I know what you're into.

1028
01:00:47,106 --> 01:00:48,357
Who are you?

1029
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:50,860
I mean, I know who you're not.
I know you're not Nick Fisher.

1030
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,633
The guy whose apartment
you're staying in.

1031
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:55,239
I know this because Nick Fisher
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

1032
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:58,367
for forcing himself
on a 14-year-old cheerleader.

1033
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:00,766
Dade County sent me a picture
of Nick Fisher,

1034
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:02,643
and you are not him.

1035
01:01:02,747 --> 01:01:07,126
So who the fuck are you?

1036
01:01:09,942 --> 01:01:12,235
I'm just a guy
whose dinner's getting cold.

1037
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:15,364
May I leave now?

1038
01:01:16,094 --> 01:01:17,241
- SLEVIN: Come here.
- What?

1039
01:01:17,345 --> 01:01:18,909
Dead bodies in refrigerators,

1040
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,994
cops in men's rooms?

1041
01:01:20,994 --> 01:01:23,497
You remind me of James Bond.

1042
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,753
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

1043
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:31,631
And The Boss, he can be Kananga.

1044
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:33,091
Kananga?

1045
01:01:34,446 --> 01:01:37,053
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Then who's The Boss?

1046
01:01:37,054 --> 01:01:39,973
Ernst Stavros Blofeld.

1047
01:01:39,974 --> 01:01:41,537
Which one?
Donald Pleasence?

1048
01:01:41,537 --> 01:01:44,560
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

1049
01:01:44,562 --> 01:01:46,020
(as Sean Connery)
You know your Bond.

1050
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:48,001
But alas, I was referring
to Anthony Dawson.

1051
01:01:48,001 --> 01:01:49,148
Who?

1052
01:01:49,878 --> 01:01:52,485
<i>Well, he played Blofeld
in From Russia with Love.</i>

1053
01:01:52,485 --> 01:01:55,717
<i>We never see Blofeld's face
in From Russia with Love.</i>

1054
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,699
That's when the villain is most effective--

1055
01:01:57,699 --> 01:01:59,576
(as Sean Connery)
when you don't know what he looks like.

1056
01:01:59,577 --> 01:02:00,618
(laughs)

1057
01:02:04,998 --> 01:02:07,083
(laughs)

1058
01:02:18,553 --> 01:02:19,597
So...

1059
01:02:22,933 --> 01:02:23,976
See you later.

1060
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:55,049
- SLEVIN: That was incredible.
- (Lindsey laughs)

1061
01:02:57,134 --> 01:02:59,949
- (Lindsey laughing)
- SLEVIN: I just realized something.

1062
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:02,556
- LINDSEY: What's that?
- I just made love to you...

1063
01:03:02,556 --> 01:03:04,537
LINDSEY: You're just
realizing that now?

1064
01:03:04,537 --> 01:03:07,458
SLEVIN: And I have no idea
who specifically you're referring to

1065
01:03:07,459 --> 01:03:09,230
when you say James Bond.

1066
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:13,714
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

1067
01:03:13,715 --> 01:03:18,094
and I was saying that it was
the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me,

1068
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:19,345
I naturally assumed that you--

1069
01:03:19,345 --> 01:03:21,952
I naturally assumed that you knew
who I was talking about.

1070
01:03:27,686 --> 01:03:32,274
Because if you aren't talking about the guy
that I think you're talking about...

1071
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,464
well, then you have me
mistaken for somebody else,

1072
01:03:34,465 --> 01:03:37,488
because in my mind,
there is only one Bond.

1073
01:03:38,531 --> 01:03:40,303
Well, on that we agree.

1074
01:03:43,014 --> 01:03:44,683
Same time, on three.

1075
01:03:44,683 --> 01:03:46,247
- One.
- Two.

1076
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:47,289
Three.

1077
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:48,436
- George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

1078
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,583
- SLEVIN: George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore?

1079
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:50,939
- Are you kidding me?
- I was kidding.

1080
01:03:50,939 --> 01:03:52,399
Yeah, I was kidding, too.

1081
01:03:52,503 --> 01:03:54,484
The only James Bond...

1082
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:56,153
- is Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

1083
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:02,410
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

1084
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,869
- I do.
- (Lindsey laughing)

1085
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:36,611
Where are you going?

1086
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,947
I'm just gonna get us some coffee.

1087
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:42,658
Okay.

1088
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:48,186
Hurry back to me.

1089
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:50,688
(slow song playing on radio)

1090
01:04:50,688 --> 01:04:54,129
WOMAN: # When you're in love #

1091
01:04:54,129 --> 01:04:58,300
# You're happy #

1092
01:04:58,717 --> 01:05:03,513
# Oh, and when you're in her arms #

1093
01:05:03,514 --> 01:05:08,206
# You gave #

1094
01:05:11,438 --> 01:05:12,898
# It doesn't matter... #

1095
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:14,462
Police.

1096
01:05:14,462 --> 01:05:16,130
Come on, man.

1097
01:05:17,069 --> 01:05:19,154
I already talked to your buddy.

1098
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:29,164
MAN: Morning.

1099
01:05:29,165 --> 01:05:30,833
I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

1100
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:33,232
Good morning, Detective Dumbrowski.
Am I being kidnapped?

1101
01:05:33,232 --> 01:05:36,568
No. We just wanna have
a quick friendly word with you.

1102
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:39,905
Is this the standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policemen's manual

1103
01:05:39,905 --> 01:05:41,365
if you looked up "quick friendly word. "

1104
01:05:41,365 --> 01:05:44,389
There is no SOP for the kind of box
you've got yourself into, kid.

1105
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:45,431
Oh.

1106
01:05:50,228 --> 01:05:52,835
- So what'd you want to talk to me about?
- You.

1107
01:05:53,356 --> 01:05:54,816
- What about me?
- Who are you?

1108
01:05:54,816 --> 01:05:55,858
(chuckles)

1109
01:05:55,858 --> 01:05:57,423
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

1110
01:05:57,527 --> 01:05:58,569
Rank, serial number?

1111
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:00,968
- You should really play ball, kid.
- Really? You think I'm tall enough?

1112
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,689
BRIKOWSKI: What is your name?

1113
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:15,149
(strained)
Oh, yeah. I remember.

1114
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,400
Slevin Kelevra.

1115
01:06:16,504 --> 01:06:18,903
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

1116
01:06:18,903 --> 01:06:20,050
Kelevra.

1117
01:06:20,989 --> 01:06:24,742
Look, kid, I don't know what's going on
or how you're into this,

1118
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:27,662
but when I figure out
what there is to figure out,

1119
01:06:27,662 --> 01:06:29,643
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

1120
01:06:30,373 --> 01:06:33,084
This is nice?
Don't do me any favors.

1121
01:06:33,918 --> 01:06:35,691
Last chance to come clean.

1122
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:43,824
Take a walk.

1123
01:06:46,327 --> 01:06:49,350
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

1124
01:07:36,378 --> 01:07:37,525
(slow song playing)

1125
01:07:37,629 --> 01:07:40,966
# When you're in love #

1126
01:07:40,967 --> 01:07:45,553
# You're happy #

1127
01:07:45,555 --> 01:07:50,141
# Oh, and when you're in her arms #

1128
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:55,252
# You gave #

1129
01:07:58,171 --> 01:08:01,508
# This doesn't matter... #

1130
01:08:02,134 --> 01:08:03,802
I have to go to work.

1131
01:08:04,636 --> 01:08:05,783
Hey.

1132
01:08:23,926 --> 01:08:25,386
(pounding on door)

1133
01:08:33,728 --> 01:08:35,292
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

1134
01:08:35,293 --> 01:08:36,751
Now's the time.

1135
01:08:37,794 --> 01:08:39,254
No, I got at least--

1136
01:08:39,255 --> 01:08:40,297
Jesus.

1137
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:43,322
The Boss says he wants you
to look nice for The Fairy.

1138
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:26,281
(elevator dings)

1139
01:09:56,938 --> 01:09:58,189
(knocks)

1140
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:02,986
You're early.

1141
01:10:06,844 --> 01:10:09,033
Why don't you come in
and fix yourself a drink?

1142
01:10:09,033 --> 01:10:10,702
I was just getting ready.

1143
01:10:22,902 --> 01:10:24,883
You'll have to excuse the...

1144
01:10:24,883 --> 01:10:28,533
I wasn't expecting you for another...

1145
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:30,618
You look good.

1146
01:10:31,974 --> 01:10:33,329
You want some wine?

1147
01:10:34,893 --> 01:10:36,249
Something the matter?

1148
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:42,401
Somebody's trying to kill you.

1149
01:10:44,069 --> 01:10:45,216
Who?

1150
01:10:49,179 --> 01:10:50,430
Me.

1151
01:10:51,055 --> 01:10:52,620
(muffled shots)

1152
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:29,324
(gun hammer cocks)

1153
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,382
That was close.

1154
01:11:46,007 --> 01:11:47,050
Yeah.

1155
01:12:04,256 --> 01:12:06,341
(men speaking indistinctly)

1156
01:13:05,151 --> 01:13:06,506
Close.

1157
01:14:29,717 --> 01:14:32,428
THE BOSS: I hired you to do a job.

1158
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:36,077
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

1159
01:14:37,745 --> 01:14:43,585
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building...

1160
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:48,381
... and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job

1161
01:14:48,381 --> 01:14:50,779
is beginning to look very much

1162
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:52,656
like a job.

1163
01:15:01,519 --> 01:15:05,064
All right. Fuck it.

1164
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:11,113
If The Rabbi wants a war,
I'll give him a war.

1165
01:15:17,057 --> 01:15:19,038
(phone ringing)

1166
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:20,393
THE RABBI: Saul.

1167
01:15:22,792 --> 01:15:23,834
(phone ringing)

1168
01:15:23,834 --> 01:15:25,085
- (door opens)
- Saul?

1169
01:15:26,545 --> 01:15:29,152
Saul, the phone's been--

1170
01:15:29,152 --> 01:15:30,508
Oh!

1171
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:32,384
I thought you were Saul.

1172
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:38,536
A lot of people have been thinking
I'm somebody else these days.

1173
01:15:41,873 --> 01:15:44,584
Your predicament
reminds me of a story.

1174
01:15:44,584 --> 01:15:47,712
<i>Hitchcock. North by Northwest. </i>

1175
01:15:47,712 --> 01:15:50,528
The movie where everybody
thinks Cary Grant is

1176
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:51,883
a man named George Kaplan,

1177
01:15:51,987 --> 01:15:53,760
but the thing is there is
no George Kaplan.

1178
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,828
It's just a made-up name,
but names, even made-up ones...

1179
01:16:00,017 --> 01:16:02,207
... they can bring about
quite a bit of trouble.

1180
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:08,463
Now, the woman
in the picture with Grant,

1181
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:09,610
her name was, um...

1182
01:16:09,714 --> 01:16:10,966
Eva Marie Saint.

1183
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:12,113
Oh, you know this movie.

1184
01:16:12,113 --> 01:16:13,781
I know this movie.

1185
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:16,284
THE RABBI: Took my father
to see it in 1959.

1186
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:20,142
His English wasn't very good,
but, boy, did he like Miss Saint.

1187
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:22,957
After the movie, he turned to me
and he said, "She's a real Buick. "

1188
01:16:22,957 --> 01:16:26,502
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word "beauty, " so he'd say Buick.

1189
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:29,526
Caused quite a bit of confusion.

1190
01:16:29,943 --> 01:16:32,028
Using the wrong name will do that.

1191
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:37,242
Is that my money?

1192
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,953
This is everything I owe you.

1193
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:11,757
(phone ringing)

1194
01:17:13,738 --> 01:17:15,093
It's the Sabbath.

1195
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:18,326
You see, we don't answer the phone
on the Sabbath.

1196
01:17:18,327 --> 01:17:19,473
I know.

1197
01:17:20,515 --> 01:17:22,497
Normally, Saul turns off the ringer.

1198
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:23,644
Saul!

1199
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:26,250
I tell ya, you can't find
good help these days.

1200
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,274
(phone ringing)

1201
01:17:30,005 --> 01:17:31,048
Saul's dead.

1202
01:17:35,427 --> 01:17:36,887
They're all dead.

1203
01:17:45,646 --> 01:17:48,357
(groaning)

1204
01:18:01,495 --> 01:18:03,267
Oh, I've been in this room before.

1205
01:18:05,874 --> 01:18:08,064
Looks the same as it did
20 years ago.

1206
01:18:09,002 --> 01:18:13,486
Somehow... somehow
it seems different,

1207
01:18:13,487 --> 01:18:17,031
the way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

1208
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:21,307
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

1209
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,208
Two decades spent
behind three inches of bulletproof glass

1210
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:31,317
due to a natural fear of high-powered rifles
and quiet rooftops in New Jersey.

1211
01:18:31,318 --> 01:18:32,673
Twenty years...

1212
01:18:35,175 --> 01:18:38,512
... locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

1213
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:41,223
(coughs loudly)

1214
01:18:41,224 --> 01:18:44,143
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

1215
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:50,712
THE RABBI: Well, Anthony,
looks as though you've won,

1216
01:18:50,712 --> 01:18:52,589
if such a term may be applied.

1217
01:18:54,361 --> 01:18:57,489
If I were wearing a hat,
I would take it off.

1218
01:19:01,139 --> 01:19:02,807
Should we get on with it, then?

1219
01:19:08,752 --> 01:19:11,463
Then keep your hat on, Schlomo.

1220
01:19:16,155 --> 01:19:19,596
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

1221
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:23,871
Nice speech, though.

1222
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,753
THE BOSS: I wish I was standing for it.

1223
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,204
You-- you brought this upon our heads.

1224
01:19:46,498 --> 01:19:47,749
- Me?
- You.

1225
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:51,294
You hired Goodkat to kill my son.

1226
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,736
After you murdered my son.

1227
01:19:56,404 --> 01:19:57,864
I had no hand in that.

1228
01:19:57,865 --> 01:19:59,324
Oh, sure.

1229
01:19:59,324 --> 01:20:00,992
Just like in '84.

1230
01:20:01,618 --> 01:20:03,599
I suppose you had
no hand in that, either.

1231
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,893
Just a finger, maybe.

1232
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,438
Time's up, Rabbi.

1233
01:20:11,732 --> 01:20:15,173
Lying to a dead man is the same
as lying to yourself.

1234
01:20:18,718 --> 01:20:20,908
You were getting too big.

1235
01:20:22,889 --> 01:20:24,245
See...

1236
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:28,311
... problem when two men
are standing in a room

1237
01:20:28,312 --> 01:20:31,127
is you can only look at one of them,
and they were looking at you,

1238
01:20:31,128 --> 01:20:34,672
their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

1239
01:20:37,487 --> 01:20:39,051
Then they called you The Boss.

1240
01:20:41,763 --> 01:20:43,744
It was clear what had to be done.

1241
01:20:50,522 --> 01:20:53,337
Try and appreciate
how it feels, Schlomo.

1242
01:20:55,423 --> 01:20:59,594
To wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

1243
01:21:00,532 --> 01:21:03,452
Lying in a pool
of your own blood and shit.

1244
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:09,082
The dead eyes of your...

1245
01:21:12,523 --> 01:21:16,173
... of your wife staring back at you.

1246
01:21:19,197 --> 01:21:21,386
The only thing
keeping you from passing out

1247
01:21:21,386 --> 01:21:25,036
is the sound of the footsteps
of the man going down the hall...

1248
01:21:25,974 --> 01:21:27,643
... looking for your son.

1249
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:35,568
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

1250
01:21:37,028 --> 01:21:38,071
And now...

1251
01:21:39,947 --> 01:21:42,137
... after all these years...

1252
01:21:44,118 --> 01:21:46,621
... in spite of our agreement,

1253
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:52,460
you... you fucking
backstabbing Philistine,

1254
01:21:52,461 --> 01:21:54,963
you managed to
take my son away from me.

1255
01:21:56,318 --> 01:21:57,361
Well...

1256
01:21:59,446 --> 01:22:02,366
Now I've taken your son away from you.

1257
01:22:02,367 --> 01:22:03,408
I told you,

1258
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:05,807
I had nothing to do with--

1259
01:22:14,253 --> 01:22:15,504
You haven't heard.

1260
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,590
You are lying.

1261
01:22:18,737 --> 01:22:20,614
Look at my face, Schlomo.

1262
01:22:20,614 --> 01:22:22,595
Look at my smile.

1263
01:22:24,368 --> 01:22:25,828
Your son is dead.

1264
01:22:29,373 --> 01:22:31,250
Your son is dead.

1265
01:22:34,378 --> 01:22:36,255
I'm gonna kill you.

1266
01:22:37,089 --> 01:22:39,487
(laughs)

1267
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:40,634
SLEVIN: Rabbi.

1268
01:22:41,677 --> 01:22:43,971
Are you familiar with The Shmoo?

1269
01:22:55,962 --> 01:22:57,422
THE BOSS: Fisher.

1270
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,280
Fisher, listen to me.

1271
01:23:04,929 --> 01:23:06,390
I already told you...

1272
01:23:07,537 --> 01:23:08,893
I'm not Nick Fisher.

1273
01:23:14,732 --> 01:23:16,609
Then who is Nick Fisher?

1274
01:23:23,386 --> 01:23:25,680
<i>I think you mean
who was Nick Fisher.</i>

1275
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:29,225
Fisher was the answer to a question.

1276
01:23:29,955 --> 01:23:32,458
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

1277
01:23:39,965 --> 01:23:41,529
<i>SLEVIN:
You get them to come to you. </i>

1278
01:23:49,975 --> 01:23:52,686
<i>But to do that, I needed a name. </i>

1279
01:23:53,626 --> 01:23:55,503
And where do you find names?

1280
01:23:55,503 --> 01:23:56,754
<i>In books. </i>

1281
01:24:01,968 --> 01:24:03,740
<i>And who has books?</i>

1282
01:24:11,769 --> 01:24:13,750
<i>Well, your bookies have books. </i>

1283
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:16,565
MAN: He's clean.

1284
01:24:17,295 --> 01:24:19,172
<i>Crooked bookies. </i>

1285
01:24:19,902 --> 01:24:21,258
BOOKIE: So...

1286
01:24:21,259 --> 01:24:23,239
<i>Who work with big time crooks. </i>

1287
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,377
<i>I was looking for a gambler. </i>

1288
01:24:37,628 --> 01:24:39,192
<i>One who was in both books... </i>

1289
01:24:40,026 --> 01:24:42,426
<i>... with a lot of red in the minus column. </i>

1290
01:24:42,738 --> 01:24:43,781
Got him.

1291
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:45,554
<i>That's when I found Nick Fisher. </i>

1292
01:24:46,492 --> 01:24:49,308
<i>A lowlife that no one was gonna miss. </i>

1293
01:24:50,559 --> 01:24:53,061
- 1729.
- Nick Fisher.

1294
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:55,459
Okay.

1295
01:25:08,181 --> 01:25:09,640
GOODKAT: There was a time.

1296
01:25:26,741 --> 01:25:29,139
All that was left to do
was make the phone ring.

1297
01:25:49,473 --> 01:25:52,288
<i>SLEVIN: All I had to do
was pull the trigger</i>

1298
01:25:52,289 --> 01:25:55,938
<i>and wait for you to call the man
who does the jobs that no one else wants. </i>

1299
01:25:58,127 --> 01:26:00,213
THE BOSS:
I want an outsider brought in.

1300
01:26:01,777 --> 01:26:03,341
There's a specialist.

1301
01:26:06,156 --> 01:26:08,554
Calls himself Mr. Goodkat.

1302
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:12,412
(rings)

1303
01:26:14,289 --> 01:26:15,645
Fine.

1304
01:26:18,148 --> 01:26:20,338
Tell him he can expect me
in the morning.

1305
01:26:24,405 --> 01:26:26,073
You ready?

1306
01:26:27,011 --> 01:26:28,054
Yeah.

1307
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:33,789
There's just that one last thing.

1308
01:26:35,874 --> 01:26:36,917
Uhh!

1309
01:26:43,382 --> 01:26:44,946
THE BOSS: Mr. Goodkat...

1310
01:26:45,363 --> 01:26:47,136
It's been a long time.

1311
01:26:51,515 --> 01:26:53,600
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting, Mr. Goodkat,

1312
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,477
so I'll get right down to business.

1313
01:26:57,771 --> 01:27:02,359
Slim Hopkins, the man who
ran my book, was hit yesterday.

1314
01:27:03,089 --> 01:27:05,280
And I guess
you've already heard about...

1315
01:27:06,323 --> 01:27:07,678
... my son.

1316
01:27:07,678 --> 01:27:09,034
Yes, I heard.

1317
01:27:10,285 --> 01:27:12,579
I need you to sort it out for me.

1318
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:14,351
Who's the mark?

1319
01:27:14,351 --> 01:27:16,020
Yitzchok.

1320
01:27:19,044 --> 01:27:21,025
Yitzchok The Rabbi's son?

1321
01:27:21,025 --> 01:27:23,006
Remember The Rabbi?

1322
01:27:23,006 --> 01:27:24,987
I remember The Rabbi well.

1323
01:27:25,091 --> 01:27:26,447
The thing is...

1324
01:27:26,968 --> 01:27:29,679
... it can't look like a job.

1325
01:27:30,305 --> 01:27:33,746
If Yitzchok gets hit,
The Rabbi will go to war.

1326
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:40,628
So I need you to make it look
like it ain't what it is.

1327
01:27:41,566 --> 01:27:43,130
Can that be done?

1328
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,424
Anything can be done.

1329
01:27:47,718 --> 01:27:48,969
Good.

1330
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:50,533
How?

1331
01:27:50,533 --> 01:27:52,827
Kansas City Shuffle.

1332
01:27:54,705 --> 01:27:56,478
I'm not familiar with the term.

1333
01:27:59,293 --> 01:28:01,170
I'll need to see Slim's books.

1334
01:28:02,213 --> 01:28:04,507
Slim's books were taken
when he was hit,

1335
01:28:04,507 --> 01:28:07,218
but I do keep copies.

1336
01:28:11,389 --> 01:28:12,953
What are you looking for?

1337
01:28:17,123 --> 01:28:18,166
This is our guy.

1338
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:20,877
Nick, 1729.

1339
01:28:23,067 --> 01:28:24,527
Nick Fisher.

1340
01:28:24,527 --> 01:28:25,778
Why him?

1341
01:28:26,821 --> 01:28:28,072
A loser.

1342
01:28:29,219 --> 01:28:30,262
Pick him up.

1343
01:28:30,366 --> 01:28:31,617
Bring him here.

1344
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,732
MR. GOODKAT: Still not talking
to each other, huh?

1345
01:28:41,732 --> 01:28:43,192
Can't say that I blame you.

1346
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:45,695
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

1347
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:49,031
I was under the impression
you no longer work New York.

1348
01:28:49,031 --> 01:28:52,681
Like I said, very big job.

1349
01:28:52,681 --> 01:28:57,060
And you thought as long as you're in town,
you drop by, see your old pal Schlomo.

1350
01:28:57,061 --> 01:28:59,876
Say, "Hello! How 'bout them Yanks?"

1351
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:02,378
(laughs)

1352
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:03,421
No.

1353
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:05,298
But something like that.

1354
01:29:07,696 --> 01:29:09,051
Only problem

1355
01:29:09,051 --> 01:29:11,450
is you and I aren't old friends.

1356
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:12,805
And I hate baseball.

1357
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:14,265
And since we're not friends

1358
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:16,350
and you hate baseball,
why the fuck are you here?

1359
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:18,436
It's because we're not friends
that I'm here.

1360
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:23,754
Because if we had been friends,
I wouldn't have been hired to kill your son.

1361
01:29:23,755 --> 01:29:26,048
'Cause that is right
at the top of my list of things

1362
01:29:26,048 --> 01:29:27,716
that friends do not do to their friends.

1363
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:32,305
The good news for you
is my friendship is for sale.

1364
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:36,371
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

1365
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:37,935
than he does to The Boss dead,

1366
01:29:37,935 --> 01:29:40,751
and more money means more to me
than less money.

1367
01:29:40,751 --> 01:29:44,296
And you are the guy that sleeps
with all that green under your mattress.

1368
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:46,903
(whispers) I'm listening.

1369
01:29:47,737 --> 01:29:49,405
You will pay me double
to kill The Boss

1370
01:29:49,406 --> 01:29:51,595
what The Boss was
paying me to kill Yitzchok.

1371
01:29:54,202 --> 01:29:55,453
That...

1372
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,373
That will make us friends.

1373
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,145
Right, Rabbi?

1374
01:30:02,543 --> 01:30:04,003
Hmm?

1375
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:11,302
And since friends do favors for friends,

1376
01:30:11,303 --> 01:30:12,866
you'll do a favor for me.

1377
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:14,013
Pray tell.

1378
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:15,682
What is this favor?

1379
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:18,081
Concerns a matter of debt collection.

1380
01:30:18,081 --> 01:30:19,541
One debt in particular.

1381
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:21,000
Whose?

1382
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,669
A flop from Benny's book.

1383
01:30:22,773 --> 01:30:24,337
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

1384
01:30:24,337 --> 01:30:25,693
Who is he?

1385
01:30:26,214 --> 01:30:27,778
Just a loser.

1386
01:30:27,882 --> 01:30:29,968
You just made a lot of money.

1387
01:30:33,617 --> 01:30:36,328
And then I was free to come and go
as I pleased.

1388
01:30:50,822 --> 01:30:51,865
Hmm?

1389
01:30:51,969 --> 01:30:55,514
Whatever they're paying you.

1390
01:30:59,998 --> 01:31:01,040
(laughs)

1391
01:31:04,169 --> 01:31:05,525
There is no "they. "

1392
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:09,070
I did this to you.

1393
01:31:12,824 --> 01:31:14,075
- Me.
- You?

1394
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:15,639
Me.

1395
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:23,981
Who are you?

1396
01:31:27,318 --> 01:31:28,673
BRIKOWSKI: Who is he?

1397
01:31:29,612 --> 01:31:33,574
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say that it's unlikely we'll ever know.

1398
01:31:33,574 --> 01:31:35,555
What about dental records?

1399
01:31:35,555 --> 01:31:38,058
Sure. As soon as you find
the bottom half of the jaw.

1400
01:31:38,058 --> 01:31:40,769
Then all we need to do is find out
who the dentist was.

1401
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:44,210
What a fucking mess.

1402
01:31:45,357 --> 01:31:47,859
<i>MARTY: Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty.
You there?</i>

1403
01:31:47,859 --> 01:31:51,196
<i>We found two more bodies to go along
with the two you already got. </i>

1404
01:31:52,343 --> 01:31:53,595
All right, I'll be right over.

1405
01:31:54,221 --> 01:31:55,785
Did you ever get a hold of The Rabbi

1406
01:31:55,889 --> 01:31:58,496
so he could get down here
and identify what's left of his kid?

1407
01:31:58,497 --> 01:32:00,894
<i>Negative. We've been calling
for the last hour. </i>

1408
01:32:00,894 --> 01:32:01,937
<i>No answer. </i>

1409
01:32:01,937 --> 01:32:03,709
Send somebody over.

1410
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:04,856
<i>Copy. </i>

1411
01:32:06,837 --> 01:32:09,757
You all right?
You look a little shook up.

1412
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:11,321
No, I'm fine.

1413
01:32:12,259 --> 01:32:13,302
All right.

1414
01:32:28,317 --> 01:32:31,341
(phone rings)

1415
01:32:33,426 --> 01:32:36,033
(phone rings)

1416
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:38,431
Yeah.

1417
01:32:38,431 --> 01:32:40,726
<i>MAN: Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy. </i>

1418
01:32:40,726 --> 01:32:42,186
Hey, Murph.
What's up?

1419
01:32:42,186 --> 01:32:45,627
<i>Harry Kello came by today.
You remember Harry. </i>

1420
01:32:45,627 --> 01:32:47,608
Retired a few years ago,
his wife just died,

1421
01:32:47,608 --> 01:32:50,007
so he likes to come in
a couple times a week, talk shop,

1422
01:32:50,007 --> 01:32:51,571
tell bedtime stories to the rooks,

1423
01:32:51,675 --> 01:32:54,490
starts every sentence
with "the way things used to be. "

1424
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:55,429
Guy living in the past.

1425
01:32:55,533 --> 01:32:56,784
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about him?

1426
01:32:56,888 --> 01:33:00,121
Anyway, we're making small talk,
guy says he can't complain,

1427
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:01,893
then all he does is fucking complain.

1428
01:33:01,893 --> 01:33:03,353
<i>His dead wife, </i>

1429
01:33:03,457 --> 01:33:05,439
<i>the leg he got shot in,
his crappy pension, </i>

1430
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,984
but then he stops when he sees
the picture Marty snapped of your kid.

1431
01:33:08,985 --> 01:33:10,339
Just stares at it.

1432
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,320
I say, "What is it?
You know the kid?"

1433
01:33:13,155 --> 01:33:15,761
Thing is he ain't looking at the picture,
he's looking at the name,

1434
01:33:15,761 --> 01:33:17,534
'cause I got it written down
at the bottom.

1435
01:33:17,534 --> 01:33:19,515
He knows that name Slevin.

1436
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:41,413
I have that same phone.

1437
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:56,324
<i>MURPHY: About an hour later,
the phone rings. </i>

1438
01:33:56,324 --> 01:33:58,409
<i>It's Harry. He's talking like
a goddamned machine gun, </i>

1439
01:33:58,409 --> 01:34:01,016
going on and on
about a horserace back in '79.

1440
01:34:04,353 --> 01:34:05,917
SLEVIN: Aqueduct.

1441
01:34:06,959 --> 01:34:09,253
7 horse, tenth race.
Ring a bell?

1442
01:34:09,253 --> 01:34:11,860
(starting bell rings)

1443
01:34:16,866 --> 01:34:20,099
<i>MURPHY: It was
a drugstore handicap, big windup, </i>

1444
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:23,122
<i>around the time The Boss
and the Rabbi set up shop in New York, </i>

1445
01:34:23,122 --> 01:34:26,355
<i>before people started waking up
with knives in their backs. </i>

1446
01:34:26,356 --> 01:34:31,256
Anyway, he goes on
about this local legend about this kid.

1447
01:34:31,257 --> 01:34:33,237
His name was Max.

1448
01:34:33,862 --> 01:34:35,114
Come on, come on.

1449
01:34:35,739 --> 01:34:39,702
SLEVIN: Max placed a bet
with a bookie named Roth.

1450
01:34:39,703 --> 01:34:43,664
Roth laid the bet off... on you...

1451
01:34:53,778 --> 01:34:54,925
... and you.

1452
01:35:01,494 --> 01:35:04,415
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

1453
01:35:04,415 --> 01:35:06,709
well, they are the opposite of happy.

1454
01:35:06,709 --> 01:35:10,462
Word comes down
an example is to be made.

1455
01:35:11,401 --> 01:35:13,069
These guys kill everyone.

1456
01:35:13,174 --> 01:35:14,946
And I mean everyone.

1457
01:35:15,572 --> 01:35:19,013
Max, his wife, his kid, Roth.

1458
01:35:19,014 --> 01:35:20,890
Even the goddamn horse died.

1459
01:35:20,891 --> 01:35:22,454
These guys went to town
with a tomahawk.

1460
01:35:22,558 --> 01:35:24,122
It was a fuckin' massacre.

1461
01:35:25,999 --> 01:35:28,084
<i>They had to bring in a specialist
to do the kid</i>

1462
01:35:28,084 --> 01:35:29,961
<i>'cause nobody would take the job. </i>

1463
01:35:48,313 --> 01:35:50,815
What've you done with my son?

1464
01:36:06,978 --> 01:36:08,125
You?

1465
01:36:09,272 --> 01:36:10,941
No.

1466
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:12,713
You're dead.

1467
01:36:14,799 --> 01:36:16,258
THE BOSS: You're dead!

1468
01:36:23,245 --> 01:36:24,392
MURPHY: So, Harry's going on

1469
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:27,728
about how they had to bring in
a specialist to kill the kid,

1470
01:36:27,728 --> 01:36:29,084
but I ain't seeing the connection,
so I says,

1471
01:36:29,084 --> 01:36:31,691
"Harry, what does any of this
have to do with the case?"

1472
01:36:31,692 --> 01:36:33,984
<i>He says, "The horse's name. "</i>

1473
01:36:33,984 --> 01:36:36,383
<i>I say, "What about the horse's name?"</i>

1474
01:36:36,383 --> 01:36:40,972
<i>He says, "The horse's name
was Lucky Number Slevin. "</i>

1475
01:36:40,973 --> 01:36:41,910
What is your name?

1476
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:43,578
Slevin Kelevra.

1477
01:36:52,129 --> 01:36:54,006
You remember this part?

1478
01:37:04,537 --> 01:37:06,309
MAX: Please!

1479
01:37:06,309 --> 01:37:08,291
I have a family!

1480
01:37:08,292 --> 01:37:09,959
THE BOSS: Not anymore you don't.

1481
01:37:09,959 --> 01:37:11,002
MAX: Henry!

1482
01:37:13,817 --> 01:37:16,319
You fucking bastards!

1483
01:37:18,301 --> 01:37:21,116
You fucking bastard!

1484
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:25,183
(Max screaming)

1485
01:37:40,511 --> 01:37:42,805
The two of you
killed everything I ever loved.

1486
01:37:48,436 --> 01:37:49,687
Fuck you both.

1487
01:38:14,712 --> 01:38:20,135
<i>MURPHY: Now, there is no such person
as Slevin Kelevra, as far as I can tell, </i>

1488
01:38:20,136 --> 01:38:22,221
<i>which means the kid
was using a pseudonym, </i>

1489
01:38:22,221 --> 01:38:25,557
<i>which is kind of interesting,
him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

1490
01:38:25,558 --> 01:38:27,539
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

1491
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:30,875
seeing as how they had some involvement
with that very same horse.

1492
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:33,691
<i>I thought to myself, you know,
maybe it means something. </i>

1493
01:38:33,692 --> 01:38:38,174
<i>Then again, maybe it's just a coincidence.
Name gotta come from someplace, right?</i>

1494
01:38:38,696 --> 01:38:42,449
<i>I guess none of this really matters
now that the kid's gone cold. </i>

1495
01:38:47,663 --> 01:38:49,227
<i>Ah, one more thing. </i>

1496
01:38:49,227 --> 01:38:51,417
<i>We got a new guy in the precinct. </i>

1497
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:54,128
<i>Jewish fella--
funny little guy, talks a lot. </i>

1498
01:38:55,275 --> 01:39:00,801
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested,
he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew. </i>

1499
01:39:00,802 --> 01:39:02,886
<i>Says it means... </i>

1500
01:39:02,886 --> 01:39:03,929
Bad dog.

1501
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,253
BRIKOWSKI: Twenty years ago,
he used to be my bookie.

1502
01:39:14,357 --> 01:39:16,547
I used to send my paychecks
over to him.

1503
01:39:32,605 --> 01:39:34,064
Brikowski, you there?

1504
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:30,955
GOODKAT: Your girl made me.

1505
01:41:32,728 --> 01:41:34,396
She took my picture.

1506
01:41:36,273 --> 01:41:38,254
She's gotta go in the ground.

1507
01:41:40,444 --> 01:41:41,799
Okay.

1508
01:42:02,862 --> 01:42:05,052
(whispers) I have something
I have to tell you.

1509
01:42:07,658 --> 01:42:09,640
He told me that we needed to kill you.

1510
01:42:14,749 --> 01:42:16,523
You're gonna have to trust me.

1511
01:42:28,826 --> 01:42:30,808
Shit.

1512
01:42:32,997 --> 01:42:34,874
He's gonna shoot you here.

1513
01:43:33,058 --> 01:43:35,144
I didn't think you'd understand.

1514
01:43:52,349 --> 01:43:54,226
I'd have understood.

1515
01:43:58,919 --> 01:44:00,378
How'd you find out about us?

1516
01:44:01,213 --> 01:44:02,881
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

1517
01:44:03,819 --> 01:44:05,488
How do you think I found out?

1518
01:44:09,033 --> 01:44:10,910
I thought you might want this.

1519
01:44:50,846 --> 01:44:52,515
I wanna go home.

1520
01:44:52,515 --> 01:44:55,434
Neither of us is going home
for a long time, kid.

1521
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:00,961
My name is Goodkat.

1522
01:45:02,212 --> 01:45:03,985
You can call me Mr. Goodkat.
