2
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,718
Should we help him?

3
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,722
He's due in the lists in two minutes.
Two minutes or forfeit.

4
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:05,432
Lend us those.

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,435
Right. Left.

6
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,574
- Dead.
- Eh?

7
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,578
Three scores to none after two lances.

8
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:30,290
As long as Sir Ector doesn't
fall off his horse, we've won.

9
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:33,752
He's dead.

10
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,382
- What do you mean?
- His life's spark is covered in shite.

11
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:43,136
His spirit is gone
but his stench remains.

12
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:46,890
- Does that answer your question?
- No, no, no.

13
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,476
No, he sleeps. Rouse him.

14
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:52,729
I haven't eaten in three days!

15
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,272
None of us have!

16
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,776
- Let's fetch a priest.
- No, he's not dead!

17
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,071
You wake up! Come on!

18
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,156
Come on!

19
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,244
You manky git!

20
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,996
Roland.

21
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:16,169
Squire, Sir Ector must report
at once or forfeit the match.

22
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,505
He's on his way.

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,260
I haven't eaten in three days!

24
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:25,679
Three days! What did you eat, mate?!

25
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,515
If you wasn't dead, I would kill you!

26
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,642
I'll ride in his place.

27
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,063
Strip his armor.
I'm riding in his place.

28
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:39,401
Wat, stop kicking him!
I'm riding in his place. Help me.

29
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:41,611
What's your name, William?

30
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,992
William Thatcher, answer me
with your name.

31
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,995
It's not Sir William.

32
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,914
It's not Count or Duke or King William.

33
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:54,332
I know that.

34
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,711
You must be of noble birth to compete.

35
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,090
A detail. The landscape is food.
Do you want to eat or not?

36
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:06,595
If the nobles find out,
there'll be the devil to pay.

37
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:09,556
Then pray that they don't.

38
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,491
Visor.

39
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:53,285
Come on, we're late.

40
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:32,407
The score stands at three lances
to none in favor of Sir Ector.

41
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,534
Lord Philip of Aragon.

42
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,661
Stand ye ready?

43
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,000
Sir Ector. Stand ye ready?

44
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:44,085
Ready?

45
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,504
I tilted against Sir Ector many times.

46
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,549
In practice as his target.
You never struck him.

47
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,345
- Badger me not with details.
- The landscape. Stay on the horse.

48
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:57,265
He needs 3 points.
He has to knock you off the horse.

49
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,768
I know how to score, Roland.

50
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,396
I've waited my whole life
for this moment.

51
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,775
For Sir Ector to shite himself
to death?

52
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,107
Get it in the cradle. In the cradle.

53
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,692
Get it in the cradle!

54
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,756
William, are you alive?

55
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,217
- We won! We won!
- Can you hear me?

56
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:18,597
Get off me! William, can you hear me?

57
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:20,932
We won!

58
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,643
He's breathing. He's breathing!

59
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,813
Sir Ector.

60
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,821
Sir Ector. Remove your helmet.

61
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:42,996
My lord, the final blow of the lance
has bent it onto my head.

62
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,332
He says the final blow of the...

63
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,669
I present your champion, my lord.

64
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,197
Twenty.

65
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:18,657
No, 10.

66
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,368
- Fifteen.
- Done.

67
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,707
Very good. Cheers.

68
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:35,257
Fifteen silver florins.
He didn't want that.

69
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,259
That's five for William.

70
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,721
Five for Wat. Five for Roland,
who's going home to England.

71
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:45,475
Straight to the pub for me.
Eel pie, brie tart...

72
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:48,603
...tansy cakes with peppermint cream.

73
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,568
We could do this.

74
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:57,404
We've done it, boy.
That's silver in your hand.

75
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,283
No, I mean, we can do this.
We can be champions.

76
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,289
Give us your coins.

77
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,711
Give me your coins.

78
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:18,425
Now, that's one for you.

79
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,636
And one... for you.

80
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,556
Which leaves 13.

81
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:27,601
That's 13 for training
and outfitting.

82
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,770
The tournament in Rouen is in a month.

83
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:33,315
We could split a bigger prize.

84
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,486
In one month we'd be on our way
to glory and riches.

85
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:44,242
Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector.
William, I just want to go home.

86
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:48,997
Tansy cakes. Dilled veal balls.
I'll take my five now.

87
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,297
Oh, wait up.

88
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:59,925
You're going the wrong way!

89
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,677
You can't even joust.

90
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,681
Most of it is the guts to take a blow.
Guts I have.

91
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,310
And technique?
I have a month to learn that.

92
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:13,647
And name a man better
with a sword than I am.

93
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:17,442
- In the practice ring.
- You're not of noble birth.

94
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,194
So, we lie.

95
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,989
How did the nobles become noble
in the first place?

96
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:27,994
They took it at the tip of a sword.
I'll do it with a lance.

97
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,914
- A blunted lance.
- No matter, Wat.

98
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:36,044
A man can change his stars. I won't
spend the rest of my life as nothing.

99
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,049
That is nothing. And that's
where glory will take us.

100
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:45,679
We're peasants. Glory and riches
are beyond our grasp.

101
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:48,682
But a full stomach?
That dream can come true.

102
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,903
If you can take your coins,
go eat cake in England.

103
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,407
But if you can't, you come with me.

104
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,874
You see? Money doesn't matter.

105
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,306
See how hungry I am?!

106
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,725
- Do you?!
- Damn your stomach, Wat!

107
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:35,729
Roland, please.

108
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,777
With 13 silver pieces,
three men can change their stars.

109
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,079
God love you, William.

110
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:55,707
I know, I know. No one else will.

111
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,223
Unlucky.

112
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,267
- I think he's getting worse.
- He is getting worse.

113
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,116
Switch.

114
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,832
Switch.

115
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,294
Glory and riches. Glory and riches!

116
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,474
You see how dangerous it is?

117
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,312
Faster! Faster!
All right, use those legs!

118
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,315
Come on, Roland. Faster! Faster!

119
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,030
- You missed it.
- You've done it dozens of times.

120
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:12,325
Well, I guess that means
we should do it again.

121
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,996
Come on.

122
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:19,666
Come on, ponies.

123
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,167
Fong him.

124
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,883
Faster. Balance.

125
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,677
No, slower. Keep it steady.

126
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:36,224
I got it! Look, I got it!

127
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,489
Any minute now.

128
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,232
- Yes, better.
- Nice.

129
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,324
- It's my turn to ride.
- No.

130
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,244
We haven't reached the marker.
And you shouldn't.

131
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:41,540
How would it look if my squire rode
while I walked?

132
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:46,336
I don't give a witch's teat!
It's my turn! It's my turn!

133
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:51,216
Maybe nobody should ride.
The horse is not what he used to be.

134
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,010
Fine. Fine.

135
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,556
Morning.

136
00:14:58,557 --> 00:14:59,683
Morning.

137
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:01,351
Hoy, sir.

138
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,316
What are you doing?

139
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,069
Uh... trudging.

140
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,616
You know, trudging? To trudge?

141
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,327
To trudge the slow, weary...

142
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:23,456
...depressing, yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left...

143
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:27,294
...except the impulse to simply
soldier on.

144
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,421
Were you robbed?

145
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,632
Interesting question. Yes.

146
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:35,635
And at the same time,
a huge, resounding, "No."

147
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:40,181
It's more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty, really.

148
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,977
But on the brighter side,
trudging does represent pride.

149
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:47,981
Pride, resolve and faith
in the good Lord Almighty.

150
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,026
Please, Christ, rescue me
from my current...

151
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,154
...tribulations.

152
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,240
Who are you?

153
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,661
Lilium inter spinas.

154
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,206
The lily among the thorns.

155
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,167
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.
Writing's the game.

156
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,425
Chaucer?

157
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:18,428
Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer?

158
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:25,101
- A what?
- "A what?" A writer.

159
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:30,440
I write with ink and parchment.
For a penny, I'll scribble anything.

160
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,111
Summonses, decrees, edicts,
warrants, patents of nobility.

161
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,115
I've been known to jot down
a poem, if the muse descends.

162
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,369
You probably read my book,
The Book of the Duchess.

163
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:46,998
Well, it was allegorical.

164
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:51,211
We won't hold it against you.
Each man decides that for himself.

165
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:54,548
Did you say patents of nobility?

166
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,718
That's right. I did.

167
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,807
And you gentlemen are?

168
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,562
I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

169
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:14,359
These are my faithful squires,
Delves of Dodgington...

170
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:17,904
...and Fowlehurst of Crewe.

171
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:21,366
I'm Richard the Lionheart.
A pleasure.

172
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,952
No, I'm Charlemagne!
John the Baptist!

173
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,537
All right!

174
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,498
Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it.

175
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,336
Now you see that, I do believe...

176
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:35,171
...Sir Ulrich.

177
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:39,467
Thank you, Geoff.

178
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:45,932
Have you any more to say, Master Nude,
or may we be on our way?

179
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,853
- Off to the tournament?
- This is the road to Rouen.

180
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:54,983
That remains to be seen.
They're limiting the field at Rouen.

181
00:17:55,525 --> 00:18:00,530
Noble birth must be established
for four generations on either side.

182
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:04,159
Patents of nobility must be provided.

183
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:15,378
Listen, clothe me...

184
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:20,383
...shoe me, for God's sake, feed me
and you'll have your patents.

185
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,094
No.

186
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,390
- Patents of nobility.
- We need him. We need him.

187
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:30,644
- Let me handle it.
- Be nice.

188
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:37,234
Nice, nice, nice.

189
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:39,611
All right.

190
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:45,575
Betray us and I will fong you
until your insides are out...

191
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:50,580
...your outsides are in and your
entrails are your extrails.

192
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:57,837
Pain.

193
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:00,924
Lots of pain.

194
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,980
I present Sir Ulrich, whose mother's
father was Shilhard von Rechberg...

195
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,026
...son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,
son of Ghibellines, son of Wendish.

196
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:23,363
- Wendish inherited the fief...
- That'll do, herald.

197
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:27,492
Six generations is more than enough.
Show me the patents.

198
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:41,256
Indicate in which events
shall your Lord Ulrich compete.

199
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:47,971
He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer.

200
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:50,307
Thank you very much.

201
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,486
I can't believe it.
You did it, Chaucer.

202
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,615
I thank you. I didn't think
we had a chance.

203
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,370
My pleasure, William.

204
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,998
If you don't mind, I'll stick around.

205
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,876
Be my herald, you'll
get part of the winnings.

206
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:22,380
Done. Now if you don't mind,
I have to see a man about a dog.

207
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:28,553
Walking out from Cheapside

208
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,890
My fortunes for to seek

209
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,268
I passed along the River Thames

210
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,605
Its waters did they reek

211
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,984
'Twas there I met a pretty lass

212
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:46,238
She said her name was Nell

213
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,086
Bell or hell rhymes with Nell.

214
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,145
Would you speak to me?

215
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:03,356
Ah, to speak.

216
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:08,320
Sir, my sex are marked
by their silence.

217
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:11,364
I would hear you speak
if it cost me my ears.

218
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:14,701
That is well, for I do not
want silence in my life.

219
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:16,870
Tell me your name.

220
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:22,626
- Would you care if I were ugly?
- Yes!

221
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:26,046
I mean, no. I mean...

222
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:29,216
You desecrate the house of God!

223
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:45,941
Tell me your name.

224
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,237
And what would you do
with my name, Sir Hunter?

225
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:53,532
Call me a fox, for
that is all I am to you.

226
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:59,538
Then a fox you shall be until
I find your name, my foxy lady.

227
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,212
He's a handsome hunter.
I give him that.

228
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:10,215
Does this not shock you, ladies?

229
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,760
Certainly, my lord.

230
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:18,390
I only laugh just
to keep from weeping.

231
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,727
Beauty is such a curse.

232
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:26,189
Pray your years come swiftly.

233
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:29,484
Pray your beauty fades
so you may better serve God.

234
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:33,822
Oh, I do, my lord. I pray for it all
the time.

235
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,577
Why, God, did you curse me
with this face?

236
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:43,748
God's will has a purpose,
but we may not know it.

237
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:49,671
Well, that is lovely.

238
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,705
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein...

239
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:29,377
...defeats Roger Lord Mortimer
one lance to none.

240
00:24:31,796 --> 00:24:34,799
Easy. They'll think I
never broke a lance before.

241
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:39,512
- But you haven't!
- Ulrich's broken thousands of lances.

242
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:42,599
Come on. You're due
in the sword ring.

243
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:44,643
My armor's loose.

244
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:55,529
Shite. I can't block an overhead.

245
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:59,407
We can't fix it now.
We're overdue in the sword ring.

246
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:03,954
It was a mistake to do two events.
I'm too hurried.

247
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:07,791
- I'll withdraw from the sword.
- Sword's what you're best at.

248
00:25:08,124 --> 00:25:11,503
But the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust.

249
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:14,965
Ulrich von Lichtenstein?
I am Simon the Summoner.

250
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:18,260
I'm overdue at the sword ring.

251
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:22,472
I must detain you
on behalf of your herald.

252
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:24,975
You were never robbed.

253
00:25:28,186 --> 00:25:30,397
I have a gambling problem.

254
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:33,316
I can't help myself.

255
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,528
And these people will...

256
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:40,115
...literally take the clothes
off your back.

257
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:43,493
What are we supposed to do?

258
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:48,206
He assured us that you,
his liege, would pay us.

259
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:53,837
And who are you?

260
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:57,173
Peter, a humble pardoner...

261
00:25:57,549 --> 00:25:59,926
...and purveyor of religious relics.

262
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:02,804
How much does he owe?

263
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,932
Ten gold florins.

264
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:08,935
You manky git!

265
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:13,398
- Pain! Pain! Take the pain!
- Get him off me!

266
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,483
Wat, let him go!

267
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:28,747
What would you do to him
if I was to refuse?

268
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:33,919
We, on behalf of the Lord God...

269
00:26:34,252 --> 00:26:38,882
...will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand...

270
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:41,593
...that gambling is a sin.

271
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:46,598
Oh, come on.

272
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,934
Please, Will.

273
00:26:52,395 --> 00:26:55,232
Please, will you help me,
Sir Ulrich?

274
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:59,069
I promise you won't regret it.

275
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:03,490
I don't have the money.

276
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:10,455
Release him...

277
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:13,917
...and give him back his clothes.

278
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,462
And you'll get it.

279
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:18,964
Done.

280
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:24,594
You lied.

281
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,641
Yes, I lied. I'm a writer.
I give the truth scope!

282
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,937
Behold my Lord
Ulrich von Lichtenstein, son of...

283
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:36,815
- Too late. He's been announced.
- Fine.

284
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:40,694
Ten blows by sword.
Sir Ulrich to receive first.

285
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:48,618
Strike!

286
00:27:57,586 --> 00:27:58,712
Strike!

287
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,297
Stop letting him hit you!

288
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:02,507
Shut up! Shut up!

289
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:07,137
Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring!

290
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,639
Sir Ulrich to strike!

291
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:12,183
- Now it's your turn!
- Come on!

292
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:27,032
Strike!

293
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,036
I taught him that!
That's me!

294
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:35,040
Sir Ulrich prevails,
five strikes to two!

295
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,792
Yes!

296
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:42,839
Behold my Lord Ulrich!
The rock! The hard place!

297
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:46,009
Like a wind from Gelderland,
he sweeps by!

298
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:50,347
Blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor!

299
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,060
We walk in the garden
of his turbulence!

300
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:03,652
Yeah!

301
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:32,657
- You're champion.
- Of the sword.

302
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:35,160
Isn't that why we're here? Come on.

303
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:38,788
Do you want to touch him?
Do you want to touch him?

304
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:57,098
We should've saved
for the blacksmith.

305
00:30:58,308 --> 00:30:59,684
I can't pay you now...

306
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:03,480
...but I promise I will, just as...
- No! Money.

307
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:11,488
- Excuse me.
- Cash first, not promises.

308
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,782
Go on.

309
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,536
Excuse me, sir.

310
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:20,830
You might try the farris.

311
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:23,500
A woman?

312
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,878
Beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

313
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:31,049
Thank you.

314
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:35,303
- Excuse me.
- I don't work for free.

315
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:39,724
- I can't joust with broken armor.
- That's your problem, not mine.

316
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:43,645
Each drop of this sweat
has a price on it.

317
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:49,901
Just as well. They told me
I was daft to even ask.

318
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:54,030
- Who?
- The other armorers.

319
00:31:57,325 --> 00:32:00,120
Did they say I couldn't do it
because I'm a woman?

320
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:03,665
They said you're good
with horseshoes, not armor.

321
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:06,293
No one mentioned you being a woman.

322
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,048
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

323
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,551
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

324
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:33,945
Lady, I will win
this tournament for you.

325
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:36,156
Nay! I will win for you.

326
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:38,158
May I present Count Adhemar...

327
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:42,245
...winner of the joust in France
and champion at Saint-Emilion.

328
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:49,920
All forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in Christendom.

329
00:32:55,258 --> 00:33:00,263
Do you only pretend to fight, Count
Adhemar, or wage real war as well?

330
00:33:01,264 --> 00:33:06,102
I am leader of the free companies.
My army is in southern France.

331
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:11,149
Geoff, 'tis my lady.

332
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:15,946
- William, you aim too high.
- I don't know any other way to aim.

333
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,491
- Concentrate.
- What should I say to her?

334
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,834
What do you think of the joust?

335
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:32,337
It's very abrupt.

336
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:35,507
And I don't understand the rules.

337
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,176
Then I shall educate you.

338
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:42,013
A match is three lances.

339
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:47,978
One point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck.

340
00:33:48,186 --> 00:33:51,356
Two points for breaking on the helmet.
It's difficult.

341
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,694
The helmet sweeps back.
Most blows glance off.

342
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:59,614
Three points for bearing a rider
to the ground.

343
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:03,201
Also, if you bear a rider
to the ground, you win his horse.

344
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:05,871
Do men die in the joust?

345
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:09,666
Lance points are tipped
with coronals, which blunts them.

346
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,044
Of course, accidents happen.

347
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:17,424
I myself, Jocelyn,
have never been unhorsed.

348
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,218
Nor have I.

349
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:24,306
Your name, lady.

350
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:26,683
I still need to hear it.

351
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,811
Sir Hunter, you persist.

352
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:33,940
Perhaps angels have no names.
Only beautiful faces.

353
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,653
And you are?

354
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:41,239
I am, um...

355
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,782
Have you forgotten?

356
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:44,910
Or your name is Sir "Um."

357
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:49,581
Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

358
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:52,459
I'd forget as well. What a mouthful.

359
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:55,837
- Your armor, sir.
- What about it?

360
00:34:56,254 --> 00:35:01,092
How stylish of you to wear an antique.
You'll start a new fashion if you win.

361
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:04,804
My grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again.

362
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,266
And a shield. How quaint.

363
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:23,031
Some of these poor country knights,
little better than peasants.

364
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:25,659
- The second son...

365
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:29,621
...of Sir Wallace Percival,
third Earl of Warwick.

366
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:32,624
My lords, my ladies...

367
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:36,461
...it is with honor
I introduce my liege...

368
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:38,964
...Sir Thomas Colville.

369
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,806
You're good.

370
00:35:48,974 --> 00:35:50,475
You're very good.

371
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:53,311
My lords...

372
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,522
...my ladies...

373
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:02,863
...and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion...

374
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:11,663
...today...

375
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,417
...you find yourselves equals.

376
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:26,511
For you are all equally blessed.

377
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:30,015
For I have the pride...

378
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:33,185
...the privilege, nay, the pleasure...

379
00:36:34,186 --> 00:36:38,523
...of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights.

380
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:42,277
A knight who can trace
his lineage back...

381
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:45,197
...beyond Charlemagne.

382
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,992
I first met him...

383
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,453
...atop a mountain near Jerusalem...

384
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:53,872
...praying to God...

385
00:36:54,372 --> 00:36:57,709
...asking his forgiveness
for the Saracen blood...

386
00:36:58,043 --> 00:36:59,961
...spilt by his sword.

387
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:03,340
Next, he amazed me
still further in Italy...

388
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:05,759
...when he saved a fatherless
beauty...

389
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:09,638
...from the would-be ravishings
of her dreadful uncle.

390
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,897
In Greece...

391
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:22,609
...he spent a year in silence...

392
00:37:24,402 --> 00:37:27,572
...just to better understand
the sound...

393
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,743
...of a whisper.

394
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:41,920
So without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado...

395
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:44,923
...I give to you
the Seeker of Serenity...

396
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:47,926
...Protector of Italian Virginity...

397
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,098
...the Enforcer of our Lord God,
the one, the only...

398
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:57,435
...Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

399
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:13,952
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll be here all week.

400
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:22,294
That was different.

401
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:24,671
It's time we celebrated
our differences.

402
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,882
Just maybe not in public.

403
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:28,967
You...

404
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:32,971
Yes, I'm well aware
a good fonging is on the way.

405
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:35,140
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

406
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:38,602
I got their attention.
You win their hearts.

407
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:01,166
Very good.

408
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:03,335
- Was she watching? Geoff.
- What?

409
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,712
- Did she see me?
- Yes, she did.

410
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:08,173
- Did she see me take the hit?
- Yes.

411
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:11,426
- Was she concerned?
- Her eyes welled up. Just awful.

412
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:30,195
Colville has perfect technique.
I've never seen him before.

413
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:31,863
Nor I.

414
00:39:32,197 --> 00:39:34,115
But this Lichtenstein.

415
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:37,494
His technique, rudimentary.
Style, nonexistent.

416
00:39:37,702 --> 00:39:40,247
Still, he's fearless.

417
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,583
Fearless? How so?

418
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:47,754
The slit in the visor is narrow,
but splinters can penetrate it.

419
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:51,007
Most knights raise their chins
at the last instant.

420
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:56,221
You lose sight of your opponent, but
protect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't.

421
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,099
He keeps his eye on the target.

422
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,893
A true hunter.

423
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:13,446
Sir Ulrich...

424
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,241
...l'm through.

425
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:20,787
But I've never not finished before.

426
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,125
I wish to keep my honor intact.

427
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:52,777
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

428
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:05,123
Colville withdraws. Ulrich advances.

429
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:08,293
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

430
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:10,837
He shows mercy.

431
00:41:12,631 --> 00:41:16,801
Then he shows his weakness.
That's all mercy is.

432
00:41:21,556 --> 00:41:24,643
For the love of victory, William,
go to sleep.

433
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:29,147
I can't.

434
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:34,319
Love has given me wings,
so I must fly.

435
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,740
I can't explain it.

436
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:44,371
- She makes me feel like a poet.
- You may feel like a poet...

437
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,248
...but you sound like an idiot.

438
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:49,376
- You don't even know her name.
- Her name?

439
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:53,547
Her name is Aphrodite.

440
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:57,509
Calypso. Venus. Take your pick.

441
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,558
Women weaken the heart.

442
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,687
Without your heart, you cannot win.

443
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:14,776
- But her eyes...
- Concentrate.

444
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:16,570
Tansy cakes!

445
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:21,741
Count Adhemar sends word.

446
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:26,204
He said he will win
this tournament for you.

447
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,251
He's won many. He wins them
for himself and his own honor.

448
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:33,879
It's nothing to say
he wins them for me.

449
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:38,049
He wishes to speak to you again.

450
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:40,677
Not to hear a word I say.

451
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:44,306
Adhemar wants his women silent.

452
00:42:50,061 --> 00:42:53,315
Would you have Sir Ulrich
win the tournament for you?

453
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:54,900
No.

454
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:59,404
And he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so.

455
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:03,950
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

456
00:43:04,743 --> 00:43:07,245
I would have him win my heart.

457
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:19,591
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

458
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:25,430
Oh, lovely.

459
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:29,976
I don't think I've ever seen
Count Adhemar lose.

460
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:33,438
No, but defeat him
and you'll see it firsthand.

461
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:36,608
My liege.

462
00:43:38,276 --> 00:43:39,778
Sir Ulrich.

463
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,156
Christiana.

464
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:47,786
- My lady bids you wear this token.
- Of course.

465
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:51,122
She also said to tell you, her name...

466
00:43:53,124 --> 00:43:54,960
...is Jocelyn.

467
00:43:57,712 --> 00:43:59,214
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

468
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:02,384
Oh, Jocelyn.

469
00:44:05,804 --> 00:44:07,472
Concentrate.

470
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:31,556
I can't breathe.

471
00:45:39,397 --> 00:45:41,274
No style whatsoever.

472
00:45:42,734 --> 00:45:44,569
But neither has an anvil.

473
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,908
- He hits like a hammer. Amazing.
- But not perfect. He aims high.

474
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:52,911
Roll your shoulder back,
his blow may go right.

475
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:56,164
But if he strikes to my left,
I'll be obliterated.

476
00:45:56,706 --> 00:45:58,500
I didn't say it wasn't a gamble.

477
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:42,836
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

478
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:35,680
William?

479
00:47:43,522 --> 00:47:45,023
William, here.

480
00:47:46,525 --> 00:47:47,859
Come here.

481
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,371
Someday I'll be a knight.

482
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:03,208
A thatcher's son? A knight?

483
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:06,378
You might as well try
to change the stars.

484
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:10,090
Can it be done, Father?

485
00:48:10,382 --> 00:48:13,885
- Can a man change the stars?
- Yes, William.

486
00:48:14,177 --> 00:48:17,138
If he believes enough,
a man can do anything.

487
00:48:36,908 --> 00:48:38,285
Come here.

488
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,253
Gain more bearing, Ulrich.

489
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:50,964
See me again when you're worthy.

490
00:48:56,303 --> 00:48:58,138
I'll fong you in the arse!

491
00:48:59,431 --> 00:49:02,142
Well done, my lord! Well done.

492
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:04,728
- You bastard!
- Go and see to Ulrich.

493
00:49:04,936 --> 00:49:06,771
Go see to Ulrich.

494
00:49:10,483 --> 00:49:12,110
Well done, my lord.

495
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:14,279
A noble victory.

496
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:22,996
My lady, I believe this is yours.

497
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:31,963
For long spear on foot...

498
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,841
...Pandolfo Malatesta.

499
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:44,351
For sword on foot,
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

500
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:53,818
Finally, for the mounted joust
and tournament champion...

501
00:49:54,152 --> 00:49:56,988
...Adhemar, Count of Anjou.

502
00:49:58,657 --> 00:50:01,535
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

503
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:08,208
I present to you your champions.

504
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:17,676
Next time, you will look up
at me from the flat of your back.

505
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:21,930
Please. You have been weighed,
you have been measured...

506
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,182
...and you have been found wanting.

507
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,150
Keep winning the sword.

508
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,778
- I won't compete in it.
- It's your best.

509
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,698
No. It's tournament champion
or nothing at all.

510
00:50:45,203 --> 00:50:47,747
Ten florins. That should do.

511
00:50:50,584 --> 00:50:54,212
Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.
Do you feel lucky?

512
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:58,717
- Have you enough clothes?
- Be gone. I'm done with you.

513
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:02,095
Except to exact my revenge.

514
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:08,059
What on earth could you
possibly do to us?

515
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:10,729
I will eviscerate you in fiction.

516
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:14,399
Every last pimple,
every last character flaw.

517
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:19,112
I was naked for a day.
You will be naked for eternity.

518
00:51:19,905 --> 00:51:22,407
I have a feeling we shall meet again.

519
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:27,913
Here, farris, take what we owe you.

520
00:51:28,914 --> 00:51:33,084
The armor you wear, it wasn't
made for you, was it?

521
00:51:34,169 --> 00:51:35,629
So, what of it?

522
00:51:35,795 --> 00:51:38,757
I could make armor you wouldn't
even know you wore it.

523
00:51:39,007 --> 00:51:40,342
What's the cost?

524
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:44,137
Just take me as far as Paris.

525
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,058
We travel alone.
Take your gold and go.

526
00:51:56,483 --> 00:52:00,946
- Get what you can. Let's pack.
- Why are we leaving so soon?

527
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:06,284
The next tournament is in a week.
We can walk now and save the horse.

528
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,038
You must go to the banquet.
You'll dance and make an appearance.

529
00:52:10,288 --> 00:52:12,457
Let Adhemar laugh at me again?
No!

530
00:52:12,707 --> 00:52:14,709
- Yes!
- No!

531
00:52:20,966 --> 00:52:24,511
My lady would know the color
of your lord's tunic tonight.

532
00:52:25,136 --> 00:52:29,307
- His tunic?
- Yes, so she can dress to match him.

533
00:52:29,683 --> 00:52:33,228
We regret to inform your lady
he won't be attending...

534
00:52:33,478 --> 00:52:37,023
- Herald, do not give my answers!
- Yes, my lord.

535
00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:38,817
Squire, answer her.

536
00:52:39,192 --> 00:52:42,821
What color is my tunic tonight?

537
00:52:46,992 --> 00:52:48,368
Green.

538
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:52,247
Trimmed in a kind of...

539
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,332
...pale green...

540
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:57,502
...with...

541
00:52:57,878 --> 00:53:00,005
...uh, wooden toggles.

542
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:03,508
I will tell my lady.

543
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,810
- This is a disaster!
- No, it'll tunic up quite nicely.

544
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:16,021
That's not a disaster, Roland.

545
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,526
I don't know how to dance.

546
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:27,699
And one and two and three and four.

547
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:31,369
Your hand should be light,
like a birdie on a branch.

548
00:53:31,703 --> 00:53:35,207
And one, two and three and four.

549
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,710
And Wat doesn't lead,
he follows like a girl.

550
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,890
And one and two and...

551
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:53,892
...twirly, twirly, twirly.

552
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:57,395
And one and two, and you're
still getting it wrong.

553
00:53:57,729 --> 00:54:01,441
And one and two
and three and four.

554
00:54:01,775 --> 00:54:05,070
You can hit me all day
because you punch like a what?

555
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,613
A girl.

556
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:08,907
- Enough!
- Get back! Wat, quiet!

557
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:11,409
- He starts it.
- You know he's touchy!

558
00:54:13,954 --> 00:54:15,956
Oh, and you can do better?

559
00:54:16,414 --> 00:54:19,292
- Of course.
- Then show us.

560
00:54:20,377 --> 00:54:21,920
No.

561
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:28,176
If I'm making all this effort,
you'd best ask her nicely.

562
00:54:32,764 --> 00:54:33,890
I'm sorry, Kate.

563
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:42,107
I was wondering if you'd care
to show us how to dance.

564
00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:44,401
- Please.
- Please.

565
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:51,283
And one and two, three and four.

566
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:54,661
Five, six, seven, change partners.

567
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:58,290
And one, two, three, four...

568
00:54:58,623 --> 00:55:01,084
...five, six, seven.

569
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:03,169
Polonaise. And one...

570
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:06,464
Are you wearing your hair like that?

571
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:09,301
Is there another way?

572
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:42,334
Sir Ulrich, you look fantastic.

573
00:55:45,337 --> 00:55:47,464
Jocelyn, you look...

574
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,384
Uh, you...

575
00:55:54,804 --> 00:55:56,306
...remind me of the Bible.

576
00:56:01,978 --> 00:56:06,358
When God stopped the sun to give
Joshua time to defeat the Amorites.

577
00:56:10,028 --> 00:56:11,363
I don't understand.

578
00:56:16,368 --> 00:56:19,079
If I could ask God one thing...

579
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:21,998
...it would be to stop the moon.

580
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:26,753
Stop the moon and make this night...

581
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:29,714
...and your beauty...

582
00:56:30,382 --> 00:56:32,092
...last forever.

583
00:56:34,219 --> 00:56:37,556
What dance will you have? A coranto?

584
00:56:38,557 --> 00:56:40,559
Or a basse dance?

585
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,103
Sir Ulrich.

586
00:56:44,896 --> 00:56:48,024
Why don't you show us a dance
of your country?

587
00:56:48,775 --> 00:56:51,069
Show us a dance of Gelderland.

588
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:55,240
Yes. Gelderland.

589
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:02,247
Well, it's a lot like the farandole...

590
00:57:03,582 --> 00:57:06,418
...but with some differences.

591
00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:09,588
Well, you bow.

592
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:15,468
And...

593
00:57:27,606 --> 00:57:28,773
...and...

594
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:44,956
Places. Places.

595
01:00:54,646 --> 01:00:55,814
What?

596
01:00:57,148 --> 01:01:02,487
- I don't know. Too small, too light.
- He'll be crushed. Killed.

597
01:01:02,821 --> 01:01:07,450
No. I found a new way to heat steel.
It's thinner, smaller...

598
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:09,327
...but just as strong.

599
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:10,787
What are these?

600
01:01:11,162 --> 01:01:14,833
The marks of my trade should
another knight admire the armor.

601
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:20,672
Twist and bend. Feel the movement.

602
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:25,677
- But eventually I will be struck.
- And then death.

603
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:29,055
Do you at least have the courage
to test it?

604
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:39,482
You okay?

605
01:01:41,026 --> 01:01:42,694
I didn't feel a thing.

606
01:02:09,763 --> 01:02:12,724
- Who's that knight?
- Piers Courtenay.

607
01:02:13,016 --> 01:02:17,229
He's raised taxes on his land 3 times
this year to pay for tournament.

608
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:20,273
His people starve while
he sits at banquet.

609
01:02:23,985 --> 01:02:25,695
It's probably true.

610
01:02:59,771 --> 01:03:03,066
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

611
01:03:03,608 --> 01:03:06,236
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

612
01:03:07,654 --> 01:03:09,239
The Count Adhemar...

613
01:03:09,906 --> 01:03:11,950
...son of Philippe de Vitry...

614
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:14,452
...son of Gilles...

615
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:16,913
...master of the free companies...

616
01:03:17,497 --> 01:03:20,375
...defender of his enormous manhood...

617
01:03:21,084 --> 01:03:23,628
...a shining example of chivalry...

618
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,797
...and champagne.

619
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,803
Nice work!

620
01:03:33,263 --> 01:03:34,598
Bravo!

621
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:41,229
Watch every move Adhemar makes.
We'll find a weakness.

622
01:03:41,438 --> 01:03:43,106
Well, Colville looks fit.

623
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,608
- My liege...

624
01:03:44,816 --> 01:03:47,611
...the second son of
Sir Wallace Percival.

625
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:50,614
It is my deepest honor...

626
01:03:54,117 --> 01:03:56,369
My deepest honor to present to you...

627
01:03:57,162 --> 01:04:00,123
It's Edward, my lord.
They're sure of it.

628
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:06,630
- The illustrious Sir Thomas Colville!

629
01:04:22,479 --> 01:04:24,147
Adhemar withdrew.

630
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:27,025
To withdraw like that means one thing.

631
01:04:28,193 --> 01:04:29,319
Royalty.

632
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:41,706
I'll see what I can find out.

633
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,210
Prepare to drop the flag.

634
01:04:45,418 --> 01:04:48,255
No, no. Not yet. Wait, listen.

635
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:50,173
Musicians, announce.

636
01:04:50,423 --> 01:04:53,885
- I must speak with my lord.
- Then go.

637
01:04:54,135 --> 01:04:56,680
See if you can beat the Second Coming.

638
01:04:57,681 --> 01:04:59,349
Wait! Wait!

639
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:05,564
Colville is Edward, the Black
Prince, future king of England.

640
01:05:05,897 --> 01:05:08,191
He's in disguise like me
so he can compete.

641
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,195
He's never met an enemy without
victory or town he couldn't defeat.

642
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:14,447
We're English! We know who he is!

643
01:05:14,698 --> 01:05:18,076
- You must withdraw. Tell them, Geoff.
- Absolutely!

644
01:05:18,326 --> 01:05:19,244
The lance.

645
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:28,044
Give me the lance.

646
01:05:35,552 --> 01:05:36,720
Lance!

647
01:05:50,901 --> 01:05:53,069
Oh, my giddy aunt.

648
01:05:57,407 --> 01:05:59,951
The match is a draw.

649
01:06:03,121 --> 01:06:05,665
You mad? You endanger
a royal family member.

650
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:08,126
He endangers himself.

651
01:06:08,919 --> 01:06:11,421
Well fought, Sir Ulrich, as in Rouen.

652
01:06:13,423 --> 01:06:15,175
You also, Prince Edward.

653
01:06:20,514 --> 01:06:22,766
- You knew me?
- Yeah.

654
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:27,979
And still you rode?

655
01:06:29,147 --> 01:06:33,151
- It's not in me to withdraw.
- No. Nor me.

656
01:06:35,695 --> 01:06:37,405
Though it happens.

657
01:06:39,783 --> 01:06:41,493
Yes, it does.

658
01:06:43,453 --> 01:06:46,623
- Good luck to you.
- You also.

659
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:53,338
The winner of the mounted joust and
tournament champion...

660
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,882
...Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

661
01:07:01,972 --> 01:07:05,308
- Melt it, sell it, do whatever you do.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

662
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,768
You're champion!

663
01:07:06,977 --> 01:07:10,021
I'm not champion until
I defeat Adhemar. He withdrew.

664
01:07:10,313 --> 01:07:11,648
Sir Ulrich.

665
01:07:12,983 --> 01:07:16,820
- Tell me what you'll wear tonight.
- Nothing.

666
01:07:17,195 --> 01:07:19,990
We'll cause a sensation,
for I'll dress to match.

667
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,784
Don't you get tired
of putting on clothes?

668
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:25,495
She's talking about taking them off.

669
01:07:27,372 --> 01:07:30,333
A flower is only as good
as its petals, no?

670
01:07:30,709 --> 01:07:32,335
A flower is good for nothing.

671
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:36,047
Really?

672
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,885
You can't eat a flower.
It doesn't keep you warm.

673
01:07:40,135 --> 01:07:43,597
And a rose never knocked
a man off a horse either, did it?

674
01:07:45,932 --> 01:07:48,643
You're just a silly girl, aren't you?

675
01:07:51,855 --> 01:07:56,735
Better a silly girl with a flower than
a silly boy with a horse and stick.

676
01:08:01,364 --> 01:08:02,699
Goodbye.

677
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:08,872
It's called a lance.

678
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:10,707
Hello.

679
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:43,907
- I have word.
- What?

680
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:47,077
Adhemar was called back
to the free companies.

681
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:50,330
Edward commanded it.
He could be gone all season.

682
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:54,251
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

683
01:08:59,923 --> 01:09:01,299
Well done.

684
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:03,760
Yeah, well done.

685
01:09:14,437 --> 01:09:16,773
The tournament results, my lord.

686
01:09:29,786 --> 01:09:30,954
Ulrich.

687
01:09:31,788 --> 01:09:33,123
Ulrich.

688
01:09:33,957 --> 01:09:35,125
Ulrich.

689
01:09:54,144 --> 01:09:55,312
- Geoff.
- William.

690
01:09:56,146 --> 01:09:57,814
I need to write a letter.

691
01:09:58,398 --> 01:10:01,067
"Dear Jocelyn." No.
"My dearest Jocelyn."

692
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:02,736
Better.

693
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:07,574
"I miss you."

694
01:10:08,742 --> 01:10:10,202
Was that wrong?

695
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:15,081
Well, it's up to you, really.
It's your funeral, I mean, letter.

696
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:19,002
- Say something about her breasts.
- You miss them.

697
01:10:19,836 --> 01:10:20,879
Her breasts?

698
01:10:22,088 --> 01:10:27,093
Yes, you could, but I would tend
to look above her breasts.

699
01:10:28,512 --> 01:10:30,222
I miss her throat?

700
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,766
Still higher. Towards the heavens.

701
01:10:33,016 --> 01:10:35,852
The moon. Her breasts
weren't that impressive.

702
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:38,355
The moon? The moon.

703
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:43,568
"It is strange to think...

704
01:10:45,195 --> 01:10:47,364
...I have not seen you in a month.

705
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:53,370
I have seen the new moon, but not you.

706
01:10:55,539 --> 01:11:00,252
I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but
nothing of your beautiful face."

707
01:11:04,548 --> 01:11:06,550
That's very good.

708
01:11:07,425 --> 01:11:09,886
I knew this girl once who...

709
01:11:11,221 --> 01:11:13,557
She broke my heart.
I said the pieces...

710
01:11:13,807 --> 01:11:18,478
"The pieces of my broken heart can
pass through the eye of a needle."

711
01:11:21,565 --> 01:11:23,650
He writes as though I had died.

712
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,903
Yes, madame. He dies as well.

713
01:11:28,572 --> 01:11:31,241
She used to cook for the Duke of York.

714
01:11:34,244 --> 01:11:37,622
I miss her like the sun
misses the flower.

715
01:11:38,081 --> 01:11:41,084
"I miss you like the sun
misses the flower.

716
01:11:41,793 --> 01:11:45,422
Like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter.

717
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:50,302
Instead of beauty to direct
its light to...

718
01:11:50,927 --> 01:11:55,473
...the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to."

719
01:11:55,765 --> 01:11:57,767
"I next compete in Paris.

720
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:01,938
I'll find it empty and cold
if you're not there."

721
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:04,608
I like it.

722
01:12:05,442 --> 01:12:07,611
And now, to finish it.

723
01:12:08,987 --> 01:12:10,614
With "hope."

724
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:13,617
Love should end with hope.

725
01:12:14,951 --> 01:12:17,787
My husband, God rest him...

726
01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:20,457
...said something I'll never forget.

727
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:23,793
"Hope guides me. It..."

728
01:12:24,044 --> 01:12:27,547
"It gets me through the day and
especially the night.

729
01:12:28,632 --> 01:12:31,134
The hope that after you
leave my sight...

730
01:12:31,384 --> 01:12:34,179
...it will not be the last time
I look upon you."

731
01:12:37,974 --> 01:12:39,684
Finish it with:

732
01:12:40,352 --> 01:12:44,564
"With all the love
that I possess... William."

733
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:47,108
You mean "Ulrich."

734
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:51,863
"With all the love I possess...

735
01:12:53,532 --> 01:12:55,367
...I remain yours...

736
01:12:56,243 --> 01:12:58,245
...the knight of your heart."

737
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:11,383
My master hoped you might have
something to send him in return.

738
01:13:26,189 --> 01:13:30,986
Cock-a-doodle once! I shall not deny
him. Twice! I shall not. Thrice!

739
01:13:31,778 --> 01:13:33,363
I deny him.

740
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,156
Thrice he denied him!

741
01:13:41,246 --> 01:13:42,789
No Adhemar.

742
01:13:44,457 --> 01:13:45,667
No Adhemar.

743
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:52,507
Wat.

744
01:13:55,635 --> 01:13:58,680
Tell me, did you see her?
Did she read the letter?

745
01:13:59,097 --> 01:14:01,099
Yes, and yes.

746
01:14:02,017 --> 01:14:02,976
And?

747
01:14:09,065 --> 01:14:10,525
She's coming to Paris!

748
01:14:14,154 --> 01:14:18,783
Did she give you anything for me in
return? A letter? A token?

749
01:14:19,409 --> 01:14:21,661
Did she give me a token? She did.

750
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:25,373
Uh, I mean, um...

751
01:14:25,957 --> 01:14:28,668
Well, what is it? Give it to me.

752
01:14:37,469 --> 01:14:38,803
Yes!

753
01:14:41,181 --> 01:14:42,807
Hell, yes!

754
01:14:44,142 --> 01:14:47,979
She... Because she's...
That means she... Yeah!

755
01:14:51,816 --> 01:14:53,193
Cinquante.

756
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:55,946
That's a nice round number.

757
01:14:56,696 --> 01:14:57,906
Excusez-moi.

758
01:15:01,618 --> 01:15:05,872
They wager that a Frenchman, not
Sir Ulrich, will win the tournament.

759
01:15:07,624 --> 01:15:09,334
But the amount is 50 florins.

760
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:12,504
- That's all we got.
- If we had 60, it would be that.

761
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:15,215
Ulrich against every Frenchman here?

762
01:15:15,465 --> 01:15:19,177
He's won four tournaments in a row.
And Adhemar isn't here.

763
01:15:19,386 --> 01:15:22,389
I check shields too.
John Beaumont's here.

764
01:15:22,639 --> 01:15:26,268
Count Theobald, Philip of Burgundy...
all French champions.

765
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:28,019
Englishmen will not win...

766
01:15:28,228 --> 01:15:30,021
...this French tournament.

767
01:15:30,397 --> 01:15:34,025
English legs are unsteady
on French soil.

768
01:15:36,528 --> 01:15:38,697
Shut your mouth, all right?!

769
01:15:40,365 --> 01:15:44,744
Come on, Roland. It's a good bet.
Win and I can buy my own tavern.

770
01:15:45,078 --> 01:15:47,914
- I could write full-time.
- A forge for me.

771
01:15:48,206 --> 01:15:52,711
And because French wine
is too much for English bellies.

772
01:15:53,086 --> 01:15:58,008
Listen, I'm about this fonging close,
mate. I swear to God, Quasimodo!

773
01:15:58,592 --> 01:16:02,888
All I want is to go home, and I've
enough for that trip a hundred times.

774
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:07,767
And most importantly, because
the pope himself is French!

775
01:16:10,395 --> 01:16:13,690
The pope may be French,
but Jesus is English. You're on.

776
01:16:14,733 --> 01:16:17,277
He won't lose with the princess
watching him.

777
01:16:17,527 --> 01:16:19,529
He's blond! He's pissed!

778
01:16:19,738 --> 01:16:24,451
He'll see you in the lists!
Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein!

779
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:28,246
He's blond! He's tan!
He comes from Gelderland!

780
01:16:28,622 --> 01:16:30,624
He comes from Gelderland!

781
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:33,793
Gelderland!

782
01:16:49,267 --> 01:16:53,271
- You think he will come?
- As sure as the sun will rise.

783
01:17:18,964 --> 01:17:20,799
You favor cathedrals.

784
01:17:23,468 --> 01:17:25,345
I come for confession.

785
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,642
And the glass.

786
01:17:31,476 --> 01:17:34,813
A riot of color in a dreary,
gray world.

787
01:17:35,981 --> 01:17:37,482
Don't you think?

788
01:17:38,525 --> 01:17:40,151
It's beautiful.

789
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:47,158
I feel the same about
the letter you sent.

790
01:17:50,036 --> 01:17:51,663
Speak to me.

791
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:54,165
Speak those words.

792
01:17:56,376 --> 01:17:58,670
I will win this tournament for you.

793
01:17:59,462 --> 01:18:00,505
Excuse me?

794
01:18:00,714 --> 01:18:05,719
I'll win this tournament in your name.
I'll defeat each knight for you.

795
01:18:06,052 --> 01:18:11,016
Your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horse's flanks.

796
01:18:12,058 --> 01:18:13,393
Wow.

797
01:18:14,519 --> 01:18:15,854
Really?

798
01:18:16,354 --> 01:18:18,690
Really? Its flanks?

799
01:18:22,027 --> 01:18:24,571
I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich.

800
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:28,033
Well, I'm not ready.

801
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:33,997
I am. Why must everything for
a woman be run on a man's schedule?

802
01:18:34,206 --> 01:18:37,709
Well, a man's day is fuller, and...

803
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:41,087
...he has more demands on his time.

804
01:18:41,421 --> 01:18:43,423
- Is that so?
- Yes.

805
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,258
Maybe.

806
01:18:46,593 --> 01:18:47,719
No?

807
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:50,430
I demand poetry...

808
01:18:51,223 --> 01:18:53,892
...and when I want it.
And I want it now.

809
01:18:57,062 --> 01:18:58,563
Your breasts...

810
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,400
...they're below your throat...

811
01:19:03,568 --> 01:19:07,739
Jocelyn, how may I prove
my love to you? How?

812
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:13,745
- Do you ask in earnest?
- Yes.

813
01:19:17,582 --> 01:19:19,960
If you would prove your love...

814
01:19:20,627 --> 01:19:23,421
...do your worst.
- My worst?

815
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:26,424
What do you mean?

816
01:19:26,925 --> 01:19:31,763
Instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation...

817
01:19:32,138 --> 01:19:34,933
...act against your character
and do badly.

818
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:36,643
- Do badly?
- Lose.

819
01:19:36,893 --> 01:19:38,895
Losing proves that I'm a loser.

820
01:19:39,104 --> 01:19:42,649
Wrong. Losing is a much keener
test of your love.

821
01:19:42,941 --> 01:19:45,443
Losing would contradict
your self-love.

822
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:49,281
It would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself!

823
01:19:49,573 --> 01:19:51,992
- Really?
- Woman, shh!

824
01:19:52,284 --> 01:19:56,788
Do not "shh" me and spare him!
Now be gone! Go!

825
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:01,209
What is your answer?

826
01:20:04,963 --> 01:20:07,132
I will not lose.

827
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:13,638
Then you do not love me.

828
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,404
The Protector of Italian Virginity.

829
01:20:30,697 --> 01:20:33,491
The Lance that thrilled France...

830
01:20:33,825 --> 01:20:36,203
...the Harasser of Paraser!

831
01:20:36,494 --> 01:20:39,164
He gave them hell at La Rochelle!

832
01:20:39,873 --> 01:20:42,667
The Enforcer of our Lord God!

833
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:46,505
The one, the only...

834
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,674
...Sir Ulrich...

835
01:20:50,008 --> 01:20:52,552
...von Lichtenstein!

836
01:20:59,309 --> 01:21:00,769
God, I'm good!

837
01:21:06,024 --> 01:21:08,318
His horse's flanks.

838
01:21:08,902 --> 01:21:11,905
Maybe where he comes from,
it means love.

839
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:24,960
What are you doing?

840
01:21:25,335 --> 01:21:27,504
- Losing.
- I don't understand.

841
01:21:28,296 --> 01:21:29,339
Neither do I.

842
01:21:49,734 --> 01:21:51,278
He loves me.

843
01:21:54,364 --> 01:21:55,615
Are you blind?

844
01:21:56,533 --> 01:21:59,327
- Did you see the flag?
- I saw it, okay?

845
01:22:00,245 --> 01:22:01,872
I know.

846
01:22:02,247 --> 01:22:05,417
You're dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory.

847
01:22:07,711 --> 01:22:10,922
Look, Jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love.

848
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:16,344
- I'd rather you were blind.
- Don't be foolish, Will.

849
01:22:16,553 --> 01:22:20,724
- Each woman wants proof, that's all.
- Proof of what?

850
01:22:21,474 --> 01:22:23,685
Her legs weren't uncrossed
for nothing.

851
01:22:23,894 --> 01:22:28,398
- I haven't uncrossed her legs.
- Then why are we doing this?!

852
01:22:28,732 --> 01:22:29,983
Because!

853
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,496
Because...

854
01:22:45,081 --> 01:22:46,416
...I love her.

855
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:32,254
- I'm going to lose everything!
- That's why it's called gambling.

856
01:23:33,463 --> 01:23:35,131
Pain! Here's your pain!

857
01:23:35,465 --> 01:23:37,634
It's very romantic, though.

858
01:23:38,176 --> 01:23:40,428
Are you a woman or a blacksmith?

859
01:23:40,804 --> 01:23:42,430
Sometimes I'm both.

860
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,474
Ooh, that chafes!

861
01:23:44,808 --> 01:23:46,142
Put him down.

862
01:23:49,688 --> 01:23:52,649
No knight has distanced himself
with victories.

863
01:23:53,024 --> 01:23:57,654
If you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses...

864
01:23:57,946 --> 01:24:00,448
...you could make the semis,
or the finals.

865
01:24:00,657 --> 01:24:04,452
- At least the armor's proven itself.
- And your love?

866
01:24:04,828 --> 01:24:07,038
Have you proven that yet?

867
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:14,171
Wat, you remember church as a boy.
The fear, the passion.

868
01:24:15,172 --> 01:24:17,340
That's what she makes me feel.

869
01:24:18,175 --> 01:24:22,512
And for that, I say my rosary
to Jocelyn and no one else.

870
01:24:23,346 --> 01:24:25,849
William, that's blasphemous.

871
01:24:32,397 --> 01:24:34,191
Then may I burn in hell.

872
01:24:34,524 --> 01:24:35,734
Withdraw.

873
01:24:36,109 --> 01:24:38,361
Lose that way.
Take no more punishment.

874
01:24:38,904 --> 01:24:40,530
Oh, Roland.

875
01:24:46,411 --> 01:24:49,706
My lady sends this message.
If you love her...

876
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:53,418
I know, I know. I must lose.
Isn't she watching?

877
01:24:53,752 --> 01:24:56,713
She says if you love her,
you won't lose again.

878
01:24:57,214 --> 01:25:00,717
She says if you love her,
you will win this tournament.

879
01:25:10,268 --> 01:25:13,730
There she is, the embodiment of love.
Your Venus.

880
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,398
And how I hate her.

881
01:25:31,414 --> 01:25:36,044
- I don't understand women.
- Nor do I, but they understand us.

882
01:25:37,587 --> 01:25:39,256
Maybe not you.

883
01:25:51,351 --> 01:25:52,769
Yes!

884
01:25:53,478 --> 01:25:54,980
Women, eh?

885
01:26:18,503 --> 01:26:20,172
Forty-eight...

886
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:21,882
...forty-nine...

887
01:26:22,174 --> 01:26:23,842
...and fifty.

888
01:26:24,134 --> 01:26:27,679
Thank you, gentlemen.
A pleasure doing business with you.

889
01:26:28,013 --> 01:26:31,808
Look us up if you're in London,
the World Championships, maybe.

890
01:26:32,017 --> 01:26:36,188
Don't look too sad.
Here, have a drink on me.

891
01:26:36,521 --> 01:26:41,484
He's quick, he's funny and
makes lots of money, Lichtenstein!

892
01:26:59,753 --> 01:27:01,922
Guinevere comes to Lancelot.

893
01:27:07,928 --> 01:27:09,930
Bed him well, my lady.

894
01:27:10,388 --> 01:27:11,932
Bed him well.

895
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:20,440
We missed you at banquet.

896
01:27:22,025 --> 01:27:22,901
"We"?

897
01:27:27,614 --> 01:27:28,907
I.

898
01:27:30,408 --> 01:27:31,785
Jocelyn.

899
01:27:32,577 --> 01:27:34,246
Your prize.

900
01:27:36,248 --> 01:27:37,874
My prize.

901
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:41,753
I am not worthy of a prize.

902
01:27:43,755 --> 01:27:45,465
Then who is?

903
01:27:47,092 --> 01:27:50,470
My maid tells me that
sometimes your varlets...

904
01:27:51,638 --> 01:27:52,931
...call you William.

905
01:27:56,434 --> 01:27:58,061
Is this so, Sir Ulrich?

906
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:02,607
Yes.

907
01:28:04,442 --> 01:28:05,443
It is so.

908
01:28:19,457 --> 01:28:22,294
Your name makes no matter to me.

909
01:28:24,296 --> 01:28:26,798
Just so I can call you my own.

910
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:30,760
But Jocelyn, I am your own.

911
01:28:38,143 --> 01:28:39,853
Damn, girl.

912
01:28:40,687 --> 01:28:42,022
You need a surgeon.

913
01:28:42,314 --> 01:28:46,443
He's been. He says I will live,
though it doesn't feel that way.

914
01:28:48,028 --> 01:28:51,031
Oh, William. This pain is my doing.

915
01:28:51,364 --> 01:28:53,033
Yes, it is.

916
01:28:56,828 --> 01:28:58,163
Although...

917
01:28:58,997 --> 01:29:00,373
...my father...

918
01:29:02,834 --> 01:29:05,003
...taught me to take the bad...

919
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:07,506
...with the good.

920
01:29:14,846 --> 01:29:16,848
This good you speak of.

921
01:29:19,684 --> 01:29:22,020
It will be my doing as well.

922
01:29:39,037 --> 01:29:43,416
How long since any of you have been
back? I've only been gone 6 months.

923
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:45,544
Two years for me.

924
01:29:46,419 --> 01:29:47,712
Three years.

925
01:29:48,839 --> 01:29:52,384
Five. Five long years.

926
01:29:55,053 --> 01:29:56,388
William?

927
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:59,558
Twelve.

928
01:30:01,393 --> 01:30:02,936
Twelve years.

929
01:30:05,522 --> 01:30:07,107
He's to be an apprentice?

930
01:30:11,903 --> 01:30:13,029
How long for?

931
01:30:14,614 --> 01:30:15,907
Seven years.

932
01:30:49,941 --> 01:30:51,610
Sir Ector?

933
01:30:52,986 --> 01:30:56,448
I'm the thatcher. I spoke to you
outside London Stadium.

934
01:30:56,781 --> 01:30:58,617
Oh, yes. I remember.

935
01:30:59,117 --> 01:31:00,660
Is this the boy?

936
01:31:03,955 --> 01:31:06,500
Step forward, son. Let me look at you.

937
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:08,960
Careful with that, Roland!

938
01:31:14,466 --> 01:31:16,635
Are you afraid of me, boy?

939
01:31:26,978 --> 01:31:29,272
Have you got most of your teeth?

940
01:31:34,986 --> 01:31:37,155
Show me your arm. Is it strong?

941
01:31:47,374 --> 01:31:50,544
Well, he's a half-starved little
scarecrow.

942
01:31:51,837 --> 01:31:53,672
But he has spirit.

943
01:31:57,509 --> 01:32:02,055
I can show you a great wide world
full of adventure...

944
01:32:02,889 --> 01:32:05,851
...and marvels you
do not yet dream of.

945
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,398
Can you pack my horse and lead it?

946
01:32:18,196 --> 01:32:21,366
Well, come on.
Say goodbye to your father.

947
01:32:23,034 --> 01:32:27,539
He's a real knight, William.
Watch and learn all you can.

948
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:35,589
It's all I can do for you, son.

949
01:32:36,047 --> 01:32:40,051
Now go change your stars
and live a better life than I have.

950
01:32:50,937 --> 01:32:53,940
Roland, show the boy his duties.

951
01:32:57,611 --> 01:33:01,281
- Father? I'm afraid.
- Of what?

952
01:33:01,698 --> 01:33:03,700
I won't know the way home.

953
01:33:04,201 --> 01:33:08,038
Don't be foolish, William.
You just follow your feet.

954
01:33:27,265 --> 01:33:28,391
London.

955
01:34:15,772 --> 01:34:18,108
Give us a shout out, London!

956
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:43,800
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

957
01:35:21,171 --> 01:35:26,301
- Adhemar's here. He's entered.
- Must have grown bored with war.

958
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:30,514
No, the Black Prince commanded it.
He had to disband his army.

959
01:35:30,764 --> 01:35:33,808
They were reveling,
pillaging town after town.

960
01:35:34,017 --> 01:35:36,895
Robbing, murdering,
ransacking churches.

961
01:35:37,187 --> 01:35:41,358
Committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways.

962
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,404
At last we will face each other again,
Sir Ulrich.

963
01:35:46,696 --> 01:35:48,490
And at the World Championship.

964
01:35:48,698 --> 01:35:50,700
And as I promised you before...

965
01:35:51,034 --> 01:35:53,745
...you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.

966
01:35:59,584 --> 01:36:01,211
Let the past die.

967
01:36:02,212 --> 01:36:05,966
You've done well in my absence,
on the field and off, I'm told.

968
01:36:06,716 --> 01:36:10,262
Winning trophies, horses, women.

969
01:36:11,471 --> 01:36:13,181
You put them in that order?

970
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:16,601
Generally, with a few exceptions.

971
01:36:23,608 --> 01:36:25,235
Beautiful, isn't she?

972
01:36:25,902 --> 01:36:29,114
A real thoroughbred trophy,
don't you think?

973
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:34,161
- You speak of her like a target.
- Isn't she?

974
01:36:34,953 --> 01:36:36,121
No.

975
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:41,668
She is the arrow.

976
01:36:45,797 --> 01:36:48,592
I've begun negotiations
with her father.

977
01:36:52,262 --> 01:36:54,097
I'm to make her my bride.

978
01:36:55,265 --> 01:36:57,767
She'll be saddled...

979
01:36:58,351 --> 01:37:00,604
...and placed on my mantle.

980
01:37:01,605 --> 01:37:03,690
Target or arrow, it doesn't matter.

981
01:37:04,608 --> 01:37:06,318
I will have her.

982
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:14,034
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

983
01:37:51,196 --> 01:37:55,075
- How would you beat him?
- With a stick, while he slept.

984
01:37:55,659 --> 01:37:58,370
But on a horse? With a lance?

985
01:37:59,162 --> 01:38:01,540
That man is unbeatable.

986
01:38:29,901 --> 01:38:31,069
Hello there.

987
01:38:34,197 --> 01:38:38,493
- You're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.
- Yes.

988
01:38:38,952 --> 01:38:43,331
You're my favorite knight.
When we joust, I always say I'm you.

989
01:38:44,499 --> 01:38:48,128
What are you doing in Cheapside?
There's no parade today.

990
01:38:52,716 --> 01:38:54,342
Can you keep a secret?

991
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:14,070
I was born in Cheapside,
just around the corner there.

992
01:39:14,404 --> 01:39:17,324
- Truly, Sir Ulrich?
- Truly.

993
01:39:17,616 --> 01:39:19,951
I only live just there.

994
01:39:21,661 --> 01:39:23,038
How old are you?

995
01:39:23,288 --> 01:39:26,458
- Nine and one half.
- Nine and one half.

996
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:31,213
I wonder if you remember a man,
though he may have died long ago.

997
01:39:31,421 --> 01:39:35,091
He was as tall as a knight.
His name was John Thatcher.

998
01:39:35,425 --> 01:39:38,053
- Of course I remember him.
- You do?

999
01:39:38,261 --> 01:39:40,430
Yes. He lives there still.

1000
01:39:45,101 --> 01:39:49,105
Sometimes we see him sitting
at the window, but no one knows why.

1001
01:39:52,943 --> 01:39:54,027
What do you mean?

1002
01:39:54,611 --> 01:39:55,987
He's blind, sir.

1003
01:40:42,284 --> 01:40:43,869
Is someone there?

1004
01:40:48,665 --> 01:40:53,003
If you're here for the net,
I'm not done yet. Come tomorrow.

1005
01:40:57,299 --> 01:40:58,300
Who are you?

1006
01:41:01,344 --> 01:41:02,470
A knight.

1007
01:41:05,432 --> 01:41:08,560
My name... is Ulrich.

1008
01:41:09,811 --> 01:41:13,982
Ulrich? I hear that name
being chanted from the stadium.

1009
01:41:14,441 --> 01:41:16,318
What business have you here?

1010
01:41:16,818 --> 01:41:19,487
I have word, Master Thatcher.

1011
01:41:22,032 --> 01:41:23,074
Word of your son.

1012
01:41:24,326 --> 01:41:27,370
Of my William? Well, come in, sir.

1013
01:41:33,376 --> 01:41:36,713
What word? Does he live?

1014
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:40,800
Aye. He lives.

1015
01:41:42,844 --> 01:41:44,513
He is very well.

1016
01:41:46,181 --> 01:41:48,058
He wanted you to know...

1017
01:41:49,893 --> 01:41:52,270
...that he changed his stars
after all.

1018
01:42:02,197 --> 01:42:04,574
And has he followed his feet?

1019
01:42:08,203 --> 01:42:10,831
Has he found his way home at last?

1020
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:13,291
Yes.

1021
01:42:21,424 --> 01:42:22,551
Father.

1022
01:42:22,884 --> 01:42:25,720
Oh, William. Oh, my boy.

1023
01:42:36,648 --> 01:42:40,026
I should like to meet this Wat.
And Roland too.

1024
01:42:40,235 --> 01:42:42,237
You will, Father.

1025
01:42:45,282 --> 01:42:49,077
And what of women?
Is there a certain one or many?

1026
01:42:50,912 --> 01:42:52,622
There is a certain one.

1027
01:42:54,457 --> 01:42:56,418
I should like to meet her too.

1028
01:43:02,924 --> 01:43:05,260
This leak won't do, Father.

1029
01:43:05,844 --> 01:43:10,599
- Not in a thatcher's chamber.
- It's quite fitting for a blind one.

1030
01:43:12,934 --> 01:43:14,811
Well, a thatcher I am.

1031
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:17,772
I'll fix it.

1032
01:44:02,275 --> 01:44:05,362
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...

1033
01:44:05,612 --> 01:44:08,865
...because he was also so strong.
Very strong.

1034
01:44:09,533 --> 01:44:11,493
- Geoff.
- Jocelyn.

1035
01:44:11,827 --> 01:44:14,287
This day just gets better and better.

1036
01:44:17,249 --> 01:44:18,416
Somebody die?

1037
01:44:21,670 --> 01:44:23,672
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

1038
01:44:27,384 --> 01:44:28,677
Adhemar...

1039
01:44:29,678 --> 01:44:33,181
...followed you last night.
To Cheapside.

1040
01:44:33,932 --> 01:44:35,267
He saw your father.

1041
01:44:36,518 --> 01:44:39,271
Will, they asked me for your patents.

1042
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:47,153
They're waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you.

1043
01:44:48,029 --> 01:44:49,698
A dozen royal guards.

1044
01:44:50,866 --> 01:44:55,871
- They'll put you in the stocks.
- But I face Adhemar in five minutes.

1045
01:44:57,372 --> 01:45:01,209
No, you forfeit.
They've already marked it down.

1046
01:45:02,377 --> 01:45:05,714
Saddle the horses.
They can arrest your baggage, not you.

1047
01:45:11,887 --> 01:45:13,430
Halt.

1048
01:45:18,727 --> 01:45:20,437
So, what do you think...

1049
01:45:22,939 --> 01:45:24,858
...now that you know what I am?

1050
01:45:26,234 --> 01:45:30,405
To know what you are, William,
would take a lifetime.

1051
01:45:31,072 --> 01:45:33,909
One I am willing to give.
But now you must run.

1052
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:38,079
Run, and I will run with you.

1053
01:45:38,413 --> 01:45:40,415
Jocelyn, I cannot run.

1054
01:45:40,749 --> 01:45:44,252
I am a knight, and I will
put myself to the hazard!

1055
01:45:44,628 --> 01:45:48,423
In your heart, not on paper.
And paper's what matters to them!

1056
01:45:51,593 --> 01:45:53,720
William, I love you.

1057
01:45:55,764 --> 01:45:58,141
I love you. You.

1058
01:46:00,602 --> 01:46:05,190
- I won't see you led to the stocks.
- But you'll see me run? No!

1059
01:46:06,441 --> 01:46:08,443
Damn your pride, William.

1060
01:46:08,944 --> 01:46:11,780
It is only you that
will not see you run.

1061
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:14,282
Pride's the one thing they can't take!

1062
01:46:14,533 --> 01:46:18,078
But they can take it from you.
They can and they will.

1063
01:46:18,829 --> 01:46:20,330
Oh, they will.

1064
01:46:21,122 --> 01:46:23,458
But love they cannot take.

1065
01:46:28,797 --> 01:46:31,132
And where will we live?

1066
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:33,802
In my hovel?

1067
01:46:35,512 --> 01:46:40,851
- With the pigs inside in winter?
- Yes, William, with the pigs.

1068
01:46:41,059 --> 01:46:42,394
With the pigs.

1069
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,148
The poor can marry for love.

1070
01:46:48,984 --> 01:46:51,820
Jocelyn, you speak of what
you do not know!

1071
01:46:55,699 --> 01:46:57,701
William, I beg you.

1072
01:46:58,493 --> 01:46:59,828
Please.

1073
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:04,082
Run. Do it for love.

1074
01:47:12,132 --> 01:47:13,842
Roland, you would see me run?

1075
01:47:20,849 --> 01:47:22,017
And you, Geoff?

1076
01:47:22,851 --> 01:47:25,729
I wish it too, with all
the pieces of my heart.

1077
01:47:32,027 --> 01:47:35,197
Wat? You and I? We aren't runners.

1078
01:47:39,868 --> 01:47:41,036
Yes.

1079
01:47:43,038 --> 01:47:44,789
William, today we are.

1080
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:49,586
Run, William.

1081
01:47:56,384 --> 01:47:58,428
I will not run!

1082
01:48:05,727 --> 01:48:07,270
I am a knight.

1083
01:48:20,242 --> 01:48:21,576
Well, boys...

1084
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:24,579
...all good things must come to an end.

1085
01:48:25,497 --> 01:48:27,415
Let's end them together.

1086
01:49:04,703 --> 01:49:08,331
You will remove yourself
from this position of honor.

1087
01:49:10,417 --> 01:49:11,751
I am here to compete.

1088
01:49:12,169 --> 01:49:14,546
You are here to be arrested.

1089
01:49:22,012 --> 01:49:23,346
All right!

1090
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:54,377
He that strives to touch a star...

1091
01:49:55,253 --> 01:49:56,922
...oft stumbles...

1092
01:49:57,255 --> 01:49:58,924
...at a simple straw.

1093
01:50:09,893 --> 01:50:11,603
You have been weighed.

1094
01:50:19,236 --> 01:50:20,946
You have been measured.

1095
01:50:23,949 --> 01:50:25,659
And you have been found wanting.

1096
01:50:31,289 --> 01:50:34,251
It's one loss or another... William.

1097
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:44,094
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1098
01:51:22,382 --> 01:51:23,842
Leave, Roland.

1099
01:51:24,926 --> 01:51:26,261
Let them have me.

1100
01:51:27,262 --> 01:51:29,097
God love you, William.

1101
01:51:29,472 --> 01:51:30,891
So do I.

1102
01:51:31,474 --> 01:51:33,643
Go! Disperse!

1103
01:51:35,937 --> 01:51:37,564
Or I will fong you!

1104
01:51:38,148 --> 01:51:41,109
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene
and his holy mother...

1105
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:44,905
...the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,
I will fong you!

1106
01:51:45,822 --> 01:51:48,533
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

1107
01:51:48,909 --> 01:51:53,079
I'll stick my fist and break you!
Pain! Lots of pain!

1108
01:51:59,336 --> 01:52:00,754
We're in trouble.

1109
01:52:04,508 --> 01:52:06,176
Listen to me.

1110
01:52:10,847 --> 01:52:12,849
Listen to me!

1111
01:52:45,549 --> 01:52:47,926
What a pair we make, huh?

1112
01:52:51,429 --> 01:52:53,557
Both trying to hide who we are.

1113
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:56,226
Both unable to do so.

1114
01:53:05,235 --> 01:53:07,070
Your men love you.

1115
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:12,409
If I knew nothing else about you,
that would be enough.

1116
01:53:13,952 --> 01:53:17,747
But you also tilt
when you should withdraw.

1117
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:22,169
That is knightly too.

1118
01:53:30,427 --> 01:53:31,636
Release him.

1119
01:53:41,605 --> 01:53:44,608
He may appear to be
of humble origins...

1120
01:53:45,859 --> 01:53:48,945
...but my personal historians
have discovered...

1121
01:53:49,279 --> 01:53:52,908
...that he descends
from an ancient royal line.

1122
01:53:56,286 --> 01:53:57,996
This is my word.

1123
01:53:59,456 --> 01:54:02,959
And as such, is beyond contestation.

1124
01:54:08,298 --> 01:54:09,257
Now...

1125
01:54:10,634 --> 01:54:13,970
...if I may repay the kindness
you once showed me.

1126
01:54:15,305 --> 01:54:16,306
Take a knee.

1127
01:54:33,365 --> 01:54:37,369
By the power vested in me
by my father, King Edward...

1128
01:54:38,537 --> 01:54:40,997
...and by all the witnesses here...

1129
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:45,502
...I dub thee...

1130
01:54:48,213 --> 01:54:49,506
...Sir William.

1131
01:55:01,768 --> 01:55:04,354
Arise... Sir William.

1132
01:55:11,736 --> 01:55:13,029
Can you joust?

1133
01:55:14,698 --> 01:55:16,700
There's my tournament to finish.

1134
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:21,705
Now, are you fit to compete,
or shall the forfeit stand?

1135
01:55:22,539 --> 01:55:23,498
I'm fit.

1136
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:29,796
I shall have your opponent informed.
Look for his shield on the lists.

1137
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:31,715
At once.

1138
01:55:32,382 --> 01:55:33,800
Thank you, my lord.

1139
01:55:44,269 --> 01:55:46,730
All hail Prince Edward!

1140
01:55:51,735 --> 01:55:54,070
My lords, my ladies...

1141
01:55:54,946 --> 01:55:57,407
...and all you other people.

1142
01:55:58,241 --> 01:56:02,954
I give you the son of Philippe
de Vitry, son of Gilles...

1143
01:56:05,582 --> 01:56:07,584
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1144
01:56:08,293 --> 01:56:11,296
It's nothing but spun sugar
and boot black.

1145
01:56:20,263 --> 01:56:21,848
It's a small target...

1146
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,268
...but aim for his heart.

1147
01:56:31,441 --> 01:56:33,693
- Doer of daring deeds...

1148
01:56:34,945 --> 01:56:38,323
...conqueror of countless kingdoms,
Count...

1149
01:56:42,118 --> 01:56:43,787
...Adhemar!

1150
01:58:28,934 --> 01:58:30,936
Oh, God. I'll get the surgeon.

1151
01:58:31,228 --> 01:58:32,270
Roland!

1152
01:58:32,812 --> 01:58:34,022
You're the surgeon.

1153
01:58:36,441 --> 01:58:37,567
Come on.

1154
01:58:45,325 --> 01:58:46,409
He tipped it.

1155
01:58:49,246 --> 01:58:51,414
Kate, get me back to one.

1156
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:53,750
Otherwise we forfeit.

1157
01:59:00,924 --> 01:59:03,093
Dirty son of a bitch!

1158
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:16,666
Kate, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1159
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:25,509
As I said, thatcher.

1160
02:00:27,719 --> 02:00:30,680
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1161
02:00:31,348 --> 02:00:33,308
Such a place does not exist.

1162
02:00:35,727 --> 02:00:37,437
She's here William.

1163
02:00:39,606 --> 02:00:40,690
With your father.

1164
02:00:45,195 --> 02:00:46,780
Change your stars.

1165
02:00:51,827 --> 02:00:53,620
Let's dance, you and I.

1166
02:00:57,374 --> 02:00:59,084
It's two lances to none.

1167
02:00:59,376 --> 02:01:03,046
You must unhorse him or kill him.
It's the only way to win.

1168
02:01:13,056 --> 02:01:15,934
- You need more padding.
- No, leave it off.

1169
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:18,228
I can't breathe with it on.

1170
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:25,026
Lance.

1171
02:01:30,448 --> 02:01:31,992
I can barely grip it.

1172
02:01:32,242 --> 02:01:33,577
Damn.

1173
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:41,585
Lash it to my arm.

1174
02:01:45,755 --> 02:01:46,965
Wat...

1175
02:01:47,674 --> 02:01:49,217
...lash it to me arm.

1176
02:01:52,387 --> 02:01:53,430
Do it.

1177
02:02:11,698 --> 02:02:13,241
Good people!

1178
02:02:14,284 --> 02:02:15,619
I missed my introduction!

1179
02:02:26,796 --> 02:02:28,465
But please...

1180
02:02:28,798 --> 02:02:30,467
...please, I pray you.

1181
02:02:30,967 --> 02:02:32,469
Hear it now.

1182
02:02:33,845 --> 02:02:35,805
For I would lay rest...

1183
02:02:36,139 --> 02:02:38,475
...the grace in my tongue...

1184
02:02:38,808 --> 02:02:40,477
...and speak plain.

1185
02:02:41,645 --> 02:02:43,480
Days like these...

1186
02:02:43,813 --> 02:02:47,484
...are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy-handed words.

1187
02:02:48,819 --> 02:02:52,697
And so, I'm afraid,
without any ado whatsoever...

1188
02:02:53,323 --> 02:02:54,699
Excuse me, my lord.

1189
02:02:55,158 --> 02:02:58,495
Here he is! One of your own!

1190
02:02:59,496 --> 02:03:02,415
Born a stone's throw from
this very stadium...

1191
02:03:02,749 --> 02:03:04,584
...and here before you now.

1192
02:03:04,918 --> 02:03:06,920
The son of John Thatcher...

1193
02:03:07,921 --> 02:03:10,924
...Sir William Thatcher!

1194
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:23,103
That's your name.

1195
02:03:26,064 --> 02:03:28,066
Sir William Thatcher.

1196
02:03:28,859 --> 02:03:30,277
Your father heard that.

1197
02:03:48,378 --> 02:03:50,088
Godspeed, William.

1198
02:05:02,077 --> 02:05:04,788
William!

1199
02:05:25,809 --> 02:05:27,811
You have been weighed.

1200
02:05:29,271 --> 02:05:30,480
You've been measured.

1201
02:05:33,650 --> 02:05:35,819
And you absolutely...

1202
02:05:36,486 --> 02:05:38,155
...have been found wanting.

1203
02:05:42,325 --> 02:05:44,161
Welcome to the new world.

1204
02:05:44,703 --> 02:05:48,206
God save you, if it is right
that he should do so.

1205
02:05:54,796 --> 02:05:56,923
William!

1206
02:06:11,062 --> 02:06:12,731
Yes!

1207
02:06:14,149 --> 02:06:15,734
He's won! He's won!

1208
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:52,479
You beat him, Will!

1209
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:58,568
Oh, William.

1210
02:07:19,172 --> 02:07:21,174
I'm going to write this story.

1211
02:07:21,466 --> 02:07:23,468
About the prince and the knights?

1212
02:07:23,718 --> 02:07:28,682
No, all of it. All human activity
lies within the artist's scope.

1213
02:07:31,184 --> 02:07:33,019
Maybe not yours.

1214
